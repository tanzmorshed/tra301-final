"MR_Heraclius","6","49","59","23 February 2020"," totally forgettable movie
","With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy."
"alindsay-al","4","156","241","31 May 2017"," A below average retread of previous pirates films
","After not really caring for the last pirates of the Caribbean film I didn't have high expectations for this movie but I went and saw it and I was right to have these low expectations. The premise of the film sees the return of captain jack sparrow as he leads an expedition for the Trident of Poseidon while on the run from an old enemy. Johnny depp has become known for the role of jack sparrow and I think when in that character he usually delivers his best, that was until this film. He has some of the charisma and jack nuances in his performances that makes him entertaining, but this character is a shell of his former self. This is the least funny he has ever been, the least charming he has been and I ended up feeling like he phoned in this performance quite a bit. The supporting cast is pretty large but I will go over the main ones, Salazar played by Javier bardem is the main villain in this film and I thought he was a pretty decent villain. He is a little hard to understand at times but, he is pretty menacing in this film and I liked his back story that makes him also a little sympathetic but then he is menacing and it adds to his performance. Geoffrey rush is back as hector barbosa in this film and like always he is great, I wasn't the biggest fan of some of the things done with his character but rush always gives a fun charismatic performance that does make me smile. However, we get to the new characters played by Brendon thwaites and kaya scodelario who are both completely wooden and lacking. I didn't buy there chemistry at all and I didn't like the involvement of lore to try to make Them interesting because they really weren't. The story is very jumbled and a bit all over the place, similar to stranger tides there is just too many people going after this artifact that you don't even remember them all. The Salazar plot and trident plot feels like two different movies and the meshing just really didn't work. The script has a couple of laughs in it I can't deny that I laughed enough for passable. However, there was a lot of misses in this script with this possibly being the least funny of the films and definitely the film with the least drama and heart in it. The style of this film has some of the pirates action scenes that are very enjoyable especially towards the beginning of the film. But as the film progresses the action felt a bit hollow as I didn't really care about any of the characters. Overall this is the weakest pirates film in my opinion and unless you are a big fan of this franchise like me it isn't really worth a watch."
"kuroahhuhh","4","66","98","9 September 2017"," Very disappointed with the direction they went for this one
","The writing is very minimalistic, character's are all former shadows of themselves. The young character leads are forgettable and character development feels almost non-existent. The lead female is an advocate for woman's rights it seems..instead of just being a really cool protagonist who 'happens' to be female. The whole cast pretty much runs around doing nothing. Jack's crew (Gibbs in particular) have been reduced to mediocre comedy relief. Quite a few plot holes as well as being historically inaccurate in parts. I did enjoy a few scenes, not enough to warrant a rave review though. :P<br/><br/>I've enjoyed all of the Pirates films but I think it's about time they wrap things up."
"will-40-625067","1","327","530","28 May 2017"," Oh My God I Am So Effing Disappointed I Cannot Believe What I Have Just Seen
","(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can't think of any besides Keira Knightley's acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it's a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer's freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore's music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court. <br/><br/>But I'm not here to talk about how great the original trilogy was. Odds are, most of you liked them too. What I want to talk about briefly before I tear Dead Men Tell No Tales to shreds, is On Stranger Tides. From what I gather, the fourth installment was/is NOT very popular. I like it. And I'll tell you why. While it didn't have the same epic sense of scale and adventure and romance and everything that made the first three so great, IT STILL HAD GOOD WRITING. It was clever, and witty, and funny as ever. And this is because Ted & Terry were still writing them, not FRICKING Jeff Nathanson. OMFG I'll get to him later. I would urge you though to go back and give On Stranger Tides another chance, especially if you've now seen the fifth installment. I think you'll find that even though it doesn't quite hold up against the first three it still FEELS like a Pirates of the Caribbean, and for all the reasons that Dead Men Tell No Tales did not, and here they are:<br/><br/>1) Johnny Depp has completely lost it. It's like he forgot how to play Jack Sparrow. There were seriously times watching him when I thought he was more Mad Hatter than he was Jack Sparrow. And it's so sad to watch. The old Jack was an idiot sure, but he was always clever, he was always suave, always cool. In this he's just silly. It's embarrassing. I'm serious when I say he acts like the Mad Hatter, you'll see what I mean. In the fourth one he at least still felt like Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>2) Zimmer's so called ""protege"" Geoff Zanelli is so forgettable. I was actually trying to listen for his music but the only times the music stood out was when he was rehashing Zimmer's themes. And some of you may be like *sissy voice ""oh that's all Zimmer did was rehash Badelt's themes"". BISH PLEASE. Not only did he make Badelt's original theme sound even better, he introduced so many new ones (Jack's theme, Davy Jones' theme, Will & Elizabeth's theme). Even On Stranger Tides added a fun new Spanish twist to the old stuff.<br/><br/>3) Salazar, Henry, & Carina are also all completely forgettable. They're worse than Blackbeard (who I actually quite liked), Philip, and Syrena. There is hardly ANY character development for them and what little there was felt SO forced. I feel terrible for them (especially Thwaites and Bardem) because they're not bad actors (Bardem is actually a fantastic actor) but they just got saddled with one of the WORST freaking scripts of all time, which brings me to my final and primary complaint with the fifth installment.<br/><br/>4) JEFF NATHANSON IS CANCER. I mean my biggest (only) concerns from the start (because let's be honest the trailer's gave NO hint that the movie would be this bad) were the fact that Zimmer wasn't composing and that JEFF NATHANSON, the idiot who ruined Indiana Jones, was writing it, but I NEVER thought he could have F'd up this movie, not as badly as he did. Like, the movie had SO much going for it. Salazar could have been another great villain to put alongside Jones and Barbossa, but he was totally wasted with minimal and poor dialogue. Carina Smith, a female astronomer, could have been a GREAT female character! And her romance with Henry could have been done BEAUTIFULLY! Instead, what did we get? Well, I won't spoil it for you but I will say there is one of the most forced, predictable, and painstakingly banal twists I've ever seen in a movie regarding her character.<br/><br/>So, as I said, I absolutely LOVED the first three, and I really did like the fourth one. Enough that I was very excited about what they could do with the next one (the fifth one). All my friends said the franchise was dead but I maintained that the fifth installment had the potential to be amazing (which it did). And I waited SIX GODDAMNED YEARS for this fifth one. And it, was just, god, awful. So bad that I actually now don't want to see another installment, and I will honestly probably never watch it again because it's so bad that it almost taints my love for the first four.<br/><br/>I tried to think of reasons to give it more than the lowest possible rating, any reason. And ALL I could think of was the visual quality that the two Norwegian directors brought to it, so good for them, I give the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean a whopping two stars. <br/><br/>Thank you. This has been my angrily hastened unedited review of Dead Men Tell No Tales."
"engagutt_henrik","5","279","467","23 May 2017"," I miss the old Jack.
","The fifth installment of the Pirates-series is by all means a step up from the fourth. In all film-series, when a sequel is released it's mandatory to compare it to the best one - which in this case arguably everyone agrees is the first one. That may be unfair, but it's the reality. Now.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge does give us some spectacular moments. The visual effects really is astonishing, and some of the scenes is beyond anything I have ever seen before. That's impressing. But that's not why I like Pirates of the Caribbean. What I expect (hope) from a Pirates-film is elegant and witty dialog, compelling sea- battles and Jack Sparrow on fire. And this last bit I think is the biggest reason why this one fails to deliver. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Johnny Depp has lost his way as captain Jack. And I think that's natural, after all, it's been 13 years since he first portrait the character. He's gotten older and that really shows. This, combined with a really poor script, regarding Jack at least, makes it all fall apart. Half the time he's completely drunk (really drunk, not just usual Jack-tipsy) and half the time he tells bad jokes which really is beneath a genius character like Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>The film starts on a positive note. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to split up and it didn't really have a good rhythm to it. In addition I think there are a lot of characters that just don't do anything to the story or adds humor or dynamic. <br/><br/>The decision to bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner is fundamentally a good one, but I'm so disappointed with he's involvement in the film. It seems Disney only took him back to promote the film and lure old fans back for more. If he's to be involved, he should have a major role. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem does a good job as villain, but nothing I will remember him by. <br/><br/>All in all, I would say that I am disappointed. I didn't have huge expectations to begin with, but where I thought the film would deliver, it just didn't. Basically it's a film for the technical wizards to show how much they can do in terms of visual effects , and they can do a lot. It's just not what I want."
"jasonsharden","2","83","131","23 June 2017"," And There Will Be a 6th Film...
","I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to not be entertaining. At least the previous films had great swashbuckling fun and wit. They told bizarre stories that had strange characters, all of which had something to offer to the film. The adventures were full of surprises, making them worth at least checking out, and Jack Sparrow was a character that was actually worth waiting for. This film had no personality. No heart. No passion. It was nothing more than a ""bottom of the barrel"" film with cheap sex jokes and physical gags, most of which were served by Jack Sparrow. He was drained of the spirit that he had in the previous films, and wasn't even worth the time he was on screen. Nobody cared, nobody tried, and the full theater was nearly emptied halfway through the film. What once was a film series known for their cinematic experiences, is now nothing more than a dried up corpse, a result of Disney's relentless need to milk their products to death."
"Muhammad_Nd","10","192","332","1 June 2017"," Good Tales Be Told By Dead Men
","After the ordeal of On Stranger Tides comes a sequel that sets sails in a truly amazing and beautiful fashion.<br/><br/>First off the film is a great send up compared to the weakest link in the series, On Stranger Tides. The cast, effects, and story line are great. The film as a whole is amazing. <br/><br/>Once again we get Johnny Depp as the ever funny and intoxicated Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is hilariously outrageous. He is very good and funny within the film. Unlike his performance in Stranger Tides his acting a characterization of the titular captain seems to have great passion and not the feeling of a called in performance. <br/><br/>Again my personal favorite character returns to the 5th film is Geoffrey Rush as the amazingly interesting Captain Hector Barbossa. Within the Hector still rides high as the captain at the helm of the Queen Ann's Revenge. When we meet up with him in the film he has become very wealthy and rich from trade and knocking off ships. He then joins a false alliance with the films hardcore villain, Captain Salazar. Rush's performance as the titular captain is great and very touching. A sad note for many including me is that this is barbossa's last appearance in the series. He dies towards the end of the film, in a very courageous and brave manor, trying to save his long lost daughter Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.<br/><br/>Next We get are new villain, Captain Salazar, played by Javier Bardem. Bardem's performance as the tortured Captain Salazar is one for the ages. His performance is gut renchingly creepy and at the same time sympathetic in a dark sort of way. His story goes like this, he was a might Spanish general who hunted and killed thousands of pirates across the sea. During one of his showdowns he was confronted by a very young (Thanks to great CGI) Jack Sparrow. He is then tricked by Jack and his ship is sent into the Devil's Triangle where he and his crew are cursed to stay forever, or at least until Jack screws up and let's them free.<br/><br/>Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan return for a very brief time span in this entry but their presence is very well known. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return as their titular characters from the previous installments. Will, now five years after 16 years after he became the captain of the Flying Dutchman is covered in barnacles and coral, still not as bad as old fish face, Davy Jones. Keira Knightley shows up towards the climax of the movie where here and will can finally reunite again after the trident of Poseidon is broken and all of the curses in the see are destroyed. Though they are in the film for a very brief time frame their presence is quite uplifting and good, a true treat would be to see them have bigger roles in up incoming installments. <br/><br/>Are new characters are Brenton Thwaites and of course Kaya Scodelario as the two young leads of the film. Thwaite's plays Henry Turner, the son of Will and Elizabeth, who in the film is sixteen. Within the film, he wants to free his father from the dreaded curse of being bound to the Dutchman. In doing so he needs the trident of Poseidon. Thwaite's plays Henry in a very natural way. He seems in place in the film and does a very good job. Then we have Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smith. Smith is a women of science. She believes in the simple and factual way of life. Later in the film we learn that she is the daughter of Barbossa, who had her at a very young age along time ago. Their relationship, Geoffrey Rush's and Kaya Scodelario's is very sweet and subtle. through the film you can feel Barbossa's pain of knowing who his daughter is and her not knowing who her father is. Scodelario plays Carina superbly and is one the new standout performances. <br/><br/>On a minor charter level we have a new British antagonist, General Scarfeild played by the brilliant and underrated Australian actor David Whenham. Though in the film for a short period, Scarfeild is an interesting charter and chews the scenes he is in. Another new charter is the films new voodoo witch played by Golihifteh Farahani. In the film she is the friend of Barbossa and give him valuable information. She is creepy and interesting as her character. <br/><br/>From a film making stand point, the film looks great. The colors in the film are magnificent, the ships and sea faring parts are extraordinary, and the special effects are freaking amazing, Salazar and his crew are beautiful in a creepy dead rotted pirate way. The two new directors did a very good job, way better then Rob Marshall directing On Stranger Tides. <br/><br/>On an overall look, Pirate of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an amazing film. The acting is spectacular. The Visuals are splendid and the story is very impressive. I loved the film, my one complaint would be that Barbossa Dies. He was my favorite character in the series. Well, anyways, the film was a great fun-filled ride and i personally can't wait until the next one. <br/><br/>Rest in Peace Captain Barbossa, until we meet again!<br/><br/>Two-Peg legs up!"

","Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.<br/><br/>This movie provided some background story of Jack while he was young, which was very interesting to see. The movie was filled with lots of fun and laughter but also few brief touching moments. The story was good and there were some surprises too. As a high budget movie, the movie was filled with very good special effects (some done by the Industrial Light Magic). I totally loved the effects of the deads (Salazar's crews), his ship and of course the very cool special effects at the end.<br/><br/>I also felt that the movie did not have any dull moment. From beginning till the end, there were always something interesting to see. My wife and I were entertained throughout the whole movie which was having a duration of a little over 2 hours. Amazingly, due to the sense of excitement, my wife was able to hold going to the bathroom till finished. I guess she forgotten about it while watching.<br/><br/>Actually, even though I looked forward to see this movie, I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this one would be good enough. I felt that the 4th one was a little bit dull, and also a bit forced. The story for that one did not feel strong enough and certainly did not give a lot of impression. But this one really felt it was worthy of giving another sequel after this. Especially if you wait till the very end, after the end-credit scene, where we were given something interesting to ponder. Might be the potential story for the sequel? Perhaps if this one is successful enough.<br/><br/>I believe this one really worth to see. I am happy to see Johnny Depp in this movie which I hope would be a commercial success for him. Since his past few movies were unfortunately not really successful ones. Maybe people grew tired of his acting as unusual characters. So if you are looking for something fun, light, interesting movie with funny charming pirate and treasure hunt story, you should definitely watch this one. I am confident you would be entertained like my wife and I were.<br/><br/>For my complete review, pls have a look in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

","Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. It's heartbreaking to say, but I have to agree with what Mark Kennedy from the Associated Press said about this film.

"hacantyapradipta","9","97","168","24 July 2017"," Definitely not as bad as many critics said it to be (In fact, I don't consider it as 'bad' at all).
","Expectations is everything with these movies. While the previous Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) movie feels more like a spin-off than a direct sequel to the original trilogy, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales/Salazar's Revenge"" continues the lore of the first 3 movies. While continuity errors are somewhat blatant, you can't say this movie is the worst of the 5 PotC movies. The actions are more grounded than the previous movies, and they managed to salvage themselves after the less-than-mediocre ""On Stranger Tides"". The humor's there, and just enough. The amount of screen time of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley probably means that there'll be more of these movies in the future. There's also a familiar feels to the first movie in this one. Perhaps this familiarity is what makes critics hate it. But seriously, if you despised ""On Stranger Tides"", this one you'll probably like. I'd say this is the best PotC movie since the first one back in early 2000's.<br/><br/>Oh, and Javier Bardem, as always, is menacing as the latest baddie ""Capitan Salazar""."

You have no other option but to take your kids to this one, you will not be sorry.<br/><br/>I especially liked Mr. Bardem as Captain Salazar, his acting is a little bit better then the rest but every actor gave hundred percent for this film and it shows! <br/><br/>Since this is my review 400 for IMDb.com I have to take an opportunity to thank staff at the Multiplex Cinema City Sarajevo for being generally kind and professional.

The special effects throughout are up a bit, but to be expected, though not slow enough to appreciate much of the available graphics wizardry of 2017. The austere and unsurprising plot leaves so little in imagination that someone forgot to develop characters, build something and have buy-in. This movie fails on so many levels that you ponder who thought this was a great direction??<br/><br/>Secondly, Jack is tiresome. Nothing new from him. Boring. The hatred from the 'villain' is sincere if not the plot that seems to put Sparrow at second whistle throughout the film. There literally is ZERO flavor, no life.

They try to continually up the action set pieces in this franchise but just manage to make them more stupid, bombastic and confusing with muddied visuals, terrible pacing and stupidity from the characters.

Even good actors seem to feel the need to Depp it up in this series, and the two new leads were so wooden they didn't need ships to cross the seas.

","After the dreadful predecessor that was 'On Stranger Tides', I entered the cinema with rather poor expectations... how I left with even lower enjoyment is beyond me.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the fact that a theme park ride can't sustain a story for an entire film franchise? Maybe it's the fact that I've seen this story before in four other films? Perhaps the lack of character development and me not giving a damn about any of the new characters? Or maybe it's just because it's an orgy of CGI madness? Who knows? Either way, this film is a complete over-the-top mess. Watchable? Yes. Enjoyable? Hell no!<br/><br/>I admit that 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End' weren't ""fantastic"" movies, but they rounded off a rather enjoyable trilogy, especially following the ultimately brilliant first film. But the two sequels' success should not have been an excuse for a fourth and now a fifth film, with each film the reception lowers and the standards and eagerness for the next further lowers. However, Disney as the opportunistic blighters they are, take their box office success with stride and look to creating the next underwhelming, money-making sequel. This time it's in the form of 'Dead Men Tell No Tales'.<br/><br/>The overuse of jokes we've heard on several previous occasions, the fact that the beloved Jack Sparrow is now becoming a character we look at in contempt because he's worn out, much like the franchise. Scraping the bottom of the barrel, milking upon its previous success... both terms that can be applied suitably to this movie (if that's what I can call it). And do you know what the worst part is? This film will make its money back, it'll double, triple, quadruple its budget in box office returns, thus giving the producers a reason to create yet-another dull sequel.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I actually think I had an aneurysm whilst watching this film..."

","Remember when Johnny Depp exploded onto the big screen as Jack Sparo- Sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, and it was awesome? Ah the good old days, what I would give to go back to that time where Pirates were cool and Salazar's Revenge didn't exist. The fifth instalment to the Pirates franchise displays a complete evolution of genre complying with Louis Giannetti's theory. The Cure of the Black Pearl marked the Primitive genre stage, the film blew audiences away and introduced them to the pirates genre. Dead Man's Chest marked the classical stage, classical conventions were utilised such as the Kraken and what have you. Next is the Revisionist stage of At World's End with it's time travel, witches that grow into giants and that sinkhole final act, let's just ignore the pointless fourth film aaaaaaaaaand now, unfortunately, we have the all out parody that is Salazar's revenge.<br/><br/>Pirates 5 is quite simply a parody of itself, from its stupidly absurd, comedic action sequences, to Johnny Depp himself. This film feels like one big joke and I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew this to be true. The way Jack is introduced in this film is quite possibly one of the goofiest sequences I've ever seen in the cinema. I've seen bank robberies go wrong before, but stealing the bank itself... All I can say is, what are those horses taking and where can I get me some? BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE! The guillotine scene is just so horrifically bad I physically had to lift my jaw up off the floor in a mix of amazement and bafflement. The Pirates franchise is no stranger to big, illogical, comical action scenes, but this film takes that to a whole different level of stupidity and is almost like a scene out of Epic Movie.<br/><br/>As well as the action scenes being all out parodies of ones which preceded them, the acting is as much, if not more so. Johnny Depp drunkenly stumbles out of the children's hospital to play Jack Sparrow once again... Or at least I think he was acting... I'm not quite sure to be honest. Sparrow has always been an alcoholic character, but that was once his lovable charm, now Depp slurs his speech and acts so confused to the point where it's hard to believe he hadn't had ""a single drop of rum."" This being said he gives the best performance in this film which is shocking to be honest. Geoffrey Rush, similar to Depp, plays a parody of his character Captain Barbossa, but to be honest, Barbossa was always a kind of parody of pirates so I can let that slide. However, what I cannot excuse is the abysmal performance by the films two newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Not helped by their rather forced relationship, the two provide a masterclass in wooden acting that makes it near impossible to care for their characters.<br/><br/>However bad the acting is, it is not the worst part of this film, oh no. That would be the films script and visuals. Firstly, the script. Pirates 5 is plagued with terrible dialogue. Lines are recycled over and over, exposition is embedded with little effort and subtlety and the sex jokes, lots and lots of cringe worthy, unfunny sex jokes. Sex jokes are practically the back bone of comedy nowadays and can be hilarious, but here the jokes just come off as dirty, like a bunch of dirty old men in a bar recounting ""the things I'd do to her."" Simply put, it's extremely uncomfortable to watch and hear. The film also features a few pointless characters. From the bald witch lady who is simply there to give Barbossa Jack's compass, to Paul McCartney's Cameo role as Uncle Jack. The film just doesn't need them and they either act as a plot device or a waste of everyone's time.<br/><br/>Now the visuals, the film was poorly shot. The lighting at night was non existent and the way the camera is positioned for some shots was possibly the single worst place they could have placed the camera, hidden behind objects so the action of focus is distorted/ out of view. Also you can clearly tell where the film is missing a vital shot or just couldn't be bothered to shoot it, as the use of fast cutting and cut away shots are used in an attempt to cover this up, but instead only highlights it and thus confuses the audience. SPOILER WARNING! When Henry is kidnapped by Salazar there is no shot of him being pulled away or anything. A series of fast cuts, Carina's reaction shot to a non existent shot and expositional dialogue of ""THEY TOOK HENRY!"" is used to present his capture, and frankly it just seems like they spent too much money on Salazar's gravity defying hairdo, that their visual effects budget was bone dry. This happens a fair bit in Pirates 5 and it simply leaves you as confused as Depp appears to be throughout.<br/><br/>To conclude, Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is by far the worst in the Pirates franchise. A full on parody of what it once was with horrific acting, poorly shot sequences and a script that needs some work done to say the least. I know I've been insanely harsh so, on the off chance that the filmmakers see this, I would like to say the famous line ""it's nothing personal, it's just business"" whether or not you agree or disagree with me, none of us can deny that the theme tune is absolutely epic and pumps us up every time."

","Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales."" A cartoon like Depp and a boring plot sends this fifth ""Pirates"" to the bottom. It has a few thrilling action sequences, but it's often loud and dumb and most unfortunately, lacks the wit and fun that made the first Pirates of the Caribbean so entertaining. Oscar winners Geoffrey Rush and Javier Bardem do their best but they can't save this ship from drawing. It's fine for a bit, but then you realize that you've seen all of these things before, and they aren't getting any fresher. If there was ever a point of time where this franchise would permanently end, now is the right moment."

","Pirates of the Caribbean, when it came out in the early 2000s, was one of the most original and unique movies to be released in recent memory. It was a great mix of comedy, adventure and action that could appeal to the whole family. Depp's boozy Captain Jack Sparrow was part ruthless pirate and part sly wink. You never knew which one you would get. The first one got it all right: a great story, a ton of adventure and a lot of fun. However, the series has dropped in quality a bit more with each subsequent release, to the point that now I find the whole thing boring, trite and overdone. Depp's Sparrow continues his act, but now it's more canned and predictable. The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. It deals with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swain's son and that he wants to join an evil pirate group and yada yada. Some explosions, sword fights, Sparrow drunk walking and some boats on the water. Ho hum. The good news was at two hours, this was one of the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome."

","After watching with very low expectations to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it is hard to understand the legion of haters that write in IMDb. The film is not a masterpiece but is funny, entertaining, with great cast, special effects, screenplay and story. Johnny Depp performs the wolf, drunken and smart Captain Jack Sparrow in the usual funny way. Cinema lovers of fantasy-adventure genre must ignore the bad reviews and question what this kind of people that writes that the movie is not good like to see or if they have difficulties to understand a story with many characters.

","If you would ask me to recount the plot, I wouldn't be able to. The fifth installment is simply incoherent. It jumps from action scene to action scene with no discernible story. Obviously, there are plenty of impressive visuals, but they don't contribute to anything larger than that. Yes, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' tells no tale. The movie also lacks the wit of the first installment and lacks any emotional or intellectual development on the part of any of the characters. The ones you would like to sympathize with, such as the female astronomer, are still too shallow and stereotypical to be any good."
"jonas_bassforce","3","28","47","28 May 2017"," What a boring piece of junk!
","Being the fifth installment in a franchise ruined (in my opinion) by its derailed third movie, I didn't expect much. The first movie was an interesting adventure that was entertaining, presented something new, had some amount of depth and mystery to it and that managed to keep all this together throughout the whole movie. After that it got weird and by the third I didn't bother going to the cinema to see it, nor can I watch the movie all the way through since it's too long and boring. They shaped it up in the fourth in my opinion by leaving that particular story-line, and that gave me hopes for this one. At least I expected it to be entertaining. <br/><br/>But I was wrong. This movie presents absolutely nothing new. The plot is somewhat the same as every other Pirates-film so far, everybody's looking for some token while chased by dangerous cursed pirates. It even brings back some old story elements that are shoe-horned in at the beginning and ending and almost have nothing to do with the entire movie. The characters are all the same, though some have been given new names. The villain is basically a ripoff of Davy Jones, he does the exact same things, although in a slightly different manner. I think he's supposed to be scary, but since he tells you who and what he is almost from the start the character just comes out flat and weird. Even the humor has been used so many times before that it comes out boring and almost embarrassing at times. It's what happens when you re-use a videotape over and over again. After some time the tape gets worn out.<br/><br/>And again like in so many other movies these days I'd like to stress: what's with this whole ""CGI character"" thing that just looks ridiculous and awful? Do the directors and visual effect guys even have eyes? What's wrong with casting real live actors? I know you can't cast a young Johnny Depp, but people will realize it's supposed to be him even if he's played by another guy. Take ""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"" for instance. Did anyone not get that River Phoenix played young Indy even though he didn't look like Harrison Ford?"
"tkentsh","3","75","140","26 May 2017"," *Sigh* I didn't expect much and still was let down.
","First off, it was awesome this movie brought back so many characters from the previous movies but the problem is these characters did not really add anything to the film. Mullroy and Murtogg were great to see again but were not the same funny two people like before. Secondly, it was good to hear a lot of the music reused but sadly I would rather just hear the music instead of watch what was happening. I dunno why people say Javier Bardem did such an excellent job in this film he barely said anything and when he did it was hard to understand him. I didn't care if he lived or died and his ship was super lame. He was not even a freaking' pirate!!!! Ugh, such a lame villain!!<br/><br/>*Warning Spoilers*<br/><br/>The trident just gets broken. What a waste of a cool weapon. Should have just left it out of the film if it was just gonna get broken.<br/><br/>Barbossa never uses the Sword of Triton to do anything except release the pearl from the bottle. Where's this supposed fleet he has? What happened to all the ships in the bottles that Gibbs had in the 4th film? What happened to the Queen's Anne's Revenge and Sword of Triton after Barbossa dies?<br/><br/>Barbossa dies. How stupid. Such a cool character and they kill him off. he did not even die a cool death. I hope he is not dead. He barely had any lines too. Kill off Jack Sparrow please! He added nothing to this film. All he did half the time was go ""AH"" or ""OH"" or mumble something not even funny. <br/><br/>Too much random events and not enough meaningful dialogue. <br/><br/>Is Davy Jones back? Just show him or have him speak. Why show his shadow and crab arm? He was a cool villain so they should have done more with him if they were gonna hint at him being alive. <br/><br/>I was real excited for this movie because I thought it was going to be like the original one but the characters were barely even likable. I want to see more pirate films but I really think these have run their course. If Jones or Barbossa are not in the next film then why even see it? I don't wanna see Jack Sparrow anymore because he adds nothing to these films anymore."

","The original trilogy of POC (Pirates of the Caribbean) was exactly what they needed it to be, original. Great story and character development set in a world of pirates brought this ancient genre back to the big screen. This latest installment of POC did none of those things the first 3 movies did. Like 'On Stranger Tides' this movie failed to spin a compelling story and lacked characters that I could get invested in. Jack Sparrow is Jack Sparrow, a drunker version of Jack Sparrow that is. Captain Barbosa used to be an imposing character that is now poorly used and really does a disservice to his character. The other two main characters are forgettable, I can't even remember their names. The protagonist, Captain Salazar, is all CGI and no game. As I watched his scenes I silently wished Davey Jones would make an appearance and kill this want-to-be so this movie could be saved. Instead, all we got was cool hair special effects. The only reason this movie got a 2 star and not a 1 star was because of the young Jack Sparrow scene that summed up how his character should have been presented in this movie. POC Dead Men Tell no Tales is a CGI ride that offers no back bone in the form of storytelling or character development but plenty of CGI craziness."

","After the success from the Gore Verbinski Trilogy, this pirate fails to deliver r it barely swim on the surface that is struggling to reach shore. That is how it feels. The movie is a mess; they cut down the budged so this one is not even an epic like the previous movies. I has good story to a degree then is bloated with slapstick comedy that it can be annoying at times, it is overwhelmed. Not interested for pirates buffs. It might drag the youngster's kid but adults it is just a movie as soon you leave the theater it is forgettable. Now the bad side is it doesn't look like a proper pirate adventure that needs to have the entire ingredient in order to be a masterpiece or great. The action is so boring no sword duels not even on deck nor or land. No sword fences like The Black Pear and Chest. No canon fire from ship to ship explosion in a battle field. No swinging in ropes from ship to ship. No Sword Swashing and Buckling on ships decks either. It has boring story and is similar to the Fountain of Youth. This time they are looking for the Trident of Poseidon. The special effect were good, the ghost pirates were different in comparison to the Black pearl. There is mall amount of ships, we see Cpn Barossa on Queens Anne Revenge and the Ghost ship. Jack fined his small fishing boat and the Galleon trapped in the Bottle. The Black Pearl this time was not the real from the previous movies, it was a CGI, but done right you can't even tell the difference. Only people experts in the computer wizardly can tell the difference. It is little bit better then Strangers Tide but it flat and fails to the bottom of the ocean compared to The Black Pearl. Johnny Deep is a great actor but I don't think he was doing best in his role either too much silly phrases or acting drank at all cost. Well in the black Pearl he was drank but when I come to use his wits and trick he was serious, and sober. In this move is lacking his magic from the First and 2 and 3rd movies. The Norwegian brothers as directors aren't suitable for a pirate adventure, that doesn't mean if they won an Oscar for Kon-Tiki can make a gem, not so. They should step aside and do comedy instead. Mr Bruckheimer should hire back Verbinski and if he wants in the future to create a masterpiece or something close to the Black Pearl. Otherways it will fall to the bottom of Davey Johnes locker.<br/><br/>Pirate moves are tough to do because they have to rely on a great story, supporting cast, character driven and less fantasy, more action, sword dual, brawls, ship battles and treasure hunters. If you don't put those ingredients in the pan it will be mash potatoes.<br/><br/>This movie it only had comedy slapstick annoying there was no need it should be controlled, less action no duels or sword fences, and no Ship Battles either. I still consider Worlds End is the best action oriented, but it fails flat in story to the Black Pearl out of the entire trilogy."

"christian-larson","2","41","73","26 May 2017"," The moviest movie of 2017 (so far)
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush, and it tells the story of how Jack needs to find the trident of Poseidon. I watched the first pirates movie in preparation for this, and I thought it was average. Not my type of movie, but I enjoyed some parts of it. In this movie, I enjoyed little to nothing. The direction is non-existent, it does not have any type of vision or creativity at all. The script is atrocious, with no character development whatsoever and with the most obvious, painfully, cheap jokes any kids movie would have. The comedy is really bad, it really did distract me how much un-laughable jokes there were throughout the movie, and how much they tried to appeal to the mainstream audience. The main villain is laughable, and I do not think that Javier Bardem should've played him, he is too good for this movie. The main motivation for the villain is very stereotypical, I have seen the same motivation many times. The exposition throughout the movie is unnecessary and apathetic, very cliché as well. The action sequences are average, nothing special there. There was very little practical effects in the movie, with a lot of green screen and CGI. There are some logical inconsistencies that really took me out of the movie, as the movie doesn't care about small details. There are some minor positives. The acting is not bad but not great, I think the actors are giving everything they got, but the sad thing is that the characters are underwritten and just plain boring. The cinematography is good, with a lot of unique and interesting camera movements in the beginning of the movie. The ending really did not satisfy me as much as I wanted, since I just wanted to have fun with this movie. I don't think this movie is a mess, its just incredibly boring with nothing driving the characters to the story. This movie needed to have more self awareness and maybe I would've liked it. 2.5/10"

","We still remember the pleasant cinematic surprise from Pirates of the Caribbean, which took us on a fun adventure fit for the young at heart. When the sequel came out, we started to grow a little sick of it. By the third, it had overstayed its welcome. By the fourth, crap, I keep forgetting that a fourth one exists! Anyway, now we're on fifth, where a few good qualities, to our amazement, remained consistent these past fourteen years. It still sustains the same atmosphere, like watching a product of the 2000's. Depp has still got it with his iconic performance, Geoffrey Rush still graces the screen, and best of all, Hans Zimmer's famous score sounds fresher than ever.<br/><br/>Whew, got the good stuff out of the way. Now let us talk about the atrocities of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>Basically, the main hero has to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do to harness its power to control life and death. Oops, wrong movie. Well, just replace the ark with the trident of Poseidon, and the Nazis with a pirate ghost army, and the plot stays pretty much the same. Yeah, the youth of the previous decade were into ancient mythology, but now they moved on to obsessing over the future. Why not let a dated concept sit to collect shelf dust?<br/><br/>The whole Indiana Jones rip-off of a plot may intrigue the parents after overcoming the opening prologue: A boy goes out rowing, ties his ankle to a rope, then tosses into the ocean a pile of rocks tied to the other end of the rope. It looks less like Will Turner's son going down to see him in the Flying Dutchman and more like Suicide 101. This honestly could have all landed on the cutting room floor; everything is retold anyway.<br/><br/>The teens may feel rather dissatisfied too. No pretty imagery parades through to please their senses, particularly by the dull darkly lit stage combat. That also goes for the ""fun"" action scenes shot in broad daylight, such as the first one, where a bunch of horses pull a house through the village streets. Then later, zombie sharks attack for three minutes' tops, a CGI-infested made-for-3D visual which looks like patty cake compared to what Zack Snyder can orchestrate.<br/><br/>As for the kids, keep them far away. After all, the rating says PG-13. Inappropriate content gladly makes its way in for nothing besides a few cheap laughs, from the sexual (gawking at a woman's bare ankles) to the tasteless (offending every Spaniard in the world). However, the children are most likely to be traumatized by some of the imagery, including a basket of severed heads at the foot of a guillotine.<br/><br/>Although the greater portion of audiences will groan over the production's excessive desperation to curse you with a giggle fit. At the screening I went to, the audience laughed plenty throughout, even I chuckled a few times. Yet the dialogue still lacks any point as the cast goes tirelessly in search for a punchline. For instance, one of the many pointless moments puts Jack Sparrow inside a whale skeleton to wed a boogery ogress of a woman.<br/><br/>These tiresome jokes are blaring enough to make you believe the plot doesn't even exist, or that the jokes came from the mouths of human beings with fears and opinions. The characters keep contradicting their own desires; especially Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl crew, who right at the beginning abandons him for no reason, then later comes back for him for no reason. A predictable romantic subplot further bombards the key plot, as played between two actors with no chemistry; the female half of the equation, played by the unenthusiastic Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) makes it worse by relying on the eyes on her chest other than the eyes on her face to stir up emotions. You could potentially forgive the writers for their lack of care in developing believable relationships, until the ending closes every story arc with pure hogwash.<br/><br/>Oh, believe me, it gets worse. This motion picture also brings up the fact that Galileo Galilei actually built his telescope to search for the trident of Poseidon, as a map to its location is found within the stars. Apparently, all these historians overlooked that important detail. Well, considering this alternate reality features a ghost army who pass through matter yet still kill people with their swords, that historical ""fact"" is the closest to believable Dead Men Tell No Tales gets.<br/><br/>Okay, enough already. Did we seriously forget that Pirates of the Caribbean was once only a freaking animatronic show breathed on by Walt himself?"

","Dear readers, Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that I have been watching since my high school. Now I am already in the working life, but the spirit of that movie series is still on my heart, so that yesterday I watched it. Since last year, I know that there will be a continuity of that movie, but I never knew that the movie is about Revenge, well yes, finally about Revenge. Before I am telling to you my review, it is important to remember that each movie of Pirates of Caribbean movie, includes an unique plot within it, for example the last adventure is about Family, and then the others are about Love, Friendship, Father-Son relation, and Captain-Crew honesty. In this latest movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is about Revenge, but do not hesitate to watch it, because the plot is designed not to show up about the Revenge itself, but there are legend, myth, Science, Witch, fantasy, history of Bank, ethical Law of pirates, and of course ridiculous adventure are around the plot, from the beginning to the end. I can guarantee you that you will be laughing of many funny actions or languages, and sometimes you do not care about the end, what you really care is that the safety of the soul of this movie: That is Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, Johny Depp is still the soul of the movie. He is leading all characters and he is the one who is making this adventure happens. Besides of its perfect, this movie has some illogical scenes and some missing plots, so that for those who are not really fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies, will not really understand who is the real enemy and what pirates stake of life in that kind of level to protect Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, there must be a betrayal, but this movie never betray you to give a lot of have fun!!"
"mohammadtalha-46767","10","76","146","7 July 2017"," Absolutely brilliant and surprising
","I am a huge fan of Pirates of Caribbean franchise. I was desperately waiting for this 5th installment (Salazar revenge/Dead men tell no tails). I watched it in IMAX 3D. The movie is full of actions, adventures and there are a lot of surprises and you will not keep your eyes away even for a min. This franchise has some of the perfect special effect and CGI. Every character in the movie is referenced well and Jack is always ruling the sea. You are aware of the origin of Henry in the movie from the trailer that he is will turner son but you are not aware of the relation between carina and captain barbossa. That was just amazing and emotional as well. While watching I was like OMG what is going to happen next many times. It was very fun to watch. So far the best movie for year 2017. And I don't agree with the critics and a low rating on rotten tomatos. If you enjoyed and remember the movie as a memory then it is worth watching. 10/10 for story, effects, actions and comedy. Now waiting for its 6th installment."

","Six years have passed away since the last time I've seen a new Pirates of Caribbean movie, one of my favorite fantasy series, and I was so excited to watch it. I came with high expectations, not about its quality, but with hope of it bringing me back to younger ages, giving me the same excitation as it used to. However, I left the cinema disappointed. Maybe I have outgrown the movie in these six years and now I am looking for more realistic and thoughtful movies, who knows? But this movies brought me no thrills at all. They've tried to put in comedy in almost every single scene, I remember the old films to have few funny scenes and dialogues, but that was just some scenes and it was well placed throughout the movie. In this case it was just a bunch of jokes one after another, and I felt satiation even boredom. Also, I think they gave too much time to some of the unimportant scenes, while those that are crucial to plot were finished in matter of seconds. Movie seemed much more fantasized than it used to be as well. It feels like they could've invented anything they want and put it in no matter how does it fit into the movie. I do understand it is a fantasy, but still even a fantasy needs to have some limits."
"diac228","6","33","59","6 June 2017"," The Two Hour Continuity Error
","The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Production hell doesn't begin to describe the attempts to create the fifth movie, even though On Stranger Tides was met with very poor reviews. Johnny Depp refused the original idea, which would have featured a female villain for the first time. Johnny Depp was going through a nasty divorce and got injured, delaying the shoot even longer. Disney and Bruckheimer were arguing about costs, and the script itself (which is a disaster we can describe later) was undergoing changes and multiple hands. And I'll still never understand how the writer of Rush Hour 3, Speed 2, and Tower Heist managed to get his hands on such a big film. Oh Hollywood The only company willing to cling on to a sinking ship of a film is Disney, simply because their patience constantly gets rewarded, and it's impossible to discontinue a franchise that has earned them a nasty 3.8 billion within only four films. So after epic struggling for many years, we finally see Dead Men Tell No Tales gracing the screen.<br/><br/>Not going to lie, this film is an entertaining mess, and part of the wave of recent sequels/prequels that went through similar production issues which affected the final product. Alien: Covenant went through tons of trouble, and then we see Fate of the Furious have to find a way to edit out the obvious tension between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel. But the Pirates franchise is more than just a cluster of movies, its part of the Disney fandom culture, it has a life of its own through video games, books, and mysteries and intrigue surrounding it all. So copying, abandoning and contradicting plot elements of the original trilogy gives this movie a layer of frustration we didn't need, and we definitely don't deserve after such a long wait. Even after the entertaining first half, it all gets damaged by the unmet potential and by the awkward familiarity of the plot. And this comes from the Disney Company, a film studio notorious for being vigorously detailed with all of its IPs, from Marvel to (especially) Star Wars.<br/><br/>Another curse that doesn't allow the cursed to touch land? Sounds familiar. Woman who doesn't believe in the oceanic supernatural mumbo-jumbo? Sounds familiar. A person who denounces pirates suddenly becomes one? Also sounds familiar. British navy trying to conquer the seas from the pirates? Heh, okay. The entire plot line felt very similar to Curse of the Black Pearl, yet this installment felt like it was tapping the brakes far too much. This watered down and clownish Jack Sparrow didn't perform any swordplay once, he didn't trick anyone a single time, I don't think he even delivered any clever quips of any kind. The villain didn't have a final showdown against Jack, as we witness a CGI-laden chase as our climax, a far cry from the dizzying mayhem during the big showdown in Dead Man's Chest. Worst of all, we didn't get the dramatic showdown between the enemy ships and the Flying Dutchman, the ship that you know, controls the damn seas, and has a captain that's related to someone that is in danger throughout the film! <br/><br/>The potential was there, and wasn't met. From script to direction to storytelling decisions, Dead Men Tells No Tales has us wishing for the original writing team and the original director to somehow bring this franchise back to decent waters. This film only further enhances At World's End and Dead Man's Chest—two films that were met with ho-hum reviews but have honestly aged well and remain better than most of your modern-day blockbusters. The script here opens the door for many intriguing scenes, and they didn't deliver. We could have explored Jack Sparrow's aging and increasing alcoholism, Barbossa's past, the Flying Dutchman/Salazar curse connection, the fallout of the elongated separation of Will and Elizabeth, and the series-shifting scene of breaking every curse. And after seeing this, I don't have much hope in the eventual sixth installment touching these story lines either.<br/><br/>The Pirates of the Caribbean series now looks like its more interested in the international box office receipts and just keeping people entertained above keeping the flavor of the franchise and keeping a continuity between each chapter. On Stranger Tides, despite the mediocrity, had interesting unresolved story lines that were completely neglected here. The original trilogy's details don't match up with the backstory of Jack Sparrow in Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>You will see some high-budget fun, comical mayhem, a good performance by Javier Bardiem, but it all gets evaporated when we reach the series-changing yet series-contradicting final act. The franchise is far from being dead, but boy it might be time to let this ship disappear out into the horizons unless we get a superior cast writing and filming it. Jack Sparrow and all his fans deserve much better.<br/><br/>Blog: https://coffeeandscriptblog.wordpress.com/"

","As a Pirates fan I was very disappointed in this movie. I think my least favorite thing was the female character. It was almost like she was trying way too hard to be a hero. I found her annoying and I noticed her chest was constantly exposed. I loved Kiera Knightly's character because she was so classy and did an amazing job and there was a good balance between her and the other characters. I hate how they depicted jack in this one. He is more of a womanizer than a bad ass pirate. There were too many sexual references as well which is not what pirates is about. One thing I loved about the first pirates was the fact that it felt realistic, pirates 5 felt more fantasy and fake. All together, I saw it once and would not see it again. I wish Hollywood would stop making movies based on feminism, sexual content, etc. just make good movies with substance!"

What makes a villain fit in of our heroes...? it was like Batman and Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Dead Men Tell No Tales as lack of that aspect. but Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar was stunning.

"dbcint","4","51","97","25 May 2017"," Nor do they tell particularly interesting stories
","The history of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is something of a tumultuous one. The first movie, The Curse of the Black Pearl, was released to mostly critical acclaim and was pretty popular with audiences. Not only that, it gave Johnny Depp the role he would be associated with for years to come – which has, in a way, defined him over the last fifteen years or so. It was quickly followed up by Dead Man's Chest, and At World's End showed up not long after. By the time the fourth film, On Stranger Tides, was announced, the talk had swung from excitement to disdain. However, the franchise has continued to make money, so now we have Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>This is an attempt to recapture the magic of The Curse of the Black Pearl, and while it's fun for the first hour or so, it ultimately doesn't work. Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) has found himself in trouble again, and must team up with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), and Carina Smith (Kaya Scodelario), an astrologist and horologist who, due to her intelligence, is deemed to be a witch.<br/><br/>All three are trying to find the Trident of Poseidon for their own reasons. Henry believes it will free his father from his curse (apparently something happened to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in one of the previous movies that has him cursed and trapped aboard the Flying Dutchman), while Corrina believes searching for the Trident by reading ""the map no man can read"" (""Well, it's a good thing I'm a woman, then!) will lead her to discover who her father is. As for Jack, he's just looking to become a true captain again, and also to escape from the peril he's constantly in.<br/><br/>This time, that peril comes in the form of Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew, all of whom are dead. They blame Jack for their current condition, and seek revenge. But in order to find Jack, Salazar must form an accord with Barbossa (Geoffery Rush). And so, a high speed chase ensues with the Trident of Poseidon being the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales starts out as a fun and entertaining movie. Johnny Depp is in his element as Captain Jack Sparrow, and the hijinks he gets up to trying to escape the island of St. Martin are exactly the kind of thing we've come to expect from the character. Most of them stretch plausibility, but if Jack can constantly survive the high seas, a collapsing bridge and runaway bank are just a regular day for him. Some of these situations are more than he can handle on his own, but luck always arrives in the nick of time for Captain Jack Sparrow. He's the drawcard to these movies, and the only person guaranteed to survive them – it would be bad business for Disney to kill him off, and even if they did, the Pirates franchise will always have ways to resurrect the dead. So while that removes any of the tension as far as Jack's concerned, it gives him a few more enemies and creates the movie's silliest and funniest moments involving a bouncing guillotine.<br/><br/>As for our two new heroes, neither of them really do anything to stand out. When the CinemaSins video for this movie comes out, they are going to deservedly be referred to as ""Discount Orlando Bloom"" and ""Discount Keira Knightley"", and their story plays out exactly as you think it's going to. <br/><br/>It actually speaks to a bigger problem Hollywood is facing these days. If you make a movie set pretty much anywhere in history, chances are you're going to come up against a culture that oppressed women. To accurately reflect that, you have to either literally show women who are being oppressed, or have men make rude and sexist comments about women. Dead Men Tell No Tales certainly opts for the latter, taking it a step further by suggesting Carina is a witch simply because she's intelligent enough to make maps from the stars. But if you don't have a strong female protagonist somewhere in your story, you alienate a lot of your potential audience. That leaves Carina as the archetypical ""strong, independent woman who stands up for herself"", and there's nothing (Scodelario) can do with that that hasn't been done over and over again.<br/><br/>But that's not the biggest problem with this movie. The second half of this thing drags on and on. It's so slow to get anywhere or do anything interesting, it might as well be the first 95% of Power Rangers. Deals and alliances are made all over the place, and at one point you might think the ultimate objective at the end of all this will be to survive the next Tribal Council. Even when the map no man can read has been read (because of course it will be) and the Trident is found (because of course it will be), the battles lack any real danger or excitement, and the various deals and plot twists make it hard to know – or care – who to root for.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fun ride for the most part, but it's utterly predictable, does nothing interesting with any of its characters (though it does try with someone, but saying who might leave enough clues to be considered a spoiler), and drags the story out for the apparent sake of ensuring there'll be more movies in the franchise. It's a great movie for turning your brain off and shoving popcorn in your mouth, but nothing more."
"danielmeench","2","18","30","29 May 2017"," Bad review for the worst sequel in the franchise
","After I watched the trailer I thought it might be not so good as Gore Verbinski's trilogy. Perhaps, it will be like the last one, I thought. But after I watched ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" I decided to write my first review ever.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, I plunged into action. Scene after scene I watched sluggish events with poor lines that hardly give an excuse for the actions of the characters. The story is built on past movies success and lies (there are small, but very notable inconsistencies), which is unacceptable even for Hollywood.<br/><br/>The most daring, tricky, witty and sexy pirate Jack has become a silly and shabby drunkard, who doesn't deserve even a one-legged moldy prostitute from Tortuga. Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario's characters were remembered by inconclusive speeches and expressive decollete (close-ups). The lines of Captain Salazar are illegible, and breathing sounds unhealthy even for a dead man. Oh,and the worst part is an old chestnut from Sir Paul McCartney's cameo.<br/><br/>In this picture there are no beautiful landscapes and spectacular panoramas. Some scenes looks like a rehearsal for a theatrical performance. Too many visual effects, led by unnatural image of a young Jack Sparrow. There were so many visual effects that the ship and some crew members of Captain Salazar cannot be seen in the literal sense.<br/><br/>At last, spoilers, sorry. The trident is shaped like the Harry's broom Nimbus 2000. Carina Smith's tear-stained red eyes are ""up in smoke"". And the death of captain Barbossa is very ""die hard"".<br/><br/>I do not know who was at the wheel actually, but he deliberately sent the ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" ship to the reefs and smashed it to pieces. In the end, I felt nothing but chagrin and disappointment."

","Ever since the Pirates of the Caribbean Ride opened in Disneyland, the producers pitched the idea of adapting the ride into a fantastic action-packed movie entitled Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and four sequels following the significant characters. The characters include the witty pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), his friends, and crew members on The Black Pearl; the ship based on the original film. The franchise was lucky at the box office, with Dead Men Tell No Tales garnering over $794 million worldwide. Unfortunately, the reviews of their movies started to drown, and this film is no exception. Whether people enjoy viewing movies about action, pirates, or comedy, the fifth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise will disappoint audience members at the movie theater. Not only does the film define what the franchise should not be, but also gives the viewers a clear perspective on every flaw in the sequels. Although the sequel was a summer blockbuster, the majority of audience members left the theater seasick. During the evolution of the franchise, the various writers transform Captain Jack Sparrow from an intelligent, witty pirate captain to a drunken, comedic caricature of himself. Throughout several scenes in the movie, Sparrow turns to rum as a source of happiness. Unfortunately, the writer depicts Sparrow's addiction in a lousy way. For example, after the poignant scene of Sparrow's crew abandoning him on the Dying Gull; an old ship that the team of the Black Pearl now possess, Sparrow scavenges for rum in the village. When Sparrow finally finds rum, he gives up his most valuable possession, a compass that points to someone's desire. After these few moments, Sparrow is tipsy throughout the entire duration of the movie, especially in the beginning acts. In addition to Captain Jack Sparrow's character alter, Johnny Depp will not satisfy the audience with his performance of Sparrow. Since the 2003 original film, Depp has gained worldwide attention of acting as Sparrow. In the case of Dead Men Tell No Tales, though, the entire world seemed to lose interest because of Depp's final performance as Sparrow. Depp's performance leads to fans and viewers commenting online about his retirement saving the franchise. After four consecutive blockbuster sequels, Depp's performance in Dead Men Tell No Tales foreshadows an empty stretch of water ahead for the franchise to cover. Though it had a massive production budget, the film proves that nothing will save this movie from drowning. The movie will not fulfill anyone's expectation of a great movie because it entirely changes Captain Jack Sparrow's character. Besides, the plot lines are similar to the other sequels of the franchise. Either way, Dead Men Tell No Tales, is a merchandising film and will neither entertain fans nor everyday moviegoers."

","Hey! Were you captivated by the rich world of Pirates of the Caribbean in the first movie? Did you enjoy the thrilling action and deep characters of it's sequels? You want to see Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp take to the seas once more in their cursed pirateships to fight an epic battle against an unstoppable force of evil? Well don't expect that in this movie. There's no epic battle, just a few minor brawls. You thought Pirates 4 was bad? Well this is worse. If you're hoping to see Orlando Bloom return for his role as William Turner in this dung heap they call a movie you're in for a sour surprise because he barely has 3 minutes of screen time. Were you hoping to see Johnny Depp return to the hilarious badass dumb genius pirate captain Jack Sparrow? Well he's just an empty shell of slapstick comedy. No? Then how about seeing Keira Knightly as the loose pirate queen of Shipwreck Cove, Elizabeth Swann? Too bad. You get to see her for maybe 20 seconds and ONLY at the very end of the movie. Or perhaps you were hoping to see Javier Bardem preform an amazing role as the most feared ghost piratehunter of the seven seas, Armando Salazar? You'll sorta get it? I mean, half the movie is captain Salazar's backstory and how he met the previously lovable Jack Sparrow. No? None of that? Then how about seeing good ol' Geoffrey Rush reprise his role as Captain Barbossa? Well he's always good, even despite the horrendous asspull they did in the last bit of the movie.<br/><br/>Now then let's move on to the latest additions to the cast. Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth, the strong, smart, independent woman who don't need no man but still kinda wants one, who's really just there to replace the hot clickbait actress they cannot afford anymore (Keira Knightly) or how about Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner? Yes, the kid we saw at the end of the third movie, who was then still called Bill Turner back then, has received a name change as well as an actor change. He doesn't really do anything. He's just a plot device called ""hurr durr I need to find the trident of Poseidon to save my father hurr""<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly dumb, and only small children would enjoy it. Which will be hard considering it's a PG-13 movie."
"theocharous_an","3","10","15","19 June 2017"," Worst installment of the franchise
","I'm not into commercial blockbusters at all. I feel that films created with money as their sole purpose do not deserve my attention as they completely miss the point of the art of filmmaking. I haven't seen a single Transformers film nor any Marvel film since the very first Avengers film in 2012. Having said that, I have always been fond of the Pirates of the Caribbean for some reason. I enjoyed all the first four films (yes, even the fourth one I thought was quite entertaining) and even if I ignored titles like The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman and Beauty and the Beast without even watching a trailer, I was very enthusiastic about the latest Pirates film. Sadly, I was in for a big disappointment. By far the worst installment of the franchise is a big mess.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the legendary Poseidon's Trident and the efforts of the main characters to find it and use it to break the curses of the seven seas. Johnny Depp reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow along with a few more returning characters like Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Jack Sparrow faces a new threat when Salazar (Javier Bardem), the captain of a crew of dead, gets released from his curse and comes to haunt the man that caused his doom. Jack's only hope is finding the Trident that can make Salazar mortal again. In this search he is joined by Will Turner's son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and a highly intelligent girl named Carina (Kaya Scodelario) who both seek the Trident for their own different reasons.<br/><br/>One of the major disappointments concerns one of the most important aspects that made the films so popular, Jack Sparrow. Yes, Jack seemed like a dumb, careless man that is usually busy drinking, but at times he would show why he became such a legendary pirate. Not this time though. His only purpose is to try to make the audience laugh by acting silly with no avail most of the time. It's not that Johnny Depp's acting is bad, but it feels that even he himself is tired of this overused character, especially now that he appears more useless than ever. The rest of the cast is average. Rush and Bardem do a good job, but they don't seem to have much to work with.<br/><br/>Then, we have the script which may be good for a 13-year old fan boy, but dumb for any self-respected cinephile. Apart from the part when Salazar recounts his first encounter with Sparrow, the story is shallow and completely devoid of any meaning. It doesn't even try to be original, but rather recycles material from the original trilogy. I cannot know why the Rønning – Sandberg duo was chosen to direct this fifth installment, but they definitely failed to make the film live up to its expectations (which were not that high after On Stranger Tides). The film has some good points, the cinematographer did a good job and the special effects are great. Overall though, it's just another pointless blockbuster especially when you think of the potential it seemed to have with Johnny Depp in one of his most renowned roles and Oscar winners Rush and Bardem in major roles. The franchise delivered some great moments, but even though this is not a befitting end, I really hope that the creators won't release a sixth film.<br/><br/>More reviews: https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"

","It didn't have a Pirates Of The Caribbean feel for me which makes me disappointed in myself for not liking it and did think about walking out but stayed as it was Pirates Of The Caribbean and was hoping it was going to get better. Comparing this to On Stranger Tides, On Stranger Tides was a lot better and I thought that at the time was not all that good but still enjoyable. Seeing the trailer and listening to the score on YouTube got me excited and was really looking forward to it knowing William Turner (Orlando Bloom) would be returning and then recently Elizabeth Turner (Keira Knightley) was also returning made me feel it was going to be another good adventure, great action and a good story line. Turned out to be a massive disappointment. Not just for the lack of involvement of both William and Elizabeth Turner but for whole film itself. Jack Sparrow's character was not the same in the previous films. There was no braveness or encouragement from him. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) was okay and the only character I found to stay the same. The effects were good as always and was the only thing I personally enjoyed. Overall, to me, they tried too hard to make it better than previous films that they forgot to keep that feeling of magic and yet craziness. Just hoping the sequel will improve."

The score is too repetitive, annoying, could've been turned off and just played during credits, unnecessarily, ridiculously played throughout to hype up drama. Randomly boring annoying explosions start anywhere for the sake of creating a visual, what a dump. Somebody mentioned there was a little scene after the credits.

Cast is awful - Depp played awful, the two new faces, playing protagonists maybe, were forgettable. The minute you see Depp waking up in an opened safe, you can read his face, hear him wonder why he's still doing these movies. The whole film, you could hear Depp going to himself 'Why am I still in this franchise?' Geoffrey Rush feels the same the minute you hear him ponder upon it, all written on his face, from the moment he is shown sitting bored in his ship, he plays retarded, pulls out a gun and shoots nearly missing the heads of his musical team in order to quiet them down, going 'Why am I still in this franchise?'<br/><br/>Bardem's character was interesting but caged. Disney probably assumed his character ought to be 'too cold' for the kids so he didn't get more room and depth. We're not just all kids when watching this so why not have more darkness coming out of him? That could've made you care more for his character. All Disney's movies are aimed at young teens and I should've remembered this was Disney to begin with - sorry to say Disney makes childishly lame movies, amusing the young ones and grabbing mommies money, throwing in overly dramatic scores, cheesy narratives and unreal stories.. I mean you really couldn't be serious and expect something concrete out of a Disney flick. You won't believe there were young kids and adults also ACTUALLY laughing to the jokes in this movie. These had me rolling my eyes. I was sitting there turning around, going 'What is going on this world?'<br/><br/>And WHY are movies like these repeatedly getting made?? How old are these writers? A whole house without wheels being dragged by about what 6 horses?? You tell me if this sounds like a movie you'd like to see.. with absolutely no character development for anybody here. Who was the witch on the ship with Barbosa or wherever they were at? What about her background? How did she get Sparrow's compass? What about her? Scenes were stitched together without giving you any sense of a story - oh turns out - no story! How conveniently does the forgettable Carina end up being the daughter of Barbosa?<br/><br/>Where were the many cool and interesting mythical creatures or so that could have potentially been part of this for maybe some 'groove'? The movie was EXTREMELY unreal, such a mess. I went, 'Why did I do this to myself?'"

The drunken, yet witty, Captain Jack must put winds behind him to search for the Trident of Poseidon, a mythical artifact that gives its possessor unquestionable control over the seas.<br/><br/>Plenty of action and great visuals. It remains to be seen, but scuttlebutt has it that this may just be the last time Jack Sparrow will get his boots wet.

"robparton","5","6","8","14 June 2017"," Have they forgotten the past PoTC?
","I think this film was a real shame for what it was and what it could have been.<br/><br/>First off, a major tweak in the storyline to suit the new film is pretty awful, and almost an insult to the previous watchers who were paying attention. This all revolves around Jack's compass - in Dead Man's Chest we find out that Jack got it from Tia Dalma, however in Salazar's Revenge, Jack gets it from his dying Captain. Not only this but the ""curse"" of Jack's compass is evoked whenever he gives it away, yet in previous PoTC's Jack is constantly giving it away and getting it back, with no repercussions.<br/><br/>Secondly, rushed scenes. It didn't feel like they were anywhere for longer than 10 minutes. This also goes for the characters. Everything was pretty much bombarded onto the audience, with such a long time from the last one being released, I wish they'd taken the time to show and build the characters up again.<br/><br/>Thirdly, no one seemed to be the same. All of the characters, including and especially Jack, seemed to have completely changed from how they used to be. I had watched all of the films before watching this and with Salazar's revenge I found it really hard to see and appreciate the characters in the same light as I had before in the previous films.<br/><br/>Overall I feel they had very little regard for the past films, and although I liked the events in the film I wish they could have strengthened the ties and from the past films and tried to keep characters that we loved from before the same."

","I think it's high time Disney dropped the anchor for the Pirates franchise as this fifth installment went in no new directions. It's noisy, unfunny, and painfully unbalanced. The villain is forgettable, Jack Sparrow contributes nothing to the story, and the quirky nature clashes unevenly with the darker and grittier sequences, a flaw that's persisted worse and worse since Curse of the Black Pearl.

"cammymadden","5","7","10","10 September 2017"," As You'd Expect!
","Contains Spoilers!<br/><br/>So there isn't a great deal that can be said here that you wouldn't have guessed simply from the direction the last film took the series in. Basically: money-hungry bosses decided to squeeze another film out of an already dead film series. Dead Men Tell No tales? More like Dead Franchises Tell No Tales! <br/><br/>The storyline at a base level could have been pretty interesting: The backstory of Jack was certainly an entertaining moment but the poor writing just opened far too many cans of worms and ultimately couldn't pull it off. I mean the emphasis on the compass at the start implied that it had something to do with the dead being imprisoned yet that was never explained. I mean maybe I just missed something but to me, the compass was the same compass we'd seen throughout the films already. The story of Barbossa felt forced and the scenes with him and his daughter were revoltingly cringe-worthy. Another thing that the film seemed to skip over is why a woman who doesn't believe in ghosts or anything supernatural is searching for a magical trident that controls the sea? Speaking of which: how did the red coats know that they were racing for the trident since nobody had got that far through the clues other than the girl? <br/><br/>Don't even get me started on Jack. Anyone planning on watching this film for the same entertaining Jack from the previous ones better give it a miss. Instead, we are forced to watch this bumbling idiot who quite honestly was more like a pirate version of the mad-hatter than Jack Sparrow. He wasn't witty, he was barely funny...it was sad actually. <br/><br/>I can only pray that they end it at this one! How long before Davy Jones is brought back on some revenge mission? Maybe we'll see another previous advisory being raised from the depths of hell. Also the Will and Elizabeth scenes added nothing to this film. I'd actually have preferred if they hadn't been in the film at all. I mean isn't the Dutchman meant to ferry the dead across to ""the next place"". So why wasn't there some involvement in the story of this film? The Dutchman could have intervened at any moment and made everything a whole lot easier. <br/><br/>Basically this film is a plothole riddled with plot holes where all your favourite characters have gone to die!"

","The Pirates of the Caribbean saga isn't properly a great one ... Its first film established an amazing character that mostly defines Johnny Depp career (he's been criticized in other movies for doing too ""Jack Sparrow-isms"") and it was a movie full of adventure, fun and thrilling action scenes. From the second installment to the fourth it has been a tormentous journey, with each movie worse than the latter. Well, one thing is certain: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge, as it was shown at my theater) is the best one since the first ... Which is not saying much.<br/><br/>Let me start with the good things first. The soundtrack keeps being epic and memorable, which makes every action sequence better, even if the action itself isn't great. Henry and Carina are excellent additions to the story as well as the actors portraying those characters. Javier Bardem also does a great job as the villain and Barbossa gets a very emotional role in this installment, captured brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush. Actually, if there's one thing that defines the Pirates of the Caribbean series, is the cast's chemistry, it feels that they're all there having fun and not just there to receive their paycheck.<br/><br/>The story is the most interesting since the first film of the franchise, even if it becomes a mess mid-way through and too exaggerated. The ending, I dare to say, it's perfect. I mean, with all its flaws, this movie manages to end on an extremely high note, full of emotion, with a lot of mysteries solved and even some closure (if this isn't the last time we've seen Jack Sparrow, the production is just going to keep drowning the whole thing and ruin it more than what it already is).<br/><br/>For all it's worth, I still can't quite give a positive review to this one ...<br/><br/>The action scenes are disappointing, they're there more for a comic relief moment than for a thrilling set piece and there's more running and jumping than actual sword and ship-fighting. Some of them are so over-the-top that it just makes them look stupid. The humor is also a bit too much ... Not that the movie isn't funny, it's just that they never once understood when to stop a joke (there are several jokes that go on and on and on and on ...).<br/><br/>The pacing is surprisingly slow until the beginning of the third act (best one of the film) and it feels like there's no rush in saving anyone's life. The characters are just going from place to place in the messiest, strangest and badly scripted way possible which doesn't help to keep me captivated at all and actually makes the movie feels longer than it is (even if it is indeed a bit too long).<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment is, by far, Johnny Depp. Don't get me wrong, he was born to play this role, but I feel that giving him 100% freedom, which is something that was definitely decided behind the scenes with the directors, kind of damaged his performance. It feels like he's doing an impression of himself portraying Jack Sparrow! In addition to this, Dead Men Tell No Tales is the movie with less screen time for this character ... Interesting, at least.<br/><br/>Finally, I didn't enjoy the humor as I expected to. I think the comedy isn't as funny and clever as it was already in the previous movies and the whole film seems like a bunch of cool scenes glued together with a messy plot. The production/directors built the story around these awesome moments instead of the other way around and the final result isn't exactly good.<br/><br/>In the end, Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (or Salazar's Revenge) is another film that critics are giving too much of a hard time to. It's the best movie since the first one (which is not saying much, I know), it has an interesting premise, some great additions to the cast and story, the usual epic score that helps the action sequences a lot and the ending is nailed perfectly. However, it does have a lot of flaws: from the action scenes themselves to the slow pacing and from the messy plot to the surprisingly not that funny humor, going through a disappointing performance from Johnny Depp, this film isn't near perfection whatsoever.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"obiegimmie","4","7","10","17 June 2017"," 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' Review
","What, really, is the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise? What has it become? What purpose does it serve, now, 14 years after the witty, clever, and fresh original? These questions, and more, you will be asking yourself while watching DMTNT. <br/><br/>So let's begin with a little history; the first PotC movie, 'Curse of the Black Pearl,' was released in 2003. The early 2000's were a tedious time for Disney, largely because it had started a new (and pointless, in my opinion) trend of rebooting classic Disney theme park rides. One infamous example of this dark period is Eddie Murphy's 'The Haunted Mansion' a crowded and ultimately mediocre picture that failed both critically and financially. But the PotC franchise came to Disney's salvation. Released a few months prior to HM, PotC proved a success and encouraged astronomical reviews and box office profit. Three years later comes 'Dead Man's Chest' a film that, while significantly worse than its predecessor, DMC managed to get relatively positive reviews and, of course, fared over $1 billion. Only a year later came, what I consider, the death of PotC, because everything; the presentation and execution of the film are dead on arrival. Of course, I am mentioning 'At World's End,' with an impressive $963.4 million. The last film defiantly refuses to attempt anything original or remotely entertaining, 2011's 'On Stranger Tides' with an undeserved $1 billion. <br/><br/>Predictably, I, as most of America, angrily stomped my feet and shook my fists because they had killed it. They had viciously destroyed everything good about PotC and expected us to pay to see the funeral. It'd be insane to make another one of these. ""PotC is dead,"" I say to myself. <br/><br/>6 years later comes DMTNT. Here is a detailed plot summary (OPENING OF MOVIE SPOILERS)<br/><br/>We open with a young Henry Turner (played by Lewis McGowan) (Elizabeth and Will's son) looking for his father Will (Orlando Bloom), the now cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman (from third film). Will is confined to his ship for 10 years at a time, and can return to land for only one day. Therefore his father has largely been missing from his life, and the fed up Henry tells his father about Poseidon's Trident, a mystical object with capabilities to cure any curse. Will reluctantly dismisses his son; and Henry vows to find Capt. Jack Sparrow, a pirate with the required resources to find the trident. <br/><br/>Henry is now roughly 19 (Brenton Thwaites) and working on a British Royal Navy Ship as a lowly crew member. His ship is about to enter the lethal Devil's Triangle, and Henry, an educated student of sea myths, tries to persuade his commanding officer to turn around. But the enraged captain sentences Henry with treason and the ship continues. This inexplicably triggers some kind of supernatural incident, in which an undead captain and crew reawaken headed by Capt. Salazar (Javier Bardem). Salazar slaughters the crew but leaves one man, Henry, alive with a message: to find Sparrow and tell him death is coming to him. <br/><br/>We cut to Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a young woman about to be hanged. A priest comes to hear her final confession, during which the most ham handed exposition occurs in the history of Disney. <br/><br/>""I confess that I am not a witch. I confess that I am an orphan who was left a diary with a secret map from my faceless father. I confess that I intend to solve the map and find a clue to my father's identity,""drawls Carina, while you wonder why they didn't just stick a STATS card in the screen corner.<br/><br/>So Carina, Sparrow, and Henry work together to get the trident while avoiding the tireless pursuits of Salazar and hilarity ensues! <br/><br/>This movie, while better than 3 and 4, holds little excitement, whimsy, or fun. Despite a few good scenes, the movie is tiring and simply a bore. It's a far cry from the PotC that you fell in love with, although a slight improvement. <br/><br/>4/10<br/><br/>40%<br/><br/>D+"

","just back from the opening day's last show here in Australian capital, thought why not share how i am feeling about it. I'm a die-hard Pirates of Caribbean fan so naturally i was expecting a bit too much from the movie. I can't say I hated it because for a fan like me you can put Captain Jack Sparrow on a motorcycle instead of Black Pearl, I'm still gonna like it, Savvy! But towards the end, I was feeling like if this is the end, they have wasted everyone's last ten years. When they were running the end-credits, I was literally praying for a ray of hope in the shape of another after-end-credits' scene that usually links towards the next outing :-( then i remember that i felt the same way after 'on stranger tides'. All in all, I felt story-line was a bit on the weaker side. Chemistry between characters, especially involving the new cast members, doesn't feel right for some reason. Perhaps they should try to go backwards: for example, a well presented making of Captain Jack Sparrow can be a perfect finish to the series if they can't keep up with the brand. But a finish like this one is just not doing justice to the fans. I have tried my very best not to give away any spoilers, trust me :-)"

I would highly recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed any of the prior films... don't let the critics determine whether or not you see it."
"Anthony89","9","36","71","8 June 2017"," I don't get all the hate for this film
","I felt compelled to write a review for this movie, due to all the negative reviews it has been receiving. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an impressive adventure movie that is visually stunning and has great set pieces & interesting storyline (more so than the previous film On Stranger Tides).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives another great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, he does exactly what you expect and hope with this character, It has been obviously several years since his first portrayal of Jack Sparrow & feel that they did a nice job of making him seem useless & past his prime in the eyes of the viewers and also his crew, for the first part of the film only for them to need him again once the story progresses.<br/><br/>Captain Salazar was interesting as the villain and appaeard quite menacing when ever on screen & has his own personal reasons for seeking revenge on Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>The nice addition of adding Henry Turner & Carina Smith into the mix along with Captain Barbosa completes some good performances of the supporting cast. Plus there was a nice twist towards the end of the film regarding Barbosa.<br/><br/>The film provides a lot of humor throughout and most of the time the jokes do hit their mark. Johnny Depp once again provides most of the comedy throughout.<br/><br/>I feel I need to mention it is not as good as the first two films in the franchise, but it is a solid return to the pirates of the Caribbean series and hope they continue to make more of these types of movies in the near future."

","Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **"

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a surprise. Disney had been trying ride-based movies for a few years and they were all awful. Then suddenly here came one that was fun and featured a character that would for better or worse define the rest of Johnny Depp's career. The movie was a critical and financial hit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately 14 years and 4 sequels later, all the charm and sense of adventure that made the original so much fun is nothing more than a faded memory. Part of the problem is the popularity of Jack Sparrow (Depp). Each movie exposes some untold backstory in order to make him relevant to the plot. Unfortunately, Captain Jack Sparrow is just overblown comic relief. Yet, his past seems to constantly dig up enemies who are after him. Now instead of seeing humor in Sparrow's role in the story, I just wonder why so many trust this loose cannon with such pivotal items.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a decently put together film. The effects are fantastic which is par for the course with this franchise. The problems here lie with the characters and the story. Since Jack is too goofy, other characters have to drive the plot. This time those characters are Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), son of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, who is a character about as engaging as paint drying. The other key character is Carina Smyth (played wonderfully by Kaya Scodelario). These two enlist Jack Sparrow as they search for the Trident of Poseidon. The villain this time is Captain Salazer played by Javier Bardem. Remember how he intimated James Bond in Skyfall and terrified everyone he crossed paths with in No Country for Old Men. Well get ready to hear him gurgle unintelligible lines. If the filmmakers went out of there way to make Bardem suck as a villain, they succeeded. Further, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa is tacked on to the story and at the end they attempt to give him a reason to be there meant presumably to maximize some emotional impact that fails miserably. <br/><br/>Part of the problem with this entire series is that it fails to do any character development and in its place inserts so many plot points such that if the audience wishes to follow the story properly they should keep notes. But, who wants to keep notes on characters who fail to evolve in any way. By way of contrast, The Fast and the Furious characters appear deep, intricate, and thoughtful. In conclusion, this pirate ship sunk long ago."

Full enjoyable from start to end.<br/><br/>Just Go for it."

","The fifth installment of this once swashbuckling movie franchise based on an old Magic Kingdom ride will have you begging for 2 eye patches and a bout of scurvy. At one time (in 2003) Pirates of the Caribbean was a nice movie for the whole family that featured a mix of action, comedy, and pace which worked. For one movie.. Since then the franchise has taken a walk right off the plank and it has sunk to it's lowest depths in this one.<br/><br/>The title of the film was perfect because while it's true that dead men tell no tales, neither do the writers at Disney. This vague ""i'm looking for my long lost daddy"" story feels old and it's made worse as it's carried out simultaneously by both of the new main characters Henry (a forgettable personality that no one could possibly be invested in) and Carina (a girl who's smart because she says so). Captain Jack Sparrow is in typical form drunkenly mincing about as usual. He gets arrested only minutes into the film for attempting to steal a safe in front of an entire square of people. To pull of this brilliant heist he falls asleep inside the safe with the wife of the man lauding it's security, straps it to several horses on the other side of the building, and then has them pull in through the back. However in an obviously believable twist, instead of pulling it through the wall the horses which apparently all pulled the chariot of Zeus himself in past lives proceed to pull the entire building through the town despite it's size and lack of wheels losing all the treasure inside. <br/><br/>While in jail he meets up with his uncle, Captain Paul McCartney for all of 30 seconds. I do feel that this was a missed opportunity for the usually ""suck every penny out of everything"" executives at Disney when they didn't force Paul to release a shameless parody album alongside the film with such timeless classics as Maybe I'm Marooned, Ahoy Jude, The Ballad Of John And Yoho Hoko, Yellow Man-O-War, Buccaneer On The Run, All You Need Is Booty, While My Cutlass Gently Weeps, Sail Sail Sail, and I Want To Hook Your Hand. One highlight of the movie was Javier Bardem who was just lightheartedly creepy enough to provide a bit of interest though they don't flush his character out enough and he commands a zombie pirate ship that can literally eat other pirate ships. The fact the we see a zombie eating ship indicates that there were actually other ship ideas that were shot down which I would have paid a treasure chest in gold to hear.<br/><br/>At the ""climax"" of the film it's revealed that Barbossa is Carina's father as they're being pulled up a huge anchor to what appears to be safety before he jumps off. probably to end his misery of being on set. It reminded me of the classic scene from Empire Strikes Back where Vader reveals to Luke that he's his father, just without the emotional investment, impact on the actual plot of the film, or surprise. I would have given this a 3 instead of a 2 if he would have just said ""Carina join me and together we can rule the sea as father and daughter"", but they couldn't even give us that. <br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is truly the end in which Elizabeth Swan shows up literally running across a field to Will Turner with no lines or explanation of where she came from. But wait! there's an after credit scene in which a crab person gives will a bad dream, so stick around. It's only the end of May and this was the worst movie i'll watch all year. At least it better be.."

","I know many will disagree with me, but here's what I think after watching Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>I re-watched the original trilogy (i.e. Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End) again before going to the cinemas for Dead Men Tell No Tales. And when the heroic score of the Pirates sounded and the end credits rolled, I was utterly disappointed. <br/><br/>I disagreed with the critics on PotC 2 and 3. I found them funny, heartbreaking and very entertaining movies. Since many people said this movie was an improvement over On Stranger Tides, I went in with an expectation - not a huge one, but one nonetheless. However, as the film progressed, as much as I wanted to enjoy it, I discovered that I couldn't. The movie was simply bad.<br/><br/>I remember loving the crew of the Black Pearl, from the ever-loyal Mr. Gibbs to Cotton and his parrot. I treated them as a family. The crew was still here in this one (albeit missing a few members), but I just couldn't find that chemistry between them anymore.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow was still portrayed by Johnny Depp, but it became clear after a while that his only direction from the directors was, ""Do what you want with him."" We didn't love Jack Sparrow because he's drunk, we loved him because he's drunk and has a heart. The few moments of Jack's sentimentality in the original trilogy are the highlights of the movies. However, in this one, Jack Sparrow is just a ghost of himself. The drunkenness is pushed to an extreme, and there are no more wit and heart in his words. And it became apparent that the sole purpose of Jack's existence in this movie is to fall around and provide one-liners to squeeze a few laughs out of the audience.<br/><br/>New faces Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites are welcome at first, but they can never replace Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner - not because they act badly, but because after some minutes into this movie, I finally realized the Pirates series are built upon Elizabeth and Will. They are the jewel of the franchise, and I teared up for them once again during the last 2 minutes before the credits rolled. Those last 2 minutes are the only redeeming quality, and I feel like they deserve a much better movie. Their reunion on the island are both joy and sadness for me, because I know that from now on, the Pirates franchise (if Disney intends to produce more), will probably never reach the heights of the original trilogy again. <br/><br/>Many critics say that the plot is convoluted and bloated, but I disagree. To a certain extent, dissecting the absurdly convoluted plot is part of the joy of watching PotC. Every detail counts and everyone has their own plots and schemes. This is what defines the entire series, and makes the movies so entertaining. To me, the plot is not the problem, the writing is. The witty banters that I loved are gone, and in their places dull exposition dumps.<br/><br/>Disney wanted to stuff everything they think people loved about PotC into Dead Men Tell No Tales, but those are often the wrong things. And it distresses me to say that the magic has vanished, replaced by a mere parody of the once-great movies."

","I am a big fan of the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie. I really enjoy the character of Jack Sparrow and the action was amazing.<br/><br/>This movie just made me feel sad, I thought that this was just a sad attempt at reviving what once was a fun movie.<br/><br/>Let me talk about Jack Sparrow. Jack is one of my favourite characters in cinema. He is so clever although he looks stupid. In this movie he turned into a cartoon character. He just kinda goes with the flow and never does anything clever. He is supposed to look like a drunk failure although he is brilliant, in this movie, he is just a drunk failure.<br/><br/>Also, this movie attempts to have a Will Turner-ish character and a Swann-ish character, and these two characters and their loves story suck in comparison to the original.<br/><br/>The CGI sucks, I admit captain Salazar looks pretty cool, but the rest of the effects look really bad, specially the green screen. Also, WTF happened to captain Barbossa. He is dressed in some ridiculous clothes that looked terrible.<br/><br/>Actually, this movie is a cartoon. The ""comedy"" is cringe-worthy slapstick with Sparrow doing some stupid sh*t. The sound effects are straight out of a Tom and Jerry episode.<br/><br/>I really was expecting a bad movie, but I at least was expecting to be entertained by all the stupid sh*t. Oh not at all, this movie was actually pretty boring. I actually was nodding off in some of the ""big action sequences"".<br/><br/>Don't see this movie, it will only make you miss the old one."

","This review of Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (Dead Men Tell No Tales) is spoiler free<br/><br/>** (2/5)<br/><br/>WHEN YOU GET on a theme park ride for the first time it's an original piece of memory that you will never forget, but when you return to the ride multiple times it gets monotonously tedious. Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (changed its name from the US title Dead Men Tell No Tales) is just like that it's the same thing over and over again. And for the fifth film in the franchise it's exactly the same ride. Promising a return to form to 2003s original film; Curse of the Black Pearl Captain Jack Sparrow and his bunch of misfits are back but not to the return to form we expect. <br/><br/>Story-wise it's the same thing, there's yet another pay-check seeking villain Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar – and his crew of ghosts manning a ghost ship out for revenge and there's another mishmash of a plot to hold it all together. We open with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) the adult son of 2003s titular show runner Will Turner (Orlando Bloom who's back in full swing), on a search for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's been missing for some years. He goes on a mission to find the lost trident of Poseidon to end his father's curse. A racy yet stunning opening to kick start it's promised return to form, this holds wholly well for the fifth film, there's a stunning set-piece of Jack being dragged by a moving building through a backdrop of a Caribbean island. A hilarious set-piece that holds firm in the film's first act thanks to the stunning cinematography, a drunk Jack who's surprisingly back to his unhinged form that nailed his character's strength in the first film. Though after horrendously bad ideas that pile up he's ridiculously routine, thus putting a barrier over his loose hinge. Through these it adds up to the same ride, yet much less fun than the previous four times.<br/><br/>On a fair scale you have to credit Norwegian directing team Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg who found their sea-legs in 2012s Kon-Tiki, the fault of the bad ideas aren't all theirs it's the editing, the best bits happen to straggle in the film's first half. On that note there's a rotating Guillotine, centrifugal to it's axis it spins several times over, the audience look on unblinkingly while the room fills with laughter. Moistly to the look on Jack's face as this makes him dizzy. But this quickly dwindles the film's promising due to the piling bad ideas, the continuous jokes (the word ""witch"" is on repeat), and the additional flimsy CG. The first act's hilarious swashbuckling proves to be the strongest force.<br/><br/>There's a return of older characters that have been here since the beginning too, specifically when we revisit Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbosa he's living the high life after the death of On Stranger Tides' villain, Blackbeard. This is short lived once he hears the news of Salazar's return, he proves to be the reigning strength yet through the film's clogging list of ideas he's long-winded. Salazar seeks out his help to find Jack, along the way coming up with plans to kill him. Enter a much-needed flashback showing the origin of Salazar's revenge, it's here when the flimsy CG first comes to light (Depp's computerized younger self is an example of this), the film improves slightly over the previous misinterpreted Pirate venture of mythology. The new players improve it too; Henry Turner falls for an attractive adventurer Carina Smyth (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) she sees adventure with Jack's crew as he goes in search for something weird. For some moments it runs the same storyline as the first adventure it shows this in full swing as Salazar is trying to stop Jack from doing his job.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge follows along the lines of mythology too, Jack still has his magic compass which points to things he wants most in life, there are zombie sharks, and there is a cacophonous plot involving the lost trident of Poseidon which Jack must find to end Will's curse. Due to the bad ideas that pile up throughout it's not the return to form that was promised but thanks to a strongly hilarious first act it's along the lines of improvement over the last Pirate adventure. This is not the worst film this far into the series and it's certainly far from the best but there is improvement. <br/><br/>VERDICT: A dull pirate venture for Jack and crew's return that promises a return to form but after piles of bad ideas and flimsy CG this is one ship that Depp's promising performance can't save."

","As someone who was born in the year of 2000 the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are a big part of my childhood. Indeed, I have no idea about how many times I've watched the first three movies.<br/><br/>But this... really? They had a budget of 230 million dollars and couldn't even get a good script?<br/><br/>The movie lacks identity: is it comedy or drama? Not to say that you can't have both at the same time, but here it's not even at the same time. The beginning with Henry visiting Will promises drama, but then we cut to... Jack with a hangover in a bank vault with someone's wife? Don't get me wrong, this could have worked. But it just didn't.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie is cheap. At one point Carina (new Elizabeth) claims that she is a ""Horologist"". What ensues are comments about how ""we've all got to make a living somehow"" and ""my mum was one too, although she wasn't as proud of it"". I really don't know what they hoped would come out of that exchange.<br/><br/>The new characters are underdeveloped. All we know about Henry is that he wants to break Will's curse. All we know about Carina is that she's trying to finish her Father's work. And then there's the, surprise, surprise, forced romance between these two that I just didn't get.<br/><br/>The plot was exhaustingly predictable. Just the same old ""time to find the all-powerful weapon which breaks all curses"".<br/><br/>Now, this movie has a few redeeming qualities. It is visually stunning. They definitely took special effects to a different level in this one. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem, who plays Salazar, stood out from the rest with his acting. Unfortunately the character still felt flat, but his scenes were never boring. (On another note Johnny Depp was sadly no longer the Jack Sparrow we know and love.)<br/><br/>Oh, and whilst cheap the humor was at times funny. I did, indeed, laugh quite a lot.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this movie is bad; maybe it's great in your opinion. I went with three other friends who all loved it. And I felt somewhat sentimental at times.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day I simply do not see myself watching this movie again."

","Nice addition to the saga but still not as good as the old ones...I m a 30+ old big fan of the Pirates of Caribbean movies and absolutely love what Gore Verbinski did with the first 3. I was utterly disappointed with the previous potc movie (#4). I went to watch this new one with a lot of prejudice.
But luckily it was an epic and fun movie to watch! Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski's style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form.

","Before i start this review i would like to point out that i'm a huge fan of the pirates franchise. I feel like the 2nd and 3rd sequels are fantastic and i don't know why people hate them so much, I understand why you'd hate the 4th one...as personally i don't like it either, now lets talk about the 5th one....semi-disappointed. <br/><br/>I'll begin with Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar, who by the way is a great actor. He is a little all over the place for me. I feel like Javier came in read the script and knew he had to be over the top in his role, which would work for a character, like Davy Jones, but his lines are choppy and his cgi is not the best in some scenes, in a very visual way as well you'll notice it pretty much the whole movie. <br/><br/>The new-comers Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites are all right *spoiler in case you didn't know* it turns out Henry is Will turners son and its an interesting reveal i saw coming, and of course Karina is supposed to be the Elizabeth to his Will but that was to be expected. Sadly enough as well we saw like no Will Turner, I was really looking forward to it as well, and I will mention this even though its to be expected, Johnny Depp is a stand out and is Fantastic as Jack Sparrow. So in conclusion..It's all right. <br/><br/>I would say if you're a fan of all 4 you're going to love it so go ahead and see it this Friday. But if you have been expecting some epic return to the franchise this is not your movie. As where Force Awakens takes too much from the original star wars, so does Dead Men Tell No Tales, but in a disappointing way. Listen if you're a huge Pirates fan like I am you're either going to think its mixed or love it so either way its not as bad as the 4th. With a bunch of sloppy fight sequences, some choppy editing, sometimes very visually bad cgi I am going to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 6 out of 10 stars, just because I felt Johnny Depp did a great job and there is enjoyment in this movie just like all the other pirates, except 4, If you did not like any of the sequels you will not like this one either. Thank you for listening"
"spamius","1","8","13","14 June 2017"," They explain everything twice - do they think you are stupid?
","I felt utterly insulted by watching this film. Do the creators think that the viewer is stupid? They explained everything for you, step-by-step. Even when the visuals tell you everything you know, they have to explain the situation again in the dialogue. Exposition is very odd and forced.<br/><br/>The performance of our stars is very bad as if they just do it for the money. No passion like the first couple films. I used to look up to Jack Sparrows luck and innovative problem solving, but in this film he is just a loser. Nothing changes character-wise, only that his crew is back at the end of the film. But I will suspect that Jack will just end up like he was in the beginning of this film.<br/><br/>Visual effects were stunning, but it does not give you the pirate feeling. The first films feels as if they were inspired by this exciting world of pirates, but now the immersive environments are just sets and it does not make you feel connected to that world. ADR is over the top and some of the sound design feels out of place.<br/><br/>I watched it with my fellow film students, and we all cringed throughout the movie. In my eyes, it is the worst film I have seen in a very long time."
"chrisjseattle","3","20","40","27 May 2017"," Should have waited for release on HBO
","The plot isn't especially good and Depp just needs to step away from this role. The whole Jack Sparrow act was fine for the first two movies, but now it just feels tired and annoying. Luckily Javier Bardem adds a good performance, as he always does, so that saves it from being a complete annoyance. Overall I would say it's worth a cheap rental at best."

"WooderIce64","7","2","2","31 May 2019"," A Guilty Pleasure
","14 years after the release of Curse of the Black Pearl, Captain Jack Sparrow returns for a fifth adventure, Dead Men Tell No Tales. The Pirates of the Caribbean series at this point is one that can only be appreciated by fans, and those who have enjoyed the previous movies. Personally, I consider them guilty pleasures. While there is a lot to like about the first few, this probably should've been a trilogy, with At World's End being the last one. But that's not the case, and there are more adventures with Captain Jack Sparrow to be watched.<br/><br/>A lot of the good stuff from the previous movies has returned. The sets, between the ships, the islands and seas, the towns, it all looks fantastic. Not only is it visually spectacular, it helps to give off the vibe of adventure that a movie like this should have. The soundtrack is fantastic. He's a Pirate is one of the best movie tracks of all time. As with most Pirates of the Caribbean movies, there's also a lot of supernatural stuff in it, and the undead continue to look fantastic. Of course, it's got to have some ridiculous over-the-top moments, which are always welcome. The most notable is when Jack and the gang steal a bank. Not just the money, the whole building. That kind of stuff is just fun and enjoyable, not much else to it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the characters aren't as good. Captain Jack Sparrow is still the wild, witty pirate he's always been, but it's quite clear that a lot of the charisma has worn off. Depp still gives a good performance, as only he could portray this character. The other main characters are Henry, son of Will and Elizabeth, and Carina, an astronomer. These are some of the most bland and cliché characters I've ever seen. They're effectively ""not Will"" and ""not Elizabeth."" What they should have done was have Henry and Elizabeth go together to break the curse, as that makes more sense than leaving Elizabeth out altogether. Javier Bardem plays Captain Salazar, the villain, who is actually pretty good. Bardem is a fantastic actor, and he plays the part of the undead captain very well. Killing off Barbossa would have been fine, but the context and nature of his death was extremely uncharacteristic. And the plot is rather similar to that of Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>If what you want out of a movie like this is just an adventure on the high seas with pirates, the undead, ancient treasure, you'll like it. It's as simple as that."
"BubbaGumpJr","8","2","2","2 March 2019"," A Solid Pirate Adventure
","It's been almost two years since this films release and about a year since I've had this film on DVD, yet I only now decided to watch it. I'd heard and read up on it, seeing all sorts of hate and saying it's a garbage film not worthy of the series. After watching it last night I have to say, what the hell are people talking about. Sure it's not perfect but it's still a damn good film with a lot of fun, action, and humor. I think the performances all around are good (yes even Johnny's despite what people say) and Javier Bardem as Salazar is fantastic. The plot is surprisingly straightforward which I definitely think is a plus, not once was I confused about what was happening or who a character was. The only real problem I have with the film is that Jack isn't his usual witty self, however that's not on Depp but more so how Jack's meant to be portrayed this time around. He's washed up, cursed with bad luck, and just depressed, so obviously he's gonna be a bit different. Overall though I really enjoyed the film, I didn't feel like it lagged at any point, and it's good summer time movie (I mean c'mon, it's pirates we're talking about here)."
"MarcSchmarc","1","2","2","21 February 2018"," Checked off the to-see bucket list ... same way this film was made.
","No spoilers here. But, even if they were, they wouldn't really be spoilers because ... in fact ... that would be impossible. You've seen it all before.<br/><br/>Why did I watch this? Because, like many other people, I really liked the first films. Just big fun. And so I figured, hey, they would do that, right?<br/><br/>Disney: evidently when they sat down to figure out why people like the first films, they got lost in their corporate, accountant driven, audience surveyed calculations, and decided it wasn't acting, or storyline that people wanted, but special effects. And that's all this is, from beginning to end. Resulting in, simply, a CGI-generated piece of ... uh ... whatever. With a plot line tidying up (more like scraping up and disposing) loose ends from previous films.<br/><br/>Where to begin: First: Johnny Depp -- who is admittedly the main reason the other films were interesting -- had absolutely nothing to work with in this script. He had nothing more to say. And he was evidently not interested in putting any personal investment into it. So all he did was crack the few not particularly interesting jokes he was handed, grimace a bit, and his principal acting skills went into scenes where he had to pretend he was staggering around drunk. And I'm not sure he was really pretending, because in later scenes, he still moved, and spoke, as though he was hammered. But I'm going to assume Disney had a clause in his contract against that, so maybe he was just severely hung over. Funny no more.<br/><br/>Plot? There was no plot. It was more like an IKEA instruction manual of how to make a (not so) cheap, mass-made and disposable consumer item. Just the usual package of some unlucky souls on an unlucky ship, trying to kill Jack. And the evil regular guys? They didn't even get enough time to be really evil, developing their bad guy thing, with maybe some time for them to develop a bit of humanity to make them a bit interesting. Just ... forget it.<br/><br/>I watched it. Yes I did. All the way to the end. Not expecting anything after the first 10 minutes ... going into a sort of catharsis, not caring, bored, but stuck watching it with the idea that ... what the heck ... I'd seen the others so I might as well see this out to the end. Like paying final respects.<br/><br/>Message for Johnny Depp: OK, you get paid a lot for this. Big, big bucks. But, frankly, you don't need to do this now. You obviously don't get any enjoyment out of it, other than maybe whatever Disney's catering service has to offer. Frankly, unless they can come up with a script that involves actual acting, some real character development or story line, and little or no CGI, let it die in peace.<br/><br/>It's over. I'm done with this franchise. Captain Jack Sparrow has obviously now become just a canned, makeup department effort good enough for keeping alive the Halloween costume industry tie-ins for another year."

","Where's the wit and the charm of the original films. This feels like a village panto spoof. Poorly written lines poorly delivered. Jack sounds like he's really drunk, and a boring drunk at that.

"iancmtexas","4","2","2","7 November 2017"," Oh the Mediocrity!
","While I enjoyed the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films (even At World's End had its moments), the complete mess that was On Stranger Tides made me suspect this franchise was losing momentum. This was proved with this film, which, while passing my admittedly very low expectations, still didn't feel quite right.<br/><br/>I feel I should first mention what I enjoyed about the film. As always, the effects are amazing, most of the action is fun, and Johnny Deep mostly remains the same character we've loved since the first Pirates film. Finally, Hans Zimmer of course does an amazing job with the score, which really helps immerse you in the experience.<br/><br/>However, my problems with this move mainly revolve around its plot and writing, which really just unravels the more you think about it. Of course, because this is a Pirates film, Jack Sparrow, Barbarossa, two white people in love, the British, and a CGI villain who will be dead in a couple of hours go after a mystical sea mcguffin that will do something that has to do with a curse. Along the way, Jack makes references to his alcoholism, the CGI villain destroys stuff with his powerful command ship, character development is glossed over, and the fight over the mcguffin leads to a finale where a protagonist sacrifices himself, even though they'll likely just come back to life at some point. Also, this movie is riddled with plot holes and a weird sexual innuendos that serve no purpose and just distract you from what's going on.<br/><br/>Overall, my feelings on this film are mixed. While the plot, writing, and character development are all lacking, the action scenes, score, and effects are all amazing and clearly have great effort put into them. However, when I think back to the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, this film just feels like a disappointment. Therefore, even if you just want to see action and effects, go watch one of those films instead, because this film a testament to its predecessors and how this franchise will likely never recapture their enjoyment."
"soxlade","2","10","18","5 June 2017"," Dull, tedious adventure that wastes talent, imagination, and production design
","Pirates of the Caribbean returns with its fifth installment and a minor reboot of cast with Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites joining the team.<br/><br/>Salazar's revenge is a very handsome film to look at, the special effects and production design are extremely fine. It is also a very expensive film - it genuinely looks like a lot of money was spent making it. The script is better written than some films and the music is very good.<br/><br/>However all of these good intentions are squandered on a film that is stiflingly, witheringly, perishingly dull. It's SO boring. I cannot recall ever being so bored in a cinema. <br/><br/>Part of the blame has to lie with the jokes and witty wordplay that just fall utterly flat. The wit is sub-Carry-On level, the innuendo is cringe-worthy, and everything is delivered without any form of comedic timing. In a film that is thought of as a comedy adventure, this raised exactly two thin smiles.<br/><br/>The first half of the film contains two huge action sequences, which are elaborately staged, filled with excellent stunts and one hugely imaginative guillotine gag that is genuinely inspired. But they too fall utterly flat. Dull, boring, unexciting - every minute of action is played for laughs, but these sequences are not remotely funny. It is telling that as the plot begins to overpower the film, these sort of sequences disappear to be replaced by death-by-cgi action sequences. It is a waste of the talents of the stunt team, and the production designers who are ultimately overwhelmed other by elements of the production.<br/><br/>The series' convoluted mythology has tied itself in complicated knots. So it falls to the actors to routinely explain to the audience what is going on and why, which has the unfortunate effect of reducing the screen time available to serve character. All of the characters, with the exception of Sparrow, are very poorly served.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the other major problem with the film: Captain Jack Sparrow. Sparrow was always an acquired taste, the over-the-top mannerisms and drunken acting entranced some viewers and alienated others. While he was largely well served by the first film, he's just became more and more annoying as the film series has continued. As the plots got more complicated, as the cast numbers ballooned, the audiences were expected to find in Depp and his performance all the film's entertainment: look, here's Jack scared of a monkey; look here's Jack drunkenly running away from a fight; look here's Jack trying to romance a 'lovely'. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow was always a pathetic individual, a useless pirate who somehow, often accidentally, always against his wishes, saves the day. The hero of the first film was Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, not Johnny Depp's pirate. Depp was the light relief.<br/><br/>Thing is, as the series' plot disappears up its own wazoo with plot convolution atop convolution, and all the other characters exist solely to explain the story, all the film has left is to deploy Sparrow, in the hope he is funny enough to carry the film. He isn't, not by a long way. He simply drains the life out of the film. It is a tiresome, annoying performance.<br/><br/>Bardem is adequate in a one-dimensional role. Geoffrey Rush is phoning in his performance, we've seen this hundreds of times before. Brenton Thwaites is Orlando Bloom bland so he's actually a fine fit for this series. Kaya Scodelario is, by far, the best thing in this film. She is an appealing presence, and she is a bright star in an ocean of misery.<br/><br/>Despite all the above criticism I have yet to address the single worst offense in the film's litany of failings: the celebrity cameo. So it is that Paul McCartney appears in a cameo so cringy, so toe- curlingly awful, you'd think it was a Ricky Gervais sketch. McCartney is so bad he actually makes Depp look good for a moment. It is a performance so irredeemably awful it makes David Beckham's appearance in King Arthur look Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>An end credits sequence hints at yet more Pirates to come. Let's hope not. This is the foul death rattle from a wheezing corpse of a franchise that should have been declared dead many, many years ago.<br/><br/>This is a film so unsure of itself it is called something completely different in the UK to the rest of Europe for no apparent reason. It is a film that seems content to waste huge amounts of money and talent on an overly complex and unfunny script. It is film that seems content with not even attempting to deliver anything close to entertainment to its audience. It is a film where there is, literally, a shark jumping sequence. It is a film where the story revolves around a trident that, when eventually found, has two prongs.<br/><br/>Two prongs does not make a right. Please, please, don't make another one."

"joshbarton15","4","18","38","26 May 2017"," The ship has well and truly sailed for Pirates of the Caribbean
","Pirates of the Caribbean has done very well for itself, considering it's a franchise that came about from the popularity of a theme park ride at Disneyland. Taking plenty of money at the box-office over the four films so far, the fifth film, Dead Men Tell No Tales or Salazar's Revenge here in the UK (annoyingly) has been unleashed in cinemas. Could it provide the franchise with a much needed energy boost after the underwhelming On Stranger Tides?<br/><br/>When Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) escapes from the Devil's Triangle, he sets about getting revenge on Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the man who caused Salazar and his crew to perish and remain cursed. With the help of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), Jack Sparrow must search the seas for the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that gives whoever is in possession power over the seas.<br/><br/>I don't really no why but I went into Salazar's Revenge with a sense of optimism that it would provide the franchise its best film since The Curse of the Black Pearl some fourteen years ago. Unfortunately the result is a film that feels as uninspired as the previous entry. I suppose the warning signs of franchise fatigue were there but this should have been a much better film than it turned out.<br/><br/>Back when Pirates of the Caribbean began, it was a simple film that blew people away with how entertaining and fresh it all felt. As the franchise has gone on though, the films have become weighed down with too many plot points and a feeling of staleness that makes for a more dreary experience as a viewer. <br/><br/>Where Salazar's Revenge makes its biggest mistake is with the narrative. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty simple story however, they try to chuck in subplots that just feel so forced that it doesn't allow the audience to connect emotionally with either the characters or the narrative properly. Decisions like that always feel to me as if they made them as they were making the film and would have been better left to remain as an idea.<br/><br/>A major strength of the franchise has been the stellar visual effects and, while they are still mostly impressive here, there are certain points where it looks unfinished and cheap. Salazar himself just looks ghastly in comparison with the magnificent work on Davy Jones earlier in the franchise. They do aid the action sequences immensely mind, even if there is only one really imaginative sequence that comes right at the start of the film. Just a shame that they don't make the most of having zombie sharks and that the finale is really dull.<br/><br/>One of the other major strengths of these films is the riveting score that has accompanied each and every film. That is no different in Salazar's Revenge as Geoff Zanelli composes a score that captures the swashbuckling essence of the film rather well. I will always hum along to the main theme as it plays over the end credits.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Salazar's Revenge sees Johnny Depp once again lazily play the character that has done so much for his career. It doesn't help that Sparrow is now written as a man who just falls over and screams all of the time but Depp couldn't look more unenthused if he tried. I can't even say Geoffrey Rush was a highlight in this one because even he looks as if he's given up on the film. Javier Bardem makes a valiant effort to make it feel as if there is actually something at stake in this film with his villainous turn as Salazar however, it's nothing that will be remembered.<br/><br/>I was actually surprised at how much I took to the new characters portrayed by Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. I haven't really seen much of either before but I found myself more interested in what their respective characters were getting up to. Fourteen years ago I would have said Jack Sparrow is a character I can't wait to see more but now I wouldn't mind if they got rid of him totally. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both return a full ten years after their last appearances as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Bloom getting a little more screen time whereas Knightley feels a little shoehorned in at the end, which feels a bit disrespectful seeing as she was one of the main characters of the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is luckily not the worst film of the franchise, an honour still held by On Stranger Tides. What it is though is a lacklustre effort that shows the world that the ship has well and truly sailed for this particular franchise."
"shawneofthedead","7","24","54","24 May 2017"," A flawed but refreshing – and, hopefully, final – return to the high seas.
","For the past decade or so, the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has been living, lumbering proof of Hollywood at its most excessive and profit-oriented. It's hard not to look at the three films following the sublime Curse Of The Black Pearl as shameless money- making opportunities – the budgets grew bigger and the action sequences more extravagant, sure, but the plots also became more convoluted and forgettable. <br/><br/>One would be forgiven for assuming that Salazar's Revenge (or: Dead Men Tell No Tales), the fifth and purportedly final Pirates installment, is every bit as bloated, clunky and (largely) free of artistic merit. Surprisingly, that's not the case. While Salazar's Revenge does suffer from some of the franchise's most pervasive problems, it's a fun, perfectly decent blockbuster that remembers to add some very welcome heart and soul back into its story and characters. <br/><br/>The film opens on Henry Turner (Thwaites), now a young man determined to free his dad Will (Bloom) from his cursed servitude as the ghost captain of The Flying Dutchman. Henry's quest prompts him to seek the help of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as he hunts for the Trident of Poseidon, the magical MacGuffin that can undo the many nautical curses plaguing the high seas. Along the way, Henry's fate becomes entangled with that of astronomer extraordinaire Carina Smyth (Scodelario), who is the key to deciphering the map that points the true way to the Trident.<br/><br/>Matters are complicated, of course, by the film's top-billed, Oscar- winning antagonists. Salazar (Bardem), a ghostly menace trapped in the moment of his grisly death, rises from the depths to exact his titular vengeance upon Captain Jack. He is helped (and occasionally hindered) by Hector Barbossa (Rush), whose complicated relationship with Jack – teetering as it always does on the knife-edge between friend and foe – has been the unmitigated highlight of even the worst films in the franchise.<br/><br/>That's a lot of plot and character to work with, and Salazar's Revenge doesn't always succeed in tying all the threads together. Setting all the characters on an inevitable collision course takes ages. The sprawling action sequences too often seem to forget when to call it quits. Jeff Nathanson's script, while sharper and more coherent than its predecessors, tends to get mired in laddish moments and gags that aren't even that funny the first time around: from the pirates' amusement with Carina declaring herself a 'horologist', to an awkward beachside wedding that's as uncomfortable for audiences to watch as it must have been for the actors to shoot.<br/><br/>What the film gets right is its decision to return Captain Jack to supporting-character status. That's not to say he doesn't have plenty of screen-time. As he has done since 2003, the perennially half- drunk Jack shambles throughout the film, oozing his trademark insouciant charm as he tries to make his crew pay for the privilege of serving and saving him. But Jack is not called upon to carry the emotional weight of the film here, as he has been for the past few films – especially Stranger Tides, a peculiar misfire on almost all counts. Instead, he's allowed to do what he does best: steal most of the scenes he sashays through.<br/><br/>As a result, the film makes a real effort to focus on its newcomers, and is all the better for it. Carina, in particular, is an intriguing creation. While clearly set up as a love interest for Henry, that's not all she is: her hunt for the Trident is entirely her own, tied to a storyline that isn't romantic in the least. Smart and determined (more so than all of the pirates she encounters), she fights or thinks her way out of tough spots and never lingers in the background, damsel-in-distressing. Her relationships with everyone she meets – from Henry to Jack and Barbossa – form the film's emotional core, anchored by Scodelario's fun, feisty performance. <br/><br/>That said, it's Rush who remains the franchise's ace in the hole. From dastardly villain to reluctant ally, Barbossa has enjoyed a character trajectory that can only be pulled off by an actor of Rush's calibre. Thankfully, he's given excellent material to work with in Salazar's Revenge. There's a surprising amount of heartbreak in Barbossa's share of the story, and Rush sells it all beautifully. In just a look or a twist of his gnarled features, Rush communicates the soul of the man long ago buried beneath the swish and swagger of the pirate Barbossa became. <br/><br/>There's no denying that the Pirates franchise has lost its way over the past decade. It tried desperately to expand the mythology of a one-and-done nautical escapade, and missed the mark more often than not. Salazar's Revenge should have been the final nail in the coffin. And yet, it's defied the odds (and myriad delays) to be the most enjoyable Pirates outing since the very first. On top of lush seascapes and jaw-dropping oceanic rescues (including one that stretches to the very bottom of the sea), the film's emotional stakes have been raised – successfully. If this is truly the last we'll see of the characters we first met 14 years ago, it's a good way to go out."

"mark.waltz","4","10","19","10 June 2017"," Sequels don't fool audiences.
","It's all about the cash, and for the long running ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, it's time to retire it. That doesn't seem likely however based on Johnny Depp's last line in this latest entry, trimmed to just over 2 hours yet feeling every bit the 2 1/2 listed as the running time. The premise seems great, although enough back story has been provided in earlier films that explained much of the character's histories.<br/><br/>Depp is so comfortable in this part that he could do it sleepwalking. He's just as charming and foppish as ever, best when making comical asides about the ridiculousness going on rather than simply being on the outside of the plot looking in. Yes, he's established as being the subject of revenge by several characters, but the real story involves Jack's old enemy Captain Barbarosa (a much subtler Geoffrey Rush) and the vengeance seeking Captain Salazar (a heavily made-up Javier Badhem who has several agendas and is determined to reach his goals no matter who he has to kill to get there.<br/><br/>There's the underlying story of a young man out to end the curse put on his doomed ghostly father (trapped at the bottom of the sea) and a young lady of science accused of being a witch. Of course, this leads to a romantic relationship, obvious from the time he has to hold onto her behind for a long period of time as she struggles to get out of a noose. At the same time, Depp's doing somersaults with a faulty guillotine and ends up with a wooden sword proof vest. Funny, yes. Relevant to the plot, no.<br/><br/>This holds the attention with bemused eye rolling for 3/4 of the film, but goes way overboard in a watery abyss where all enemies come together and all secrets come out. The special effects are impressive, often noisy, but after a while, the absurdities just get to be too much. Some Ray Harruhsusen type creatures briefly get some attention (ghostly sharks, the ship's hood ornaments come to life), but it's just more of the same, rushed out for box office gold without regards to script, substance or all around interesting characters."

","With the sequels being a mix bag for me I went this movie thinking it is going to be another silly pirates movie and honestly I am shocked to say this was a thrill ride. If you are expecting a over the top Jack Sparrow performance then here you go cause Depp doesn't disappoint. i'll like to say that in order to enjoy this movie you must watch all of the movies in recent time in order to understand this film. if you are judging Pirates 5 by memories of the sequels then you'll probably hate this movie. let's face it the pirate movies has been debated as good or bad over the years but regardless of that these movies always seem fun to watch. If you are a TRUE pirates fan then you are going to enjoy this movie and it's conclusion. if you are not a pirate fan then you'll won't. again this movie is a like a special award for Pirates fans who really love the series and it's really good. the newcomers in the films are good especially Brenton who plays Henry. You can tell Javier is having fun playing Salazar and Geoffrey kills it as Barbossa again as always & Kaya is performance is awesome. so the way I can sum it all is that you'll love this movie for what it is, if you are a TRUE pirates fan of course. the soundtrack to Pirates 5 is epic. stay alert when you here the pirates theme. It's a good summer blockbuster film to watch and won't be disappointed. don't be worried if nobody else didn't like it. what matters is you the TRUE pirates fans to go in and enjoy this epic ride of Pirates 5. certainly watching it again instead of Baywatch. 9 out of 10 is my score.

","Let me start off by stating, I nodded off during Stranger Tides. The movie was a complete waste of my time and it besmirched a very good franchise. I refused to complete the movie till date. If something takes that much of effort to watch, I'd really rather go put my efforts into anything else. <br/><br/>But with this movie? They hit their usual stride again. Fast paced, good action scenes. I think I subconsciously knew that if they managed to incorporate Hans Zimmer phenomenal score from the trilogy into this movie, in a way that satisfied me, I would give it 8 on 10 ( I keep my promises). But the movie did more than deliver and stay true to the original trilogy. It brought back the feelings of old. I wont give away spoilers but I was very happy to see old faces return to the screen. They have also laid down good groundwork for the new generation of characters. I wouldn't mind sticking about to see how this soft reboot gets along with out the original characters. <br/><br/>Do watch, you will be pleasantly surprised."

Sparrow and Henry get help from a young female astronomer Carina Smyth who claims to have the map to the Trident.<br/><br/>Captain Salazar and his undead band of sailors are after Captain Sparrow for revenge, Captain Barbossa also returns initially being forced to help Salazar.<br/><br/>The plot is a mish mash of Salazar wanting his revenge and the search for a mythical item that everyone wants. In many ways it retreads the first film and also has elements of the sequels with elaborate comic action sequences, heavy use of CGI and some downright silliness.<br/><br/>Thankfully the running time is shorter but it still feels bloated and boring.

"rdwvazmbx","Null","3","4","11 September 2017"," Mediocre in all aspects, even where it ought to shine
","This movie was frankly quite disappointing, a half hearted and soulless re-tread of the elements that made Pirates a hit in the first place. That's not even to mention the problems with pacing, overall series consistency, and frankly dismal writing which tanked the performance of actors we know can do far better (i.e Javier Bardem). <br/><br/>However that has all already been said, what hasn't really been said is that even where the film has no real reason not to be great, it somehow manages to mess up. Specifically the CGI, which is just used terribly. That's not to say it isn't expensive CGI, I'm sure it's some of the best money can buy, but as the old saying goes ""you can't buy sense"". Sense is still something badly needed in the use of special effects, and the film demonstrates again and again whoever was in charge simply didn't have it, or just didn't care to. Instead of focusing on only a few really good uses or only where it would shine, the screen is awash with CGI. There's CGI in the foreground, CGI middlegrounds, CGI backgrounds, CGI enemies, CGI on the actors, CGI in place of actors. It's everywhere and more often than not it's not used well. <br/><br/>For instance, often the film composites physical props against CGI ones, and the contrast is somewhat jarring. The costume work and the props have wonderful attention to detail going on, but the CGI just doesn't quite measure up when they are side by side. Other times there's a CGI middle ground which just looks off, mostly in places they don't expect you to be looking like during action scenes the quality of middle ground CGI really degrades. Occasionally there was a scene or two where they used CGI for something incredibly trivial like a simple prop causing it to move in an uncanny way. There were moments where they used CGI and for whatever reason it just looked off, like the zombie shark scene where the sharks almost looked like they were taken from one of those low budged shark themed Sci-fi channel movies instead of modeled and detailed by professionals. One final example of what in my opinion is poor use of CGI is the main baddie the undead pirate hunter Salizar, who's hair is supposed to look as if it where moving in the water, but all it reminded me of is what happens in a video game when the soft body hair physics go on the fritz. It didn't help that at times it just really didn't get composited onto him exactly right and seemed to sort of be hovering near his head like some vengeful undead kelp which just happened to attach itself to the capitán's head. <br/><br/>Now I'm not categorically against CGI as some are, I think it can do wonders, and it's not like it's all bad. Most of the locations in the film like the sea and most of the islands were done in CGI and it's quite well done. The water effects and the island near the end of the movie were pretty nice too. The problem is the majority of the use of CGI in the film is not done well. <br/><br/>I'll admit, for the average viewer it probably doesn't matter at all, but if you are like me and you appreciate good use of special effects you will find this film disappointing even in this respect."
"marc5477","5","3","4","7 September 2017"," Poor character development left a hallow shell
","The premise was fine, the special effects were good, and the flash backs were interesting however the film suffered from poor directing. The scenes simply didn't flow well despite being filled with interesting tidbits about Jacks history and the possible consequences of the ending. I think the big problem was character development. In the 1st movie, the characters had a lot of quality scenes whereas in this one they had equal time but the scenes were not great or memorable. For example, in the 1st movie we had that great fight scene between Jack and Will filled with comedy and purpose. In this one, the only scene Henry had that was remotely interesting was at the beginning when tried to locate his dad but the problem is that the scene was simply dumb. He basically committed suicide simply to say hi to dad. It was not reasonable and it certainly did not make me like Henry in any way like I liked Will in the 1st. Elizabeth Swan also had a better story than Carina who was largely a wimpy version of Elizabeth and although she is supposedly smart, she did not come off as such as her only purpose in the entire movie is to point a ship in a direction and that is all. She served no other purpose and her romance with Henry was not convincing. Lastly, and possibly the biggest problem, Jack was not funny... actually, I cant remember a funny scene in this movie which is a huge let down. They tried to crack a few jokes here and there but they were not good. I also felt like Jack played practically no part in the movie aside from making it things harder than they should have been. In fact, this movie did not need Jack Sparrow at all. He didn't have any smart tricks up his sleeves, nor did he contribute much of anything and Salazars hate of Jack felt as empty as Henry and Carina's romance. It simply made no sense.<br/><br/>Overall, id say its an average movie. Nothing worth watching more than once, and certainly not worth the price of admission but its better than straight to TV movies and certainly better than movies like the Ninja Turtles debacle or the lousy Transformer movies."

Beautiful landscapes and colours. Awesome effects. Without a doubt, Disney has nailed CGI and post- processing.<br/><br/>Cons: 1) The story is part predictable and otherwise boring. The first 50 or so minutes represent a mixture of things that we have seen in previous instalments, pure insult. The rest of the film boils down to yet another oh-so-powerful pirate artefact, but one so uninteresting that one's attention and intellect, already numb from the first half of the movie, simply walk out. 2) The acting is altogether terrible, not a single cast member performs memorably. Johnny Depp has lost all charm and wittiness, Sparrow's lines are painfully flat, goofy, and cringy. Not once did he induce even just a chuckle. Geoffrey Rush equally feels like a mere shadow of his former self. Javier Bardem's character fails to make an impression as well. The two newbies Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are OK-ish but not great.<br/><br/>Technological competence cannot compensate for lack of story, lack of direction, and lack of acting.

Thus, we get bloated action sequences that attempt to one-up the previous Pirates movies, but which suffer from the same deplorable ""Too much of a good thing"" that now plagues the Fast and Furious franchise.<br/><br/>It isn't as bad as the previous outing but it shows that it is struggling. Javier Bardem tries his best as the villain of the piece and, as I mentioned, being one of the ""dead"" characters in the movie, stands out from the rest by virtue of that fact. But the others...<br/><br/>I'm also unsure if Orlando Bloom just didn't want to be in this movie. Was he strong-armed contractually into what is little more than a cameo role along with Keira Knightley, or did the writers think that leaving those two characters out and bringing in two almost identical replacements would be a good idea? Will the new pair replace them in future outings? Are Bloom and Knightley just done with the franchise? Is this the Pirates equivalent of Star Trek The Next Generation? <br/><br/>If so, then swapping out two of the old characters for near identical replacements and making up some hokum to tie them into the story is a real slap in the face to the franchise's fans. Hey everyone! We heard you like a young couple in your Pirates film, so we put a young couple in to replace the young couple we used to have that grew old and demanded too much money/couldn't be bothered anymore/saw how bad the movies were becoming. Enjoy! <br/><br/>It is all rather cynical and obvious. They should have stopped after the third film and just left it as it was. But no, they churned out a fourth (awful) movie, and now a fifth. But don't despair! The end credits not-so subtly promise a sixth outing, so maybe that will be good...right? Right? <br/><br/>Okay, enough disappointment! I'm off to watch The Dark Tower next! That'll be a big improvement, right? Right? <br/><br/>SUMMARY: Tired rehash that has tired actors tiredly rehashing their tired characters. Tired plot. Tired story and tired action. Just tired everything, really. Only watch if you are really, desperately, tired."
"fudgepacker-12883","4","4","6","23 June 2017"," The same old Pirates - just way older
","I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot. Since the original Pirates of the Caribbean- and even the second- I haven't felt that sense of wonder and adventure and intrigue that really brought me to enjoy and love the movies. In Dead Men Tell No Tales I felt there was no sense of mystery or intrigue. Right from the beginning you know Jack Sparrow will be drunk, the Pirates will want gold, and that there will be silly trials and tribulations along the way. I essentially knew what the ending would be half an hour in, so I was really just sitting in the cinema, bored, and waiting for the inevitable (clichéd and drawn-out) ending to happen. I really would like to add something positive, but I genuinely can't think of anything."
"DuskShadow","6","4","6","23 June 2017"," Turn away and hoist The Sails: Dead Plots Tell Poor Tales.
","Once I saw Bardem in a trailer, I knew it would be cheesier than Fondue. Most any movie can give itself away almost entirely with just a 30 second clip before release. And any veteran movie goer can gauge a stinker ahead of time. But family movie day is not to be sacrificed to personal enjoyment, so the show went on. The acting of Bardem, trying to be a scary undead ethereal pirate hunter was about as scary as Time Curry in It. I wasn't amused.<br/><br/>The Pirates 'del Caribbe' franchise has been milking the public for almost 15 years, and there is so little to inspire since the 3rd movie ,which is where it all should have ended, that I have to take a spit upon the direction the last two films have gone.<br/><br/>Not only are pirates one of the top lucrative old world professions that people of all ages gush over ( including ninjas and gunslingers) but with a huge library of myths to call upon encompassing magical curses, enchantments and blessing endowed by the gods themselves, I wonder why more wasn't done..<br/><br/>There's so much tip toeing about the effect that ancient beings of power had upon the world of men, especially on the high seas, that there should be no lack of possibilities to throw in peoples faces, without seeming repetitive. Nothing in film has so failed to bring it after dangling a carrot of supernatural goodness in front of me as the Caribbean film series.<br/><br/>Oh yes heres Depp as a drunk Jack Sparrow again, very familiar but either the man was actually drinking on set, or he really thought slurring all his words for the first hour would be enjoyable to people. He was difficult to understand and likely was actually imbibing alcohol in between scenes. Its no method anymore, this is the 5th film, its clichéd. Then there's Bardems portrayal of an endlessly suffering burning pitch of rage and smoke that was nauseating to witness. Adding his already heavy accent, his character had a mouth full of nonstop dripping black ectoplasm that made listening to him nigh impossible. Like baseball player with a chew addiction on roids with no outlet. <br/><br/>The premise is so unoriginal by this point with two young people looking for treasure, but this time the gals gotta be the rare bookworm type, yet without glasses, antisocial tendencies and skittishness that a woman like that would have had in olden days. And the son of Turner, yet another example of someone, paired with the female lead, that have daddy issues. This franchise could have concluded years ago with the trilogy, skipping the trash that was the 4th film entirely. <br/><br/>Even for a movie as long as it was, to fit everything into it, it was hard to take a breather and absorb things due to the speed at which things flew by. Either events were too predictable or immature in their humor without depth, or there was some familiar element from previous films to fool people into thinking the plot was thickening instead of burning itself out. With all the veiled hints at magic ties to ancient pantheons and promises of godly interventions or battles, I was far too disappointed with this movie to give it anything more than an average 5 out of 10 ."
"jaapeelman","5","4","6","17 June 2017"," Nonsense movie without the witty Jack
","The other Pirate-movies were not really good movies but nice to watch due to the special-effects and the funny Johnny Depp as Jack. In this movie it is all about a dead captain who lost his ship, crew and life due to a special ship's manoeuvre initiated by Jack. A very stupid story, even for the Pirates-movies, without any logic and also no suspense. Jack is not very funny but most of the time drunk and easily trades his special compass for a bottle of booze. If you have nothing to do watch this movie at home with some beers so the nonsense of this movie won't bother you too much."
"achsaphillippi8","4","4","6","16 June 2017"," Not the comeback it could have been.
","After the monstrous atrocity that was Pirates 4, Disney decides to laugh it off and give us another Pirates movie. Unfortunately, the only real compliment I can give this film is the fact that it tried to ignore the fourth movie ever happened as best as it could. I can tell they tried...to some degree. But it falls short of the fun and adventure of the first film (and dare I say the second or third.)<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a film in which dead men do indeed tell tales. Tales of a young CGI Jack Sparrow outsmarting a Spanish naval officer and causing his ship to blow up somehow. Jack Sparrow is back, this time in the role he is supposed to be in these films: NOT the main character and NOT a hero (one of the great faults of the last film). This time the story follows Will and Elizabeth Turner's son Henry and a spunky (and annoyingly arrogant) young woman who is smart and knows everything. They join Jack and his small crew to look for the trident of Poseidon.<br/><br/>But evil undead Javier Bardem wants revenge on Jack for leading him to his death all those years ago, so he chases after them with a monster ship that bites other ships and zombie sharks. These two things sound a lot cooler than they really are. Oh, and little Henry Turner wants the trident to cure his daddy of Davy Jones Syndrome and there's something about the girl's father.<br/><br/>I think the main problem I had with the film was the action. The strongest aspects of the Pirates movies are the action scenes, but boy did they screw it up here. Every single scene is either way too dark to see anything, or far too bright to see anything. There's never a comfortable in-between. There were several instances in the film where I was squinting at the darkness, trying to piece together the scene in my mind, only for a shaft of light to break out and fry my retinas. The camera is so shaky and the editing is so choppy and abrupt that it's impossible to process all the cool pirate action the movie promised.<br/><br/>The story is boring and the characters are uninteresting. They tried to give us a replacement for Will and Elizabeth (not ultra interesting, either, but at least they were somewhat likable) with their son (who is as boring as a brick wall) and a new character, some chick who people think is a witch because she's really good with astronomy and smart people stuff. She was incredibly irritating, constantly bragging about how much smarter she was than those BIG DUMB MEN she was around. It was clear they were trying REALLY hard to make her a strong character, but it was so blatant that it became irritating. <br/><br/>The whole movie just felt like it was going through the motions: like it had a basic checklist of things that were in the previous movies that people liked and trying to shove it all in there. These things include:<br/><br/>-Jack Sparrow is a ladies man <br/><br/>-Jack Sparrow is funny and drunk <br/><br/>-Undead pirate man who hates Jack and wants to kill him <br/><br/>-Captain Barbossa <br/><br/>-Will and Elizabeth types that serve as a contrast to Jack and his behavior<br/><br/>-a mystical object the characters race to find before the bad guys <br/><br/>-sea battles <br/><br/>-monsters (i.e. zombie sharks) <br/><br/>-mean and pompous British dudes<br/><br/>-Jack Sparrow is a funny guy, isn't he? <br/><br/>-elaborate escape sequences<br/><br/>-crazy supernatural phenomenon related to the sea <br/><br/>-explosions <br/><br/>-swords<br/><br/>-slapstick humor (involving Jack Sparrow) <br/><br/>In listing all these attributes, it becomes clear that the filmmakers were trying WAY too hard. They were clearly desperate to recapture the lighthearted fun of the previous movies, but all they've accomplished is making one big mess of a movie. The movie is shot poorly, the humor feels tired and lazy, and the characters range from bland to irritating. Even the return of our beloved Jack Sparrow feels a bit underwhelming.<br/><br/>I think the whole point I'm trying to make is that this movie doesn't have much of a reason to exist. They should have stopped making Pirates movies a long time ago, but after the stupendous screw up that was On Stranger Tides, I guess Disney wanted to prove they could make a fun Pirate adventure again that didn't suck.<br/><br/>For all its faults, I can still say it's better than On Stranger Tides, but it's still so far beneath the enjoy-ability of the first two or three movies that I can't even recommend seeing it just for the sake of seeing another Pirates movie. It just didn't leave much of an emotional impact, and I can't say that watching it was even that fun. It's not the worst movie ever made, and it's not the worst Pirates movie ever made. But it's so bland and poorly shot that I don't think it's worth seeing. Yes, Jack is back, but who really cares anymore? We don't need any more Pirates movies."
"jtindahouse","5","18","41","24 May 2017"," The final quarter kills a good film (once again)
","Here's how every 'Pirates of the Caribbean' sequel seems to go: it starts off fun, light-hearted and clever, then as things go along it becomes more and more convoluted until it reaches the point where it becomes so self-loving and obsessed with it's own cleverness that it is nothing short of unwatchable. Unfortunately 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is no different, however it is better than some of the previous installments.<br/><br/>Unless you somehow have managed to care enough to follow the mythology that the stories follow, then you (like me) are here for Johnny Depp playing 'Jack Sparrow'. You're happy for there to be a story and for other characters to have their time in the spotlight, but at the end of the day you've paid your $20 to see Depp. That's why the last quarter of these films is always so disappointing, because his character almost always becomes nothing more than a chess piece in the extravagant action sequences.<br/><br/>The first 3/4 of the film, where Depp is allowed to do what he does best, are admittedly very good. Almost all of his jokes land and the film keeps a good pace avoiding being bogged down by storytelling. Javier Bardem is the other bright light in this film. His performance is genuinely scary at times. These films are incredibly frustrating because they truly could be great, but instead always end up sinking into mediocrity."

"eichler2","6","7","13","31 May 2017"," If you liked the first three and want more of the same, here it is
","A few of the reviews I read before going to see this fifth (and supposedly final) Pirates movie basically boiled down to ""well, at least it's better than the last one"". I don't know, am I the only one who liked ""On Stranger Tides"" because it at least tried to do something different with the franchise? This new entry just tosses the soundtrack and best bits of the first three films in a blender, adds a new zombie bad guy and a couple youthful new romantic leads and hits the puree button. They even re-use the ""bad guys can walk through the bars of a prison cell"" effect from one of the earlier movies.<br/><br/>Yeah, some of the special effects are spectacular, there are battles at sea, lots of stuff blows up, the villains are creepy and some of the comic relief is funny (and some is painfully unfunny), but watching this movie it was hard to shake the feeling that I'd seen it all before. It's pretty much paint-by-numbers, even down to Javier Bardem's bad guy reciting the film's title line just before it appears on screen. Even Depp's Captain Jack seemed largely uninspired.<br/><br/>On the positive side, many of the characters you've come to know from the first four films return for this one. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner shows up to help set up and resolve the plot, and even Keira Knightley makes a very brief appearance. At over two hours long I was afraid the film would drag in spots, but it moved along so quickly that I was actually a little surprised when they reached the big finale.<br/><br/>The plot, without getting into spoilers, revolves around Will's son Henry who is determined to break the curse on his father and rescue him from the Flying Dutchman. In order to do so, he has to retrieve a powerful, magical item that is also being sought by a brilliant young woman with a mysterious map that her unknown father left to her. It soon turns out that they need Jack Sparrow's help, and of course that drags Captain Barbossa into the fray. Opposing them all is the undead Captain Salazar, who bears a grudge against Sparrow and will not rest until he's dead.<br/><br/>There's a very short and unnecessary cameo by Paul McCartney as Jack's uncle Jack. He tells a lame joke, there's a single off-screen laugh as if even the filmmakers realized how pointless the scene was, and then the plot moves on.<br/><br/>One bit where the film really went off the rails was a flashback scene in which we learn why Salazar hates Sparrow so intensely. Instead of hiring a younger actor to play Jack, they digitally de-aged Depp and raised his voice about an octave. The result is just...creepy. And entirely unconvincing.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was just the theater where I saw the movie, but the picture was really dark for a lot of the film and the sound mix was terrible. The explosions and music were super-loud and often drowned out the dialog. I'm glad I didn't see the 3D version because I've heard that's even murkier-looking. At the rate movies are going, in a couple decades the theater experience will be staring at a black screen for two hours while being deafened by a continuous roar.<br/><br/>At any rate, if you loved the earlier films in the Pirates franchise and want another dose, or if you're just looking for a big, mindless spectacle with some bits of humor, this movie fits the bill. I can't say I really disliked it, but it also didn't make me sad that it's supposed to be the last one. Or is it? Stick around for a final scene after the credits that hints at an unlikely sequel. Or maybe it's just meant as some weird sort of joke. I heard people discussing it in the lobby and no one quite knew what to make of it."

","Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't rewrite the rulebook for the franchise or the genre as a whole, and is wholly predictable from start to finish, but the likable characters—Thwaites and Scodelario have more natural presence and mutual chemistry than Bloom and Knightley— creative action set pieces, and Depp finally being put in his place in the franchise creates a fun ride that's instantly unforgettable. It works well enough as a stand-alone, swashbuckling comedic spectacle, thanks to the terrific performances, some ingenious practical effects, impressive CGI and a steady diet of PG-13 dialogue. There were couple of Scenes which were unnecessary (like where Keira comes out of nowhere in the final scene). Otherwise, the movie was overall good but can't match the goodness of the First 2 Installments of the franchise<br/><br/>My Rating : 3.5/5"

I enjoyed every second and would thoroughly recommend it. I took a 12 year old girl and a 73 year old lady and they both absolutely loved it.

"fielbail14","8","7","14","2 June 2017"," Back to it's Best
","The fifth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise sees Captain Jack back chasing after the Treasure of Poseidon in a quest which is very likable and catching. Many reviews have been crucifying this film for numerous aspects; however there is a lot to love. The story-line is very structured to such an extent that it is similar to the original film in the sense everything is set up for a reason. This is something the fourth film seemed to lack and saw it head in one direction without much context. Nevertheless, the adventure aspects are great and so too are the snaps of humor seen throughout the film, which are somewhat less than what was seen in the last film which was perceived to be more a comedy. The CGI aspects of the film are also very effective and entertaining, with bits and pieces of the human body missing from each ghost pirate character, as well as the action sequences to be very entertaining. The action sequences are quite thrilling and the acting is fine, boosted by a star performance from Geoffrey Rush portraying Captain Barbossa, which is now a wealthy pirate at the head of his very own fleet. <br/><br/>Returning aspects of the film also lead for it to be very entertaining. Both Orlando Bloom and Keira Kightley return, although they are in the film for two or so minutes, they create a grasping and cliff-hanger like effect to the film. Also, by introducing their son Henry Turner gives an enhanced impact making both aspects of these past characters to be rolled into one. The plots twist of having Carina turning out to be Barbossa's daughter also created an emotional effect that finishes the movie off with Geoffrey Rush sacrificing himself for his daughter. Although a heartfelt moment, the death of one of the characters was needed, as most of the characters have followed all 5 movies and without it, it would have been dragging the franchise on.<br/><br/>The only criticisms of this film are that the directional choices, specifically the choice of camera shots are sometimes poor, allowing viewers not to get the full extent of what is happening and not being able to have the desired impact. The only other problem is that of Johnny Depp's characterization of Captain Jack Sparrow. In the past films we've all know the character of Jack Sparrow to be cunning and witty along with often being partially drunk. However, in this film the trickery and wittiness were not as prominent as what they have been in the past. The acting on Depp's behalf led to Jack Sparrow to act more than just a little drunk, more so being very drunk for most of the film. Nevertheless, as this 5th installment is 6 years since the last and 14 from the first of course Depp is going to lose some touch with the character, in regards to how he is played and portrayed. <br/><br/>All in all this film has taken us back to the origins of what really a pirate's movie is all about, the adventure. By-passing some minor problems this film is very likable and is a step up from the fourth movie which was probably needed."
"blackmamba99971","10","7","14","1 June 2017"," An excellent ending to the story
","Well the gang is altogether again in the face of evil. This time on the heels of the pirate lords is a once decorated admiral of the Spanish fleet who hunts down said pirates but does not provide mercy in the face of judgment. Played by Javier Bardem the cursed man Salazar becomes death incarnate as he tracks down Jack Sparrow in order to settle his avenging nature. Yet stuck in the middle are two new heroes. one who is searching for an answer to break the curse of his father Will Turner. Henry the son teams up with Corrine Smith as they try to find Poseidon's Trident. The trident itself is said to hold all curses of the ocean, and sea bearing pirates like Will turner who is the Captain of the Flying Dutchman. If Henry or Corrine can either wield or break the trident then every single curse shall be lifted from all blackened men.<br/><br/>It is a race against time as Salazar, Barbarossa, Sparrow, and the crews span cross the wide open oceans to find it but as with all stories of pirates it tends to be complex as Corrine begins to realize just how important her life has become when she learns of a deep secret about she, and Barbarossa. This movie really satisfied my hunger for action films. The entire series has been incredibly successful over the last ten years albeit for the prior movie Pirates of the Caribbean On stranger Tides. It was the only episode, which did not do too well with the audiences around the world despite how much it made.<br/><br/>Dead men tell no tales held me captivated from start to finish. Great actors, same crude humour which we all love, and a well done story to allow us the viewer into a bit of Barbarossa's past, and who he was as well as Salazar. Everything fit. Music, spills, chills, ancient tales of mythical gods, and down right fun for everyone. Pirates of the Caribbean has been a fan favourite since the first movie Curse of the Black Pearl, which has stood the test of time. I highly recommend this wonderful romp for all ages so that children around the globe can show their appreciation with one word... Arrrrr!"

","I don't know where to begin with, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is just gets going on forever but anyone thinks that the previous installment (On Stranger Tides) is all time low, then this latest installment is looking very very bad.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is very convoluted and complicating, makes us thinking that it gets boring, bloated, and worst of all mind-draining that would leave us to tear this movie into pieces. Also had to forget to stating that most of the characters particularly the new ones had half-baked qualities and even the love subplot is underdeveloped. It even leave us to think that some of members of the cast with the likes of Depp to act badly just to get a paycheck!<br/><br/>Second is that, although members of the cast did a solid performance Johnny Depp has his different side of the story. We always know that Captain Jack Sparrow will remain iconic to Depp but the point is that he's lost the charm, wit, and humor from the first movie that we come to love (the curse of the black pearl) and really he acting like a mascot. Clearly it's really a bad sign that Johnny Depp's star power is now diminishing.<br/><br/>But this movie still have redeemable qualities like Javier Bardem's performance as Captain Salazar which make the performance as frightening and intimidating and some of the visual effects placed on Salazar, the crew and even the ghost sharks that makes it fascinating but somehow bland."

"swedenshell","3","7","15","1 June 2017"," Overall
","To be honest, I'm giving such a low rating because I don't appreciate it when companies think they can ride on the success of a franchise with a completely different director and try to make a continuation of something someone else did, and NOT pay attention to the small details of their work. It's both lazy and insulting to the one who put a lot of effort and time into making those specific characters have depth. <br/><br/>The graphics, unfortunately, is the really the only praise I can give for this movie. A little bit more praise would be that I think Salazar was a well-rounded antagonist in this film, but there are a few things that I have issues with as for him over all, and most of it has to do with bad writing. The first thing that comes to mind is that, if Salazar was the one that gave Jack his ""Sparrow"" name, how did everyone else hear about it, if him and his crew were cursed to the Devil's Triangle and couldn't leave? Another would be that his death was far too sudden. As the main antagonist, I feel that it should have had more meaning. On a similar note, I want to know, how did lifting the curse not kill him? Because half of his head was gone, and most of his men got blown away (hence why they were missing a few pieces of themselves).<br/><br/>Another thing; that was the most open end ever. <br/><br/>Now I want to touch on some of the answered frequently asked questions. First, Tia Dalma giving Jack the compass in a barter. I think it's a little stretched to say that Jack lost it and had to barter to get it back, ESPECIALLY since if that were the case, this whole issue with Salazar would have happened then, instead of now. And Will. I can handle the idea that he's turning ""fishy"" because he's behind, but then I don't feel like that would be the only development. However, my main concern was what was up with the crew? I feel that money was the reason that the rest of the crew wasn't included, but I don't like the fact that the rest of the Dutchman's men were a part of the ship again. <br/><br/>Why was Jack's history that was revealed in the third movie completely obliterated? This is where I feel like this movie should be taken as a slight alternate universe at this point. Because if you pay attention in At World's End, Jack and Beckett have a conversation. This conversation states that Jack was employed by Beckett to deliver cargo. Jack states that ""people aren't cargo"", and the movie itself hints at what all happened, but here's the canon explanation: <br/><br/>Jack worked for Beckett for about a year, and after he comes back empty handed from an errand that Beckett sent him on, he demands that Jack transport some slaves to another area. However, Jack ends up setting the slaves free and Beckett hunts him down, burns the hull of the Wicked Wench and brands Jack as a Pirate for ""stealing"" his slaves. In an attempt to save his beloved Wicked Wench, Jack dives in after her and instead, is picked up by Davy Jones. He strikes a deal with Jones for his ship and 10 years at sea as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, at the cost of his soul and 100 years of service at the end of the 10 years. Jones agrees and raises the Wench, of which Jack renames, due to her now black hull, as the Black Pearl. <br/><br/>This is how Jack became a pirate, however, in this new movie, he was given the title after the original captain dies in the battle between them and Salazar. This also ruffles my feathers, because Jack wasn't a first mate. There was no real reason for him to become the next captain. In all honesty, I feel like this whole scene was created, because they wanted to show off their technology in making the actors look young again, as they did to Carrie Fisher in Rogue One.<br/><br/>Jack's personality. In ALL the previous movies, Jack has had a few moments of clarity and wittiness. In this movie however, he seems to have just lost all sense of reality. I want to attribute this to the ""loss"" of the Pearl, but the thing is, I feel like Jack would have taken any measure to get her back. But because of this fact, I believe that is why he was pretty much broken and refused to sail on, and therefore brings me to another short and sweet point: he seemed more like the Mad Hatter, than the Jack Sparrow we know and love. <br/><br/>And something else I can't stand is when there is no time in between a theory and it's reveal. Carina tells us that her father leaves her this journal while talking to a pirate (avoiding the other name for spoiler purposes). This is the first hint that we know who the father is, then boom! It's confirmed. Now, I know I'm dissecting this a little harshly, but seriously. The better way that myself and others have stated was that it should have been at the tattoo scene. That would have been the perfect reveal time, since this was supposed to be the last movie in the series. <br/><br/>Which all of this leads me to my final issue. Barbosa. I'm not sure WHY Jack and Barbosa went their separate ways. I may have missed that from between the fourth movie and this movie, but over all, it seemed like things were relatively patched up between the two.<br/><br/>So, to wrap up this exceedingly long review, I just want to say that overall, I was not impressed at all; I'm very upset that I wasted my money on it."
"Troy_Campbell","5","9","21","26 May 2017"," Passable time-waster.
","Disney's ghoulish swashbuckling adventure rages on with a sequel that sees the indomitable Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) reluctantly team up with Henry 'son of Will' Turner (Aussie youngster Brenton Thwaites) to find the trident of Poseidon. Six years after the dull On Stranger Tides proved this seafaring franchise should take its last sip of rum, instalment number five, although a step up, does little to change that viewpoint. Battling against a mishmash script that doesn't bother to hide its contrivances or uninspired storyline — save for a neat subplot that ties up loose ends — this outing lives and dies by its big budget set pieces and tongue in cheek humour. And signs are positive for the first hour or so. A wildly ambitious, exhilarating and funny bank robbery sequence is the perfect introduction to a still-drunk Jack Sparrow, and an early demonstration that Norwegian directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg could breathe life into the 14-year-old series. But they well and truly run out of gas by the tremendously tedious third act; the set pieces become increasingly muddled and so CGI-heavy that the undersea finale may as well be a cartoon. Brought on board as the murderous, revenge-filled Captain Salazar — and given an awesome vessel-devouring ghost ship to boot — Javier Bardem's swishy-haired and tar-drooling villain is a delight to watch. Pity the rest of the cast don't leave the same impression. Depp can do Sparrow in his sleep by this point, which is the heart of the problem. The drunken sway, slurred words and permanently confused expression still provide the odd giggle here and there, yet it just as often draws yawns and eye-rolling. If you're a big fan of this franchise then there's enough here to keep you entertained, but on the whole Dead Men Tell No Tales is a merely passable time-waster."
"rannynm","10","12","31","23 May 2017"," The most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and has the most other-worldly visual effects of any recent movie. The CGI is the most mesmerizing piece of treasure throughout the film. Johnny Depp again stars as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. It also stars the terrific Javier Bardem as the new villain, Captain Salazar. Brenton Thwaites plays Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario plays Carina Smyth. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have cameos as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, respectively. Full disclosure: I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and I have loved the Pirates of the Caribbean movies since I was 5 years old!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, Captain Jack Sparrow is presumed dead. He resurfaces in a most humorous way. Captain Salazar is Jack Sparrow's oldest nemesis. He takes revenge on Sparrow by unleashing the vicious ghost pirates of Devil's Triangle. The ghost pirates are hell-bent on killing Sparrow and destroy multiple pirate ships in the process. The only way to break the curse is to find and destroy the Trident of Poseidon. Along the way, we learn the background of Will Turner's son, Henry Turner. He's looking for Sparrow and also trying to find the Trident in order to save his father who is trapped in Davy Jones Locker. Carina Smyth is a young astronomer who is also searching for the Trident. What ensues is a humorous, action packed adventure on the high seas.<br/><br/>The special effects and CGI are astoundingly lifelike. The most stunning visual effects in the film are the CGI animated ghost sharks, which are sent to hunt down Jack Sparrow. The movements of the ghost pirates and sharks are hyper-realistic. Out of all the Pirates of The Caribbean films, this one utilizes the most mythological elements. Johnny Depp again aces his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. His interpretation of Jack Sparrow is one of the most entertaining and memorable characters in recent film history. The inimitable Geoffrey Rush is again terrific as Captain Barbossa and Javier Bardem, an acclaimed actor from art house and independent films, is riveting as the vicious Captain Salazar.<br/><br/>One flaw of the film is how Keira Knightley suddenly appears for one minute during the movie. It's the one false note because it seems gratuitous. However, it doesn't distract from the impact and excitement of the film. Compared to other movie sequels, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales flows surprisingly well and moves along at an exciting pace. The film is appropriate for 10 to18 year olds. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 5 out of 5 stars. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Clayton P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

","'What we bring to the screen is great storytelling, with wonderful characters caught up in this magical fantastic world' - Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) on this fifth installment.<br/><br/>Sorry Jerry, NO! This movie did not have great storytelling, it had boring uninteresting characters (even the ones that were interesting in former installments were stale and washed up) and the world was anything but magical.<br/><br/>If anything, this made me love the first three movies even more. (even the second and the third on what they were attempting to do with the epic scale and world-building storytelling)<br/><br/>This movie was utter trash. This is coming from someone who tolerated the fourth movie (On Stranger Tides). On Stranger Tides was mediocre but it was sometimes enjoyable at least when you watched it the first time. This thing (if you can even call it a movie) was like staying too long at a dance party. The lights are already turned on, there is no music playing anymore and some really drunk people are still dancing but only because they had too much to drink. And you are in the middle of the room, looking around you and wonder: why didn't I leave sooner. This party isn't fun anymore.<br/><br/>The main problem was the uninspiring story-line, it's contradicting script, boring characters,the cringe-worthy forced jokes were not funny and worst of all it's retconning and undermining of the lore from previous (much better) movies. <br/><br/>Here's another quote from Jerry: 'Johnny Depp has created an iconic character. One of the best characters ever created in cinema.'<br/><br/>Thanks Jerry. Depp indeed created an iconic character in the first movie (and kinda continued with that in the second and third movies) but his performance is best described as a washed-up former rock star with alcohol issues. You almost feel bad for Depp when you watch his performance in this movie.<br/><br/>Dear Jerry, please don't make another one!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean has always been a franchise that makes no attempt for Oscar worthy material but in its own way is massively enjoyable.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales certainly embraces the aspects of the original movie while also incorporating new plot lines that fit in well with plots from the original story. With the introduction of Henry and Karina there is a new love interest that is provided to the audience that rivals that of Will and Elizabeth Turner's.<br/><br/>Henry Turner is portrayed as an almost exact copy of his father except just a teensy bit worse at sword fighting while Karina differs from the usual women as she remains just as important, if not more, as Henry as she guides the course towards Posiedon's trident.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is entertaining as always with his usual drunk characteristics. For those of you who are tired of Sparrow acting this way Don't SEE THE MOVIE Jack sparrow isn't going to change because it doesn't make sense for his character to suddenly change.<br/><br/>All together the movie was expertly written and expertly performed by the entire cast even Kiera Knightely who didn't manage to get one word throughout the whole movie. I know as a major fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean I can't wait to see what happens for the future of the franchise."
"bkrauser-81-311064","5","8","19","26 May 2017"," This Ship Sinks
","If you're like me, you were never much interested in the buccaneering, larger-than-life characters that populate the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003-Present) series. Subversive characterizations; forget about it, constantly shifting alliances; no need for it, organic integration of plot combined with clever setups and payoffs; pirate please! Everyone knows this series is and should always be a catalog of increasingly far-fetched pirate folklore almost entirely based on a small collection of supernatural trinkets Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Captain Barbossa (Rush) happen to have on them.<br/><br/>Submitted for your approval: Dead Men Tell No Tales answers the pressing questions of how Jack Sparrow got a hold of his magic compass. It's cursed (of course) - having the power to release the owner's worst fear the moment it is betrayed. Naturally, Jack betrays the compass at a bar, unleashing the ghostly Captain Salazar (Bardem) from his watery tomb. This then allows Salazar to seek revenge against the pirate who outsmarted him a generation ago. There's also some throwaway exposition involving two star-crossed lovers (Thwaites and Scodelario), and a mythical trident that gives the movie an excuse to dust off and use Orlando Bloom for all of five minutes.<br/><br/>With a narrative foundation positively drenched in seafaring happenstance, Dead Men Tell No Tales is an uncompromising success of messy, soulless, conveyor-belt cinema. Its emotional stakes strain under the weight of Depp's, by now tired and embarrassing performance while the pacing ebbs and flows with the force of every exposition drop. The special-effects are a master's class in ""quantity over substance"" with a showstopping zombie shark sequence being a real standout in the patently unnecessary.<br/><br/>Speaking of the patently unnecessary - Captain Barbossa's inclusion blows any of the unnaturalness of the previous movies completely out of the water. His contrived, lazily detailed story serves as a perfect metaphor for series' parent company's indignant lack of creativity. But while some other franchises I could name, disguise familiar trappings with a false sense of reverence (cough cough Star Wars, cough cough) or at the very least retool them to seem new (cough cough Marvel), Pirates just lets its complex myths dangle in front of Disney's nakedly plain ambitions to keep this moneymaker chugging.<br/><br/>It's almost like the movie is daring you to hate it. It brazenly has no economy of thought - letting its dry exposition scenes, its tired comedic scenes and its loud action scenes serve their simple purpose with nary an overlapping thread. It then perverts the original film's fondness for coincidence into an oppressive highlight reel of bad storytelling, bad editing and bad franchise maintenance. Then, as if to purposely p**s everyone off, the movie manages to fit in a reoccurring joke about Scodelario's character being a witch because she happens to be smarter than everyone else in the f**king movie! This is now the fifth movie cataloging the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow and his confederacy of loose fitting friends/enemies. Five movies...out of a franchise that arguably only made one good one! Can we please be done with these? Please? I don't think I can stomach another lucky brush with a well armed, supernatural villain on a search for vengeance and quite possibly Jack's hat. If anything this movie is proof that some things just need to die."

","Hijole what a piece of crap. This movie reminds me too much of Grownups 2. It's like the writer and director watched the previous movies, made notes of what people laughed at and then randomly put that in this movie, with no cohesion, and then filmed the movie as a bunch of sketches with huge time lapses in between.<br/><br/>It was painfully obvious that Barbossa's two new comical reliefs were there to replace Pintel and Ragetti from the other movies. Only these had no personality and frankly, did not serve any purpose. Speaking of Barbossa, the only reason (I suspect) he is in this movie is because he was in the others. That's about as much point he has.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp appears as if he's sick of the character and only does it because of the money/contract. Also the story of him getting the nickname ""The Sparrow"" because he was standing on the lookout, yelling at Salazar (who then died-ish), and this being explained by Salazar makes no sense. Did he become undead, killed off a bunch of people, let one go to spread the tale of Jack, so he could get nicknamed ""Sparrow""? Salazar apparently became cursed because the writers liked the idea. No explanation is really given. On top of that, he's an extremely boring character.<br/><br/>The ending with Kiera's character magically appearing is just stupid.<br/><br/>Horrible, horrible film."

To my surprise, I enjoyed the film and found it very funny. Jack Sparrow's lines are funny as in previous films, and got the cinema giggling in many occasions. The guillotine scene is really good, it is funny and thrilling at the same time.<br/><br/>The story itself is just alright.

","First off, Dead Men Tell No Tales is magnitudes better than Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>Instead of a misplaced attempt to cater religious nuts, this time we see a politically correct female scientist astronomer (yes, indeed) as female ""lead"". The weirdness doesn't stop there, because she also believes in blood moon star constellation magic. Still better than the bible study of Stranger Tides.<br/><br/>We also see a return of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. They play small roles , but add some much needed substance to the otherwise slow and flat story.<br/><br/>However, the movie falls short in two major points: The villain and the introduction of new young lead characters.<br/><br/>The main villain is a pale shadow of Bill Nighy's Davy Jones. He reminded me a lot of General Grievous from Star Wars. CGI overkill without any soul to be found. After the trilogy, it simply feels dumb that there is yet another Big Bad out there.<br/><br/>The new young lead characters suffer from the Indiana Jones IV-syndrome. They feel forced and out of place. Among a band of seasoned pirates, they are the new kids on the block. The trashy hip hoppers among the Mozart-aficionados. The fast food generation clashing with lobster gourmets, especially the guy. The female ""scientist"" is okay, because she has some decent lines with Jack, but the dude is just another young Indiana Jones copy.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie series could have ended after the first, and it should definitely have ended after the third.

"hennyxu","5","6","14","1 June 2017"," In five words: A tale not worth telling.
","The fifth movie in the Pirates of The Caribbean franchise is promoted as the final chapter. It will be the last time we'll see Jack Sparrow sail the open seas on the Black Pearl and follow him on a crazy adventure, depending on the box office results off course. So did they close the franchise with a swansong or did they jump the shark. Well let's order some rum and ""drink up me hearties yoho!"" and dive into ""Davy Jones' locker"" to review this movie. <br/><br/>First some background about the franchise. Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie franchise that started strong with a movie that breathed new life into the pirate movie genre in 2003. A genre that died in 1996 with Cutthroat Island starring Geena Davis. The first movie ""The Curse of The Black Pearl"" is a good and entertaining movie with a strong story and well balanced action and humor. This is also the first time we see Johnny Depp play a drunk and brilliant pirate named Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>Following the success of The Black Pearl, Disney decided to shoot the back-to-back resulting in mediocre action movies with a convoluted story. The fourth movie however completely jumped the shark by including an uninteresting villain and a story that made no sense; furthermore it primarily focused on Jack Sparrow. Don't take me wrong, Jack Sparrow is a brilliant and funny character; however the fourth installment showed us that he can't carry a movie. So how is the fifth and final movie?<br/><br/>Story: The fifth movie is about a boy named Henry Turner whom wants to find the trident of Poseidon in order to free his father from a curse. To achieve this he needs the help of Jack Sparrow and a horologist named Carina Smyth. During this endeavor they are followed by Captain Salazar an old enemy of Jack Sparrow's and he is seeking revenge. While this is the main outline there are also multiple other side stories and none of them are paid-off properly, resulting in some plot holes. Basically they tried to juggle too many story lines and in the end they ended up with nothing. A shame though because there is a specific side-story about the character Carina Smyth that had much potential and in my opinion should've been the main story. <br/><br/>Characters: There are too many characters in this movie and they all do not have enough screen time to fully develop. Together with an unfocused story it isn't always clear who the main character truly is: <br/><br/>Carina Smyth (played by: Kaya Scodelario), a girl who tried to follow in her father's footsteps as a scientist. She is headstrong, inventive and personally I think she should have been the main focus of the movie. Her story has so much potential. She is portrait reasonably by Kaya and I think she can do better, however the script is letting her down. <br/><br/>Henry Turner (played by: Brenton Thwaites), the son of the main character from the previous movies Will Turner (played by: Orlando Bloom aka Legolas). He is adventures, innocent and focused on freeing his father from the curse. He doesn't really do much in the movie. A forgettable character and the performance by Brenton was bland. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (played by: Johnny Depp), worst performance yet by Depp. The character was entertaining in the previous movies, partly because we see a new side of Jack Sparrow, in this we're just going through the motions. While it is interesting to see his younger self and his relation with Captain Salazar it is regrettable that we never truly see this character grow. <br/><br/>Hector Barbossa (played by: Geoffrey Rush), I've said it once and I'm saying it again he should've been the lead in the previous movie and especially this movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep it a bit cryptic. His part in this movie is a little short; however it has soooooo much potential. If only Geoffrey Rush had more lines and a better script this movie could've been great.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Nothing truly noteworthy. If you've seen the previous movies you'll know that the in camera shots on the sea are beautiful to look at. The CGI effects are a little dated but still good enough.<br/><br/>Three-Act-Structure: Beginning: The movie starts strong, mysterious followed by over the top action. However, after I don't know how long (felt like an hour), they were still introducing characters and unnecessarily fighting and it dragged.<br/><br/>Middle: Almost non-existent mostly action scenes and no character development. At least none that truly mattered. <br/><br/>End: Really, this movie has a dragged out beginning, and after that an anticlimactic ending. Because the movie doesn't give us any time to truly connect with the characters. They are mostly used to setup the next action scene or plot. And because of this we are not emotionally invested in their motivations and choices, resulting in a specific moment at the end of the movie that really wasn't earned.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A shame that is the only thing I can truly and honestly say about this movie. If they only had focused the story on the female lead Carina and invested time and money to rewrite the script they could've made one of the best pirates movie to end the franchise. As aforementioned, most of the stories aren't fleshed out properly and even though Salazar is portrait as the main villain he didn't leave an impression on me. It was mostly a copy paste work with interesting ideas and some with much potential. <br/><br/>So even though this movie isn't any good it is important to note that it didn't commit the unforgivable SIN a movie can ever commit and that is being boring. If you don't overthink it and just go with the flow, I think you'll have a good time."

","'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: SALAZAR'S REVENGE' was a joint directorial effort by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, and stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Brenton Thwaites.​Long ago, Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) first earned his rank of Captain when he outmanoeuvred Spanish Pirate hunter Captain Salazar(Javier Bardem), cursing Salazar to life in hell. But when he has come to the end of the line, Jack exchanges his treasured compass, and releases his greatest foe.<br/><br/>This is a franchise that, while I enjoyed 2 and 3, should have died after the first one. It didn't need to continue this long and they're really beating this skeleton of a once good franchise. Please, for the love of god, stop making these movies. If you enjoyed this movie, then I can't say I understand why but I'm happy you did because I wanted nothing more to like it. That said, after 'On Stranger Tides', this and even the already decreasing quality of 2 and 3, this franchise has proved it was a one trick pony and trying to get any more goodness out of it is a waste of time and money. <br/><br/>For starters, the story is very weak and not engaging in the slightest. I understand that the casual audience member may not care about the story and focus more on action(don't worry; I'll get to that later) but I still expect a coherent narrative that makes logical sense and engages me to an extent. To be fair, the ending was actually pretty great and neatly ends of the franchise, if they end it here(please do!).<br/><br/>CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is a name that used to mean something in movies. Johnny Depp received his first EVER Oscar nomination for this character and now it's devolved into a pathetic, practical joke. That is genuinely sad because of what he was, and what he is now. RIP Old Jack. Javier Bardem provided perhaps his worst performance as Captain Salazar which is also a huge shame because I respect Bardem as an actor immensely(he's in my top 3 bond villains for God's sake!). I understand he had little to work with, and thus do not blame him for such a bland, unforgettable and uninspiring villain. Brenton Thwaites was also pretty weak as Henry but making the character the son of Will Turner cleverly links him into the rest of the franchise and gives me a reason to actually like him and want him to succeed. Caya Scodelario was decent as Carina and I really like the strong, powerful female character that each Pirates movie has included. I'll say that Carina is definitely better than Angela but slightly weaker than Elizabeth Swan(but that may be down to Swan having three movies to develop). Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only two actors in all these movies that I still genuinely like. Both Barbossa(Rush) and Gibbs(McNally) are incredibly likable characters and I love the way their arcs end, one in particular.<br/><br/>Each Pirates movie from the Gore Verbinski trilogy to 'On Stranger Trash' at least had a unique feel to them and all of them FELT like a Pirates movie. This movie just felt like a mesh of 100s of other action and adventure movies thus causing this movie to lose its identity which is really sad. The costume and set design was fine but it didn't feel as alive as the other movies. The effects for this movie are also fine but I don't think they hold a candle to even the effects in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'(but I may need to re watch it to be sure). <br/><br/>Right, another of my main flaws in this movie is the action. It's a PIRATES movie and contains the less Sword fighting and cool scenes than Schindler's List(you just imagined Oskar Schindler and Amon Goeth in a sword fight, didn't you?). The only sequence in this movie that had even remotely good action was the opening sequence(involving Sparrow) but aside from that, I wasn't impressed by any of the action.<br/><br/>A fair number of the jokes hit in this movie, which I was impressed by but I think that less time could have been spent on jokes, and more on an engaging narrative. <br/><br/>The pacing for this movie is also awful and it is WAY TOO LONG. You could have shaved off a good 20-25 minutes and wouldn't have affected the movie in any way. <br/><br/>The score for this movie is also awesome but that was established in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' and can thus not be credited to this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I really didn't enjoy this movie. It didn't contain enough good of anything to excuse the bad of anything. The bad outweighs the good for me and I just recommend it. If you liked it, I envy you because I really wished I did but I suppose the title(Salazar's Revenge. Really?) should have gave away how lazy this movie was gonna be. I don't recommend you see this movie and I'll rate it 3 out of 10 mute cameos."
"lev-nemkin","4","6","14","30 May 2017"," Disappointment for the most part...
","This film was a disappointment with only a few decent moments and one saddening scene which I will get into soon but first let me point out that I only went to see this because me and my friends couldn't get in to see Alien Covenant which is what we really wanted to see right now I'm going to talk about everything that I didn't like...1. I didn't like the fact that Jack Sparrow wasn't the same pirate we know and love he seemed washed up like he didn't have it in him anymore 2. The villain Captain Salazar played by Javier Bardem he was just terrible and so corny they tried to make him come off as funny but that just didn't work 3. It wasn't as action packed as the first 3 Pirates of The Caribbean films were now I'm only saying the first 3 because I haven't seen On Stranger Tides I actually heard that wasn't that good of a film but at some point I may give it a chance because I'm sure it's better than this. Now the things I did like and the one thing that kind of saddened me...1. I liked the scene where Jack Sparrow robbed the bank that was kind of funny and the only scene where I thought that he could be the same pirate we know and love but after that I threw it out of my mind because it just went downhill after that 2. The fact that Will Turner was showed in the beginning talking to his son Henry who wanted to lift his father's curse by finding the Trident of Poseidon 2. The sad thing is when you see Barbosa die who is the father of one of the other main characters of the film who I didn't really care about because her acting was so horrible but her name was Carina Smyth I mean that just seemed unlikely that a pirate was the father of such an intelligent girl but like I said it was quite sad to see him die because he was a huge part of the series but it was time to write that character off I didn't like that scene at all though 3. The last thing I liked is the ending of course when Henry broke Will's curse and they were reunited with Elizabeth that was just beautiful that happened because he broke the Trident of Poseidon but in the process he also broke the curse of Captain Salazar and his crew I won't get into how or why he was cursed because that explanation in the film was just boring to me I can't believe a film series based on a Disney attraction went on for so long to me personally I think it should've stopped at 3 which was At World's End that would've been a good ending this is definitely the worst Pirates of The Caribbean film I've seen but who knows maybe when I finally see On Stranger Tides that may change although I'm really not sure. Anyway I give this a 4/10 I mean if you're a huge fan of Pirates of The Caribbean you might like this but you also may not an example of a fan who didn't like it would be me."

","I'm quite sure Walt Disney would cry to see his name in this.<br/><br/>Like the other three sequels, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is made by the motto More Is More, which, apparently, is still not the case. Having watched, and loved, ""Kon-Tiki"" and ""Max Manus"" -- two impressively well-made productions by talented Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg -- I must admit that I couldn't help hoping that I would once again get to experience the wonder and magic of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Regrettably, though, there is nothing of that to be found here, as the latest installment of the series is completely devoid of story and inspiration and even, at most times, fails with the so-important humour. Bardem and Depp, both at times great actors, brings no real energy to their characters, and despite a few glimpses of light, I walked out from the cinema feeling that for 129 minutes, I'd been watching a movie on autopilot. One of the few things preventing this from being an unbearable experience was the music, which of course relies heavily on the works of Zimmer/Badelt from before, but also adds some nice new touches from composer Geoff Zanelli."
"ctowyi","5","6","14","29 May 2017"," Feels like yesterday's spaghetti bolognese
","This unnecessary fifth entry of the franchise feels like yesterday's Spaghetti Bolognese. The gravy has coagulated into a thickened blur of red and the noodles have congealed into a bloated mess of starch. It looks great from far, but once you get up close all your alarm bells start to go off. If you put one spoonful in your mouth, the only thought pervading your consciousness will be how much you miss its formal glory and then you will proceed to spit it out in a hurry.<br/><br/>For a movie franchise that is built on fun and adventure on the high seas, while maintaining a deft balance between light and dark elements, these sequels missed their mark with increasing notoriety. For me, On Stranger Tides (2011) flatlined from the get-go, while this new one helmed by Kon-Tiki (2012) directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg takes a while to get to the point of no return. There is no denying the fact that this entry feels unnecessary and almost redundant. There is some effort in trying to do a soft reboot with the introduction of new characters Henry Turner (son of William Turner and Elizabeth Swann) and Carina Smyth, but they lack chemistry and the uninspired script barely allowed them to stay afloat.<br/><br/>One of the joys of watching a Pirates of the Caribbean movie is Jack Sparrow, a joyful collision of spur-of-the-moment slapstick and irrelevant eccentricity. The script of this latest entry doesn't even push the character a millimetre forward. He slurs and staggers his way through any scene and nothing is truly memorable, except maybe that guillotine scene.<br/><br/>The story features yet again a MacGuffin, the Trident of Poseidon, and it feels too familiar and bloated. It doesn't help matters with so many characters which basically dissolve into a chain of cause and effect events.<br/><br/>Dead Men Tell No Tales does look great at times, especially with inventive scenes featuring zombie sharks and the parting of an ocean, but like all money-spinning franchises the studios don't want to think up fresh storytelling ideas and is content with letting the CGI overwhelm the movie like a Kraken. The studio motto is ""the boat that carries the gold shall not be rocked"" and it is clearly evident here."
"zardoz-13","9","5","11","11 June 2017"," Shriver Your Timbers and Tickle Your Funny Bones
","If numbers mean anything to you, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is the fifth film in Walt Disney Studios' 18th century, supernatural, seafaring, fantasy franchise about swashbuckling buccaneers. Norwegian directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg of ""Bandidas"" have taken the helm and recycled the best elements of the series with this boisterous as well as bizarre scavenger hunt for the fabled Trident of Poseidon. The Trident—according t0 ""Tower Heist"" writer Jeff Nathanson's elaborate but rambling screenplay--will absolve any curses cast on seagoing guys. The exhaustive Trident search amounts to a marathon enterprise in this scenic, widescreen, PG-13 rated, 129-minute epic, but everything works out in the surf. The CGI animation of various characters and the ocean where they find the Trident is probably a milestone for the franchise. Mind you, the ""Pirates"" movies have savagely maligned for their heavy reliance on special visual effects. Given that fantasy is the keystone of the franchise, such criticism seems entirely irrelevant. Nothing about the ""Pirates"" movies, aside from the exotic settings and sprawling production designs, is remotely authentic. After several mediocre movies and enough bad press to drive a lesser mortal into exile, Johnny Depp is back doing what he does best. Captain Jack Sparrow is as rum-soaked as ever, and Depp plays him with his characteristic flair for comic theatricality.<br/><br/>Directors Rønning and Sandberg have delivered not only a superior sequel but also an interesting prequel. This time we see Jack before he acquired his signature headgear and attained the rank of captain. Captain Jack Sparrow is still as much a hero as a buffoon. This time out he is pitted against an utterly villainous ghost, while the pride of His Majesty's Imperial Fleet terrorizes him. Presumably, after the least memorable 0f sequels, i.e., ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer sought a return to form. Although it lacks the inspired spontaneity of the original ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" you couldn't ask for more from this fourth sequel. Forty minutes shorter than the second, overindulgent sequel ""Dead Man's Chest,"" ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" ties up many loose narrative threads as well as charts a possible future for the franchise.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" opens with an attention-grabbing scene. Twelve-year old Henry Turner (newcomer Lewis McGowan) rows out by himself into the ocean at night. Knotting a rope to his ankle, which in turn is attached to an anchor, he steps from the boat into the briny deep, and the anchor plunges him down to the ocean floor. Holding his breath all the way down, Henry lands on the deck of the sunken pirate ship The Flying Dutchman. Henry meets the ghostly apparition of his father, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom of ""Ned Kelly""), and assures him that he hasn't given up on his lifting the curse on his dad. Henry tells him about the Trident of Poseidon and assures his father that he can live on land again as soon as Henry acquires the trident. The Flying Dutchman surfaces from the deep, and Will reminds Henry that the trident is largely a legend. Nevertheless, Henry vows to find it. Nine years elapse, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites of ""Maleficent"") is aboard a British sailing ship in pursuit of a pirate ship. Henry warns the captain in vain that he is pursuing a treacherous course into the Devil's Triangle as the ship approaches a tunnel in a mountain surrounded by a reef. The captain charges Henry with treason and has the youth clapped in irons. Not long afterward, the dreaded Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem of ""Skyfall"") attacks his ship. They kill everybody aboard except Henry because they find Jack Sparrow wanted posters in his possession. Salazar allows Henry to live on the condition that he tell Jack Sparrow that he wants him. Furthermore, Salazar lets Henry live because he always sends one lone survivor back to tell the tale.<br/><br/>Meantime, Sparrow and his pirate crew have sneaked into the township of St. Martin. They have come to rob the bank. The bank directors are celebrating the addition of new, impregnable vault that nobody can rob. When they open the formidable vault, the commotion awakens a sozzled Jack Sparrow who is inside it. The British fire a volley about the same time that Jack's crew has lashing the vault to a team of powerful horses. Whipping the steeds into action, they wind up hauling the whole bank along with the vault behind them! Jack Sparrow entangles his foot in one of the ropes, and he is dragged along behind it, blissfully guzzling rum from a bottle. Predictably, the British follow with muskets blazing. The trouble is the door to the vault doesn't shut and all the wealth in the vault spills out in a trail of golden bread crumbs that citizens scoop up. This qualifies as one of the best gags in this sprawling spectacle. Indeed, it recalls a similar robbery in ""Fast Five."" Later, after the British Navy recaptures Jack, they set out to decapitate him with a French guillotine. At the same time, the British are poised to hang an alleged witch, Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario of ""The Maze Runner""), because she claims to know how to read the stars as if they were a map. Not only does Henry believe she can lead him to the Trident, but also that Jack Sparrow has a compass that can aid them on the quest. Henry enlists the help of Sparrow's crew, and this escape sequence is both hilarious and exciting.<br/><br/>The characters in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" run the gamut of larger-than-life as well as larger-than-death. Salazar's zombie pirate crew are a CGI miracle. Most of his crew are missing fragments of their anatomy, some even their heads. The fifth installment in the ""Pirates"" franchise will keep you shivering and snickering."
"slacky_23","4","5","11","5 June 2017"," A Shoddy Disney Rehash
","Pros: - The movie starts out really well with the opening sequence of Will Turner's kid tying a rock to his foot to talk with his dad - The Will Turner/Elizabeth Swan story was tied up nicely - The sequence with the Horologist comments was hilarious<br/><br/>Cons: - Jack Sparrow has suffered from Flanderization (The act of progressively exaggerating a single trait of a character until it overtakes all other characterization) with this being his drunken silliness. He was reduced from a cunning/witty character to one purely for comic relief, which, for the most part was unfunny - We got to see a young Jack Sparrow, albeit, one who acts exactly the same as he always does. His character is just far too one- dimensional, we don't get to see any new goals/desires, new emotional territory. Sadly, there is more emotional depth to Barbosa - Jack's crew forgive/agree to save him far too quickly, all for 10 silver which they could've robbed from the kid, they are pirates btw - Disney basically trying to rehash one of their past successes just like Star Wars with The Force Awakens i.e. figure out what the fans liked last time and dishing the same thing up again, eg having one of Jack Sparrow's old enemies out to get him who just happens to be cursed <br/><br/><ul><li>A house being dragged by horses. I know that it's a movie and a fantasy one but I still like them to obey the laws of physics, if not, at least explain it away with magic or something - The origins of Salazar's curse. He arbitrarily gets swallowed by hellfire and gets to come back all cursed why exactly? - The East India Trading Company's presence in the movie wasn't necessary at all. They were just there for old times sake. - Kaya Scodelario's character was very proactive to begin with, all the witch comments fit the period and was funny but her character became passive towards the end - Barbosa's death was rather forced and formulaic. Did he have to jump off the chain like that? Could they have perhaps just kicked Salazar in the head or something? - Salazar's dialogue was just him dribbling and saying 'hombre' a lot</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion: I'll end by saying if you liked Disney's 'The Force Awakens', this is the movie for you!"

TCOTBP was very underwhelming, but every time Depp was on screen, he lit the film up with his presence, and he immediately went from a wonderful actor who picked some wonderful projects, into a megastar.<br/><br/>This carried on with the next three films, which were irritatingly enjoyable, but in hindsight, just for the spectacle, as viewing them on Blu Ray proved that they were convoluted with too much going on, making the narrative almost indecipherable.<br/><br/>But, Depp was still great, and people flocked to see him, rather than the films.<br/><br/>Now it's the fifth entry, and it appears that Depp has lost his mojo. <br/><br/>Gone is the endearing Sparrow that brightened up the previous films, the kookiness feels forced this time, and strangely, Depp just feels like he's a shell, almost that he's embarrassed to be in this as these are really the only films of his that actually make money, and since he's had a lot of bad press of late, it seems like he's begging his audience, rather than entertaining them.<br/><br/>It's thankfully a lot shorter than the other films, and whilst Salazar is a wonderful concept, him and his crew are nothing more than a redux of Barbossa, who makes an appearance only because the writers have thought of a way to bring him back. Honestly, for all,the trouble that the story goes to, it's not worth it, just to bring back a popular character.<br/><br/>Talking about popular characters, Bloom turns up to bookend the film for around two minutes, and Knightley, well, she literally does not have a line.<br/><br/>It's tiresome stuff, the set pieces are pretty mundane, even the much talked about guillotine sequence is pretty laboured.<br/><br/>Paul McCartney turns up as Jacks 'Uncle Jack' so in the POTC world, he is Keith Richards brother, but his scene is so awful, he makes David Beckham look like Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>As always, there is a stinger at the end, and once again, we are treated to a popular character from other films, one that ironically rhymes with Lazy Bones.<br/><br/>It's tepid stuff, offering nothing new to a well worn franchise, but hopefully Depp will go back to his kooky ways and start making some interesting films again.<br/><br/>Not terrible, but not worthy of such a high budget."

"Imaculata","8","5","11","2 June 2017"," A lot better than I expected
","This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. Reviews of this movie have been pretty cynical and negative, but I don't think the negativity is deserved. This is a fun movie. A lot of the old cast returned for this film, and it bookends the series in a lovely way. It's not perfect, and we'll get into that below. But if you are looking for a fun adventure movie, with a lot of laughs, this movie fills all those check boxes.<br/><br/>Lets first get the negatives out of the way, which are few, but deserve mention. The two new leads in this film are rookies, and not strong enough as actors to carry this movie. They are adequate, but never succeed in convincing you that they deserve being in this movie, contrary to Orlando Bloom and Kyra Knightley in the past. Fortunately the old cast are able to bare the weight of the movie, with both Rush and Depp doing a great job.<br/><br/>There's a scene where they show a young Jack Sparrow, and as usual, the effect for that is not good. Please Hollywood, stop de-aging actors with CGI! It looks terrible. His mouth looked like it had just been pasted on. It was really weird and jarring. Not as jarring as CGI Peter Cushing in Rogue One, but pretty jarring none the less. There is no reason to do this with CGI. Just cast a young actor who looks enough like a young Depp and you're done. It's cheaper, and the audience will accept it more easily, instead of being distracted by a lousy effect.<br/><br/>The script is okay, although there is a lot of plot convenience, and a lot of stuff that defies physics. But I can look past that, because this is not a movie franchise that should be taken too seriously. The dialogue in the beginning is a bit stiff though, especially when the two new leads are basically telling the audience their backstories. Show, don't tell! (But don't show it with bad de-aging CGI!) Now for the positives, Depp does a great job. I thought that I would be bored of Jack Sparrow by now, but I guess not. Both he and Rush seemed to be having fun, and giving it their best. And it is fun watching these actors just having a lot of joy on set. The humor is also really on point. Most of the jokes work.<br/><br/>The action is pretty fantastic. I was amazed by some of the crazy action scenes that they came up with, especially during the very strong opening of the film. Yes, it is absurd and over the top, but there was a lot of practical stuff, and just good old stunt work. It was so much fun to watch. I feel that they could have ended the film perhaps with a big battle, but the ending we got instead sufficed.<br/><br/>The design of the ghost pirates and their ship is really well done. And the undead sharks (which you can see in the trailer) were pretty creepy. I also liked the quality of most of the special effects. The ships all look really good. The high production values are clearly on display. There's some green screening here and there, but I think the general audience will not even notice that. The set designs are fantastic, and there's just a lot of awesome practical stuff in the film.<br/><br/>So as you can tell, I had a lot of fun at this film. I was not disappointed in the slightest. Stick around till after the credits for the usual post credits scene. But I could be mistaken, but isn't this going to be the last PotC film? Then why are we getting another post credits teaser? And why does the post credits scene seem to contradict the finale of the movie? Ehh... whatever."
"joshteggert","4","5","11","31 May 2017"," The entirely worn-out 'Pirates' franchise stands to prove that that the Dead do in fact continue to Tell Tales.
","It seems that the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will keep sailing until star Johnny Depp decides to hang up those washed out boots. 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' (or the significantly inferior 'Salazar's Revenge' in the UK, which I refuse to refer to it as,) has some fantastic moments, but its nadirs are so low that it is hard to relate to at points, churning out the same thrills, the same problems, and the same franchise developing plot devices that culminate to form a generally uninspiring sequel, which promises that more of the same is still yet to come. <br/><br/>The so-called ""beginning of the end"" to the 'Pirates' series sees the return of familiar faces, notably Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley - whose cameos comprise some of the most moving moments in the film - alongside newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario as Henry Turner and Carina Smyth respectively. The plot follows the latter duo on their journey to find the Trident of Poseidon with Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, who seems somewhat unassured in the role this time round, and Geoffrey Rush's fantastic Captain Barbossa (the best developed character in the entire series). This is all whilst being chased by an undead sea crew, headed by Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar. Oh, and of course, the protagonists also have some altercations with the British Empire along the way (an entirely pointless sub-plot that only adds to the convolution of the narrative). <br/><br/>The motives are identified clearly from the start and founded upon rather basic principles, making it easier to follow than other 'Pirates' films, and it relates back to the beloved trilogy a lot more than the miserable 'On Stranger Tides'. But these aspects are often too plainly reiterated to the viewer that it hollows the plot disproportionately, sacrificing the development of potentially more engaging material. Bardem's antagonist thus feels loosely integrated into the franchise's narrative, which is sad given that he plays the role with natural certitude. <br/><br/>However, during the instances where Disney is showcasing its mastering of the CGI department, or the alcohol-fuelled scenes of Jack escaping near death situations (not to mention Paul McCartney's ingenious cameo), 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' provides some undeniably delightful entertainment. Yet in terms of an original, witty, swashbuckling joy of a ride, it fails to deliver on most fronts, conforming to the structure of the preceding films but also feeling far more conveniently pieced together than ever before. <br/><br/>It is a tale told by a franchise that should've been dead long ago; where it ought to be looking to bring back those wonderfully crafted sword fights of the first 2 films, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' instead decides to expand its mythology to dismal effects. <br/><br/>Figuratively, no ships are being blown out of the water by this entry."

"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","9","24","24 May 2017"," Pirate's life
","While most consider the first PotC movie the 'best', the second one grew on me the more I watched it and, to my surprise, became my favourite. The third one remains a mess (Keira Knightley/Elizabeth was the one bright spot) and the only part I enjoy/remember from the fourth is the mermaid attack. I'd personally rank this fifth film in the middle, it's better than the last two, though not as good as the first two. The movie begins with Will and Elizabeth's son, Henry, wishing to free his father of the curse from the third film. Orlando Bloom fans shouldn't get their hopes up, as his screentime is basically cameos at the beginning/ending of the film (including the post-credits scene). He fares better than Keira Knightley, though, who has a silent cameo at the end and post-credits scene (at least we get to see them reunited/have a happy ending).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow seems drunker during the beginning of this film than he has previously. If you're over his shtick by now, chances are you won't change your opinion now, but if you're up for one more adventure with Captain Jack, then just go along for the ride. At least his first scene in this film is better than the last two movies (just not as good as first two). By that point we've also met the adult version of Henry (Brenton Thwaites), who's after this film's 'McGuffin' that everybody wants (the Trident of Poseidon) in order to save his father, and astronomer/firm believer in science/skeptic of the supernatural, Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), who's constantly accused of being a witch and is the only one who can read the map that leads to the trident.<br/><br/>When the two newcomers aren't being tied up or shouting each other's names, they prove decent enough additions to the cast. Carina's intelligent, independent, resourceful, and crucial to the story; while Henry is...Will's son. Well, at least they're better than the missionary man/mermaid coupling of the last movie. While their characters certainly won't replace Will/Elizabeth as the romantic centre of the franchise, the actors try their darnedest to make their coupling work (with mixed results). They each work better playing off of Jack, actually. Kaya manages to make her character heroic without ever swinging a sword and her exasperation at being surrounded by pirates and their ignorance allows for a comedic touch. It's also revealed she has an important connection to Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. It's a shame they didn't get more time together.<br/><br/>Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar is thankfully at least more interesting a villain than Blackbeard (not hard, considering how underwhelming Blackbeard was). Salazar has undead sharks and a ship-eating ship at his disposal...which are somehow still less ridiculous than Blackbeard's magic-rope-controlling-sword and ship flame-thrower), though the most memorable thing about him is the effects used on him and his cursed crew (they're all floaty and have pieces missing). It's quite something. A flashback scene explaining Salazar's motives (and the origin of how Jack got his various accessories, including his hat), displays equally impressive effects with a de-aged Johnny Depp as young Jack. While interesting/informative, it may have been better placed at the *start* of the movie, as where it's actually placed in the film kind of brings the story to a screeching halt.<br/><br/>Filling the void of the weirdly 'hot' (despite efforts being made through make-up to appear otherwise) witch-type in place of Naomie Harris' Tia Dalma is Golshifteh Farahani as Shansa. Her character is bald, covered in tattoos and, like Salazar, in serious need of a toothbrush...but somehow manages to make the look *work* for her. She proves intriguing, but sadly disappears shortly after her introduction/feels underutilised. Gibbs is back once again, and he actually amused me at one point with how he managed to trick Scrum (a character I wasn't that fussed on in the last film, but since then I've seen the actor who plays him in the TV series Boardwalk Empire as Al Capone and what Gibbs does to Scrum here feels like payback for all of Capone's pranks...which might not be 'fair', but it gave me a laugh).<br/><br/>There are several big action set pieces throughout the movie, though the most visually dazzling one was near the end, set at the bottom of the ocean (which had been parted). The film's humour is hit & miss, some jokes work and some don't (Paul McCartney gets an amusing cameo). There's a couple of emotional beats that have some impact, but don't expect to be tearing up too much. Despite the fact this film, for all intents and purposes, seems like the 'final' one, there is the door left open for possibly more. However, it would be in the franchise's best interest to end things here. It mightn't be at the highest of highs, but neither is it the lowest of lows; so they should quit while they're ahead/make like dead men and tell no (further) tales."

","Great things about the movie:
1) The visual effects are mesmerizing.
2) The production design, costumes, make-up and properties are wonderful.
3) I appreciate the performances of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Armando Salazar, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, and Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, although not as great as in previous movies.<br/><br/>Weaknesses of the movie:
1) The story is not really interesting. The plot is weak, complicated, and coincidental.
2) The characters are not as interesting as in previous movies. Their introductions, development and roles are not done properly. Henry Turner and Carina Smyth are unnecessary additions, and the villains (Salazar, the Royal Navy) are not as compelling as before, in terms of story and portrayal.
3) The action scenes are boring.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) As always, the Royal Navy soldiers were ridiculously incompetent.
2) Why did the people accuse Carina as a witch? She did not do, look, or act anything bizarre. Although common people were ridiculously stupid, I could not understand their accusation. Not to mention the Royal Navy's hatred towards her.
3) In a world where magic, Kraken, ghosts, and curse existed, why did people in this movie (like the Royal navy crew and Carina) not believe in such?
4) The bank robbery was ridiculously not believable. The horses should have not been strong enough. The bank should have not been that mobile.
5) The execution of Carina and Jack could not be done properly.
6) How could Jack and his crew get away from the robbery? Why could the army not catch up?
7) Salazar could have just killed Jack easily when he could control water.
8) Why were Salazar and his men cursed? What did it have to do with the compass? How did Salazar know that it was the key to let them out of the zone?
9) How could Henry get away from the triangle zone?
10) How could Gibbs and the others get away from the British Navy ship?
11) How could Henry find Gibbs and the others to save Jack? Why would they even care? How could Henry find the money?
12) Why did Barbossa not let Carina to lead them in the first place? He, as captain, used starts to guide him.
13) Why were the people not familiar with astronomy? There was a shop with telescope.
14) Recurring characters did not seem like they aged.
15) It was too lucky that Henry, Carina and Jack could cross path, in terms of motivation, mutual goal, and relationship.
16) Carina could lead the way, but she did not have to steer.

","What the heck happened? I guess kids took over. That's what happened.<br/><br/>The obvious and brainless dialogue, nonsensical plot points, scenes that exist for no other reason than to exist, and thick exposition read out loud, covered by thick layer of CGI. It all makes me think that this film was constructed in a lab to appeal to kids who don't know any better. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw cartoony drawings of pirate Jack Sparrow as if they were leaflets at the Disney park.<br/><br/>The thing is, I am not sure it works for kids either, because there is metric ton of poorly weaved story beats that a kid would probably not care about. Some plot points appear to require you to have prior knowledge of previous movies, which makes things even more confusing. If you're going to make a movie that appeals only to kids, what's the point of adding complexity.<br/><br/>I don't know what I expected. I guess I expected that Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp are worth something, and they are at times, but the rest of the movie isn't and the two actors cannot save it. Even though Depp is doing his old tired act he's become known for, it's still entertaining at times. Whenever Bardem is on screen, that's when the movie captures your attention. The dialogue doesn't become any smarter, but somehow he is able to sell it well. But then the guy goes away for a while, and everything goes right back to suck kingdom.<br/><br/>This movie is an exceedingly dumb CGI fest and it's not for adults. May I suggest finding a youtube supercut of all the scenes with Bardem in it."

The plot is as farcical as ever, so don't expect a deep thinker - just enjoy the fun. Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbosa never disappoints and Javier Bardem delivers a decent villain in the form of Captain Salazar.<br/><br/>Don't take it too serious, switch off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: an action packed swashbuckling adventure."

","Part of me wishes that the title of this film were true. What I wouldn't give to have these dead men not tell their tale of revenge. That being said, I had some hopes that this movie would help redeem the franchise after the lackluster On Stranger Tides (2011). After all, Javier Bardem has proven to be an effective villain in such films as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Skyfall (2012), so I thought he could help carry this movie as a solid antagonist. Unfortunately, even he could not save this sinking ship of a franchise.<br/><br/>The main problem with Dead Men Tell No Tales is that it feels rote and uninspired. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow feels more lucky than actually talented at pirating. Granted, that was some of his charm in the previous films, but not all of it. Add to this a loose connection to the original trilogy as a vain attempt to remind the audience how great those films were, and it just highlights how bad this movie was. In fact, I felt the many overt double entendres were more groan-worthy than clever, merely pandering to the lowest common denominator. I can only assume that was why the doe-eyed and tightly bosomed Carina (Kaya Scodelario) featured into the plot so much.<br/><br/>In a franchise that stakes itself on wild swashbuckling action sequences, this film had maybe two of note, and even they were uninteresting at best. This movie might have been better if it picked its battles more carefully, as the plot seemed like a stone skipping along the sea: never going very deep into any single character's arc, thus making them all seem insignificant when compiled together. If it was merely about Salazar's (Javier Bardem) revenge, Henry's (Brenton Thwaites) desire to break his father's curse, or Carina's search for treasure; then it might have been interesting. Unfortunately, it is all of these things and none of these things at the same time.<br/><br/>A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise, I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 2.0 stars out of 5."

It is a great shame to see a great franchise go out with a whimper, but it happens more often than you'd care to think.<br/><br/>So, once again we catch up with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who's up to his old tricks. Once again there are couple younger actors playing foil to him, setting him up for hijinks and jokes. And once again there's a sea-themed threat to oppose both him and all sailors in general. This time the villain is played by CGI string puppet made to look like Javier Bardem. They will try to tell you that Bardem himself was involved, but this is obviously a lie.<br/><br/>And I could get behind that. On Stranger Tides was not as good as the two previous films, and to talk about it and the original Pirates of the Caribbean in the same sentence is just sad, but it was good entertainment for what it was.<br/><br/>But alas, this film is neither funny nor entertaining. Jack Sparrow is perhaps more absentminded than ever. At least in previous films he had moments of cunning and savviness. Here, simple drunken drawling, nothing more. Furthermore, the villain has no depth and no presence due to the obvious CGI gimmickry. The locations are not that interesting. The young couple are not that interesting. And it's just so... slap-sticky. Sure, the previous films had outlandish fight scenes and sets, but at least you could kind of suspense your disbelief. In this travesty that goes out the window in the first action set piece. They're not even trying.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is more sad than it is outright awful. The music is still nice, there are a couple cool scenes and the world is still intriguing. I would not recommend this to any diehard Pirates fan, because it's such a letdown, but if you've merely liked the previous films, you might find something worth your while in this as well."

I knew these movie were meant to be a comedy but I did love the scenes watching captain Jack, sword fights, devious plans and actually being a good pirate. <br/><br/>Then you reach ""Dead men tell no tales"" which seemed more of a joke to me, Jack is portrayed as a coward who runs from a fight and doesn't even seem like he knows how to use his sword. he has completely failed as a pirate. The film has no daring sword fights or ship battles.
Then you later encounter Will Turner who I dont even seem to know why he is in the movie, I get it is meant to tie in his happy ending, but in the third movie they make out he is happy to take on the responsibility of the Flying Dutchmen but then it sits at the bottom of the Ocean for 19 years. His son gets attacked and later Captured why couldn't dear old dad come to the rescue and see and awesome ghost ship battle. 
All together i think it is a very poor movie full of plot holes that they don't explain
What happened to Black Beards magic ship that Barbosa took over?
Why did Jack all of a sudden get bad luck, I know they hint Barbosa got a Witch to take care of his enemies, myself was curious if that caused Jacks bad luck but they never confirmed.
What happened to the other bag full of ships Jack stole from Black Beard?
The only reason i give it a 4/10 is due to the fact i believe the part of the fool that jack is meant to be was still played very well and i liked the back story it added regarding the compass."

","'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (2017)' is the latest in its financially viable yet creatively strained swashbuckling series, hitting the UK with a baffling alternate title (who on earth is Salazar?). The thing is disappointing, for sure; it's a huge step down for the franchise, which has been consistently good since its inception. The problems mostly come from the writing, as the visuals are typically on point. We're fed the same basic story we've been getting for the past four films, stripped down to its apparent essentials but lacking in its charm. Depp seems like he's done caring, coming across as a parody of what he once was (which was, essentially, itself a parody). He unenthusiastically stumbles about almost as if really drunk, while Bardem - in potentially his worst performance - chews the scenery like an untrained puppy. The hokey, near parodic plot pushes through its intangible, CGI-fuelled action sequences as if it can't wait to be over. It all feels somewhat inconsequential, even if it attempts to tie back into the 'original trilogy'. Of course, the thing does have its moments. Some of its action is decent and Rush's Barbossa is as good as ever. In the end, though, it's just mediocre. Its worst offence is that it's never really entertaining.

","In the past, sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, have been a rollercoaster in terms of quality, from the mediocre Stranger tides to the amazing At World's End, but that ends now.<br/><br/>This movie killed the franchise. That's all that anyone really needs to know, but here's my reasoning for why. <br/><br/>Well, first off, we were promised Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, but Will got a very minimal role, and Elizabeth had literally thirty seconds on screen. The movie even tried to replace their characters with Henry Turner and what's-her-face mathematician girl. <br/><br/>Of course, the movie retains amazing effects, music, and acting. But the plot of the movie killed everything. And though I blame this on the person who scripted the lines, and not Johnny Depp, but Jack Sparrow seems like a shell of his former self. Giving away the compass for a drink just doesn't seem like him. At least his comedic quotes stayed the same.<br/><br/>Some people have recommended not watching this unless you are a big fan of the franchise. I recommend the opposite.

","Pirates of the Caribbean 5 (yes, the fourth one exists) promises a return to the roots of this beloved franchise of scurvy dogs and misplaced rum. Critics are even claimng it will remind us why we love ""these movies"". I can only think of one Pirates film that I like particularly much, the first one, but if you can't get enough of Johnny Depp mugging and doing a funny voice, then fine. Just try to ignore the fact that your favorite clumsy charmer Captain Jack Sparrow is apparently in an in-canon sex trafficker now.<br/><br/>It is true that Dead Men Tell No Tales (known as Salazar's Revenge in countries that deem death too spooky) was made as a call-back to the one that started it all but I don't know how much consolation that is. One would think that it had been better to let Gore Verbinski come back and do his thing as opposed to having Disney executives try to replicate his vision to make money. But then again, Verbinski's latest contributions include The Lone Ranger and that Shutter Island rip-off so I can merely speculate.<br/><br/>We discover that, after the events of At World's End, former blacksmith and current barnacles-ridden first rank of The Flying Dutchman, Will Turner (40-year-old Orlando Bloom) fathered a child in the form of Henry (27-year-old Brenton Thwaites; you do the math), who now works for the British Royal Navy. One day, said navy is lured by pirates into what I assume is the Bermuda Triangle, disturbing the haunted shipwreck of Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), who promptly materializes alongside his undead followers. Killing nearly everyone on the navy vessel, Salazar lets only Henry live so that he can return home, to announce to Jack Sparrow that doom awaits him. Always good to let your enemies know that you're after them.<br/><br/>Returning home, Henry is sentenced to prison under allegations of mutiny, but is freed by another accused felon, an astronomer named Carina (Kaya Scodelario), sentenced for her blasphemous exploration of science. Eventually the two unite with Jack and his men, as Carina reveals that she knows the way to the Trident of Poseidon, an artifact that can release Will Turner from the curse of The Flying Dutchman and also maybe, just maybe, restore his relationship with Henry. That's about as much sense as I can make of what I saw in the order I saw it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Salazar escapes his enchanted prison and encounters Captain Barbossa (played again by a great Geoffrey Rush), whom he forces to help him find Jack Sparrow, so that he may exact his revenge properly. There are more characters; Kevin McNally once again plays First Mate Gibbs, Golshifteh Farahani portrays a sea witch, and David Wenham provides a secondary villain in the form of Henry's superior at the Royal Navy. Keira Knightley reappears briefly and, get this, Paul McCartney cameos as Jack's paternal uncle. They have the courtesy not to bloat it further with magical crabs and Davy Jones nonsense but a post-credit sequence tells me we haven't seen the last of Squidbeard.<br/><br/>I understand that reviewing a film like this is futile. It's been a while since people saw Jack Sparrow on the big screen and since he was the first man-crush a lot of people (my age) had, it makes sense that my Snapchat feed of post-ironic Chicken Run memes is frequently interrupted by nigh tearful messages like ""On Sunday, I will see you again"" written over an image of the movie ticket. Evidently, there is still treasure to be found, so it hardly matters if the rest of us are tired of the in-your-face 3D or cacophonic action that occurs along the way.<br/><br/>Another emotional aspect for many is the notion that this is the last film; a final return to the waters they've become so attached to. I mentioned money earlier. I don't think the post-credit scene is the only clue that this is far from being the end.<br/><br/>Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't without its redeeming features. Some of the new designs are deliciously nightmarish, the music is as fun as it's always been, the de-aged Johnny Depp we see in one scene was less jarring than he could have been, and most of the shots that would otherwise have been done by crane or helicopter were apparently done by drone. I for one never noticed and wasn't distracted, so good on you. Now knock it off."

Today I found it a real chore to sit through. <br/><br/>This movie represents a perfect example of what is wrong with movies these days 
a half-baked casserole of recycled elements from past installments of the franchise tossed together with lackluster action sequences and gratuitous special effects. like so many summer blockbusters, this is designed to deliver a momentary adrenaline jolt while providing audiences with a few familiar characters and elements. If it's the characters that keep film-goers coming back, Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is the character most (if not over 90%) of the audience turn up to see.<br/><br/>Captain Jack does not turn up until after 20 minutes. By which point I had considered turning it off twice. Depp who was paid $55.5 million for his role in the fourth movie, netted himself a pay rise as he was paid £60 million approx ($78 million). But (much like Sly Stallone in Rocky V) he seems to have totally forgotten how to play Captain Jack. Instead he seems to be doing a drunken impression. This is a totally different Captain Jack than the one we met 14 years ago!! <br/><br/>The douche Paul McCartney has a pointless cameo which he was no doubt paid a fortune for. <br/><br/>Salazar's Revenge, grossed $172 million at the domestic box office to end the year to 18th highest grossing movie of 2017. So domestically it was the worst performing pirate movie, by quite some distance.<br/><br/>The film was a financial success worldwide, grossing $794 million, to end the year the 11th highest grossing movie of 2016 worldwide.

In every other film he's at least a couple steps ahead of everyone, or uses other characters for his own benefit. In this he's a babbling idiot drunk who is given no clever lines and only states what's in front of him. Continuity error is HUGE in this, Jack's ""curse"" when he ""betrays"" the compass doesn't exist in the previous films, he gives it away/loses it at least 5 times. In Dead Man's Chest, we're told that Jack received the compass from Tia Dalma, the human form of the sea goddess Calypso. In this film it's his captain who gives it to him before he dies? What a waste there was so much backstory to show and connect here but the writer seemed dead set on wasting everything the previous films have built up for this film. Why they allowed this movie to be made based off a script that wasn't written by the original writers makes me sick to think about. He could have AT LEAST tried to connect this film with On Stranger Tides in some way, I don't see what the problem was with the mermaid character and the religious man, (they had their new ""will turner"" and ""elizabeth swan"" characters RIGHT THERE). They did not need to add stupid young adult offsprings of Turner and Barbosa, how awful an idea.

Sure, they're fun and they were both box office behemoths, but they were too crowded, too complicated, and too unwieldy. 2011's On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in the franchise, brought viewers back to a simpler story, but also managed to throw out all the fun and heart along the way as well.<br/><br/>So how does Dead Men Tell No Tales, the fifth film in the franchise, fare? Not well, I'm afraid. In fact, this film is easily the worst of the series and a major disappointment. Let's start with the small problems. Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario make their franchise debuts as Henry Turner (son of Will and Elizabeth) and Carina Smyth (the long-lost daughter of Captain Barbossa, the first film's main antagonist) and while they aren't bad characters, they also aren't very memorable. Other than their familial ties, the story doesn't really give us any reason to care for the duo. They're both wholly uninteresting and I wouldn't go out of my way to see a sequel revolving around them.<br/><br/>The story is another problem. Dead Men Tell No Tales brings us back to the complex, overloaded storylines of the first two sequels and it's really quite frustrating. Multiple plots are constantly happening at the same time and presented in a jumbled format, story threads are left dangling, and the characters are tossed from point to point like hacky sacks. Complexity can be good if presented correctly, but DMTNT is a mess that isn't much fun to figure out.<br/><br/>But perhaps the biggest failure of the film is the character of Jack Sparrow himself. The writers decided to capitalize on the comedic side of the character by making him as goofy as possible. Jack Sparrow has always been somewhat silly, but he was also a formidable fighter and intelligent badass in the first four films. Even when the sequels lost their way, Jack Sparrow made them at least somewhat worthwhile. That can't be said for this film. Jack doesn't have a single serious moment in the film and doesn't really do much of anything. He spends the entirety of the movie bumbling around, making jokes, and almost getting himself killed while Henry and Carina drive the plot. He's given a bit of backstory in this film, but it's insubstantial and doesn't counteract the absolutely imbecilic nature of present day Jack. It doesn't help that Johnny Depp seems positively bored as the character and almost as if he has forgotten how to play him. It's a shame that a character as iconic as Jack Sparrow has been brought to such a low level.<br/><br/>There are some positive aspects of the film. Geoffrey Rush is still fantastic as Hector Barbossa and his death scene is appropriately emotional. The finale and reunion of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is also fantastic. Their absence has hurt the most recent films since they brought a lot of charisma, chemistry, and star power to their roles. Javier Bardem does a splendid job as the film's main villain Captain Salazar, although he is severely underutilized. The visuals are unsurprisingly well-rendered (although those undead sharks are pretty abysmal) and the action set pieces are fairly well-executed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these few positive aspects can't save the film from being a soulless mess and an insult to the character of Jack Sparrow. How the mighty have truly fallen. I think it's far past time that we laid this franchise to rest. It has overstayed its welcome and is no longer the fun adventure it once was."

","These films are all just hot garbage. Cursed pirates are invincible but want to be able to feel, or die again need to be stopped by our main character. This is the plot to every Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Just hot Disney garbage."
"zimmerblake","5","1","1","22 January 2018"," Javier Bardem forgot how to be Spanish
","Javier Bardem changed his own Spanish accent a few times in the movie and it was hilarious. He said Jack Sparrow at least three different ways and would include the theta sound at random. Also, apparently the compass suddenly has new powers in this movie it didn't have before and ""dead men tell no tales"" but apparently hear enough gossip to learn a full backstory about Jack Sparrow."
"cutesd","2","1","1","20 January 2018"," Utter garbage
","I understand that Disney is in to this game to make money. And this movie did make money ... outside the US. And deservedly so ... it's a horrible horrible mess of a plot, terrible dialog, Jack's personality has been reduced to ""drunk guy"", the new characters are unexciting and lack both chemistry and charisma. Not to mention the complete waste of talent... bringing Kiera Knightly back for a hug and a kiss? I hope she charged them $10M for that.<br/><br/>Disney spent $230M on this picture ... why couldn't they get a decent script? It continues to be my issue with pretty much everything that Disney puts out. Why are their scripts such garbage? It's the cheapest part of the entire production. Why can't they do it better? This script wasn't even that terrible it just needed some good editing. A few tweaks here and there and it could've been great.<br/><br/>So why not do that? Why not hire some good script editors, make a movie that's actually GOOD and make even MORE money? Why not make a movie that doesn't get immediately panned by critics, is a huge splash in the US, and STILL kills overseas? Sounds like definitely the way to go. And yet ... <br/><br/>With this much money there's no excuse to make crap movies and yet Disney has made this their MO. So they have fabulous effects, decent actors, and just sh*t stories. Apparently they don't care."
"rebeccabritt","6","1","1","16 January 2018"," I expected more
","Well I enjoyed the cinematography which apparently is an indicator that I didn't quite have the time of my life watching the 5th instalment. I base this mainly on the sloppy plot that was rife with not only obvious plot holes (two different and unexplained origins of Jack's compass) but limp surprise plot twists (the whole daughter thing). For such a previously satisfying franchise I felt like a disappointed parent at a bad parent's evening, to start with the name Smyth is like the most generic surname in the western world, point of fact it was used in #1 to demonstrate that no questions need be asked about Jack when he steps into port, and yet the name rings a dim, and utterly random bell in his rum soaked brain. I don't think so. Secondly, when compared to the 4th sequel I found the humour in this one too desperate, there were too many people tied to masts and Jack's wit was severely lacking. However, the most unforgivable sin was Jack himself, he was too drunk and was subjugated to a side-lien character at best. 
While I'm here I may as well mention some other irritations, though briefly (thankfully). The Red Coats, there was some potential to a scene reminiscent to #3 when there was some pretty damn good double crosses and bargains struck, but instead they were eaten by Salazar's weird floating crocodile ship, a waste of a good bad guy (Wenham) if you ask me. And where were Will and Elizabeth for the entire film, because there is no way that they would sit at the side lines and wait around for everyone else (their son no less) to save them. I think those characters could have been capitalised on a little more. 
Not all complaining though, there were a couple of laughs, the opening scenes set up the film very well, I thought that there was good chemistry between pretty much all of the character dynamics and the bad guys were appropriately creepy (even before he died, that Salazar was not a friendly guy). 
And damn. You just have to love the soundtrack."

","So, what's Jack Sparrow doing in this film??!! He literally has nothing to do with the story. He is just following around !!! The wittiness, cleverness, and a grip on every situation all are missing from his character. <br/><br/>And no act to fuel the ""that's got to be the best pirate i have ever seen""<br/><br/>Only two characters, Carina & Henry, are playing their roles.
All side character are missing their own characteristics for which we loved them over the years. Mr. Gibbs, Marty, Barbossa and even the english captain are missing their strength. <br/><br/>""POOR"" is not enough to describe the this film from one of my favorite series"

"eddie_baggins","5","1","1","6 December 2017"," Another bumpy ride on the high-seas
","I can still remember heading along to Pirates of the Caribbean in 2003, a Disney movie based on a theme park ride that was never supposed to be anything more than a mildly amusing blockbuster but somehow ended up spawning a multi-billion dollar series that catapulted its then more art-house focused star into a Hollywood leading man.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski's movie was, against all the odds, a fantastically fun adventure, filled with great action, characters and humour, elements that were slowly but surely lost as the series went on and that all but disappeared by the franchise's misguided On Stranger Tides from 2011.<br/><br/>Like it's leading man Johnny Depp, the series was getting more tiresome as it went and in many ways its surprising Disney felt the need to unleash the franchises 5th feature film on us this year in the form of Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>Recruiting Kon-Tiki helmers Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg to oversee proceedings this time around, Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't a terribly bad film by any stretch of the imagination but its number 1 achievement is its ability to once more remind us just how good Curse of the Black Pearl was.<br/><br/>Wisely moving at a much fast pace than some of the previous bloated instalments, Dead Men moves at an almost alarmingly quick pace as we are introduced to new characters like rising Australian star Brenton Thwaites's Henry (son of Will) Turner, Kaya Scodelario's feisty and intelligent Carina Smyth and Javier Bardem's new baddie Captain Salazar, while still mixing in the old with Johnny Depp coming along for the ride once more as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery as pirate captain Barbosa.<br/><br/>Rønning and Sandberg no doubt didn't want us thinking too long and hard about an overly complicated story that includes Poseidon's trident, ghost ships, lost parents and the filmmakers throw set piece after set piece at us to keep our enjoyment levels up.<br/><br/>There is enjoyment to be found here as well, with a few hilariously inventive set-ups bringing the trademark Pirates lunacy and a few characters able to bring up the occasional belly laugh but overall the world of this franchise still feels like a rather so-so experience especially when placed up alongside the first adventure.<br/><br/>The heart and soul that was found originally has all but been lost with Jack Sparrow becoming more and more of an annoyance rather than a comical delight, while the films failure to capture any real heart is glaringly evident in the stilted and uninteresting romance between Henry and Carina and an atrociously bad cliffside ending that makes you screw up your face in disgust, rather than melt your heart.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>There's probably going to be another journey on the high seas for this franchise in the future but it would be great to see Disney start afresh in this world, as the continued return of characters and situations that initially worked no longer do, while Depp would do well to hang up his captains hat once and for all in hope some of the good will legacy can still remain intact for his character that he made his career around.<br/><br/>2 ½ pet sharks out of 5"
"wackywhovian11","4","1","1","3 December 2017"," Same Old Pirates Film
","Same old Pirates film then before. I gave it a 4 out of 10 because I liked the special effect of the villain and ship but that was about it. Basically the film is about Harry's Will Turner son is trying to find Jack Sparrow to help him get the Trident to bring the curse to get Will off the Dutchman. That's it. That's the film in a nutshell but without any spoilers add in. The reason I gave the film a 4 out of 10 because it was the same old Pirates of the Caribbean film like before. Jack gets drunk, Jack gets in trouble, the British army try to capture Jack but fail, Jack is about to be killed but oh by some miracle he's rescued by some mystery person or the same old trick where Jack is about to be killed but is saved by the last minute. Ugh it was just so annoying and I heard they're making another Pirates film. Why? I'm tired of these same movies by this series so I'm probably not going to see the next film unless it's on TV or on cable. The only positive of the film was that cute guy who played Harry he was adorable so that was a plus. <br/><br/>Should you see this film? Ugh well I guess if you like the same old movie over and over again and you already know the plot of the film then sure go ahead but if you don't then pass this one like a message in a bottle calling for help."
"michaelbozas","4","1","1","23 November 2017"," Mediocrity at its best.
","I don't know if I'm disappointed or surprised by this film. In one hand from the trailers it looked really bad and I went in expecting a worse experience that I actually had. In the other fan I'm a huge Pirates fan and I wanted something great to come out of a film where Javier Bardem plays a villain. But the final products is just...mediocre. I had minimal laughs and there were a few things I appreciate (I don't hate the film), but it might be the weakest film in the franchise. Johnny Depp is hurtfully unfunny in this and I was constantly finding myself wondering where the real Jack Sparrow was. The true show stealer (if you can call him that) was Geoffrey Rush, the only one that I actually think is great in all of these films. The newcomers were average, with some being less that that. The only thing except Rush that kept the film enjoyable at the minimum was the action and the cinematography. Sure it wasn't anything terrific, but it seemed as if people tried to make this film look pretty. While you might have some fun if you're a Pirates fan, I'd say to skip on this trip."
"studioAT","6","1","1","7 November 2017"," A vast improvement
","The 'Pirates' franchise has been a victim of the law of diminishing returns in my opinion. However, it was still a surprise to see this 5th instalment being touted as the 'final' film.<br/><br/>Salazar is hunting Jack down this time around, with Captain Barbosa only too happy to help. It makes for a dramatic and somewhat poignant finale.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed this film. I thought the shorter running time and the fact that the plot was somewhat simpler made a big difference. Yes, it's all very much on Johnny Depp's head to keep it all moving, but Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush both have their moments.<br/><br/>It also harks back to the original film at times too, and that can only be a good thing.<br/><br/>I don't for one minute think that this will indeed be the 'final' instalment, but if they do make more they should certainly use this as a blue print to follow."
"joepoma","Null","1","1","22 September 2017"," Made up for the last one
","The fourth movie was horrible and seemed to be a desperate attempt to keep the franchise going. They should have made the 5th one the 4th and ended it there. I liked this movie and it was fun. Sure, Jack Sparrow is nearing his end with regards to being funny but the other actors they inserted made up for it. I like that they brought some old characters back and introduced new ones and you didn't even notice and it all worked out. I highly recommend this latest pirates and I enjoyed it. Once again, don't listen to the critics folks. They only like movies that rock at sun dance or Cannes and have Streep in them."

","I was not sure what to expect from this after Pirates 4, so guess I kinda wen't in open minded.<br/><br/>First of they nailed the tone of the movie, it's back to the root of the first movie.<br/><br/>They introduce quite a few new characters, which worried me, because I was afraid it would make them too shallow. Luckily I actually felt i got to know them enough to care about them.<br/><br/>It's mostly me personally, but I really ain't' a fan of Javier Bardem, but he did work pretty well as a villain.<br/><br/>As expected the visuals were great, awesome effects and scenery which is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The music and sound effects where amazing, and several times downright epic.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect, and this had a few issues like any movie. Like most sequels, they try to top what was done before, and I felt sometimes it got to be to unreal, rather than being smart and funny.<br/><br/>Depp plays the role quite well, but he can't match is own performance from the first pirates, which I think most expected.<br/><br/>No spoilers. The story was rather good actually, and worked as a backdrop for for the action and where they went.<br/><br/>The story did have a some plot holes, and a few things wasn't explained too well, but overall it all made sense.<br/><br/>So a final thought, too all those who lost faith in Pirates of the Caribbean after the letdown of the 4th.

"newtido","8","7","18","27 May 2017"," A great comeback for a great franchise
","So I went to the theater with a lot concerns because this movie's meta-score is 38, and rotten tomatoes is 36 (oh god' it's low), but as soon as I sat down the first 10 minutes my concerns disappeared. So now, before we'll get to the good things, I wanted to write some of the problems I have with this movie.<br/><br/>First, It was slow. And when I say slow I mean, they weren't off this British island until the first half of the movie. Although, the scenes on the island are entertaining and funny, but the adventure it self was too short for me. I mean, in the last 4 movies they went from one island to another, with a lot of memorable places and in this one they didn't had any time for this kind of things because the adventure was too short. And another thing that bothered me was that the trident, that supposed to be the big interest of this movie had a small part, and most of the attention was on Salazar.<br/><br/>And now, the good thins. Well, Salazar. He is great. Javier Bardam was menacing, and his back story was understandable. Another good thing were the action scenes.Every time that a fight was going on it was exciting, huge, impossible and entertaining. As always, Johnny Depp is brilliant and funny, and also the supporting actors, lead by Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, Kaya Scodelario and Brendon Thwaites.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is way better than the 4 and the 3, and even ties up to the second. Go and see it (and it's way better than Baywatch, if you need help choosing). Ps. There's an post credit scene, so you should wait, because it's great."
"alanahsurfchick","6","6","15","8 June 2017"," A pretty damn funny adventure
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back again for another adventure on the high seas. This time he is pursued by a crew of undead sailors, led by the vengeful Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), who Jack previously scorned many years ago. Looking to save his skin, Jack searches for the legendary Trident of Poseidon with the help of headstrong astronomer Carina Symth (Kaya Scodelario) and Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). It's been six years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean and its great to see the return of familiar characters. Since this is the fifth film in franchise, it doesn't have to worry about developing its large cast of characters, as we have already got to know most of them in previous films. That being said, the film does give a good amount of development to its new characters. Especially Henry and Carina. They both have their own story arcs whilst also having an interesting relationship with one another. The film also has the traditional Pirates humour, making you laugh out loud. There are poorer aspects of the film though, such as the British Navy. They're poorly set up villains though thankfully they aren't in the film too much. There is also a death scene of a character, which, while sad, feels a bit unnecessary. Overall, this film was a swashbuckling, roller-coaster of an adventure that is by all means worthy of a trip to the cinema. The characters were likable and fun to watch and the humour tickles your funny bone."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","6","15","29 May 2017"," A decent, fun enough ride, could have been so much more however
","The best film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will always be the first, which is still a terrific film fourteen years later (has it really been that long, feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out).<br/><br/>Its sequels are not on the same level, and while they are a long way from flawless none of them are awful films either. They have their flaws, 'Dead Man's Chest' did get too frenetic sometimes, 'At World's End' was overlong, bloated and needlessly bloated and 'On Stranger Tides' (which has been dumped upon by many here but to me it was a very enjoyable film, one of the better sequels, and much better than given credit for, which is not going to be a popular opinion) had an underdeveloped and forced romantic subplot and too much filler that could have been trimmed in some places. They all have great merits, namely great visuals, exciting action, Hans Zimmer's music, Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge' has its defenders but has also been met with underwhelmed disappointment by critics and most fans. Personally am on the fence with 'Salazar's Revenge' and consider it one of the weaker entries generally of the series, with only 'At World's End' being weaker. It is a decent and fun enough ride, but it could have been so much more and has some glaring flaws.<br/><br/>It is easy to say forget the story, however this is a strong case of being very hard to do so when there is so little to it. It takes a while to get going and there are some real pacing problems in the final act, which has its good points but generally is very tedious. It is very thin for the running time and feels overstretched and bloated, giving the impression the film is too long. The script has some droll and witty quips every now and again, but mostly it is very weak with far too much of a rambling, improvisatory and random feel, it just doesn't feel that well structured. There is also a very bizarre exchange with Depp and Paul McCartney (whose presence is rather jarring).<br/><br/>Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are vastly inferior to Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, they lack presence and come over as bland and dare one say deadweight. The music score is rousing enough and creates some nostalgia, but can be overly bombastic and is too much of a retread from the music of the previous films. There is an overload of CGI effects, which standard-wise are mostly splendid though with some artificial ones too.<br/><br/>With all this being said, there are obvious merits here. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful and full of beauty and atmosphere, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and sumptuous and the effects are superb. As aforementioned the special effects are splendid quality-wise.<br/><br/>'Salazar's Revenge's' action is a lot of fun too, being coherent and exciting, especially the very scary one with the undead shark and the ending, which also does a good job clearing up loose ends. There are some great and suitably light-hearted comedy set pieces, like Jack being dragged by a building and clinging onto the guillotine.<br/><br/>Jack not being the central focus but still being essential to the plot proved to be a good move. 'Salazar's Revenge' succeeds in bringing a sense of nostalgia. Loved Barbossa's story arc, inarguably the film's most interesting which allows Geoffrey Rush to really sink his teeth and give a fun and moving performance. His revelation and his farewell was heart-breaking in its emotion.<br/><br/>Contrary to what some have said, apart from the newcomers to the franchise Thwaites and Scodelario as well as McCartney, the acting was fine. Although Johnny Depp's performance has been criticised, to me he still has the enthusiasm, sense of fun and swagger. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always, while an unrecognisable Javier Bardem (very impressively made-up) is simply brilliant and clearly having a whale of a time as perhaps the franchise's most sinister villain (if not the best, that title still belongs to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones).<br/><br/>Summing up, decent and fun enough ride that could have been so much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"tyson-hunsaker","4","6","15","27 May 2017"," Possibly unfair to expect anything more.
","The fifth installment of the Pirates franchise finds itself with a fresh director(s) and a ghostly Javier Barden as this adventure's antagonist. <br/><br/>It's difficult to judge this film properly given its context and timing. This film relies on the familiar fun, formula, and action the previous installments relied on. It has come during a year of nothing but sequels, prequels, and reboots which begs the question ""How are we not getting tired of this by now?"" <br/><br/>That being said the film is a fun ride. Really anyone who enjoys the previous films will most likely enjoy this one. It's the exact same recipe for swashbuckling fun and will most likely make money and please the crowd. Johnny Depp plays the same drunken buffoon he has in the last two. Our two young and supporting cast members fit into almost identical character types as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan from the original. We're treated to the same Barbosa and crew of misfits. Swordplay, dead people, curses of the sea, and of course the forever iconic Pirates score.<br/><br/>Perhaps because of the reasons previously mentioned, I believe this film fails. It was what I was afraid it was going to be: ""just another pirates movie."" The film takes no liberty of trying anything new or exciting. Instead, leans on Jack Sparrow's bumbling gags, generic fantasy themes, and irrelevant subplots. <br/><br/>The film as a whole feels like a 100% cash grab. There isn't a worthwhile story to tell nor is there something new this film would like to offer to cinema or even its own franchise. It feels like Disney cashing in their titles for easy popcorn entertainment. <br/><br/>Really if that's the goal, popcorn entertainment, then this film will suffice. It's got a few laughs and is reasonably superior to its predecessor. However, anyone looking for a new, fresh, and fantastic movie about pirates won't find it here. Definitely one you can skip but if you don't, no harm done."
"shivamt25","5","6","15","27 May 2017"," Repetitive and boring
","Dead men tell no tales takes Jack Sparrow, Henry Turner and Carina Smyth on an adventure of finding Poseidon's trident, which has the capability of giving its bearer the full control of the sea. Henry is non-other than the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Kiera Knightley) from the 'Curse of the Black Pearl' trilogy. Henry wants this trident to break his father's curse. But like all the other POTC movies, there is a villain who wants the same thing at the same time and also, wants to kill Jack Sparrow. And there is Barbossa because he has to be in all the movies. <br/><br/>A critic from Screencrush wrote, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales is the sort of sequel that's so bad it makes you retroactively wonder why you liked the original film so much in the first place."" I just watched it and felt the same. They have put all expected clique of the previous movies and mixed it up to present before the audience hoping that we will like it. We liked it the first time, In 2003, when Curse of the Black Pearl came, everyone was in love with the character 'Jack Sparrow'. It was a completely satisfying swashbuckler fun but it was also complete in itself. After looking at its success, they made two more. I won't deny saying that I found them okay too as any production house might have done that and also, they were not quite bad. The trilogy was complete and they should've stopped there. But, then the graph took a nosedive. <br/><br/>On Stranger Tides was bad but this one is a mistake. It is so boringly repetitive that I lost interest during the climax. The jokes were not funny this time. It felt as if they asked Johnny Depp to do something 'Jack Sparrowy' and they recorded it. The character additions played by Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario were not convincing enough. Geoffery Rush's Barbossa is now unbearable. Javier Bardem tried but you cannot save a sinking ship alone. They even tried to bring some characters from the initial movies back to send you into nostalgia but it is not going to work. <br/><br/>These thoughts about how much I disliked the movie came later. What came to my mind after coming out of the theater is that there were serious plot holes. SPOILER ALERT => Salazar and his crew had some connection with Jack's compass. They came to attack mode after Jack gave it away. But as far as I can remember, Jack has lost it or given it away to someone a dozen of times in previous installments. Where was Salazar then?<br/><br/>It's not like there is nothing to like, there are some moments to laugh. Also, visual effects are great. But the series has lost its touch. Maybe instead of heavily relying upon Jack Sparrow to make people laugh, they should focus more on what else can be done, what new horizons can be explored. I am telling this because they are planning to make another one. It is starting to feel like transformers, should've stopped after the first one, or after the trilogy."
"viktoreeckhout","7","8","22","27 May 2017"," Fun, exciting, but not great
","I think the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was one of the first movie series together with star wars that I absolutely adored. At Worlds End was the first 'non-kidsfilm' I saw in a movie theatre. I saw Salzar's Revenge yesterday and right of the bat, the music and sets brought me back to 10 years ago. The overall movie is a fun and exciting experience. Other than the nostalgia I felt, the movie wasn't really memorable.<br/><br/>They introduced new characters, such as Henry and Carina, but they weren't as memorable as Captain Jack Sparrow or Will Turner. The music wasn't scored by Hans Zimmer this time. That is probably the reason why the score is made up of variations of the original movies' score, but I don't really mind it.<br/><br/>Bardem's and Rush's acting is like I was used to. They are both really committed actors and that's clear by watching the movie. It is clear that Depp just agreed to do this movie to get a fat pay check. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw Paul McCartney in a scene, but that scene could have easily been cut and it wouldn't have made a difference. Still, considering I'm a huge Beatles fan, watching McCartney perform and even singing a Beatles song (Maggie Mae) was fun and put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>The film takes off by introducing Henry to the audience. Henry's motivations are explained in a believable way. He wants to find the Trident of Poseidon which can break any sea curse to save his father, Will Turner, from his curse that goes back to the third movie. After that, the main villain, Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), is introduced. The scene is well shot and you can feel the tension of the characters. After that, a huge (and probably very expensive) action sequence takes place where we meet the old gang. The pirates (Jack, Gibbs, Scrum and some others) try to rob an unrobable vault on the island of Sint-Maarten. The action is way over the top, like we are used to in these movies, but it is very fun to watch. During the heist, we are greeted by another new character, Carina. Her character is a strong, female scientist in a world ruled by men. I really like the writers' idea to constantly make fun of the idea. The fact that she is a woman of science is constantly mocked by her being called a witch. It's a nod to the cinema of the past 2-3 years, where classic franchises, such as Ghostbusters, are remade with female leads, just because they are women, but they're not given anything special that differentiates them from their male counterparts. It's something I'd not expected from Disney, but I'm very pleased they made this choice. After the heist, the audience is introduced to 'A new Jack Sparrow'. Sparrow, once the most famous, successful pirate in the Caribbean, is losing the support of his crew because of his greedy lifestyle and the fact that he has become the most miserable pirate in the Caribbean, it's like Johnny Depp is playing himself. Not much is done with this subplot other than an occasional joke. To me, it's just an excuse to let Jack wonder around Sint-Maarten on his own, so that he can release Salazar by giving away his compass. When Salazar is released, he's out for revenge on Jack Sparrow. With the help of Barbossa, who finds Jack's compass, he tries to find Jack and kill him. The only hope for Jack to lift his curse is finding the Trident of Poseidon. After that, the film just consists of action scenes, silly jokes and minor character development. In other words, not much to talk about.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, are the groundbreaking visual effects. ILM, once again, didn't let us down and delivered some beautiful, convincing CGI mixed with some amazing practical sets. I often had to guess what was real and what was fake. The sound design by Skywalker Sound was great, like always. When it comes to visual and sound effects, there is absolutely nothing to complain.<br/><br/>All in all, I hope they never make a POTC film again. Not because they're bad films, but in my opinion, they should've finished the franchise with the third film. The ending of the film didn't really suggest the making of a sequel, but that satisfied feeling quickly went away when the post credit scene revealed that Davy Jones might be coming back in a potential sequel. I guess we'll have to wait and see.<br/><br/>I think the movie is entertaining and really worth a watch. It's good fun, but don't expect anything groundbreaking or revolutionary. I wouldn't say it's as good as At Worlds End, but it's definitely better than On Stranger Tides."

","14 years ago I was in the cinema with my family. Although being only 10 years old at the time, I still remember like it was yesterday, the first time I met Captain Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>Since then, I've been an eager fan and attended every Pirates of the Caribbean screening. However, I must admit that it has been downhill since the Curse of the Black Pearl. Until today. Today I attended an early premiere of Dead Men Tell No Tales, curious about whether my fellow Norwegians, Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, would manage to take the saga back where it belongs. And I am proud to say, they have pulled it off.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there are numerous exciting scenes with a perfect mix of action and humorous dialogue (especially from Jack Sparrow, who finally got the script he deserves). Also, Javier Bardem was as frightening as only he can be, playing the villain, Capitan ""Salamander"". <br/><br/>In contrast to the forth movie, where I was yawning half way through, looking at the clock, I did not take my eyes off the screen once during this one. Even though the final sequence of the movie was a bit cheesy and could have been executed better, this was overall a great movie, and I'm sure the billions of marketing spent on promoting it will be well worth it!"

","The review for the latest installment of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film franchise is fairly simple - did you enjoy the other Pirates movies (or at least one of them?).  If you did, then you'll enjoy this one.  It is a very well made - and faithful in tone, style and content - entry in this long running franchise.<br/><br/>Fortunately for me, I enjoy these films, so I had a great time in the cinema - enjoying a film equivalent of comfort food.<br/><br/>Once again, Johnny Depp is back - and in his element - as rogue pirate CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.  Depp knows this character well and plays him with a major wink in his eye always bringing him to (but never going over) the line of caricature - keeping Jack a person and not a cartoon (not an easy thing to accomplish).<br/><br/>Directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg (best known for the TV show MARCO POLO) and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) - do a very smart thing.  They know that a little of Captain Jack goes a long way, so - even though he is central to the story - they use Sparrow sparingly throughout so when he is on screen creating havoc, you enjoy his hi-jinks as opposed to getting sick of them.<br/><br/>Consequently, the core of this film must fall to someone else - and it falls to the very capable hands of Geoffrey Rush (back as Barbossa) and Javier Bardem (as the bad guy in this tale - Captain Salazar, seeking revenge).  Both of these veteran actors commands the screen when they are front and center with Rush, especially, taking charge in a character he knows very, very well.<br/><br/>Add to these two the obligatory ""young loves"", played (this time) by Brendan Thwaites (MALIFICENT) and Kaye Scodelario (The MAZE RUNNER films).  They more than hold their own when the weight of the story shifts to them, with Scodelario rising above - she is an actress to keep an eye on.<br/><br/>And...of course...we have the regular ""rogues gallery"" of Pirates - bringing back old favorites Gibbs (Kevin McNally), Scrum (Stephen Graham), Marty (Martin Klebba) and even the monkey - Jack.  All welcome returnees.  There also are two other characters from earlier Pirates' films that show up (but telling you who this is would spoil it) and a very nice cameo by a major Rock Icon who plays Jack Sparrow's Uncle Jack.  A totally needless and throwaway cameo, but fun and welcome nonetheless.<br/><br/>Kind of like this film - it's like eating a juicy piece of watermelon on a warm summer's day.  A welcome and tasty treat.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  B+<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

"rgkarim","8","8","23","25 May 2017"," Set Sails For Calmer Waters!
","Avast ye scurvy scoundrels, it be Captain Robbie of the S.S. Review, sailing the seas of the cinema in search of the treasure known as a good movie. Alas, this weekend Admiral Bruckheimer's armada set out on a fifth voyage with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp)<br/><br/>taking the wheel once more. Will this adventure be smooth sailing and reward us with a crown jewel, or will we be drowned in the sea of sorrow at another hand me down adventure? Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A pirate's life for me, drink up me hardies, sit on your captain's chair and read my thoughts on Pirates of The Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales. <br/><br/>Summary: When it comes to the plot of these movies, one never knows if they'll find gold or mere rocks. The fifth installment is fortunately back on the path to good storytelling, focusing on the characters instead of well immortality. Among the number of scallywags, we get some background on about five of the cast, each with a unique angle to help them stand out. While certainly not the best story, it is miles above the mess number four was. <br/><br/>The story is a nice component, but the acting is really the aspect that brings the pirate's life to welllife. Newcomers like Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are a welcome addition that have spunk, class, and a number of other qualities that many will latch onto, (especially the cute factor) and they aren't bad to look at either. Scaring is way into another antagonistic role, Javier Bardem brings his bag of tricks back to the screen, including the suave accent and cantor that oozes evil. Of course the main two you are probably coming to see are Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, the legendary captains we fell in love with in the first movie. Rush is incredible, bringing the sea saltiness and arrogance that is the famous Captain of the Black Pearl. Depp on the other hand is as enigmatic as ever, capturing the goofiness, lackadaisical attitude of Sparrow with a dash of heroic charm. Together, the two actors lead not only the character development, but the comedy. Yes Pirates 5 certainly has the laughs in spades, using every in their arsenal to get a chuckle. I loved the clever word play, idiotic banter, and comedic timing in this movie, which helped relieve the darker aspects of the film. <br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't be a pirate's movie without incredible special effects. Yes Disney and Bruckheimer combined their studios to bring the magic back to the screen. Chaotic maelstroms expand across the vast screen, as ships sail across dead infested waters, firing explosive cannons at the specters that haunt the blue. The journey is certainly beautifully illustrated in a mix of art and excitement, all under the unifying banner of the epic orchestra work we all have come to love. <br/><br/>Summary: Alas, despite the jewels that sparkle in the distance, the story still needs some work. With five main stories, each a different motif to quest for the elusive item, the plot gets spread thin and deprived of real sustenance into the character's history. Sure, one of the stories has more bite than the others, but this Pirates took a hit in the rich depth we have come to expect. Therefore, the bland characters were lacking at times and not as strong as I had hoped. <br/><br/>Even more bland are the action scenes that they tried to bring to the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are some beautifully animated battlegrounds in the movie, it's just that they lack the same sting I feel in love with. Where were the epic sword fights between two swashbuckling men amidst dangerous landscapes? Where were the notorious ship to ship battles where a well- placed cannonball and evasive maneuver meant the difference between life and death? And where was the suspense and thrills that kept me on edge all those previous installments? I'm not sure, but Pirates 5's action scenes were malnourished forms of battle I loved, with many scenes reduced to pan over shots of extras fighting CGI enhanced ghosts. A few scenes were gaining the potential to be awesome, but comedic relief set in and reduced it to some quick ended scuffle that quickly turned to running. Glad to know our pirates could have run track. <br/><br/>And finally, the cameos. While certainly a great tool for nostalgia, most of the cameos were shallow shout outs to the characters we have wondered about. It allows for some neat little tie ups at times, but these less than 5 minutes screen appearances were missed potential. Only Paul McCartney, the legendary beetle, was able to pull off an appearance that was worthy of being included well done Paul. <br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>Pirates 5 took a step in the right direction with its returned to character driven story, comedic style, and special effects that scream pirates. However, it still has room to improve to get back to the glory of the first film. It's unbalanced at placed, and lacks the excitement of the battles, or an exciting conclusion at all to wrap up the supposed final entry. Seems they wanted more of a comedy than anything else, and one will certainly enjoy the laughs, and most likely the movie, if you go in for the comedy over everything else. Worth a trip to theaters? I'm sure you would still go regardless what I said, but the special effects are certainly worthy of the theater's sound and video. Yet you could still hold off on this film and check it out at RedBox, because this finale sets up the series for yet another installment. Finale chapter my butt!<br/><br/>Scores:<br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
"openyoureyesmediainc","5","3","6","15 September 2017"," The worst Pirates Of The Caribbean film
","The fifth film in the Pirates-series is in my opinion the worst in the franchise.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge does give us some pretty entertaining moments. The visual effects are very good, and the acting is overall very good. I think that the screenplay for the film was really badly written and gives us a very sloppy story. There are some good character moments, mainly from the new lead actress and Barbosa. The only characters in the film I enjoyed watching. Johnny Depp was really disappointing in this Pirates film, and half of the time he was just drunk on set, which really showed and it made it painful to watch him on screen. <br/><br/>The film starts really well. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to gradually decline and get worse. In addition I think there are a lot of characters that just don't do anything to the story.<br/><br/>The decision to bring back Orlando Bloom to play Will Turner is fundamentally a good one, but I'm so disappointed with his involvement in the film. It seems Disney only took him back to promote the film and lure old fans back for more. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem does an okay job as the films villain, but there was nothing special about his performance. <br/><br/>All in all, I would say that I am very disappointed with this film, and really hope we don't get any more Pirates films. I didn't have huge expectations to begin with, but I thought the film would deliver more than it did."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","6","8 September 2017"," Another Addition To The Franchise That Nobody Gives A Damn About Anymore
","Another unnecessary addition to the franchise that already sailed into the sunset on a satisfactory note a decade ago, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth instalment in the series nobody gives a damn about anymore, tries so hard to be funny that it's actually pitiful, and fails to move an inch off the seabed after On Stranger's Tides sunk it in such spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>Set 5 years after the events of the last movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales finds Captain Jack Sparrow being pursued by an undead sea captain & his crew after he unwittingly sets them free. Joined by Henry Turner, an astronomer & an old friend-foe, all on board with agendas of their own, his only hope of survival lies in seeking the trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that would grant him control of the seas.<br/><br/>Directed by Joachim Rønning & Espen Sandberg, the film lifts its plot outline from the first entry in the saga yet is devoid of all the elements that turned it into an instant classic right away. Direction is poor as the plot feels repetitive, convoluted & bloated. Writing is just as bad, for the returning characters have got nothing to add while the new characters are more or less hopeless and have no meat on their arcs.<br/><br/>A number of scenes pay homage to earlier entries of this series but they don't mean much because just like everything in the movie, it feels forced as if slapped on to the narrative just for the sake of it instead of contributing in any meaningful manner. Despite running at 129 minutes, which makes it the shortest entry in the series, the film feels overlong & bloated, thanks to its lazy editing. And the background score isn't any different this time.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the returning cast of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush & Kevin McNally, in addition to Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley, reprise their respective roles while new additions include Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites & Kaya Scodelario who play Captain Salazar, Henry Turner & Carina Smyth respectively. And yet, there isn't one performance in the picture that stands out or leaves anything remotely resembling a positive impression.<br/><br/>Depp's acting career has been on a downward spiral for a while now and even a return to his most iconic role fails to turn things around for him as Jack Sparrow in this instalment is more annoying than amusing. Rush condones to tag along with the circus for another easy check. Bardem is truly wasted in the role of Captain Salazar, while Thwaites & Scodelario are the new Bloom & Knightley in this soft reboot but neither their individual inputs nor their chemistry ever hits the right note.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an unneeded instalment to the saga that was better off as a trilogy & shouldn't have been disturbed ever since. Incompetently directed, poorly scripted, lazily edited, awfully paced, terribly performed & marking the departure of Hans Zimmer from the franchise as well, there is just about nothing that works out in the film's favour. In the end, it's just as appalling as the previous entry, if not more, and needs to be put out of its misery. Just skip it."

","I am a sucker for the Pirate movies, because I just still am a big fan of the Captain Jack Sparrow character. And that is just the movies, not to mention all the charity work Johnny Depp does by visiting Hospitals and what not in costume/character. But back to this, which brings back the fun and is relatively ""normal"" when you take the story. It's not too complex, one of the things previous sequels were condemned for.<br/><br/>We do get a bit of throwback by connections to previous movies, though generally speaking you don't have to have seen them to enjoy this. Though as every other Pirates movie this has a scene after the credits. Which generally makes you wonder if there will be more? This was supposed to be the last of them ... and it would make a good closing chapter ..."
"chrischristodoulakis","8","3","6","29 June 2017"," A notable effort of approximating the glorious early days of the franchise.
","Exciting, thrilling and very funny, the fifth installment of our beloved franchise, comes with the great burden to clean up the mess that ''On Stranger Tides'' evoked and restore the greatness of Pirates of the Caribbean. The plot is very interesting and arouses immediately the attention of the viewer with a villain that can easily be compared even to the great Davy Jones. The introduction of Will Turner's son is also a pleasant and mysterious addendum to the plot. Johnny Depp although satisfactory finds himself struggling to imitate his old self, with jokes and facial expressions which are rather played out and don't manage to shock the audience. In addition, the visual effects seemed quite fake, giving me the impression I was watching an animation movie in certain scenes. Despite these weaknesses, the movie was fascinating and moving. Totally worth watching, although everyone can agree that the first three installments will never be counterbalanced."
"bratxja","7","3","6","11 June 2017"," An intelligent movie with a strong script? Are you drunk?
","Let's make the point. What are you looking for? A strong script, a dark atmosphere and an unexpected twists? And you going to watch Pirates? In this case score it as sh... bad film and let us have done with it. But if you are looking for action, jokes and Jack Sparrow (sorry, captain Jack Sparrow) then you are in the right place.<br/><br/>Critics vs Fans<br/><br/>So, you can rate movie from 1 to 10 based on your expectations. Is this the best part of the Pirates and the best role of Johnny Depp? Of course not! But is this the worst movie you have ever seen? Nope. <br/><br/>I'm really annoyed by people who criticize the Pirates for ""stupid action and lack of ideas"". And because of the use of the charismatic character of Johnny Depp. 3 of 10, no more! However, Fast and Furious, they said, is good movie. Without weaknesses of the Pirates. Double standards. <br/><br/>Pluses<br/><br/>My expectations were not high: Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, pirates and action. Not so much, actually. After several shocking bad movies, I doubt sequels. <br/><br/>We have Jack Sparrow, I think that this is one of few reason why people go to this movie. For me interesting character is Barbossa, with his evolving from evil to chaotic good. If you like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley they also return... for a few minutes on the beginning and at the end. Besides, do you remember the names of their characters? <br/><br/>Then action, action, action with some jokes. And cool graphics. <br/><br/>Minuses<br/><br/>I will mention only a few of them, that tortured my brain the most. The script. OMG, where did you get it? It's... it's...it's at the level of a book for children. You must turn off the brain and don't ask questions! Script has several interesting scene, for example how Jack got his nickname. But at all it's too childish. <br/><br/>Villain. Captain Salazar is the most non-charismatic and poor villain of all Pirates. He is some sort of hybrid of Davy Jones and Barbossa from first Pirates without charm. <br/><br/>""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. Didn't expect to see him in the minuses? In this part I realized who Jack is - he is a loser. Judge for yourself - in the final he gets all prizes, but every movie we meet him at the social bottom. This part of Pirates emphasizes his failures. It's problem of script. <br/><br/>Sea battles. Yes, we have them. But creators on the way to the Fast and Furious model. Ships - have, sea battles - who loves them? <br/><br/>Because of my expectations and just because of them - 7/10"
"iamjacksmoviechannel","7","9","27","24 May 2017"," Better than On Stranger Tides
","Dead Men Tell No Tales is the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although really it may as well be called The Quest to Prevent Johnny Depp's bankruptcy. <br/><br/>Whether or not you think the character of Jack Sparrow has reached his limit, and apparently everyone from Johnny Depp's kids to Depp himself has an opinion on that, Depp's personal and professional woes over the past years (Amber Heard, Lone Ranger) have tied his and Disney financial fates together apparently and made the box office for this far more interesting than the movie itself. <br/><br/>It's gotten so bad that there are apparently plans being made for additional Pirates movies, just maybe rebooted without Depp. Which is ridiculous because that's like sex without genitals. <br/><br/>So here's Jack 5.0, the character is now a washed up alcoholic, devoid of treasure and abandoned by his own crew. It's no surprise Depp helped out newcoming screenwriter Jeff Nathanson. This is probably his most personal piece of work in years. <br/><br/>It's also no surprise we get as many jokes as we do in the early going. This is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 at sea basically, although here it's for a different reason. <br/><br/>Pirates has always been a series with pacing issues and no more did this feel more apparent to me than with ""On Stranger Tides"", where Depp just didn't seem his same witty self, and nothing else really picked up the slack either. <br/><br/>Here it's jammed full and he's doing his best to sell them all. There's even a moment with a guillotine that's one of the best sight gags i've seen in a while. Yes there is an annoying factor to this and yes there are quite a few that don't hit and yes as it goes on the jokes seem to dry up but this is a much funnier, more enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>It's also a more action packed one. The bank heist that starts the film keeps with these movie's wild spirit and there's a lot of over-the-top stuff that follows involving sharks and splitting the sea in half. Hey, if Fast and Furious can do an action sequence on a sheet of ice, then these Pirates can play Moses for a little while. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem's Captain of a ship full of zombie dead men intent on revenge also helps this a long really well. Bardem not only looks hauntingly scary but he puts an inflection on the dialogue to make it seem like almost like he's choking on his own blood. <br/><br/>But what makes him probably the best villain in the series since Barbosa is that he does have a backstory that puts him on a collision course with Captain Jack and gives us the origins of the Jack Sparrow name and legend at the same time. <br/><br/>Other than that there's not much that's new here. There's a MacGuffin everyone is trying to find; in this case it's a Trident. And then there is the British Navy, Barbosa, and anyone else willing to chase Jack around for the over 2 hour running time. <br/><br/>Brenton Thwaites is also in this movie. He's that kid who Hollywood is trying to turn into the next heartthrob action hero only the problem he's been given either bland characters to work with or God's of Egypt. His impression here is equally minimal. <br/><br/>He plays Will Turner's son. Kaya Scodelario plays a scientist. Both are searching for the Trident for different reasons. However the only reason they're here is because young love, and sometimes objectifying young love for laughs and or PG-13 titillation, is what the young people want. <br/><br/>Both super attractive in any case. Unfortunately Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have been pushed to what amounts to cameos. <br/><br/>So overall this is pretty familiar territory and it's hard to imagine it without Depp but it's eager to please. It will probably only please the die hard fans but it is eager to do so and I for the most part had fun with it for that reason. <br/><br/>So I go 7 out of 10.

"The-Sarkologist","5","6","16","27 May 2017"," Beating out another Film
","Just when you thought that they had killed off a franchise, all of a sudden they seem to be able to resurrect it for just one more movie. Judging by the user rating on IMDb (which in my opinion is much more reliable because, well, I generally pay no attention to critics) this seemed to have been well received, though judging by the comments as I was leaving the cinema it seemed to be completely the opposite. As for my opinion, it was a fun film, and somewhat enjoyable, but like the previous film in the franchise, it just seemed like they were flogging a dead horse. Hopefully this is the last Pirates of the Caribbean that we see for a very long time, or even ever.<br/><br/>The film takes us down a generation so we have the son of the heroes from the previous films (though it had been so long since I have seen them I can't actually remember their names). His father has been cursed to dwell at the bottom of the sea living an undead existence, so he has sworn to find the trident of Poseidon and thus break all of the curses of the sea. As for Jack Sparrow, he is basically a drunkard without a ship, and without a life, and is wandering around aimlessly. However, he gives up his compass for a drink, which unbeknownst to him, released a ship full of undead spirits who are seeking revenge.<br/><br/>Basically it is another Disney movie, so expect a lot of swashbuckling mixed with fantasy elements. Actually, come to think of it, it seems to have a lot more supernatural and horror themed elements than fantasy elements, but I suspect they are trying to capture the essence of the period. Basically this is set in a time, during the rise of the British Empire (probably sometime in the 18th century), where superstition and religion are giving way to science and reason. In another sense, what they seem to be doing is drawing all of the elements of the pirate adventure and bring them together into a unique film.<br/><br/>As I mention previously, it is an okay film, but nothing hugely spectacular. I enjoyed, and in a way it was a decent night out, even if it was simply around the corner at the cinemas (which is a little longer than that, but that is beside the point). As for its re-watch value, well, I probably should get around to watching the first three again, but I doubt I would go much beyond that. Fun, but easily forgettable."

","I had to write a review because I feel this movie is getting unfairly ripped apart by the media. Dead Men Tell No Tales might be the best Pirate movie since Dead Man's Chest. That said, the Pirates franchise is not everyone's cup of tea. Convoluted story lines and nonsensical action sequences are traditions of the franchise. It just wouldn't be a Pirate movie if it didn't go on for at least a half-hour too long. Personally I love every ridiculous minute of the franchise, and I think DMTNT is a great addition to it. It is far better than the 4th installment, On Stranger Tides, that somehow managed to make a Pirate movie boring. This time around there is a much better villain, and we are emotionally invested in the story right away because of the tie-in to the original characters. It certainly isn't a perfect movie, but it's a fun 2 hours to spend at the theater. I am certain that if you enjoyed the second and third Pirate movies, you will enjoy this one. Fans of the series will especially love the ending that was 10 years in the making. Also, there is a scene after the credits that may or may not set up a 6th movie. Only time will tell."

","This is my first film from this particular series. If the earlier ones are anything to go by this installment, I'd have to conclude that it's vastly over-rated and pretty boring - or at least, this one is.<br/><br/>The action and the 3D effects do wake one up in between and begin to catch your interest a bit, but then the slow plot and in fact a very nonsense kind of story diminishes everything.<br/><br/>As a side-note, is that what Captain Jack Sparrow is all about? In this one at least, he plays the role of a passenger who's carried by others, and circumstances, here and there with him being in control of not even an ante. Some of his dialogues do provide a good comic relief, but surely that's not why they cast Johnny Depp? His role was nothing less than that of a joker."

Credit to the directors, and Javier as the bad a$$ villain! Definitely up there as one of my favourite Potc films! Here's to the next one!"

","I have seen several reviews of this film and these, along with my past experience of On Stranger Tides, made me seriously sceptical about going to watch this movie. I am so pleased that I did! Everything that On Stranger Tides wasn't, Dead Mean Tell No Tales is. Fantastic job, getting us back to the characters we know and love. Thoroughly enjoyable for the entire family. Jack and the rum are certainly back in the way that they were always meant to be."
"arianna_n","8","6","17","27 May 2017"," We needed more scenes with Will and Elizabeth
","As other posters here, I grew up watching Pirates of the Caribbean. To the point I was literally obsessed with the franchise. I have watched the first one countless times (more than 10 for sure), and the others, while not my favorite, at least 5 or more times. Maybe it is because I was a little girl when I started watching them, but I have always loved all installments. Including this new one. <br/><br/>When they said that Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann)were returning, I was so happy. But they only appeared on screen for a couple of minutes that I think it was not worth it. I know Keira said sometime ago that she would never return to the franchise but this return was kind of disappointing. Maybe if they did 10 minutes of screen appearance I would have been content.<br/><br/>On another hand, while it is predictable, it is also a very entertaining film. It had all the points of the previous ones that made it a really fun watch. <br/><br/>I do really recommend it, specially to people like me who grew watching this, and to teenagers. Kids under 12 might go with parents. But after all, then I remember I was barely 8 when the first one was premiered, and my little sister was 6, and besides my sister saying ""Rum for all"" at every family gathering, we didn't understand the double-meanings until we were teens and adults."
"admcdonough","8","6","17","27 May 2017"," Solid Entertainment
","I wasn't really expecting that much out of this film as I rarely do out of films that are sequels in a long series. And for the most part the comedies that have been out lately have been very disappointing. But I was pleasantly surprised. The action scenes are good, the special effects are very impressive and there are plenty of good one liners that will bring a chuckle in the film. The film moves along at a quick pace and the cast were all very good. You expected Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush to be good since they always are and Johnny Depp has the Jack Sparrow character down to where he could probably play him in his sleep. Kevin McNally and Stephen Graham are also back and again provide solid laughs. Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario are the new two young characters a la Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (who both appear in minor roles themselves that are basically just cameos). They are well cast for the roles and deliver what they were cast for (both are young, energetic and good looking). The plot isn't the movie's strong point, but is is good enough to move things along quickly and to allow you to enjoy the action, effects and comedy without getting in the way. All in all an enjoyable two hours."

","You know the old saying that those who criticize only because they fail to do it themselves? This is all I can think of reading so many reviews that say this movie is horrible. We saw an advanced press screening of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales and it was such a thrill. I give it an eight because one of the ending scenes (about two minutes of screen time) on a bluff overlooking the ocean was dumb and cheesy. The rest of this movie was everything we wanted in a Pirates sequel. Javier Bardem is perfect and Depp's Jack Sparrow hasn't lost a step. The new ghostly characters, some which are barely there at all are so cool and the scene with young Jack and how it ties in with his character was such a nice addition."
"subwayhd","6","8","25","23 May 2017"," Pirate of the caribbean* // Johnny Depp is carrying the whole movie.
","Here's my short review of the movie.<br/><br/>Note: I am a huge fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.<br/><br/>Act I: Starts out pretty good, not what I'd expect, but what happens in the beginning is important for us to understand the rest of the movie. However I think they should have started it differently.<br/><br/>Act II: It really feels like you're watching a pirates of the caribbean movie, but it also feels a little overdone. Johnny Depp is really carrying the movie and without him it would be very boring. However the movie fails to entertain me through the entirety of act II, there are moments where I am genuinely bored, and there are moments where I am laughing my ass off. Like mentioned earlier I do believe that the special effects are very overdone.<br/><br/>Act III: This is where things start to really take off, and there are some really good scenes, but at this point it does not really feel like a pirates of the caribbean movie anymore. Too much CGI and un- realistic things happening. Feels like a typical Hollywood action-scifi movie, and not a comedy-action.<br/><br/>This movie was not as good as I wanted it to be, but not as bad as I expected it to be either. I think this is the second worst movie in the franchise, but it was certainly worth my money.<br/><br/>TL;DR Humor: Nailed it! Acting: Very good acting, especially Johnny depp! Special effects/CGI: Overdone, but nice to look at. Plot: A little messy, but good over-all."
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","10","2 June 2017"," Yo! Ho! Yo! Ho! A Pirates Life is not for me. It's getting pretty tiresome. This movie was just meh.
","ARRRRGGHHH! This swashbuckling film is notorious for its troubled and chaotic production, involving multiple rewrites, injuries, recasts, and ransom affair with hackers. Although, the biggest problem, this movie had, was its main star, Johnny Depp, whom broke international laws, while filming this movie in Australia. Not only did, he breached the country's laws when he smuggle his dogs into the country, but Depp's bitter divorce from actress, Amber Heard put a black mark on the film, due to allegations for domestic abuse. This left Disney with doubt, on how bankability, Depp was, after his latest set of films underperformed at the box office. However, with 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tells No Tales'. It did prove that Depp's star power hasn't fade out yet, as the film is projection to gross a good amount of money for the franchise, international, despite domestic, the film's opening being below standards. Nevertheless, the film's total gross, compare to the other films in the franchise is still pretty low, and much of that, comes from the fact, that the film franchise has run out of ideas. The fatigue is very noticeable in this film. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the plot is pretty much, the same from the other films, just recycled and rewritten with new characters and locations, but yet have the same old McGuffin treasure hunt, with Deux Ex Machina, moments, sparkling, throughout it. This time, ruining the mythical of the previous movies. Some good examples of this, is how the movie, has Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his crew being pursued by ghosts, yet again, this time, commanded by Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), a Spanish pirate hunter who seeks revenge on Sparrow, for leaving him to die in the Devil's triangle. I wouldn't mind, if this curse was related to the treasures from the first movie, as that, would make more sense, but instead, of that, this curse comes unannounced with little to no exposition, on how Armando is able to stay undead. Nor does the movie explain, why the compass, keep them, there in the first place. It get even more puzzling, when a plot point in the film, about 'betraying the compass,' releases them, all free, despite the fact that in the previous movies, Jack has lost, stolen or given his compass away to other people to use throughout the saga, having no mention of this. Another thing, this film shows the compass being given to Jack by somebody else, besides Tia Dalma (Naomi Harris) from 2006's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. Even if she was still involve with the compass delivery. Are we to believe that, the goddess of the sea, was willing to keep ghost pirates hunters in bay, knowing full well, that it was the pirates lords that trap her in human form!? Another thing, the idea that Jack and his crew's only hope of stopping them is to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon that will be able to break all of the curses of the sea, seem a bit much. Are we to believe that compass can't hold them, back, anymore!? Also, wouldn't the destruction of the trident at the end of the film mean, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) would die, seeing how his heart was cut out, during the events of 2007's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I guess, death doesn't really matter in these films, seeing how, the after credit, pretty much, shows that, another character from a previous movie is being brought back. In my opinion, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. This movie makes no sense. Not only, did this movie kinda ruin the lore of the franchise, but it also kinda hurt the backstory of some of familiar characters. The idea of having one of the character, be related to Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and him, sacrificing himself, felt a bit forced and out of character, knowing his history. Despite that, I have nothing bad to say, about the new youthful characters of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) & Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) They were far better than the ones, established in 2011's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'. I can say that. They were somewhat memorable. Even the other cameos in the film weren't so bad. However, I did think Depp was sleepwalking through this. It's clear to me, that he's getting really tired of this movie. For Bardem, I found his performance to be boring and never amounts to much more than a drooling wet mop full of ink stains. While, both leads were a disappointment, at least, I thought, the high production values were impressive. I did like, all the real life, set locations, they built. Also, the special effects, while, not the greatest, work for the film that was being made. However, I just hate that the movie has, too many action sequences set, during the night, filmed in pitch black darkness with barely noticeable ghost. It made for a very hard to see, movie at times. Even, the action scenes shot in the day, were a bit jarring, due to the film, not understanding how physics work and it's ripping off, action sequences ideas from mediocre films like 2011's 'Fast Five'. At least, the musical score by composer Geoff Zanelli was great to hear, even if it's not Hans Zimmler on the wheel. Overall: For a film franchise that started out as joke, based on a Disneyland theme park ride. I have to say, it had a good run. While this film is probably not the best movie to end the series, with, but I have to say, it's time for it to end. Any future films will never quite manages to recapture the magic that launched this film series to such stratospheric heights back in 2003. It's truly time, for Jack to sail into retirement. I'm sorry, but in the end, this movie was just mediocre, at best."
"Danielhero1998","9","7","22","25 May 2017"," A great reminder of why I love the Pirates franchise
","Pirates Of The Caribbean is one of my favorite movie franchises of all time. I loved the first 3 movies, and enjoyed parts of 4. Going into Dead Men Tell No Tales, I was really excited. It had great Norwegian directors behind it (Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg), the trailers were great and I was expecting a great fun ride. I left the movie really satisfied. This is the best Pirates movie since The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003). <br/><br/>Plot: Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea—notably Jack. Jack's only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifully small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune, but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has ever faced.<br/><br/>It was full of great action, effects, humor, music, acting, it was a lot of fun, and it has a good, but complicated story. The beginning of the movie with young Henry meeting his father Will on board the Dutchman was toughing and sets up the motivation for Henry wanting the Trident perfectly. Carina's motivations for getting the Trident, while not as great as Henry's, was still good. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is the same Jack Sparrow we all know and love, and Johhny Deep is once again great as the character, Salazar was a great villain with a great motivation for wanting revenge against Jack, Henry and Carina were great new additions to the franchise, but not on the same level as Will and Elizabeth, but way better then the priest (or whatever he was) and the mermaid in On Stranger Tides. The best character in the movie was Barbossa. Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as he has been in all of the movies, and the fact that Carina is revealed to be Barbossa's daughter is fantastic, and his sacrifice at the end was great and sad. <br/><br/>The ending with Henry reuniting with his father (Will), and Will reuniting with Elizabeth, and Jack setting course for a new adventure was amazing and would a great ending to the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise, but there is an after credits scene, which maybe teases a potential sixth Pirates movie with the return of fan- favorite villain Davy Jones. <br/><br/>Problems I have with the movie are one subplot that wasn't needed and led to nothing and an underwhelming climax compared with the other movies' climaxes.<br/><br/>Overall, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a great fun ride that I was never bored with. I think the critics are being way way to hard on this movie. If you love the Pirates movies, even if you weren't a fan of the 4th one, you will enjoy this movie. If you didn't like the Pirates sequels (or the Pirates movies), then this one will not change your mind. If you require movie to be serious or make sense logically, then this isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 8,5/10 or 9/10"

"dave-mcclain","8","6","18","26 May 2017"," ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is an entertaining return to the roots of the franchise.
","The trident, a three-pronged spear appearing in European and Asian mythology and still a recognizable symbol today, is the object of everyone's desire in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" (PG-13, 2:09), the fifth film in Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. Historically, tridents have been used for spear fishing and as weapons. In Greek, Roman and Hindu religious traditions, the trident is the weapon of the gods Poseidon, Neptune and Shiva, respectively. In the folklore of the ancient Greeks, Poseidon used his trident to create bodies of water and also to stir up storms at sea. In short, the trident is said to be able to control the waters, a handy implement to have at your disposal, especially if you're a pirate, a sailor, or have become somehow beholden to the powers of the sea.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is not dead. He's just sleeping. In a safe. It's part of a bank robbery scheme that he and his crew want to pull off – if Jack can stay sober long enough to make their plan work. But not much works out for Jack (Johnny Depp, in his fifth turn as the perpetually unlucky, inebriated, horny pirate). He soon finds himself on the wrong side of a new French invention called the guillotine. (And the way that turns out, let's hope it doesn't inspire the Disneyland parks to create a guillotine ride next to the ride which originally inspired this film franchise.) As Jack peers into a basket of severed heads, he's just yards away from a young woman named Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) who is standing atop a wooden platform with a noose around her neck. As Jack is about to lose his head, she's about to have the blood flow to hers cut off because she is believed to be a witch. What else would 18th century British colonists in the Caribbean call a woman of science who is so knowledgeable about astronomy and horology? Carina had recently met another new character to the franchise, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites). Henry was under arrest on suspicion of treason because he was the only survivor of a British naval vessel which was destroyed in an area of the sea known as the Devil's Triangle. Henry was serving on the ship as a way of searching for the Trident of Poseidon, a mythical object that supposedly can be used to control the oceans – including their curses. Henry is the son of Will Turner, whom we last saw in the third ""Pirates"" movie, and Henry wants the Trident so he can free his father from his cursed existence aboard the ghost ship known as the Flying Dutchman. Carina thinks she can find the Trident – and she wants to do so very badly – as a way to connect her to the seafaring father whom she never knew. In the chaos that ensues as Jack's crew, led by his friend and First Mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally), frees Jack from the guillotine, Henry saves Carina from the hangman's noose and a big new team is formed. Captain Jack, always up for an adventure, loads everyone onto the Dying Gull and they shove off.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, this mission won't exactly be smooth sailing. Jack is being pursued by an undead Spanish naval officer and former pirate hunter called Captain Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his (literally) rotten crew on a ghost ship of their own. Captain Salazar blames Jack for his fate and that of his crew (which we understand after seeing a very informative flashback sequence). He wants nothing more than to see Jack dead – and also to get a hold of the Trident so he can break free of his curse. While searching for Jack, Salazar cruises the Caribbean, destroying every ship and killing every crew in his deadly path. When he comes upon the ship commanded by Captain Jack's old First Mate and rival, Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), convinces Captain Salazar to spare his life so he can help find Jack. Plus, Barbossa wouldn't mind getting his own hands on the Trident of Poseidon in the process.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is an entertaining return to the roots of this lucrative cinematic franchise. With a new crew on deck (the directing team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, screenwriter Jeff Nathanson and composer Geoff Zanelli), the intention was to get back to the relative simplicity, sense of adventure and heart of the original. There's still a lot going on in this movie, but the plot is relatively straightforward (even if it feels a bit contrived) and it's definitely less bloated than the previous installment(s). This one also nicely ties up its storyline (along with some others from earlier in the series), while a post-credits scene makes it clear that there are potentially more stories to tell. But as far as 2017 is concerned, the fifth film displays the great acting, the sense of humor and the action-packed spirit of fun for which the franchise is known – plus the heart of the earlier films.

"Newyorkmgg","10","6","18","26 May 2017"," Absolutely amazing!!!! Coming from someone who strongly dislikes almost every movie.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is an absolutely astonishing continuation of the series! I personally dislike more movies than I do like, and I especially disliked the fourth pirates movie. So I was incredibly surprised to see that the fifth was good enough for the both of them. If this is the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, then it's a wonderful way to end the great series, but if there are more to come then this movie has definitely given writers tons of inspiration for an amazing sixth movie. I was terrified at the thought of Dead Men Tell No Tales being a disappointing addition to the legacy the previous movies left, but by the time I left the theater I was extremely grateful to Disney for doing the franchise justice. I would absolutely pay to go see this movie again in theaters, and I will certainly be buying it when it comes out."

","Pirates of the Caribbean were never dull movies to look at. A good picture of how it was a couple of hunderds of years ago in the world of Piracy. Combined with a twist of humor Pirates of the Caribbean were created. Quite honestly I thought after the third movie this movies stopped, but no. A fourth movie was made and even better now: the fifth movie has started: Salazar's revenge. What a movie! Great shots, great special effects and another great story. What I love the most is that most of the Original actors of the first movie have returned in this one. If you are looking for action, good sense of humor and you have a lot of fantasy, then Pirates ofthe Caribbean: Salazar's revenge is one for your list to see!"

And this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>This is the sequel fans have been waiting for. Providing thrills, laughs and stunning visuals(this movie looked sharp). The story was compelling and I felt that every actor excelled. That is not to say it didn't have flaws. But regardless it brought a fun filled, action packed movie that I thoroughly enjoyed all the way through. A couple plot holes, an iffy final act and questionable cameos aside it was exactly what I could ask for from a Pirates movie. My advice to possible viewers: if you enjoy the fun of his franchise, see this movie and you'll have a great time. My advice to people who didn't like it, either you hated the franchise to begin with or you forgot how fun/silly the first few movies were to begin with."
"aupz23","10","5","15","28 May 2017"," Excellent Film! Some SPOILERS
","I just saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" last night and the audience I was with applauded at the end! :-)<br/><br/>I thought the use of Poseiden's Trident in the plot for breaking all sea curses was clever but my question is what were the other jewels on the island that led to the trident's location? I really liked how Henry Turner and Carina Smyth(Barbossa) came into the story. Carina is Definitely different from Elizabeth Swann. I thought it was really sad about Captain Hector Barbossa :-( I'm not sure how Barbossa could return for the next ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film since he sacrificed himself to save Carina, his daughter BUT there's always a possibility. Let's not forget that Barbossa has as much of luck as Jack Sparrow does. Barbossa died once and was brought back from the dead (with help from Tia Dalma/Calypso). The witch Shansa who is in league with Barbosa could perhaps help bring him back as well for a purpose - Carina, who is ahead of her time as a woman educated, might be able to pull it off! Perhaps Barbossa's help might be needed to fight ""Davy Jones"" who looks as if he returned during the post-credits scene. So, I believe Barbossa is gone for not BUT will return. :-)<br/><br/>I thought it was well done with how Jack Sparrow came in possession of his compass (SPOILER - Jack ""inherited"" it from his dying captain who was killed by Captain Salazar. The dying captain tells a teenaged Jack Sparrow to hold onto the compass and to never betray and it. After the captain dies, the teenaged Jack, who was assumedly First Mate and now Captain, has the crew (in which a lot of them look like young boys) have all hands on deck to lead Salazar's ship into the Devil's Triangle - a teenaged boy pirate Jack Sparrow did this! :-) After saving the ship and crew, the crew look to the teenaged Jack as ""Captain"" and they give him items, such as,the iconic pirate hat that we now know Jack to wear at present.<br/><br/>This film was well-done and I really enjoyed it! :-)"
"RodrigAndrisan","2","4","11","7 June 2017"," Danger of drowning!
","I think it's a movie about Mayonnaise, though we do not see it at all. It is mistakenly mentioned by that Captain Jack Sparrow, when invited to taste the delight of the Guillotine... The Guilotine scene is actually the only funny thing in all this production, which is neither Action, nor Adventure, nor Fantasy. It's just another movie in the franchise with pirates... A movie with two very good actors: Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush, both of whom are two great talents. Kaya Scodelario is beautiful and sweet in the role of Carina Smyth. Who wants to see some good pirates films, I recommend ""The Sea Pirate"" (1966) and ""Il grande colpo di Surcouf""(1966) both with Gérard Barray, and ""The Black Corsair (1976) Il corsaro nero"", and ""La tigre è ancora viva: Sandokan Alla riscossa!""(1977), both with Kabir Bedi."

","This movie is really boring. I was not engaged for 99% of the action sequences. The setting of the third act was really unique and involved breathtaking set design, so that caught my eye. But I thought most of what was happening was either bland dialogue or a meaningless action scene. I never felt any stakes, nor any real investment in what was going on. You may say ""Well that's just because you're not a fan of the franchise!"" This film should stand on its own. I may not understand every little thing, but I should be able to watch this, and appreciate and enjoy it for what it is, separate from the other films. And it didn't do that. I think if you like the style of the other movies, then you may enjoy this one more than I did. But I think my enjoyment of Dead Men Tell No Tales (or lack thereof) has nothing to do with my not being a fanboy of this franchise. I found myself looking around the theater a lot, and just not invested in what was happening on screen. This movie should have made me care about these characters, or at least what was going on.

","I am a HUGE fan of the POTC movie franchise since I was a little girl. Its been my favorite fantasy movie and it never fails to entertain me. I was so excited for this movie, but ended up being disappointed. Ill be starting off with things I ' like and then move on to things I like.<br/><br/>Things I liked: 1)Getting to know about Jack's past, how he became a captain and got the compass, how he became the beloved Jack Sparrow we all know and love. I think it was a beautiful scene and it gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>2) Barbossa's little secret daughter, that was a twist and it showed us a side of Barbossa we have never seen. <br/><br/>3) And as always Jack's escapes are always a favorite.<br/><br/>4) Salazar was a magnificent villain and if they used him more instead of easily solving the situation then the plot would have been magnificent.<br/><br/>5) The use of horses and how it showed that times have indeed changed<br/><br/>Things I didn't like...(WHOOO HERE WE GO)<br/><br/>1)When in the hell did Elizabeth have time to conceive Henry?? The beginning of the film was to take place two years after ""Worlds End"", Elizabeth had no time to conceive a child while being the Pirate King or whatever. ANd his father being trapped on the Flying Dutchman is another reason.<br/><br/>2)Johnny Depp was out of touch with Jack, there were moment where I thought it wasn't Jack on screen anymore. I Didn't even recognize him, how easily he gave up his beloved compass and how his hat was missing but he didn't care. It just wasn't him.<br/><br/>3)Carina Smyth (Barbossa) could have played such a strong female character in the series, being astronomer and daughter of Barbossa, they could have showed her being more knowledgebale on the adventure or given her more dialogue. All she did was talk about her father and yell for help and when she wasn't doing that she was looking at the Map No Man Can Read. We didn't get to know her enough as a character. She easily ended up with William with barely any interaction other than banter and both having the need to find the trident. <br/><br/>4) The whole trident thing all seemed so simple and the dead men curse breaking, it was all; solved so simply. Nothing difficult. I think they director tried to put too much in two hours and ended up with things making no sense.<br/><br/>5) I understand Barbossa having this connection with his daughter but it wasn't empathized enough and nor was it shocking when he died. I watched it in a poker face as he fell because i truly believe Barbossa will not stay dead, and if this does happen it will be obvious. The plot is being repeated and its gotten boring.<br/><br/>6)There was just so little of everything and too much information they were tying to fit in, it was hard to keep up. This lead the movie to plot holes such as: <br/><br/>-Now that the trident is broken and all the curses of the sea are broken...isn't this a bad thing? Like imagine what if a curse was holding something evil from being released, OH WELL TOO BAD<br/><br/>-Where the hell did Elizabeth come from?<br/><br/>-Who is the witch that was with British ships and what is her role?<br/><br/>-WHy wasn't this a prequel? if this was the history of Jack becoming a pirate I believe that would have been such an interesting story and view of POTC.<br/><br/>7) In the end everything was just so rushed, Jack got the Black pearl, a crew, the trident was broken everyone is peachy keen in a matter of seconds because all they had to do was escape like twice? <br/><br/>Im just really upset with the outcome of Dead Men Tell No Tales, it really could have been something great but the writing and directing just wasn't good enough i guess."

","Wow! I really wanted to like this movie, I could not. The positives are that it looks nice, but that's it. The movie starts out semi promising as we are introduced to Henry Turner (Will Turners son) who finds out that Will needs the trident of Poseidon so he can be human again. Then we find out Captain Salazar has beef with Jack Sparrow, then we find a scientist lady who is accused of witchcraft because she does scientific experiments who happens to be Barbarossa's daughter. Then we meet with Barbarossa and a real witch. Then Jack has to free the Dutchmen from the bottle. These are not even all the subplots as the movie is full of them and had way too much. This is Batman V Superman level of overstuffed subplots. At least there is closer as Barbarossa is seaming killed off for good, Salazar is dead at the end, and Will Turner's curse is lifted. But no, they sequel bait by bringing back Davy Jones in the post credit scene, indicating a 6th movie is coming. Can these Pirates movies just stop? This is coming from someone who liked the first 2 squeals."

","Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales is a fifth movie in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean series with Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush returning, but also some new stars Brenton Thwaites (The Giver, Maleficent) and Kaya Scodelario (The Maze Runner) and the great Javier Bardem as a lead villain Salazar.<br/><br/>Just like every Pirates of the Caribbean movie, it's a good time guaranteed once again. It's a visual spectacle and it's full of witty dialogues and fun action sequences. The actors are clearly having a great time in their roles and it's a joy to watch them (even though Jack Sparrow is turning into a parody of himself), but all that put together didn't make for a memorable enough experience. It was fun, but not captivating enough. It's not one of those movies you will remember much when you get out of the theater. It's a good time while it lasts, but it won't stick with you. At least it wasn't as uninteresting as On Stranger Tides. And by the way, don't get too hyped up about that Paul McCartney role. He's in the movie for less than a minute and feels awfully shoehorned in. But maybe he will have a bigger role in the future. Still, I don't think he was necessary here, as much as I appreciate him.<br/><br/>Yes, you will have fun, but you will forget about it eventually. It's still not as good as the first three movies in the series."

","As far as I am concerned Dean Men Tell No Tales (as it should be called) was a little better than Stranger Tides but not as good as Curse of the Black Pearl. It was a riotous romp through the Caribbean with the lovable Jack Sparrow & the new pretty things, Carina & Henry.<br/><br/>We regrettably don't see Penelope Cruz return for this adventure but we do get Mr & Mrs Turner for a cameo (actually was kind of sweet)<br/><br/>Javier Bardem was the titular bad guy & he absolutely stole the show! If Skyfall taught us anything it was that he's a stellar bad guy & he didn't disappoint as Captain Salazar. He was dark, menacing and played the good guy gone bad perfectly. <br/><br/>There were a few things that didn't add up continuity wise though; pay attention as this is where spoilers come in. <br/><br/>Will Turner; At the end of ""Worlds End"" Will becomes Captain of the Flying Dutchman & the 'fish curse' is lifted as the crew return to being men once more. At the beginning of ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" we meet Will again & he's getting all crusty with barnacles like the old 'fish cursed' crew. He & his little lad (about 10 I'd imagine) are talking about Will's time on the Dutchman as being a curse, although at the end of Worlds End he seemed more than happy to take the role to be with his twice cursed father & do away with Davy Jones. So he totally knew what he was getting into & according to Tia Dalma in ""Worlds End"" Davy Jones squid appearance is a result of him not doing his duty of ferrying the people who died at sea to the other afterlife. Considering Will was a good guy for the first 3 films why is he suddenly appearing all sea like?<br/><br/>Jacks Compass; As you'll recall in ""Dead Mans Chest"" Tia Dalma asks Jack if the compass he bartered from her couldn't lead him to Davy Jones Key. However now we see him being given it by his dying Captain in a flashback. That's a big one, I'm not sure why anyone who'd worked on that movie didn't point it out as it disturbs the continuity of the franchise now. <br/><br/>The Trident; OK so this relates to two major points as far as I'm concerned. It has the power to end all curses at sea! If that is indeed the case, how on Earth do Will Turner & a post credit Squid Davy Jones appear to be alive? Firstly Davy Jones in Squid form is a curse brought about by him not doing his duty of ferrying the dead to the afterlife. his heart was stabbed at the end of ""Worlds End"" and he died subsequently being replaced by Will Turner who had his heart cut out put in a box & left with Elizabeth. So breaking the Trident ends all sea curses but does it also bring the dead back to life? Salazar & his men returned to their mortal states even though they clearly all died after their first encounter with Jack Sparrow. So Will returned to his mortal self with his heart reappearing inside him, otherwise he's be dead. Lets address post credits Davy Jones! How? It's not possible! 1: He's dead & 2: the Trident lifted all sea curses & Davy Jones curse was tied to the sea as was his 'fish curse'. So how is it possible that he's come back from the great fishy beyond in Squid form to haunt the Turners?<br/><br/>The Black Pearl in a Bottle; From what I remember from ""Stranger Tides"" there was a storm going on in the bottle, yet now all seems to be quite calm."

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","0","30 May 2020"," ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" has a lot of action and some good jokes, but everything is very mechanical, not surprising, adding nothing to the franchise
","Fifth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, with the script by Jeff Nathanson. Jerry Bruckheimer returned as a producer, while Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario and Orlando Bloom star in the film. The duo of directors cited the first feature of the series, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", as inspiration for the script and tone of the film.<br/><br/>This time, Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) is the new stone in the shoes of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). He leads an army of murderous ghost pirates and is willing to kill all the pirates on the face of the Earth. To escape, Sparrow must find Poseidon's Trident, which gives its owner the power to control the sea.<br/><br/>After a more episodic adventure seen in ""On Stranger Tides"", presenting us with other tales from the seven seas as mermaids and the Fountain of Youth, this time Jeff Nathanson's script focuses on other aspects, such as witchcraft, mysticism and science, in addition to put the famous Trident of Poseidon in the middle of everything. In fact, what we see here is an adventure that can be compared to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" - many parallels can be drawn (more scenes at sea, battles between ships, cursed crew, revenge etc.), although the tone does not present any newness and innovation. Now there is very little left of the novelty that one long day caused. Much of this was lost in the wear and tear of a formula that was never rethought, ""The Revenge of Salazar"" is the synthesis of this reduction, something that had been demonstrated since the third film in the saga. After a six-year rest, the series returns with Dead Men Tell No Tales without the dramatic weight of the last two films and with a visibly tired Jack Sparrow. The fatigue of the character and Johnny Depp is wide open on the screen, but it does not detract from the uncompromised afternoon session proposed by the studio. With an episodic air, this fifth feature has a simple script, full of predictable twists, but with honest execution.<br/><br/>One of the aspects that guarantee the identity of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, is how the old sea legends are used in order to compose this universe that mixes fantasy with reality. We saw this with Davy Jones, the Fountain of Youth, the Kraken, among many other elements. Dead Men Tell No Tales, however, sounds like the chapter that adds the least in this sense, even though it offers a look at Jack's past and resolves the future of others. Poseidon's Trident is something that is never truly worked on and we just have to accept what it does, similar to the Blackbeard's magical ship in the previous film.<br/><br/>What the script proposes here is a return to the central characters of that story at the beginning of the franchise, the first scene already shows the return of Will Turner, a famous figure played by Orlando Bloom, and even if the narrative is not focused on him, but on his son, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), there is a first attempt to co-opt the audience by remembering his first and best titles. The decision to tell a story from Jack Sparrow's past gives the impression that the pirate will be the center of attention. This doesn 't happen. Despite guiding the narrative, he shares the screen well with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the villain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and mainly with the new protagonist couple, Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and Henry (Brenton Thwaites). The plot mixes the revenge of the Spanish officer, with a search for identity and redemption by the two youngest in the cast. One is the rebellious son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and the other is a young scientist who tries to give a feminine look to the pirates' journey. In addition to the predictability of the script, the biggest mistake of this new Pirates is to force a connection with the predecessors. Bringing the sense of an even larger universe (as if the other films had not done enough) does not add or increase interest in that world, but makes any subject that escapes the main core an unnecessary prop. This happens with Barbossa's plot and the English Navy's always futile goals. While focusing on resolving Salazar's rematch and Sparrow's ""messes"", Vengeance approaches the first Pirates and works.
It is true that in the opening minutes the film brings and articulates everything that was once interesting in the series, there is adventure from this young protagonist, there is humor, there are even good visual insights. The first part of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" refers to a classic matinee tone, something very present in that first film in the series. The scene of the bank robbery by Jack and his troupe is sensational. However, this new feature is a constant chronicle of the wear and tear of the series, the narrative of the fifth title itself is getting lost. Everything sounds extremely conniving with the characters of the work, everything seems to happen magically in the feature, without giving the viewer the slightest explanation. Even the encounter between Henry and Carina is completely played, the character just appears in the other's bed for no reason. The feature is a succession of these inexplicable encounters that only facilitate this narrative. The characters meet, appear or know something without it being shown to the viewer. And the worst thing, when something comes to light, is through the worst and least functional narrative crutches, such as the use of a flashback to explain the relationship between Salazar and Sparrow, something that, until this point, its importance for the narrative is not understood.<br/><br/>The number of unnecessary sequences and focuses is too much for immersion in the story. To begin with, the whole relationship between Henry and Carina fails to convince us at all and it is clear that they are there just to repeat Will and Elizabeth's dynamics, something that never happens, of course. Other than that, we have a completely expendable focus that does not affect the narrative at all in a crown officer, played by David Wenham, who is certainly wasted in this film. It gets ridiculous as the whole issue surrounding this character is resolved in an instant, just like that. The story always follows the same formula: Sparrow is always about to be executed when his crew comes to save him and, from there, set out on a new adventure. The whole world always wants the head of the pirate: The English Navy, other pirates, sorcerers, sea monsters and, in the case of the new film, ghosts. Each story has its object of desire. It can be a treasure chest, a magic compass, a mythological trident, things like that, which are passed from hand to hand during the plot. In search of the artifact, the group ends up finding themselves in several unusual situations, with pirates ally and betraying themselves all the time, unexpected solutions and many jokes and puns, some that work, but most do not. Another repeat play: after Keith Richards acted as Sparrow's father in the previous two films, it is now Paul McCartney who makes a cameo as the pirate's uncle.<br/><br/>For the first time in the series since The Curse of the Black Pearl (which he composed in association), Hans Zimmer did not compose the music for the film, but one of his colleagues, Geoff Zanelli, who had worked on all previous films in the franchise, now as the main composer. The composer maintains the classic themes of the series and knows how to amplify the emotion and tone of adventure when necessary. At least Nigel Phelps' production design maintains the level of the series, along with excellent visual effects, especially bold to build Salazar and his crew, which perfectly symbolize death itself. However, alongside cinematographer Paul Cameron, the directors end up delivering confusing action scenes that are hampered by excessive effects and very dark moments. Regarding the effects, the facial rejuvenation performed by Disney deserves to be highlighted, which hits the spot on young Jack Sparrow, who, ironically, is better than the old man in this film.<br/><br/>Depp, just like in the previous film, just repeats more of the same, without the same inspiration as before. If before everything revolved around Captain Jack Sparrow and his iconic figure, now he looks just like a prop, whose function is to repeat dribbles and mannerisms, without this developing the narrative seen. Like Depp, Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) used to be charismatic. Both characters are more uninteresting than ever, with both actors playing automatically. The villain Salazar is a little better, both for the performance of Javier Bardem and for the beautiful visual effects that accompany the character, keeping the Spanish captain in an eternal state of death and drowning. Bardem is fine, but does not receive a script that allows him to create a really threatening villain.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Men Tell No Tales"" has a lot of action and some good jokes, but everything is very mechanical, not surprising. It is more of the same. For those who just want fun, that's fine, but lack a minimum of creativity. The final climax in the quest for Poseidon's Trident is excellent. The film certainly just repeats the same formula as the first film, adding virtually nothing to the franchise. With a Jack Sparrow more exaggerated than usual, a plot full of unnecessary elements and characters that do not convince us, this work shows, once and for all, that Jack should have already hung his hat, burying the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which already gave what he had to offer."

","PotC is perhaps the most sort out franchise ever to be created in a pre-Marvel world. Genre defining music, breathtaking CGI, heart warming story and eye-popping action.

Even though the novelty was there but the added elements didn't work well for me.<br/><br/>The new characters added, lacked depth. They were mere reflection of some of the old characters. The plot line borrowed heavily from the past. Not only borrowed, at some point it seemed like the film is perhaps a remake rather than a sequel.<br/><br/>All though, the music was good but again was just some tweaked up version of old masterpieces.<br/><br/>CGI was good. Not the best (which I believe used to be the franchise's forte). And the action is great.<br/><br/>Overall the film is watchable, but just because of the nostalgia.

","Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent trilogy with three solid films. For those that doubted the sequels' quality, I give you this film to show how far the franchise has sunk. This film is a zombie with no understanding of how to portray its world nor its characters. It brings in new characters to fill the shoes of Will and Elizabeth and both are anything but interesting. Jack Sparrow is at his worst. While the film justifies it as him literally being at his lowest, they forget to bring him to his highest too. Johnny Depp is clearly phoning it in throughout the film. The film seriously seems to think Jack Sparrow is a loser and truly stupid too. It thinks pirates are all stupid. Those cunning swashbucklers from the old franchise? Gone. The new villains are boringly overpowered and yet lack any of the fright possessed by Barbaossa or Davy Jones, their ships, or crews. The only saving grace in this film is Barbossa's subplot but it still felt far too rushed. All mystery has been lost in this franchise' world and at this point, any world building feels tacked on and often contradicting of previous lore. We've already seen the heights of this franchise. A time of a compelling Jack Sparrow, formidable pirate nemesis, and exciting adventures waiting on the horizon. That time is over. Now, it's time for it to fade into legend. Let your ship rest, Disney. I beg you."

","By this time in the series, it's the special effects that have the most resonance for this viewer, as the story is largely a retread of prior action on the high seas. My summary line by the way, is not a comment about the picture but was actually spoken by one of the principals, though I've already forgotten who it was. It didn't seem to me like Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) did any of the heavy lifting in this movie, the focus seemed to be on his nemesis Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and his love interest Carina Smith (Kaya Scodelario). There were a few interesting concepts in the story, I liked for example the idea of robbing the bank actually involved robbing the entire bank. And 'the map no man can read' was a clever way to utilize the character of Carina Smyth, later revealed to be the long lost daughter of Barbossa. Watching the 'Pirates' series out of sequence, I don't now how much I might have missed in the way of continuity, but seeing Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley reprise their former characters for a heartfelt finale was also noteworthy. But in the end the story for me was largely forgettable, as it had to do with a lot of back and forth maneuvering between Barbossa's crew, the villain Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), and the British naval crew led by Commander Scarfield (David Wenham). When I find my attention wandering, it's a sign to me that the picture could have done a better job of putting together an intriguing story. Maybe if they go for number six, they'll come up with something better."
"silverflame-57766","7","0","0","16 January 2018"," It's okay, not great, just okay.
","Having watched the first ones in sequence before watching this one, I was fully prepared for the world of pirates, and to start with I wasn't totally disappointed.
The opening sequence was interesting but really didn't explain enough of why the Dutchman was once again cursed to rot, if Will had been doing his duty to escort the dead to the other side as expected.
Then we meet Jack Sparrow again, which is what we were waiting for and the next ten to fifteen minutes were definitely the funniest and best bit of the whole film.
Jack trying to steal a bank, the WHOLE BANK, was brilliant and just what you would expect from his character.
But unfortunately it was spoiled very much by Depp's acting, and for most of the film, the usually calm, mysterious and odd captain Jack Sparrow just seemed like a parody of himself that belonged more in a National Lampoons film than in the real film, whether this was bad scripting, bad acting, or an attempt to give us something different i'm not sure, but I am sure it spoiled the reputation of a brilliant and much loved character.
As for the rest of the film, well trying to recreate the magic of the first one was a fairly good idea, but it was basically knocked off course by one main central point to the plot, Jack had given away the compass several times before in the other films with out a problem, so why? when he did it this time, did it cause the chain of event's that followed.
Continuity was clearly put aside for the sake of story telling and it was such a glaring plot hole some one should be Keelhauled for this abomination in such a fun and marvellous series.
Other than that, it was good to see some familiar old faces accompanying Jack, and some new ones, who I think stood up well and were very well acted as they took over two familiar roles that had been performed very well by very good actors before them.
So I would say over all, it was good and worth at least one watch, but it never really sparked into life like the first three movies did, so let's hope, if a sixth is on the cards, they finally find that missing piece of the treasure!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales: 
Directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. Written by Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio<br/><br/>The fifth Pirates movie. Who would have thought? Certainly not I as it really felt like this franchise had completely run out of steam in On Stranger Tides. They went back to the well of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann and started introducing kids with a Captain Jack Sparrow who much like Johnny Depp himself doesn't age. This movie is eerily reminscent of the first one with a supernatural villain with close ties to Jack Sparrow and two young heroes in love but not really sure what to do since they have obligations to a destiny greater than themselves. <br/><br/>You've seen this before from this series for sure. It feels like a greatest hits of the Pirates series. There's honestly not much to the villain Captain Salazar. He hates Jack Sparrow because he was outsmarted and killed by him a long time ago. Jack barely even recognizes him when he does show up. <br/><br/>That brings me to Johnny Depp himself. He is barely recognizable as this character anymore. Jack Sparrow has come around full circle to a parody of what it once was. This is inevitable for any character on a long enough timeline. This was always a comedic character anyway but something seems off in Johnny Depp's portrayal this time around. <br/><br/>The action setpieces are nicely done and look terrific for a big budget movie. The camerawork is swirling and puts you in the place of what is happening. Everything feels lived in even for smaller scenes. Then again I would certainly hope so for what they spent on this thing. <br/><br/>It's an okay movie. There isn't much to it and as I mentioned previously it feels like a greatest hits record of the Pirates franchise. With On Stranger Tides, this franchise was over and this was the network special honoring it's anniversary. It's still over. I give this movie a C."
"Samiam3","6","0","0","9 November 2017"," Sparrow and Spectacle in another unneeded (but not unwatchable) sequel
","Kudos to Pirates 5 for showing us a younger Jack Sparrow, for bringing back Will Turner, for adding some fresh young blood, and for Captain Salazar's (Bardem's) sizzling screen presence. <br/><br/>As for Jack Sparrow, the franchise has left him behind. Sparrow is a puppet meant to be laughed at as the plot whirls him through various comedic scenario's (including a forced marriage at gun point). Sparrow is no longer a catalyst of the tale, he is a victim in it. As you watch, you get the hunch that Depp is so discontent with the franchise that he is deliberate trying to sabotage it though his performance. He is not even even speaking his lines, he is garbling them.<br/><br/>And yet somehow the movie still gets by. If nothing else, it is an improvement over the inert and imagination-free Pirates 4. The set pieces are far more spectacular but still they are far from compelling. When it comes to the 'circus' aspects of the film, directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are good with the set up but not the punchline. Frantic editing, and poor lighting render most of the action scenes disoritnenting. <br/><br/>The first and final scenes of the movie are the strongest. They are centred around Will Turner's son who seeks to break his father from the curse of the Dutchman. This is the starting point for the film muddled plot which has a beginning and an end, but no middle. <br/><br/>The character of Henry Turner, and his 'girl to be' Carina, bring a hint of something that was missing in the last film; a sense of character purpose. He seeks to free his father, and she to find the map in the stars from a clue that her father left behind. If only the film has given them a little more time. Other highlights of the film include a flashback to the origins of Sparrows rivalry with Salazar's Barbossa's brimming new beard / hairstyle combo, as well as a cute cameo by an almost unrecognizable Paul McCartney.<br/><br/>And then the film ends on the kind of note that is perfect, and very much needed, The kind that brings resolution to it's characters and does not cry out for another sequel."
"dylansecure","3","0","0","8 November 2017"," Crappy plot which caused a crappy movie
","It feels like a group of drunks commandeered the set, and put on a cheap and nasty play; there is hardly any application of meaningful acting. The actors could hardly be blamed, though, the script is horrendous, and does not align to the narrative provided by previous Pirates of the Caribbean movies. To the producers, I issue a 'Please explain.'"
"unbrokenmetal","Null","0","0","11 October 2017"," Fresh blood
","Here we go again, part 5 of the most successful pirate series ever. The best moment was the confrontation of the old captains, when Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) is trying to make a deal with Javier Bardem (Salazar). Every look they give each other is a statement, here are two captains of the same caliber, don't ever turn your back on either of us... Johnny Depp, well, has he been better than in the first part in any of the sequels? He does his usual routine. Brenton Thwaites as Henry and Kaya Scodelario as the astronomer (!) Carina really keep the action going, frankly I didn't miss Bloom and Knightley that much. The movie has a few weaknesses, from the fight at the bottom of the ocean (just to show off where the money for the effects went, but the audience never believes it is real) to silly jokes (I just say 'horologist', ouch!).<br/><br/>But all in all, 'Salazar's Revenge' aka 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' is a good movie to finish the series. They brought some fresh blood in front of the camera (the two young main actors) as well as behind it (two new directors), so you never get a feeling of watching someone flogging a dead horse. I voted 9-8-6-7-7 for the 5 movies of the series."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","8","0","0","5 October 2017"," Sailing Into the Sunset?
","Hard as it might be to believe it's been 14 years since we first became acquainted with a drunken pirate named Jack Sparrow whose exploits and blind luck made us laugh, sit on the edge of our seats and scream ""Shiver me timbers!"" Okay so maybe we didn't scream that but we did find ourselves so enamored of the scalawag that three movies followed that one. Now a fourth, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES has found its way to disc and it's as enjoyable as the rest.<br/><br/>As complicated as the last sequel, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES, seemed to be this once is more so at times. Old and new faces combine this time around, my guess is in hopes that the franchise could carry on with the new faces while still paying tribute to the old. A short sequence after the credits makes me believe this even more.<br/><br/>This time around we meet Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who was cast onto the Flying Dutchman ship to sail the seas for eternity. Henry has learned that there is a way to free his father from this eternal curse and he needs Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help him. Before that can happen Henry is tossed into the brig on the ship he's on just as it is attacked by a ghost ship commandeered by Capt. Salazar (Javier Bardem). Salazar always leaves one survivor from his attacks to carry the word because dead men tell no tales. He sends a message with Henry, to let Jack Sparrow know death awaits him.<br/><br/>Henry makes his way to the last location Sparrow was seen at just as two other plot lines are taking place. Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a woman who studies science in a time when that wasn't allowed, is about to be hung for being a witch. And Sparrow and his crew have just stolen a safe with all the money of the town he is in. Unfortunately Jack was caught and is about to be beheaded. Which is about the time Henry and Jack's crew show to save the day.<br/><br/>Plots twist again as Jack ties up both Carina and Henry who soon come to realize that they are both searching for the same thing, an island that doesn't exist where it is said the Trident of Poseidon can be found. With the Trident Jack can free his father and Carina decipher the map left her when she was a child.<br/><br/>Next twist. I told you there were plenty. Salazar and his ghost ship have taken to the high seas and are wreaking havoc on the fleet owned by Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Jack's old nemesis/friend. Before he eliminates him and his crew, Barbossa negotiates a plan with Salazar to aid him in his search for Sparrow. Of course all of these plot threads come together like a pirate's eyepatch before the finale.<br/><br/>As with all of the other films the acting here is solid from all involved. Perhaps the weakest performance comes from Depp who spends most of the story inebriated and just wandering through. While the other films had him in this condition it wasn't to this extent and he was more involved with the tales going on. Here he just seems to be wandering about, a character there because the series was based around him. Newcomers Scodelario and Thwaites leave a better impression and Rush displays more depth to Barbossa than he has in the past. And for fans you'll be glad to see that Bloom and Keira Knightley both make an appearance tying the films together as does Depp and Rush.<br/><br/>The past films have been noted and discussed since the first for the amazing special effects that were on display. You'll find that Disney hasn't let that slide as there are more amazing effects on display here as well, including a half rotted trio of sharks that threaten our heroes as well as fantastic ghostly effects involving Salazar and his crew. That being said at times the effects overpower everything else and the movie feels more like it depends more on them than the actors or any sets that were used. Over reliance on the effects takes away from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>All things considered the movie was still a lot of fun. When released I recall the press slamming the film and headlines about how much less it earned than the others. It doesn't matter. What does is the end result, is the film worth watching? Yes, it is. Is it worth buying? If you're a fan of the series it's worth picking up to have the complete set. If not, then it is still worth giving a watch and then deciding to buy or not. As for me I can see myself pulling it out from time to time to watch again. Maybe pick up some fish from Captain D's on the way home. Some salt water taffy. Too much? Okay, just know that it's fun then and worth the time spent watching."

"SmashandNasty","7","7","24","24 May 2017"," Forget the 4th film, this is a much better followup to the original trilogy
","Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Daddy Issues. This film will remind you of all the reasons you love and hate the Pirates franchise (we can ignore the fourth since Disney is going to.) Jack Sparrow is one of Depp's best character: he is hilarious, drunk and wildly inappropriate — but unlike the fourth movie, his presence is tempered by the addition of Will and Elizabeth-esque characters (Henry and Carina). Scodelario shines as Carina and is a breath of fresh air in the essentially all-male cast. There are a lot of other familiar pirate faces, including Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who are all great, but there are just too many characters at this point for any of them to get adequate screen time.<br/><br/>Yet, the film cannot stop itself from falling into the same issues as the other movies in the series. There were too many plot lines, most came out of nowhere and were completely absurd, and at 2 hours and 9 minutes, it became too long for us to keep caring about the conclusion. However, it's cute, featured good acting, stunning visuals, an impeccable soundtrack— and it actually has an ending, unlike the other films."

"jovan_zola1999","10","6","20","24 May 2017"," In my opinion, its the best of the series!
","In my opinion Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Man Tell No Tales or Salazars Revenge, however you want to call it, is the best movie of all 5 POTC movies. Action scenes, comedy scenes, everything in this movie just left me without even moving my eye at all. There was not a second when I took a deep breath or moved on chair, not at all. I was totally amazed by this movie.<br/><br/>The newcomers, Henry and Carina are awesome. They did their job well and did entertain me. I really loved the characters. Chemistry between them is really good and for me it is better than Wills and Elizabeths in The Curse Of The Black Pearl. Not better than in Dead Mans Chest and at Worlds End tho. <br/><br/>Captain Barbossa did incredible job in this movie. His role was totally perfect, no complaining at all. I can say that I did cry because of the way his story ended in this movie but I will not spoil it totally.<br/><br/>I also did cry on the Turner family reunion scene. It was just so emotional for me that it made me cry. I am a huge fan of POTC franchise, I re-watched every part more than 30 times so probably that's why I took it to emotional but anyways it did make me cry.<br/><br/>As for our favorite pirate CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW I can say only one word. Incredible. Johnny Depp is just incredible in this movie, I just loved it. He is also my favorite actor and I've seen all of his movies and I can say that this was one of his best performances. He just nailed it. <br/><br/>You all should know that if this movie does well at box office there is 100 % chance that 6 movie is on his way. Its because of Post Credit scene and I should strongly recommend to all of you to stay on Post and Credit Scenes, it is worth.<br/><br/>So yea, that's my review for POTC Dead Man Tell No Tales, really good movie, even if u didn't like any on POTC movie you will like this one. It is just well done."
"javi-y-se-acabo","7","5","16","27 May 2017"," It's The Pirate's Life
","After On Stranger Tides (a not so good pirates sequel) here we are, with a new movie and for me they really achieved to recover the feeling of the original trilogy, well not like the first one, but it's two sequels.<br/><br/>It tells us the story of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is trying to find the way to break the curse of his father and for that he must cross the seas with the famous Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young astronomy girl called Carina (Kaya Scodelario) while they're chased by the semi-dead Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) who is looking for revenge after Jack Sparrow. The story is quite simple and at parts it was a bit of rip-off from the previous ones, specially the second one (someone is chasing Jack Sparrow for a pay off with him and he cannot steady in the land) but for me it worked well and was very entertaining and funny. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp provides another hilarious and quirky performance of the ""peculiar"" Captain Jack Sparrow as well as Geoffrey Rush in the role of Captain Hector Barbossa. Even Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley in their small roles were great, maybe because of the nostalgia of seeing them together again after ten years. This about the old faces but in the new there are some great performances. Well, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) didn't gave it too much emotion and despite some good moments he felt like a bit flat. On the other hand, Kaya Scodelario gives a great performance of strong and scientific woman trying to fight in the world of the manly pirates, and also she is very beautiful. And we have the Spanish Javier Bardem in the role of the evil Captain Salazar. I didn't expected too much from him, but he surprised me delivering anther great villain to this fantastic saga.<br/><br/>Most of the visuals were done amazingly. I specially love the last battle when the sea opens in the middle and they can walk through it. The cinematography provides some very beautiful shots like the ones in the island of Will & Elizabeth and also I have to mention the guillotine scene that it was filmed in a way that made laugh a lot trough all of it. Also I have to mention the score, that here was made by Geoff Zanelli, a frequent collaborator with Zimmer, and while he is not Zimmer, he brings back many of the old themes as well as creating some very good new ones, like the beautiful Carina theme you can hear in the star island near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great sequel to the pirates saga, being on the line of the first two sequels. I recommend it to you, if you liked the original trilogy or maybe if you just want to see a very funny and entertaining movie full of action, adventure and a bit of romance"

","I've just watched the movie few minutes ago, i feel like the movie is not satisfied enough. The script was boring and so predictable that i could direct the second haft of it. Where is jack sparrow that i used to know? Where is the drama, the wow, the ohhhh the ahhh, the excited heartbeat that the audience could have? The characters was not digged deep and showed out. After 19 years, Jack became the jerk getting around the new-unknown 2 characters, while Will Turner appeared in the blink of an eye and miss Swann suddenly came from nowhere wearing an urbanized gown? I had to scream inside ""are you joking me?"".In the first haft the movie approached excellently by the story of Salazar to the rich Barbossa but then end it with clumsy. As a fan of ""pirates of the caribbean"", i suggest that the series should back on track with exciting scripts, highlight the main characters and most importantly, the spirit of the pirates: the Jack Sparrow's spirit! #theSparrowSpirit"

Regardless, I still went to the theater and was praying it would be good, and I am so happy to tell you the critics are dead wrong! This is a terrific film! As always, Johnny Depp as captain jack sparrow was great, and also loved the characters of Henry Turner and Carina Smyth. They both did great jobs and unlike on stranger tides, this one has characters besides captain jack, that I was interested in. Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar was so menacing and such a cool villain. He actually has a lot of depth and motivation to his character unlike Blackbeard. Critics are saying this film is ""boring"" but I did not find a scene that dragged on and I was very invested in the well written story of this film. My only issue with the film is I wish they would've given captain jack sparrow more to do with the plot. But other than that I think you should definitely see it and do not listen to the critics!"

","I would say the movie failed to live up to my expectations. The 7-year difference between the fourth and fifth installments made me hope that something great was coming. The sad part about this movie is that they tried to re-create that Elizabeth-Will relationship with Henry and Carina, which was really disappointing. In addition, in this movie, it seems that Henry is the main character rather than Jack, which is really disappointing. Geoffrey Rush, Barbosa, had significantly fewer lines in this movie, which also did not satisfy me at all. There was no real flow of the story, things would just happen. No one saw the Black Pearl being released coming yet it happened out of nowhere. Despite all this negativity, I am still hopeful for future installments. Will and Elizabeth are reunited and we see Davy Jones returning in the after credit scene. If this is the beginning of another adventure, probably the last, I hope that Will, Jack, somehow Barbosa, Elizabeth, and Jones will be a part of it."
"jdsarahsl","8","4","12","27 May 2017"," Good Movie
","As a huge fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I can say I liked it a lot. <br/><br/>First of all, you could laugh from the opening scene on, mostly because of Jacks jokes or behavior. For all who say Jack is not how he used to be... Yes, naturally because he get's older, just think about the time space in the stories from movie to movie. And also...that is the Story: Jack is 'out of luck' but he gets more an more in the movie. You get to see his history and see the friendship between Barbossa and him again. You get to see a lot of old characters and a lot new ones and actually see a little more of Barbossa. One more thing: The Ending makes it a good movie because everything really comes to an end and there is no loose part, where you can't imagine what happens next. Still, I didn't give 10 Points because: 1. The new couple... oh well, is OK but not necessary. 2. The Front statue is suddenly alive and haunts Jack?! 3. The sharks, good effect, but somehow too much. <br/><br/>I would and will definitely watch it again and hope the people just leave Johnny be Johnny."

","Depending on how you go into this movie, you will either have a great time or be somewhat disappointed. For me personally (A huge pirates fan)this film was a great return to many characters and introduction for new heroes. The movie is full of humor, action, and had a fun sense of adventure. The new villain Captain Salazar is played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. There is nice blend of feelings from the original 2003 film and the sequels. That being said this movie isn't without it's flaws. Johnny Depp does a good job as Jack Sparrow but it's not his best outing as the character. There are many continuity errors with previously films which makes the writers come off as lazy. The action is very entertaining but lacks the fun of the original, Gore Verbinski, swashbuckling sword fights. There are some similar plot points to the previous 4 films which might make you think that your watching the same movie but, they're different enough. Admittedly with all of the films in this franchise, you have to turn you brain off, If you think to hard about what's happening then you'll over analyze it and be disappointed. I recommend going in to this movie with the expectations of it being a pirate movie, and nothing else. Understandably people believe that this movie is one too many. I disagree. I had a great time watching this movie and seeing characters interact with each other that I love. It's certainly not the best movie ever made but I had a great time watching it. 7/10 stars"
"nyjsinger","Null","4","12","27 May 2017"," The Best Pirates of the Caribbean film since Dead Man's Chest
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a solid movie. It gives me the same feeling the first one did.<br/><br/>The Cons: They ruined Jack Sparrow's character. He goes from a quick-minded, tipsy pirate that is good at being a pirate to a drunk, stupid, bad pirate. It also got me hyped for Will Turner returning, but he was only in the film for probably a total of 10 minutes.<br/><br/>The Pros: Salazar is a villain to remember. He is frightening to look at and has a reason to be hunting down Jack. This movie has funny moments that aren't force, like the guillotine. The movie gave me the same feeling the first one did."
"ThomasDrufke","8","4","12","27 May 2017"," A Return to Form
","In a similar way that Mad Max Fury Road, Jason Bourne, The Force Awakens, Creed, and Jurassic World, Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to make both a sequel and a reboot, which some people refer to as a remake-quel. Remarkably, it succeeds in doing just that. Honoring the lore that came before and establishing fun new characters to follow as well, Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Pirates film since the original. That's a surprisingly impressive feat.<br/><br/>Picking up a good time after At World's End (I think 19 years to be exact), Henry Turner, searches for a potential item that would reverse all of the curses in the Caribbean, including his father's lifetime duty as captain of the Flying Dutchman. Part of what makes this film so great is that it revitalizes the series in an unexpected way. I never knew how much I would have enjoyed following new characters (albeit similar in spirit to those of Elizabeth and William). Much like the last few entries, there are a few very unfunny and cringe worthy Jack Sparrow moments, but that's to be expected at this point.<br/><br/>Tonally and aesthetically, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a return to what made The Curse of the Black Pearl so special. Colorful, grandiose, ambitious, and even at times frightening is exactly what this film needed to recapture. Of course, there are plenty of fantastic action sequences, visually stunning special effects, and the inevitably charmingly convoluted plot. Speaking of charming, Henry and his love interest, Carina, are very good together in playing off of Sparrow. They're far from throw away characters like Philip and Syrena were last time around. I actually found myself getting invested in Henry's mission to save his father, and Carina's astronomical goals. <br/><br/>Most pleasing of all is seeing the return of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly in minor but significant roles. The film doesn't rely on the presence of them, instead using their legacy as a bolster for the development of a new story with fresh faces.

"CriticomLink_YT","7","4","12","27 May 2017"," A solid start to a closing chapter and a worthwhile entry in a failing franchise.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (AKA Salazar's Revenge) is the fifth film in the titular franchise (and marketed as the final, but we all know it probably isn't) and is directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, with a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. It stars Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar, Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth, Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (father of Henry Turner), as well as cameo appearances by Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Turner and Paul McCartney as Sparrow's uncle.<br/><br/>After At World's End, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was essentially put on life support. The plug was almost completely pulled considering former Pirates director Gore Verbinski envisioned At World's End as the final film in the trilogy. Then came the slightly improved On Stranger Tides, which is basically all that was. And now were here, with Dead Men Tell No Tales, the ""supposed"" final film in the franchise. It tells the tale of Captain Sparrow, who is being hunted down by a ghostly figure from his past, and through the franchise's signature character-interactive shenanigans and Macguffin-that-unites-the-characters-to-defeat-a-powerful-enemy kind of storytelling, Sparrow along with Henry Turner and Carina Smyth set out to find the Trident of Poseidon and defeat Captain Salazar.<br/><br/>Allow me to start off positive. This series has always been renowned for it's stunning visual effects and eye-catching CGI, and this film is no exception. One particular scene was the climactic battle at the end of the film, that saw the characters battle Salazar and his men on the seafloor, while the water formed two vertical waves around them. It looked amazing. While there was CGI, there wasn't too much. It genuinely felt like I could reach out and touch the water, or pick up the sand and throw it, or rip a piece of seaweed out of it's roots. There were numerous other scenes that blew me away, but this one takes the cake. This movie's look was not perfect, however. There were some scenes that overused CGI, and it stuck out as looking fake. Most of the bad CGI emanates from the fire sequences, and the people standing in front of/behind them while the background looks like something straight out of a video game with average graphics, did no doubt take me out of the moment.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film is not totally style-over-substance. All of the actors involved bring their A-game, especially the always charismatic and effortless Johnny Depp as Jack Sparr- sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow. Newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario as Henry and Carina, respectively, both put on excellent performances while sharing great chemistry with one another. However, I still need to see more of them in these Pirates films before I can unapologetically call them the next Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Everyone else is very good or great, and I found Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar particularly intimidating. Salazar also carried most of this movie's story, as without his involvement, the movie most likely would have been less enjoyable than it was. On a similar note, this movie's plot was even and well-executed, and the character's actions that lead from one obstacle to another felt more streamlined and comprehensible than say, At World's End.<br/><br/>I have to say that ultimately, Dead Men Tell No Tales was not a big letdown for me. It was nowhere near as great as the first film in the series, but it is slightly better than Dead Man's Chest, and far better than At World's End and On Stranger Tides. But just like every movie out there, Dead Men was not without it's flaws. The biggest disappointment of this whole film was it's predictability. Near the beginning of the film, Jack's crew walks out on him after some stuff that I won't spoil goes wrong, and you just know they're gonna come running back to him. One way or another, you know that even though they say they're finished, they will come back and assist Sparrow in his quest to find the Trident. That one scene alone made the movie less enjoyable for me, but there were one too many other scenes where you could easily plot out what's going to happen next. Another disappointment that this film possesses is the fizzled and drained humor. I can only recall two scenes where I laughed, and a few others where I chuckled. In some parts, the movie was trying too hard to be funny, and in others, the movie could have tried a lot harder to inject fresh humor into an exchange that borrowed most of the humor from the first film.<br/><br/>But other than those and a few other nagging flaws, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales did boast an engaging enough story to keep me mostly interested throughout the film's run time. Johnny Depp is better than ever as the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, the visuals kept me on the edge of my seat with their breathtaking cinematography, and despite the humor mainly not working, I did relish in a couple of laughs. Does this entry reinvigorate the franchise and set it on a completely new course destined for riches and success? No. Is it entertaining and worth watching? Definitely. You'll probably like this movie if you loved the first film and shared some of my opinion on the later entries. All in all, Dead Men Tell No Tales was not great, but if it's the ""beginning of the end"" like the filmmakers say it is, it's a solid start to a closing chapter and a worthwhile entry in a failing franchise.<br/><br/>Rating - 6.9/10 stars"
"gaglianojohnpaul","7","4","12","27 May 2017"," Really Liked It
","Reading these reviews there's a common theme among them that bothers the heck out of me. Everyone keeps saying that Jack isn't himself anymore (his jokes aren't as funny, he's not as sharp or as witty.) Yall - he's SUPPOSED TO BE. That wasn't an accident. Didn't anyone read the plot overview prior to the movie's release? ""A down-on-his-luck Jack..."" Guys, Jack is portrayed as aging, less-skilled, less-witty and resorting to jokes that don't cut it to imply his career as a pirate is declining. It's the point. He needs the two young whipper-snappers to help restore him to his former glory; a reverse-symbolic nod to the first film where the two whipper-snappers needed him. Think about it, if Jack never had any flaws or character digressions he'd be the same person in every movie and this would cease to entertain. I liked this movie a lot and for a lot of reasons but I just wanted to settle my personal opinion on this issue."
"MaximumMadness","8","3","8","9 June 2017"," ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales""- The best in the series since the original. Big, loud, silly dumb-fun at its finest!
","I came out of the theater from seeing ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", the fifth chapter in the pirating adventure series, with a bit of confusion and bewilderment. Because I've been following the critics and the fans and the general audience reception, and have seen how decidedly mixed people feel towards the film. Some love it. Some hate it. And many more come out somewhere in between. What confuses me is the simple fact that, as a fan... I thought this was easily the best entry in the series since the original, and see it as a grand new installment that reinvigorated my interest in the franchise after the somewhat lackluster fourth film. Sure, it does have its moments of nonsense and a few leaps in logic here and there, but I left the movie wanting more, which is perhaps the best feeling you can leave one of these films with. I had a non-stop blast with ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" and I didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>Young Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) has spent his entire life on a mission- to try and discover a way to break the curse that binds his father William (Orlando Bloom) to the Flying Dutchman for all eternity. And he may have just found a way- the legendary Trident of Poseidon. Whomever wields this ancient weapon will have control over all the ocean and every ships that sails it. However, there's a catch- Henry will need to seek the help of the daring young scientist Carina (Kaya Scodelario) and his father's former adversary/ally Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to get the help he needs to free his father. At the same time, Jack finds himself being pursued by a vicious ghost-ship lead by the dreaded Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), whom holds Jack responsible for the vile curse that have kept he and his crew imprisoned somewhere in between life and death for decades. And so, our heroes must try and race to get to the trident first (eventually joined by Barbossa, once again played by the delightful Geoffrey Rush) before Salazar can have his revenge...<br/><br/>Directed by the Norwegian duo of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg from a script by Jeff Nathanson, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a good example of classic ""dumb-fun"" done right. It never takes itself completely serious, and is simply here to entertain us with another story of adventure. It's filled to burst with oft-clever action, non-stop gags and consistently thrilling visual effects set-pieces while only occasionally slowing down to throw some story or minor character- development our way. In some ways, I feel this follow-up has rectified one of the major faults of the past few entries in the series- it never goes too dark, and it never outstays its welcome with needlessly convoluted storytelling. This is a fast, concise bit of entertainment. Rønning and Sandberg are cool and confident with their slick visuals and sometimes jaw-dropping action, and they cement themselves as a good fit for the material by the time the first major action set-piece is finished. Sometimes I did miss the weirdly gritty aesthetic of original director Gore Verbinski, but I think the new creative team does an admirable job at continuing the franchise without simply just repeating what came before with less gusto... Which is a major issue that I felt dragged down the previous installment, ""On Stranger Tides.""<br/><br/>The cast is great fun as always. While Johnny Depp could play Sparrow in his sleep by now, it's always a pleasure seeing him on the big-screen and he's charming as always. He's a bit more broad this time around, but I didn't mind it. Rush and Bardem are great foils to Jack, with Rush once again often stealing scenes and Bardem being just a delightfully disgusting baddie that you'll love to hate. It was also fun seeing Orlando Bloom back, even if his role is fairly small. Will turner is a key character in the franchise, so it's good seeing this film honoring the series. Where the cast starts to shake a bit is with newcomers Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario. Don't get me wrong. They're both likable and charming. And they play well enough off of one-another. I think the problem is the script, which is clearly trying a bit too hard to make them the new surrogate replacements for the original characters Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Thwaites does well playing the child of those two, but comes off too often as a slightly tamed-down William. Scodelario fares much better as a feisty woman of science, but again... she's a bit too similar to Elizabeth to stand on her own. Though I like the characters just enough that I wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of them.<br/><br/>This isn't a film without flaws by any means, however. While I appreciated the quicker pace and simplified storyline, the film can sometimes rocket through key moments or leave minor characters in the dust, which is a shame considering there's a larger ensemble cast. Some of the action can be a bit far-fetched even by ""Pirates"" standards. And I felt the climax almost felt like it came out of nowhere. But those issues cannot detract from the sheer fun I had with the film. And I really can't wrap my head around the mixed reception. It's a tight, fun film with non-stop thrills and a fair share of laughs and giggles. Just like the original that people love so much. And it stars several characters we've come to love to boot! That's what I wanted. And that's what I got. It's not a perfect film. But I found it to be a charming and more-than-adequate return for the franchise that left me satisfied and even craving more. What more could you want?<br/><br/>As a fan of this series, I give ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" a very good 8 out of 10."

","Odysseys evolve with every chapter. The hero grows while the scenery passes by. Then there are the disasters, with each subsequent episode so disappointing that it begs the question why we enjoyed the ride to begin with. Finally there are the cruises like Pirates of the Caribbean. Dead Men Tell No Tales is neither a return to former glory nor a promise of greatness to come, but it is enough so a fan might reminisce with a smile on their face.<br/><br/>I am sticking with this voyage till the end.<br/><br/>Pirates 5 offers no compelling new characters and a clunky plot, but has the franchise defining Jack based laughs and the absurd action sequences. Unlike its predecessor, this film is not instantly forgettable. Henry Turner (Thwaites) son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, takes center stage in this installment. He is in pursuit of Poseidon's Trident, a panacea with the power to release his father from the curse of the Flying Dutchman. Hearing myths, Turner seeks the Jack Sparrow (Depp) to aid in his quest. Also enlisting in the crew is scientist Carina (Scodelario), who also seeks the trident as a clue to her lost heritage. This expedition is endangered by a cursed Spanish crew lead by Captain Salazar (Bardem) Jack's eternal enemy and greatest fear.<br/><br/>In Curse of the Black Pearl, there was a one golden medallion and a cursed pirate fleet. In Dead Man's Chest, there was a key, a disembodied heart, a cursed pirate fleet, and the British Empire. Now included, but not limited to, in Dead Men Tell No Tales are: a trident, a diary, a ruby, a blood moon, the compass with more rules, the Black Pearl in a bottle, Blackbeard's sword, an accused witch, an actual witch, two curses, two Turners, Jack's crew, captain Barbosa, his armada, undead Spanish pirate hunters, the British empire, and a man wearing pearls with an unattractive sister. We have lost the way. I am pretty lenient on sequels with uninteresting plots, but this is convoluted enough to interfere with the good stuff. I would say the script needs a rewrite, but I am willing to bet that's what got us here to begin with. Lone highlight is a wonderful flashback revealing Jack's backstory, an island of concise and gap filling storytelling in a sea of bafflement. The plot is a mess, but we are not here for the plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we are here for character and these new additions just add to the boring bewilderment. I like the return to naivety in Turner contrasting with Jack's cleverness, but there is no for him chance to shine. More remarkable is Carina, who compared with original Elizabeth seems more intelligent yet out of her league. Still, she feels more like a device to advance the plot then a thinking, breathing, human. Fortunately, one woman's loss is probably a certain pirate's gain.<br/><br/>Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow feels like a living legend of a lost lineage. Part of a tradition spanning from Buster Keaton to Robin Williams. Cinematic comics in constant motion. Performance are more than just a pile of witty lines, but how the actor moves with them. There is more humor in Sparrow's literal hands than half of contemporary comedies. No, Depp is not as sharp or original as he was a decade ago, here he is constantly in a drunk stupor which is a typical act anyone can pull. Still, if Jack is your reason for buying a ticket you are getting a good chuckle to dollar exchange. Thank the return of the completely implausible set pieces that Pirates has mastered over the years. This film is competing another franchise, but here there is a scene with Jack bound to a guillotine that got a laugh from the audience twice as large as anything I have heard in Guardians. The musical theme is still unforgettable, and the sense of exhilaration when it plays remains. Unfortunately most of the magic is spent in the first act, replaced by impressive CGI sea battles with ghost pirates that I have kinda become used to. Pirates is too uneven and overploted to be great or even very good, but the heartbeat endures. Dead Men Tell No Tales is enough for fans to recall the wonder and maybe even return for another sequel."

Will does not believe the Trident exists and orders Henry to leave his ship and never come back.<br/><br/>Nine years later (and five after the events of On Stranger Tides), Henry works on a British Royal Navy warship. While chasing a pirate ship, Henry realizes the captain is about to sail them into the Devil's Triangle. The captain dismisses his concerns and has Henry locked up for attempting mutiny. As they sail into the Triangle, they come across a shipwreck that quickly comes to life with undead sailors, led by Captain Salazar. The ghost crew board the ship and kill everyone in their path.

","I love the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The first one is brilliant and the others are kinda good as well. One of the problems with the sequels was that they really did not feel like the original. This movie does however. It has great pace, simple story and fun humor. It is also one of the movies with the most heart in it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is back as Jack and he does a great job. The same goes with the new characters. <br/><br/>My main problem with the movie is that villain(Captain Salazar). He is not really that good. He is much more of a character than Blackbeard but not anything close to Barbossa or Davy Jones. Some of the humor he tries to pull of really does not land.<br/><br/>All in all I will say that its a fun movie. It has much more heart and is nowhere near as boring as ""Stranger Tides"". So if you liked the ""Pirates"" movies, you will enjoy this."
"paulijcalderon","7","6","22","24 May 2017"," Nice to see these characters back, but it wasn't everything I hoped for
","Let me tell you a tale of a film series that has inspired me over the course of 14 years. Yes, that's right. I am an admirer of the ""Pirates"" series. I've seen every one of them in the cinema and each time they've been some of my favorite movie going experiences. You go through a great adventure where you can have fun on the ride. These films always leave me feeling happy and as a good friend of mine put it: Inspired me to tell stories of my own.<br/><br/>I wanted there to at least be one more film. Just a final good one. The ending of ""On Stranger Tides"" is perfect in my opinion. Hate me all you want. But, the way they walk on that beach talking about the actual treasure not being what's important, but rather the joy in the adventure itself. That right there is an example of how these movies can leave you with an optimistic outlook. You wanna go out and enjoy things and be happy. I love that feeling. I waited six years for this movie and it got delayed numerous times. As much as it frustrated me I tried to stay calm. With the extra time they are given they will make sure they go out with a bang. That was my hope. To be honest, I couldn't wait. I even had dreams about seeing the movie and waking up to be disappointed it wasn't real. That's how much I care for ""Pirates"". Maybe I'm the only one in the world who anticipated it that much, but so be it. Days before the release date I got this scary thought. What if my expectations aren't met? What if I've been wanting to see it so much that I get disappointed? My hands were shaking when I got the tickets. I couldn't believe the day was here. I did my best to stay calm and go in with an open mind and to forget about the anticipation for a moment.<br/><br/>I can with full confidence say that it's not bad. It's just not as good as the rest. It's a completely fine time at the cinema. You'll laugh and get to see some well put together set pieces. My problem is the run-time and the pacing in the second act. It opens with an incredible scene. I mean, it had me. You feel the emotional connection with the character of Henry and the introduction of Salazar is fantastic. There's even a sense of mystery on what's happened to dear old Jack Sparrow. So we are with Henry on the quest to seek our Captain friend that we all have a good time with. Speaking of Jack. He has lost his touch which makes him a little different. It was sad to see him all drunk and miserable. It makes sense to give Jack some development, but he doesn't really find himself back by the end. They mention what's become of him and how he isn't the same person anymore. The drink and misfortune took the best of him. So this adventure might be what he needs to be inspired again. He longs to be at sea and for freedom. That would have been a fantastic story and a chance to give Jack Sparrow some true emotional moments. But, they don't go for it. You get hints of that. The scene where Gibbs says: ""We are on the edge of the line now"" saddened me too. It made me think that one day these characters will pass on.<br/><br/>It should have been longer. We have many stories and characters to cover and we don't have enough time with them all. That was my fear when I saw that it was the shortest in the series. It would have needed to focus and taken its time more. I think Depp might come across like he is sleepwalking through the performance here. Many of his scenes are still fun for what they were. He is a pirate who tries to come across as tough and like he doesn't care for others. In the end we know he does and he can't help himself to be endearing and show compassion towards his friends. Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is incredibly good once again. It's amazing how he has shape-shifted from being a villain to more of a good guy. To me it felt like Salazar was sidelined. Which is a shame because whenever he shows up he chews up the scenery. It does come together in the ending and it feels right. Everything is patched up nicely and the emotion is felt. But you will probably only feel the emotion and empathy for everyone if you are familiar with the characters. I miss Hans Zimmer. Geoff Zanelli isn't able to top the soundtrack from the other movies. There was nothing new that I can see myself humming to. He does an alright job here. The emotional connection was great at the beginning. The first half was fun, but unfortunately the second half didn't hit home run. It's with great sadness that I say that. I think that the greatest thing missing was more excitement. I should have feared for Jack's life when Salazar came after him, but I didn't. The excitement and urgency is important. We need that to really care for what's going. The same goes for time spent with characters. It goes through it all too fast.<br/><br/>I wanted to love it, but it wasn't truly there. It's completely watchable and harmless fun. The crowds will surely be pleased. It does work as a final chapter. They tie it with the first movie and I appreciate that. I still enjoy them all, but this is definitely the one with the least steam. Lots of great ideas here, just not realized to its potential. If you want a fun lightweight movie, then this will entertain you."

"dusuncelie","7","4","13","27 May 2017"," Strengths, cringes, Jack, and why this movie is more than acceptable.
","-Contains spoilers-<br/><br/>The fifth installment that I just couldn't wait to watch proved to be no disappointment. However, I can't say it blew me away either. It could, maybe, but some major cringe-worthy scenes towards the end of the movie just left me hanging about with mixed feelings as the credits rolled in. As I exited the cinema, however, on considering the whole movie from beginning to the end, I felt that the pirates actually exceeded my expectations, though not that much.<br/><br/>The strengths of the movie were many. The visual effects were awesome as always. The action sequences did not disappoint. Carina's scientific personality in such times and her strong presence was a delight. The story was quite full of much needed information and lore. The source of all the curses was revealed, Jack's past was uncovered a bit more, all of which was thrilling. <br/><br/>In the second part of the movie, if I remember correctly, there were some very clichÃ© and sloppy scenes between Henry and Carina. I don't blame the actor and actress though, but the horrible script writing in the dialogues of these two. This was one major problem for me because I had high hopes for a nice touch of romance in this movie and because of the lack of solid flirty scenes the ending just didn't feel right about these two. Another horrible issue with on of the ending scenes was when Elizabeth comes running from the fields like a stranded traveler. This being the first time we see the face of Henry's mother in a story so concerned with Henry just does not feel good. It feels rushed. No connection can be felt with Henry and Elizabeth, nor Will and Elizabeth in that respect. In my opinion all they had to do was add a scene or two at the beginning where Elizabeth cooks Henry some food or something and they discuss Will and they embrace each other to find strength in themselves and so on. This would have made things much more solid. <br/><br/>On one side note I would like to share my opinion on the Drunk stupid Jack thread. The way that Jack was presented in this way was all in line with the story. We pick up at a point where Jack is quite apparently having trouble with himself. The reason we are not given but we see that these problems affect his pirate life greatly as his crew leaves him. Seeing him in a not so perfect psychological level was welcome to me because it added a whole another depth to the character of Jack Sparrow and made him much more real and easier to connect with. Therefore I find it wrong to immediately jump to the conclusion that Johnny is too old that's why or stuff like that.<br/><br/>Overall Dead Men Tell No Tales was a movie that was worth my time because of the lore, Carina, nice insight into Jack's personality, the visual effects and the action. Although peppered with some sloppy scenes regarding the romantics and the Elizabeth issue, it was a great experience and I thank all those working in the project to come up with a slightly more than acceptable production."
"umutyelbasi","7","4","13","27 May 2017"," Not bad, but I've seen (and expected) better
","The whole movie was more like a school play than an installment of a huge franchise as PotC. I found it very unsatisfying even though it was fun to watch from time to time. <br/><br/>As a musician myself, and as a person who LOVES Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt's works on the previous PotC movies, I found the music very vague and unsatisfying. There was no depth to almost any of the pieces, and there were some parts that the music didn't even fit the atmosphere. Maybe I am being judgemental because I am used to see Zimmer's name under ""Music By"", but I still think the way I do. <br/><br/>Not a bad movie, but I've seen better."

"verik15","6","3","9","4 June 2017"," A bit disappointed
","Being a huge fan of the whole concept of the movies with incredible mixture of awesome actors, jokes, piracy being bad and good, jumping from sly to honest, ruthless to sentimental, there was always a feel that from obvious human values that the producers and directors were playing around in the first two parts of franchise they were now more willing to add more and more crazy fictional stuff that made the movies a bit less interesting to watch, (personally for me off course). <br/><br/>I was ready to witness quite something seeing the new villain that was so scary and threatening in the trailer. However the idea and story behind him was quite poor, just another walking angry dead man (same concept as the Pearl curse movie), that can not be killed, whose main source is revenge on lucky Jack. Common guys ... if you are pulling in all that Poseidon trident then maybe bring the God himself, that would at least connect it to something, rather than some random Spanish Captain who was ""cleaning the seas from pirates"". <br/><br/>I did expect to see young Mr Turner and him trying to save his father , however the confusion with the long lost daughter of Barbosa .... oh common that was too lame to bring in. I understand that it is important to bring female in the action, astronomy - great idea, witch - awesome reasonable cover and usual misunderstanding of those times for females who were interested in anything more then household. There was no need of making her Daughter of Fearless Hector. He is an awesome actor and I love what he brought in the franchise but his death should have been not like that and not in this movie.<br/><br/>Awesome trick with sharks, loved it! Great choice of actor for Henry Turner! It was pleasant to see the lovebirds reunite in the end but definitely would have added more scenes with Elizabeth and Will during the movie, since you brought them in the movie anyway while some of the scenes could have been shortened or even cut out at all. Jack was as cool as always, a bit too much drinking concept this time and less womanising :)"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","5","3","9","1 June 2017"," Even with new directors helming the film, Pirates 5 is still pretty mediocre.
","Dead Men Tell No Tales is probably metaphorical of the film's actual plot; the story here is extremely similar to the first Pirates of the Caribbean film. Even The Black Pearl makes an appearance in it. Jack and Barbossa are back in this film, but they're here because the actors signed up for it; their characters are just there for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has unfortunately outstayed his welcome as Jack Sparrow. As good as the character was in the first Pirates movie, he just seems to be playing a man we've already gotten enough of. He gets drunk again, flirts with a woman again, and helps break a curse... again! Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. That's pretty much what this film does. It's Pirates of the Caribbean. What else can I say besides... I've had enough of these films already."

","After a 5yr absence, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is the fifth installment of the series and the continuing adventures of the infamous Cpt. Jack Sparrow. Having hit choppy waters since it's fantastic first film, does this one finally recapture it's adventurous fun?<br/><br/>1. Having embodied a character (at this point) more popular than Indiana Jones, the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise would be truly lost without Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow. With wind in his sails, undying wit and drunken-luck on his side, it's hard not to love a character like Jack Sparrow. No matter which film(s) we like better than the others, Sparrow has stolen the show since 2003 and has undoubtedly grown on and become aware to every movie-going audience. I was delighted as anyone can be having him back on the silver-screen for what could be his final adventure. Needless to say, I couldn't help but think his luck and charm just might have run it's course with this film.<br/><br/>2. No doubt that Johnny Depp is in fact one of the greatest actors of our generation. He's an A-list star as well as a household name and now most notable to younger audiences for his portrayal of Sparrow. However, his characters on film may be immortalized, but Depp is in fact getting older and his fatigue does in show through this particular performance. Perhaps the blame can fall on the writing or the story as a whole, but the charm and wit we all love from this character is few and far between and solely replaced by drunken foolishness instead. We all look forward to what new mischief and tricks Jack has in stored, but I left the theater feeling as if he's now one big walking joke.<br/><br/>3. The plot revolves around Henry Turner (Brendan Thwaites) promising to rid his father (Orlando Bloom) of the Dutchman's curse by finding the Trident of the Greek God 'Poseidon'. In the case of Jack however, a former enemy who himself and his crew were enslaved as ghosts, are set free and seek revenge on Sparrow. As simple as this may seem, it unnecessarily becomes more convoluted. Karina (Kaya Scoldelario) a young astronomer gets involved, since she claims that she can navigate to the Trident's location by mapping the stars. Alas, even though she has more personality with her character than Thwaites, Scoldelario serves just a minor purpose to the plot and even less as a love-interest as she is utterly underused.<br/><br/>4. Having an Oscar-winning actor as the villain seems like a win/win scenario right?.....not exactly. Javier Bardem is indeed a great actor, but as the ghostly Cpt. Salazar.....he falters. Not only is he not as intimidating as one might think, but his Spanish accent is much too thick to where it's hard to understand his English. Bardem definitely falls short of the franchise's previous antagonists such as Geoffrey Rush (Barbosa), Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) and even Ian McShane (Blackbeard) to an extent. The film tends to work better as long as you focus on the characters that you've already invested in. The action scenes are done well, but never quite hits any exciting high-notes.<br/><br/>5. Besides fun and relate-able characters, the next important thing necessary in a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film is.....the Caribbean. Not only was this installment filmed entirely in Australia, but it's glaringly obvious that set-pieces were missing. There are way too many digital back-shots that take away from the organic feel swashbuckling films supposed to have. Filming for this ended in the summer/fall of 2015, and my guess for it's delayed release was the massive amount of CGI and art direction added in post-production. Not saying that all the effects were bad, but the CGI on the ghosts and the final action sequence is quite glaring. For it's second film 'Dead Man's Chest' to have won an Oscar for special effects, this was indeed a huge step back.<br/><br/>'Dead Men Tell No Tales' amounts to be an average and mildly entertaining flick. Rating this out of the franchise's five films, this would be #4, with 'At World's End' being by far the worst. 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is definitely the best, and I sure hope the filmmakers find their stride as they did with the first and have a successful return-to-form if there is to be a sixth entry."
"RforFilm","4","3","9","31 May 2017"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a tired rehash of the previous adventures that make this series closer to sinking
","""Yo ho, yo ho, a pirates life for me!"". These lyrics came from the popular Disney attraction, Pirates of the Caribbean and as of the past couple of years, the popular movies that came from them. What surprised most people was that pirate movies could not only be big bucks, but could also add elements like undead skeletons, cursed treasure and even rock star-like characters that could end up with Academy Award nominations (yep, Johnny Depp got that honor for a movie based off of a Disney ride). While I still consider the first movie an action masterpiece, the films that followed had never caught the same accidental perfection.<br/><br/>After the mega hit that The Lord of the Rings series was, Disney tried to replicate that with the Pirates of the Caribbean. The problem with that is that unlike Lord of the Rings which had a ton of characters to follow, Pirates only had a few I could name like Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Will Turner. Still, each movie has managed to generate success and it seems that people cannot get enough of Jack Sparrow and his pirate adventures. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continues the hijinks that our pirates get into. <br/><br/>Sometime after the events of On Stranger Tides, Henry Turner (played by Brenton Thwaites) is looking to lift his father, Will Turner's curse aboard the Flying Dutchman. He has spent years looking for clues that will lead him to Poseidon's trident, which is said to not only control the sea, but also has the ability to end all curses. He manages to find Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) for help, but is disappointed by how much of a drunken buffoon he is. Meanwhile, a young woman Carina (played by Kaya Scodelario) is also looking for the trident to prove that women can have an academic career in astronomy. She and Henry bump into each other and agree to join Jack Sparrow to try and find it.<br/><br/>But it looks like that Jack Sparrow has a couple of people following him. Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) has become a wealthy pirate since the previous movies and later becomes involved when he encounters the Bermuda Triangle and the ship full of ghost pirates as commanded by the undead Armando Salazar (played by Javier Bardem). Both end up following Jack Sparrow while our heroes try to find the trident. <br/><br/>While the new directors gave a promise of hope that new life can be put into the series, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is more of the same that has been done before. True, the story is different, but it's still about pirates going to break a curse (which was already done in Curse of the Black Pearl). It feels redundant on top of the story's major problem; we're not sure whose story it is. It seems to be between Henry Turner, who wants the treasure to help his dad, and Carina, who wants to prove her scientific research (even though she says she doesn't believe in the supernatural).<br/><br/>I can't say much about the acting. Johnny Depp at this point can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep, and seems to be doing so as half of his performance seems drunk. He's still the Jack Sparrow people love, but something here feels missing. I wouldn't be surprised if it had to do with the fact that Depp was going through his divorce or if wasn't as invested in the story as before. Javier Bardem does has his moments, but his CGI makeup felt overshadowing (which wasn't even the well rendered). While the majority of the cast was bland, I did like Kaya Scodelario who does bring a lot of likability to her character. <br/><br/>I'll give this four Jack Sparrows out of ten. Again, I got the feeling that this adventure had a ""been there, done that"" vibe that made the whole thing feel redundant. If your simply looking to get lost in a pirate adventure with Johnny Depp, you'll get it, but I'd still recommend Curse of the Black Pearl first. I hope that Depp can get onto another franchise, because this pirates series, as shown by this movie, is without a paddle."
"yunuyei-107-574373","3","3","9","30 May 2017"," Worst Pirates of the Caribbean
","I really loved the old trilogy and I also liked 3 despite it's flaws. The old trilogy had good costumes, good landscape shots, nice fights, well written dialogues and well written side characters. Part 5 has nothing of it. 1. Characters I didn't like Elizabeth and Will, but they fit perfectly in the universe and the actors did a great job. Jack was a brilliant and funny character and quite clever. Additionally we had a great cast of side characters who completed the universe. In Part 5 has forgettable main characters and side characters who had nothing do to in the movie. I had no sympathy for the main cast and the love story was quite forced. The old cast wasn't great too. Johnny Depp played a drunken, perverted idiot and not the clever Captain we know. Barbossa was nice, but overacted too and was wasted. Salazar was a standard villain and easy to forget 2. The scenery and costumes CGI everywhere. The old trilogy had nice pictures and outdoor shots. Part 5 is almost completely done with a green screen and doesn't look as good as the old ones. The costumes are really boring and aren't comparable with the fancy and great outfits of the old trilogy. 3. The story The story of the movie was simple and not creative. But to be honest, the old movies didn't have a great story too, but they had good characters and dialogues and much more to offer. In part 5 not only the story is bad, but also the pacing. The first 40 minutes are quite rushed: the movie doesn't take time to introduce the characters and the story. Everything is rushed and suddenly the movie get's really slow and boring. I was almost sleeping. The ending is rushed again and I was relieved when the movie was finally over.<br/><br/>My recommendation: Save your money, watch part 1-3 and pretend there is no part 4 and 5"
"luzm88","6","3","9","30 May 2017"," Good movie in general, but terrible Pirates movie overall
","On the whole, it wasn't a terrible movie. If you don't know the franchise, then watching this is kind of cool. This in itself is kind of a backhanded compliment as it's not a good sign that you don't have to watch the previous movies to be on board with this one. Some scenes might be confusing, but overall, you'd be fine.<br/><br/>On the whole, it's an action movie. Simple plot, simple characters, simple goals. They didn't , in my opinion, destroy the characters that they'd built over these past 4 movies. <br/><br/>All this being said, it was a bad Pirates of the Caribbean move! There was no character growth, the motivations for the characters were weak, and the new characters and possible plot points were discarded. Given what we've come to expect from a Pirates movie, this movie was so basic and simple. No new mythology or even no diving in the treasure of mythology that they've already created. I was SO disappointed in the Poseidon's Triton. They found it and destroyed it so easily and quickly. What was the point?!<br/><br/>PLOT ISSUES RANT: Sure it broke all sea curses, but what does that mean? Will there be no new sea curses? Especially given the Davy Jones post-credit scene. What gives? He was dead! Now he's not? As far as I saw, the Triton didn't bring back people to life that had been cursed by/at the sea. If it had brought him back, wouldn't he have been a normal human like Salazar? And what of the witch character Shansa? She seemed like a bad-ass character with whom they did very little and gave basically no backstory. How do they go from On Stranger Tides to this?! This is not to say that On Stranger Tides wasn't without it's issues, but at least it wasn't so simple. <br/><br/>My overall thoughts are that it was a good movie, but a terrible Pirates movie as it ignored the characters and mythology that it's created in favor of a simple sea action movie with ghosts."
"manojormanu","6","3","9","28 May 2017"," Passable
","We know from the history of this series (and plenty of other)that there is no point in expecting the glory of the first installment again. So for me, Salazar's revenge or Dead Men Tell No Tales delivered more or less what it promised. A laid back fun ride. Jack Sparrow is as likable as always and his timely wits, once again delivers the good. Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem were refreshing add-ons to the series. Kaya's obstinacy and charm reminded so much of the aura Keira carried during the initial phases of the franchise. Javier Bardem may not be the menacing villain of No Country for Old Men but still qualifies as a memorable antagonist. As you can expect, the film is CG packed and for most part enjoyable.<br/><br/>So overall, on the 2 hours and 30 minutes of its running time, I was not yawning or pulling my hairs out. That is the only kind of satisfaction I expected with this too."
"Neil-M09","6","3","9","28 May 2017"," The same formula as its prequels
","As for the script nothing new to say: Introduction, Jack Sparrow makes his great entrance, the British army chase him, more persecutions, comic moments, final fight. Very similar to its 4 predecessors.<br/><br/>The performances have been good but no surprises, the only strong point was the improvement in special effects. This saga with each new movie seems to lose emotion, only entertains for a while, but they still do not exceed the first 2 and I think they will not be able to do it."

And here we are with this one, a bunch ghostly villains and old Captain Jack Sparrow is back yet again to and it captivates immensely just like the original movie did...But what was amusing, clever and innovative in 2003's original, is back again.<br/><br/>Do not read the negative review on the net saying that its a rehash of the previous movies. The acting performances are stellar and Jack sparrow is yet back with his usual charm and witty antics.Depp remains wholeheartedly the focus of this fifth Pirates film, and saying the character's loopy novelty has faded is like complaining that there are maggots in the below-decks gruel: You knew what you were getting when you came aboard.""Yes dead men tell no tales but there is indeed a new tale with this one that goes back to the previous tales to tie up everything together. Watch it and u will not regret!"
"EatMyWords","3","2","5","6 September 2017"," Dead Men Tell Better Tales (than this)
","""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" or ""Salazar's Revenge"" is a recent attempt by Disney to keep a franchise afloat with a billion dollars. Unfortunately it turned out rather boring, and failed as an adventure, revenge-story and as a ""Pirates of the Caribbean-movie.""<br/><br/>This film is shorter and has a faster pace than its predecessors yet still feels compelled to inject needless characters and subplots where none is needed. The plot revolves around a maguffin with magical powers (the Trident of Poseidon) that multiple people are itching to get their hands on as well as a revenge-story involving a decayed Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar and the target of his revenge: Jack Sparrow. These two story threads connects to each other conveniently rather than organically and with a rattling pace and lackluster script filled with superflous characters, the film fails to achieve most of it's admittedly low potential. Skip the silly backstory with Jack trapping Salazar in some hell hole and get cracking with the Trident-plot instead and focus on Jack's growing irrelevance, age and uselessness as a main character arc. <br/><br/>Now, it ain't necessarily a complete waste of time. There are still scenes in here that will bring smiles to the lips of the less cynical portion of the fan base. One involves a guillotine, another the robbery of a bank and another dead sharks chasing after Jack. These scenes works well because of their slapstick tone, just like these movies used to. The original off course managed--on top of the slapstick--to create an exciting adventure with real dangers for our main characters. The sequels--to varying degrees-- lost the sense of adventure and stakes (sometimes both) but still contained tons of funny slapstick sequences, juicy dialogue and hammy acting you could lose yourself in, something this sequel is in short supply on.<br/><br/>Much of this doesn't really matter though, what really matters is its most glaring flaw: Sparrow and Depp themselves. Now it is true that Jack not acting and ""feeling"" like he used to is established from a Watsonian perspective: He's older, doesn't have his Pearl and has generally lost his luck at piracy. One certainly senses this self-reflexive take on the character, but the directors are too lazy or dumb to make anything of it. Here's the thing: Jack Sparrow was always a very specific type of character commonly seen in adventure and action-flicks. People loved to watch Jack outwit foes, flail around, escape captors and generally do and say silly stuff while one's in awhile and very far between do something ""human."" He functions as a character in much the same way that characters like Indiana Jones, John McClane or the ""Man with No Name"" function. They don't strike anyone as actually fleshed out human beings with believable psychology or belonging in the context of a ""real world"". They're fantasy characters here to mash on very specific emotions in the audience. And so this film makes Jack out to be in a bit of a funk, not quite functioning anymore. The idea itself is a good one (exemplified in two fine scenes; one in which Jack's crew abandons him and another one where we find out that the bounty on Jack has steadily decreased). It was time to show some weariness in this 15 years old character. In doing so however the creators needed to provide Jack with a clear arc and towards its conclusion either have him reclaim some of that former glory that made audiences love the character in the first place, or affirm in some meaningful way that the magic of Witty Jack from bygone years can never truly be re-achieved (the former is better for box office revenues and the future of the franchise but also really hard to pull off, the latter is better if you want to do something more intellectually defensible and bold). Safe to say, nothing like that happens here and so Depp--and by extension Sparrow--remains bored throughout, never reaches any of his previously established comedic or theatrical heights and ultimately lacks a meaningful resolution.<br/><br/>----In short: If Sparrow ain't a sparrow no more, then why not give us a new bird to marvel at? Maroon Bored Jack on an island, give him a pistol with one shot (or just shoot him) and leave him behind. Take your worm infested ship to nearest shore, repair, set sails, hoist the colors and let the wind carry you to new and unfamiliar adventures instead----"
"erikmy","5","2","5","3 September 2017"," Balance gone from adventure to a fairy tale
","In context of previous Pirates' movies its adventures are more fairy tail-like, rather than surreal and catchy. The attempt was to use the same working elements, but it should be characters to carry them out, who had unfortunately too little time to shine due to the must-have-plot. Yet I still suggest the previous movies."
"ericstevenson","5","2","5","20 August 2017"," What it does right it does right
","This is the fifth entry in the long running ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie franchise and it isn't getting any better. There are definitely good things about this movie but at this point, there are so many of these movies, like ""Transformers"" they aren't special and decline with age. Of course, they're still better than ""Transformers"" hee hee. Anyway, this movie features Will Turner's son trying to find a magic trident that will undo the curse put upon Will Turner that caused him to become bound to the Flying Dutchman. I do like the idea of them trying to do something that's important to the story.<br/><br/>The effects are very nice and it's always good to see Jack Sparrow. The problem is that the plot is far too simple and the villain is just lame. It's reached the point where we're just recycling old characters and we don't have any sense of finality or being in a new place. In a long running series, that can get annoying. Will and his wife were so great playing off of Jack but their absence in most of this movie just makes the film awkward. There's more action but certainly a sense of deja vu as it does seem we're just trying to throw everything in for a bigger movie. **"

","When an old enemy of Jack's arises from the dead to kill him, the famous pirate's only hope lies in a famous but unknown trident which he pursues with two youngsters who seek the artefact for their own reasons.<br/><br/>It's a pretty simplistic plot which presents another episode of Jack's adventures, while he is chased by the undead. The characters are not very well developed in terms of complexity but manage to keep up with the plot. There is also a reckless disregard of logic and physics, which is to be expected from this type of movie but it really seems too exaggerated at times. All these aside, you're going to watch it for the special effects which look spectacular in 3D and create a wonderful science fiction atmosphere. Oh, and for Jack Sparrow of course, who keeps you entertained with his jokes and typical attitude.<br/><br/>I have to say that it is quite an average movie, which doesn't excel in any aspect, apart from the visual part."

(I used to watch the trilogy in a single sitting - don't judge.) And I have to say that I was surprisingly entertained and satisfied with this entry of the series. One thing that the last one lacked was the impact of the main character i.e. Captain Jack Sparrow. It was this foolish, drunk(seemingly) and yet brave(arguably), cunning and unexpectedly lucky character whose witty puns and ingenious escapes that made this franchise what it is. And this movie takes a step towards returning the character to its former stature. And though it might not make it as good as it should be, it sure as hell is a lot better than what you would expect. The movie tries to bring back the old Jack while bringing back some old characters to go with it. You can argue their role but you cannot deny the nostalgia that you would feel - if only for a while. To me it was a very good attempt by the authors to nicely tie up the ends and a crucial comeback from their last disastrous attempt. If this movie is to be the end of the franchise I would be content with what I got."
"sean_winnett","10","2","5","22 June 2017"," Absolute Redemption for those still open to the series
","Sometimes initial reviews, especially those of the critics can shape the psyche of a movie goer. I would even go as far to say that some movies have been severely limited on the economical upside due to these preliminary reviews. The best example of this I can think of is a movie called 47 Ronin. I believe it came out at 9% on Rotten tomatoes and absolutely panned by overseas critics. I make no claim that 47 Ronin was a fantastic movie, but after being destroyed at the box office, and failing miserably (financially), the IMDb score eventually started to climb to a much more suitable value in time. A lot of effort went into that movie, but it never stood a chance.<br/><br/>A rotten tomatoes rating somewhere in the 20's for this Pirates instalment is absolutely asinine. It has already influenced those ready to smash the 1/10 button to find reasons to do so.<br/><br/>We did not see this movie immediately due to the initial reviews, and the defensive nature of the positive reviews (of which there were several). Many positive reviewers would defend their position as ""simply fans of the series"". Not a fantastic endorsement to say the least.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the series. I was a fan of the first movie. It was a clean, linear story line with fantastic character acting, hilarious engaging dialogue and some great action. The best part was the element of surprise. Nobody saw it coming and even large skeptics left the theatres with big smiles. After that Jack Sparrow turned into Homer Simpson. Far less effort in his schemes and dialogue sets. Mainly just random situations with a whole lot of babbling and flailing. The writers assumed the mere sights and sounds of Jack were enough. Although the graphics and action remained quite good, the content was just so much weaker. The story lines became bizarre, and not in a good way. There was constant filler, with emphasis on weaker characters trying to act out stronger roles. And I could go on.<br/><br/>This movie needed not attempt to recreate the first story, as the element of surprise was gone. What it desperately needed was an overhaul in content. The desire to make the writing, visuals and acting make us enjoy the movie, not the expectation established characters will do it regardless of content. At first it may have seemed like another random story thrown together so Homer Simpson (Jack) can bumble around for another 2 hours. This seemed particularly apparent during the first phase of the movie. I even found myself assuming that the reviews were likely to be more accurate. A tiny bit of patience and an open mind prevailed as the movie immediately took off after one particular scene. I would say this scene was a perfect representation of where this movie fits within the context of the series. There have been TONS of scenes of exactly this nature, but it was just done better. I went from being put off, to starting to chuckle, and it did not stop there. The smile stayed on the face through the entirety as they added bit after bit of hilarity fuelled by attention to detail. I'd not felt as positive about a scene since the first movie. From there the movie alternated contextual scene, to action scene (similar to the first), where the scenes for context were absolutely hilarious and the action scenes were consistently effective. The sheer effort placed into the dialogue of this movie was exactly what I was looking for. The volume of comedy (often fuelled simply by the dialogue) far outweighed scenes of suspense or drama. Even with that said, when called upon, the power house actors of this movie really made you feel what they wanted.<br/><br/>Was this the first Pirates all over again? Of course not! But it was an absolute redemption of something I did not think they could pull off. As it stacks up, I feel this movie and the first pirates instalment are a little bit different. Character development and story were paramount in making the first Pirates so successful. I wouldn't describe the first as a single genre, but a blend of so many. No doubt this instalment is also a blend, but I could much more comfortably describe this as a comedy. That is not to say that it didn't have fantastic scenes full of action, suspense, and even drama as well.<br/><br/>Those with an open mind will find this to be a wildly entertaining movie and score it highly. A handful may even see this as rival to the first. After all, it is much harder to write the extra content for a movie where all the characters are developed. <br/><br/>If you are mentally checked out, or rolling your eyes at the thought of more Jack Sparrow, I highly doubt you will feel the way I feel about this flick. <br/><br/>I simply wish there had been more of this kind of review a few weeks ago to balance the ratings and perhaps get more people out to the theatres. After all, I have suddenly found myself hoping they make another Pirates!"
"matayocro","7","2","5","14 June 2017"," The Worst One Yet and I Still Liked It
","Pirates of the Caribbean has been one of my favorite franchises since the beginning, my favorite having always been At World's End. One thing I really liked about this movie was the tie-ins to AWE, with the return of Will and Elizabeth, the Flying Dutchman, and even the cliffhanger at the end with the possible return of our favorite tentacle monster, Davy Jones. But more on that later<br/><br/>Another thing I enjoyed was the constant humor throughout, with the execution attempts on Jack and Carina, and definitely the banter between Jack and Henry. Although, the humor did seem to be layed on a little thick at times, making Jack seem like more of an accident prone goofball of a hero than the sassy and epic pirate we've seen from the past.<br/><br/>One thing I found a little irritating was that Jack seemed to be a completely different character. For the past four movies, Jack was a ruthless, swashbuckling, expert swordsman and marksman that made us love him even though he was usually doing no good. Even at times when he would fight his so called friends, we still rooted for him because we knew that they would fight on the same side again at the end, even when it didn't seem like it. However, it's obvious from the get go that Jack as changed his ways, and a little too much. He even goes far enough to save people he's just met, choices he's had to make before, but it took a lot of will power to save another before himself. Now he does it like it was nothing, which makes him seem more like a true Disney hero, but that's not what we sign on for at a Pirates movie. I want to see him struggle between being the thieving pirate everyone sees him as and being the hero he secretly wants to be.<br/><br/>Another thing i could've lived without was Carina being Barbosa's daughter. We already got the father-child dynamic with Will and Henry. Adding ""Carina Barbosa"" to the mix seemed really forced. And while Barbosa's sacrifice at the end was sweet and heart warming, it could've made sense even without it being his daughter. We've absolutely seen Barbosa become more tame through the series, moving from villain to hero in an instant, and his friends in turmoil would've been enough to make that sacrifice.<br/><br/>One thing I really loved was the reunification of Will And Elizabeth. We really don't know the history of those two after AWE, which was around twenty years before this installment. We know that Will returned once in the middle to visit his family, and that he met his son again two years later when he stowed away on the Dutchman, but other than that Will's voyages on the ghostly ship remain a mystery. The scene where he and Elizabeth run across the field at each other and embrace was of course cheesy, but it still warmed my heart to see them together again, by far being my favorite Disney love story and really the only one worth following. In a deeper sense, during Henry's action scenes and Will's cameos, I noticed and enjoyed the music from the background. If you're a conscientious Pirates lover, you'll notice that they used Will and Elizabeth's wedding and action scenes from AWE in Henry and Will's scenes. AWE had the best score in my opinion and I loved the throwback music very much. I also loved the post-credit scene with Davy Jones, and I'm really hoping to see both Will and Elizabeth again in #6, and hopefully a revived Davy Jones seeking revenge against Turner and Sparrow.<br/><br/>This movie has its faults, don't get me wrong, but it also has its bright spots. Mostly the best scenes are ones with throwbacks to the original trilogy, with Will and Elizabeth, Davy Jones, and even the returns of minor characters like Gibbs, Marty, and Mullroy and Murtogg. There isn't much to say about the new characters, other than that Salazar was too similar to Davy Jones, Henry and Carina's love story was pushed too hard, and the British empire's involvement in the affairs of Jack and the Black Pearl have become just confusing and unnecessary. Anyways, if you're looking for the best Pirates movie ever, you're out of luck. But if you're looking for a sequel that surpasses On Stranger Tides, then go out and see it.<br/><br/>Thanks guys! Drink up me 'earties, Yo Ho!"
"Mr-Fusion","6","2","5","13 June 2017"," Well if it ain't broke . . .
","There's a certain recipe to these movies, and ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" adheres faithfully to it Johnny Depp gets into one ridiculous situation after another, plays the dialogue with eccentric flair, all the while acting as a plot device for two central characters. In this case, it's Brenton Thwaites and the lovely Kaya Scodelario. There's an element here of getting the band back together as the crew and Barbossa reappear, and aside from some new curse, it's all very familiar.<br/><br/>It's not as overblown as I'd feared (and mercifully shorted than ""At World's End), and maybe that's because of the audience. The guy in from of me was pretty pumped when the Black Pearl made her return; we're talking' fist in the air.<br/><br/>Strictly as a vehicle for Johnny Depp to do his pirate thing, it's not bad.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I watch a movie to be entertained . Not to watch and worry about character development etc. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies as they kept me entertained. If a movie entertains me then I consider it a good movie.Why critics have to spout so much junk about movies I do not understand. If a critic says a movie is bad then I watch it and generally find that they are talking nonsense."
"austin0731","4","2","5","12 June 2017"," Fun? perhaps, but really just the same old, same old.
","This film is very much mirroring of Johnny Depp's career, He has become so molded into a character actor who must play these over the top strange characters that his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow has really became dull and unnatural in a sense. On the other hand movies such as Black Mass does prove that Depp is able to pull off more emotional roles with more depth involved. <br/><br/>So why is Pirates 5 very much like Depp's career as an actor, well personally I see this in many franchises as they extend to their 5th or 6th installments not to say that this is a certainty but it is often seen, the case where each sequel follows that same formulaic structure that all the predecessors follow, there's no new blood; Well in the case of the 2 latest Pirates movies there is an attempt of doing so but the filmmakers are so afraid of putting these new character forward that they simply get drowned By Captain Jack. So yes Pirates 5 was fun and yes it was enjoyable but really it went nowhere whatsoever. <br/><br/>About Depp and Jack Sparrow his performance in this film just seems like the same old thing, and what was once legendary now seems tiresome, annoying and ridiculous. He is no longer a groundbreaking performer but someone who is attempting to 'rekindle the fire' and the desperateness, it shows. Also the 'young couple' that Sparrow must team up with are very under utilized and may have been great, I really can't tell because of how little their characters were explored.<br/><br/>I am personally a supporter of the second and third installments of this franchise and I think the biggest reason why is that it progresses the story further, whereas these past 2 films really just went nowhere and seemed like side quests in this greater main plot line. This leaves me wanting to move back to the main storyline desperately, I do hope that with the addition of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner in this film we may see a return to forms and a continuation of a story. Afterall I think what was so compelling in the franchise's early days was how there was a sense of adventure and questing as audiences leap from film to film."

","I don't like it better or worse than Part IV but just like ""On Stranger Tides"" it is not on par with the original three movies ( and yes I loved the first and really liked the second and third) but it did have its moments and it did have some cool ideas and scenes. I particularly liked the ending which had some nostalgic and emotional vibes. But yes the franchise is more or less over, and I say that although I liked it. The screenplay and especially dialogues were really not good and rather dry - or try hard? Johnny Depp proves that he obviously only does it for the pay cheque (while i really was motivated in part 1 - 3 ) his character falls more and more flat. Javier Bardem was not good here either. I really did not like his character nor his performance. Glad that the great Geoffrey Rush was back and he was the only one who really seemed to have enjoyed being there. And I was happy to see Orlando Bloom back (never thought I would say that) because that brought back some tiny little dynamic the former films had. The two new youngsters Brenton Thwaits and especially Kaya Scodalario were fine and had decent enough characters and motivations. Why I still liked the film? The action scenes were great. Many fantastic stunts and action value which constantly kept me entertained. There were some really nice twists. Oh and they finally put more emphasize on the great score again. Cinematography and visual effects were also good. But if there is ever be a sixth one I hope they bring back Bloom and Keira Knightley in main roles again for nostalgic reasons and to bring back the old dynamic of the trio which is one of the reasons the first three films worked so well. Oh and Gore Verbinski probably wouldn't hurt either."

After the weak adventure of On Stranger Tides, directors: Joachim RÃ¸nning and Espen Sandberg are Captain of the ship in another poor excuse for a sequel.<br/><br/>Set 9 or 12 years after the events of At worlds End, Will Turner's son, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) pursues Jack Sparrow to help him find the Trident of Poseidon to help free his father's curse, but is ambushed by dead man Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem) to deliver his message of vengeance to Sparrow. This leads to a clash of characters being terrorised by the dead, and all in hopeful search of this Trident.<br/><br/>Although the Pirates series has never been perfect, I have always found satisfactory enjoyment in the first three, but now I have lost patients. What you have the same reused material and structure again, but really exhausted to the point of apathy. From the very beginning I immediate had no excitement or enthusiasm and just didn't really care at all. Although the main narrative thread is hat they are searching for this magic artefact, (as usual) there is also much else going on, in underdeveloped mini stories just leading nowhere, or nowhere important.<br/><br/>You still do have the same swashbuckling action, turned up to a ridiculous degree, moving banks, to zombie sharks, which may still be kind of fun but just too ridiculous, and wasn't enough to keep the woman sitting next to me awake, or the person in front off their phone.<br/><br/>What the entire film really relies on is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has rightly so by other critics become a routine, but just a very annoying routine. I know the whole point of Sparrow is to e a bumbling fool, but from the beginning the character is just drunk, and stays like that for the rest of the film. It feels like a fan's very oversold impression of Sparrow, and Depp is just there to do his thing.<br/><br/>What I was hoping to save the film, was Barden's performance as the villain, which he appears to be the only one actually in his character and very intimidating, but is sadly not enough to save the film.<br/><br/>We also have the knew Keira and Orlando replacements played by Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario, both just walking plot devises helping to move the story on in no direction. Combined with their weak acting talent and the appalling script, the entire experience is just aggravating. There is even a small theme that is meant to comment on the historical social ideas at the time, which I personally fund to be quite offensive, but I don't know to what degree that it is accurate.<br/><br/>Which leads on to the jokes, which by some miracle amused the audience I was with, but did not impress me, besides its humour we surely must all have seen in any other family comedy, but just became another reason to get frustrated.<br/><br/>So in the end there is nothing really to like in Pirates 5, it may entertain a younger audience, but I completely lost patients with it. Its not terrible, but just nothing really good happens. 5.5/10"

The movie didn't even seem like 2 and a half hours. I experienced no lulls in the movie and while there were a few touching scenes, this movie was a lot of fun to watch. A lot of old familiar characters. It was fun to see them in this movie, as well as some new characters, Henry Turner, Karina Smyth and Salazar. <br/><br/>**SPOILER** I love how they brought Will Turner and Elizabeth Swanns love story full circle.

","I give them excellent 10 because I really like Captain Jack Sparrow. I am a little disappointed because Jack is stupid and drunk, and changed... Is so changed, in the bad way. He was there in the story, but not taking part of it. All the action is near Jack, but not with Jack. Everybody was talking about him, but the story was about everybody else. He is not funny any more, he is somehow forced in the acting (not so natural like in the first movie). We have a very drunk Jack, giving his precious compass away for a bottle of rum, and he didn't know how to release the Pearl from the bottle.<br/><br/>Salazar is an interesting character, but not that good to remember him. Something is missing, but I don't know what.<br/><br/>The story between Henry and Barbossa's daughter is weak, I didn't see a look, a word or a kiss that showed their feelings. Will and Elisabeth love story is much better and more real. <br/><br/>Barbossa's story with his daughter is beautiful, it is so sad that he dies at the end. I really hope he will come back somehow. And I am still waiting for the story between Calypso and Davy Jones. And in the next movie I really hope that Jack will find someone. All the time someone takes away from him the female characters. (Except the 4th movie when he runs away).<br/><br/>The 3D effects are very special and interesting, but there are not enough, combined with bad acting and no good story. <br/><br/>I am waiting for the next movie because in the end seemed like Jack is coming back on the good track.

I know there are many mixed reviews about this movie, but most of the people saying ""We don't need another Pirates"" likely haven't even seen it. It's just like 'Diary of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul.' People should at least give it a chance before jumping to conclusions about the new cast. But anyway, this Pirates of the Caribbean was by far the funniest. The action was a little hard to see at first, meaning the camera angle, but the final battle turned out amazingly.

","Dead Men Tell NoTales But Dead franchises certainly have the ability to do so. Yes this franchise came back from the dead with the possibility of saving it. As a major fan of the first 3. The Davy Jones saga intertwined with the foundation of the Black Pearl story perfectly. Hence setting up a universe and a pirate mythology. Viewers need to note this, this is a fantasy franchise based on pirate mythology and not a swashbuckling adventure film. The 4th film in the franchise was a major let down. It was a more of a steroid induced spin off than a sequel. This 5th film how ever, establishes basics and sets the tone back to the first one. A huge improvement. <br/><br/>Unfortunately not quiet living up to the first 3. The use of Will Turner was really disappointing. They perfectly set the tone up for a return but did not execute a story line. Rather turning it into a cameo than a star billing cast member. The Music wasn't bad, felt good with the pacing and with the movie portrayed but no aesthetics to it like Hanz Zimmer conducted in the first 3. <br/><br/>Acting: 8/10 (Javier Bardem, this guy is a class act. The range of Villainous characters he brings to the screen is crazy. Johnny Depp, the big show or the no show? A different Jack Sparrow, not the one we are use too. Stupid jack, lost his mojo, but it ties within the plot line. The 2 youngsters were a great refreshment, in fact they were the leads. The small cameo that Orlando Bloom had was dark & ghostly. Wished the plot revolved around him but he was just the foundation unfortunately. The dark aura of the Flying Dutchman that he brought in the small screen time that he had will leave you wanting more).<br/><br/>Action: 8/10 (Brilliant Visuals and Excellent Action Sequences. This film has a lot of major sequences. This is where it may be a let down, got slightly too much needed more pirate to pirate action).<br/><br/>Sound: 7/10 (Surround sound in Dolby Atmos was good but not ground breaking that can give one the wow factor. The music sounded great but no aesthetics).<br/><br/>Story: 7/10 (There was a lot going on. A lot to follow. Some may think it's a flaw, too rushed or over crowded but from a franchise trying to keep the ship afloat its a good thing. It expanded the universe, characters were funny and had a purpose. Though there was a flashback scene which might turn out to be a plot hole where only fans will pick up. Unless this gets fixed in the next film).<br/><br/>Feels/Nostalgic: 7/10 (When you're 5 films into a franchise nostalgia is a must. Yes there were call backs to previous films but I don't feel they were well executed. The film had small heart throb moments but nothing that will bring out the onion eyes).<br/><br/>Final rating: 7.4/10"

One criteria that I base cinematography on is water. H2O, how Real does it look, and does it carry the significance of life with it, as water symbolically does in many ways. Action, Life and Rebounding character is what this movie conveys...along with just being an excellent example of what Disney can do, and set the standard for, many years ago; fun escapism fantasy. It reminds me of when I saw the first Indiana Jones movie or, of course, the first 'Pirates' movie. Although the follow ups are good, one always feels the first is best. This 5th in the Pirates series is as good as seeing a movie genre at first fresh viewing. The Action violence is in the genre of swash buckle fantasy and is not disturbing like it could be if in a realistic drama.

Geoffrey Rush breathed another fresh breath of air into the series as Barbossa, and Depp once again performed well as Captain Jack. Be sure to stay until the very end of the credits to see a very cool extra scene with a large cliffhanger!"
"kiwijinxter","10","2","6","5 June 2017"," Pirates returns to form, with a vengeance!
","Once again, the ""professional critics"" show they are ignorant and know nothing about a darned good story! Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a true return to form. <br/><br/>The feeling I got when I first watched this was the same feeling I got when I watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It reminded me of the excitement of the early movies, the intrigue, and the sense of wonder, all captured in the first movie. After the so-so Pirates 3 and Pirates 4 (which I feel was the worst of the series), this is the Pirates' return to form. It has everything. It's got action like Fast & Furious, it's got familiarity like Star Wars, it's got heart and jokes like, well, the first Pirates of the Caribbean. And of course, FANTASTIC CGI - I couldn't stop staring at that ""floating hair"" of Captain Salazar! <br/><br/>This is a movie beautifully made for those who longed for the excitement of the first one. The characters are all fleshed out well - Henry Turner, Carina Smyth (hint: I won't throw spoilers here about her name), Captain Barbossa and of course, aye, silly old Jack Sparrow. You'd be missing out big time if you listened to the useless professional critics. Watch it, and decide for yourself. Thankfully, I always ignore pro critics - they're the most unreliable bunch when it comes to movies. <br/><br/>Ultra highly recommended if you liked the first Pirates. This installment has truly redeemed the series. Go Pirates!"

I don't understand the people, who give it only one star, please don't do that, you probably don't know what a one-star movie is and it is not this one!

"misaiga","8","2","6","2 June 2017"," Something new, something old, but it still leaves me cold
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge/Dead Men Tell No Tales is fifth one in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and you can tell it. I went to see this movie a bit optimistic but also prepared for a disappointment. I gotta admit, this movie was good but it wasn't astounding. The movie as a whole is enjoyable and exciting, but something about it seems off. Bringing Orlando Bloom as Will Turner back to this film was a good idea but his presence in this film is lacking and not even in an exciting way. He's barely there. The new characters brought by Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites are a breath of fresh air and as individuals they work well. Nonetheless their roles are nothing they'll be remembered by. One of the greatest issues I have with this film is the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow. As a major Johnny Depp fan I was intrigued to see how well he performs Jack this time around. He wasn't tipsy in this film - he was drunk. That took something away from the old Jack I've used to see and replaced it with something I didn't find intriguing to see. He also had a few inferior lines that didn't appeal to me at all. Otherwise Jack Sparrow in this film was extremely hilarious and the Jack I grew up loving. But this time around he had more flaws than ever before. Something that I truly missed in this sequel were two things: Hans Zimmer's musical score and Gore Verbinski's prestige directing. Music wasn't as flamboyant as before and directing (even though worked well) didn't reach the level of fluency that Verbinski had in the first three films. So why did I give this new Pirates of the Caribbean 8 stars out of 10? I gotta admit, it's the nostalgia. This movie feels more connected to the previous ones than On Stranger Tides which was more like a spin-off from the Pirates universe. And also the ending is phenomenal. After the last scene you get out of theater thinking ""It wasn't that bad at all. Actually it made sense and I liked it"". Even though the nostalgia can't save every flaw in this film it does make the film better. Simply, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in good but not great."

","'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The fifth film in the 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN' film franchise, with Johnny Depp once again reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. In this installment Jack must locate an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon, in order to stop his old enemy Armando Salazar, and his Spanish ghost navy crew, from controlling the seas and killing every pirate on them. The film was directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg, who also co-directed the 2006 western-comedy 'BANDIDAS' (starring Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz). Jerry Bruckheimer once again produced the movie, and it was written by Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio. It costars Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario and Javier Bardem. Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley all reprise their roles from the earlier films. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has done well at the Box Office so far (on a $230 million budget!). I think it's at least better than the last sequel.<br/><br/>Henry Turner (Thwaites) desperately wants to break a curse that is imprisoning his father, Will Turner (Bloom). He needs an artifact called the Trident of Poseidon in order to do so. Henry believes that Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) can help him find it. At the same time Jack's old nemesis Armando Salazar (Bardem) has escaped the Devils Triangle, with his Spanish Navy ghost crew, and he's coming for Jack. An astronomer, named Carina Smyth (Scodelario), who's also looking for the artifact, joins Henry and Jack on their journey.<br/><br/>The movie starts out promising but (like the other installments in the series) it gets overly complicated and somewhat boring in the middle. It also ends with a great climax though. Depp is once again hilarious in the lead role, but it's definitely nothing we haven't seen him do before. The movie also has some great visuals and the action scenes are somewhat exciting too. I mostly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/4Bt6rG-Wb0c"

They put the best (and only)entertaining or funny scenes in the trailers and that was it. I want to feel disappointed but I could see it coming. On a more positive note I thought that Javier Bardem made an excellent villain with his appearance and voice which really did provide something new and fresh to the franchise but ultimately didn't like up to the likes of Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) or Bill Nighy (Davy Jones). In a attempt to modernize the franchise the jokes were lame and unfunny while the film lacked any real flair or flow and was over crammed with too many characters and too much crosscutting. It was far from captivating and you found yourself during the movie daydreaming and making plans for the upcoming week. 5.8 out of 10<br/><br/>You best get yourself a nice bottle of rum while watching this to aid your overwhelming disappointment."

"spincus-02487","7","2","6","28 May 2017"," A Riveting Return to the Pirates Series
","As a fan of the Pirates series, I've been waiting for this installment for many years now. It was upsetting to see the film delayed to release dates in 2015 and beyond, but at long last, the Pirates series continues with a fifth installment. <br/><br/>Dead Men Tell No Tales is definitely a step up from the previous film, On Stranger Tides, which focused on a mostly new cast and took the story and its characters in a very different direction. Dead Men Tell No Tales brings back old characters while also fleshing out an interesting story. I've some complaints about the film, and what better way to start than with the plot holes? <br/><br/>If Jack gives away his compass, the thing he fears most will be released - and that thing is Salazar. This concept seems feasible, but how does Salazar know this is possible? How does he even know about Jack's compass, let alone anything about Jack beyond what he saw at the Devil's Triangle? Why is Blackbeard's sword able to restore the Black Pearl to its original size? In the film's post-credits scene, Davy Jones' resurrection is hinted at. It would be an interesting twist - but if the Trident's destruction eliminated any curses in the sea, why would Jones still look like a tentacled-monster? The Trident's destruction even caused Salazar to turn from a ghost to a human again. Also, the concept of the Trident breaking all curses on the sea. Let's talk about that. The only reason this concept came to be was so Will Turner could be freed from the Dutchman's curse. And even that isn't done very well. Will's son Henry strives to claim the Trident so it can break his father's curse. Might I mention that this fabled weapon appears in the film for three minutes, before being destroyed by Henry, despite being the focus of the film's plot?. At World's End proved that the Dutchman must always have a captain. Maybe this ties in with Jones' possible resurrection? It doesn't make sense, at least not right now - and that's the problem. Jones couldn't walk on land in his cursed form, and in the scene he's evidently cursed and implied to be alive, but the Trident wouldn't allow this ... you can ponder that yourself. <br/><br/>I also felt there was a lack of interaction between Salazar and Jack. The film focused on their rivalry and did a great job setting up the concept of it, yet the two characters aren't really shown confronting each other. We get a great flashback scene with them. Then there's a brief beach scene, a scene where Salazar's crew raids the Pearl and he fights Jack, and the final fight when Salazar claims the Trident. Their fight felt very underwhelming, considering Salazar wielded such a powerful weapon and all he did was use it to shoot water at Sparrow. Seriously? <br/><br/>The film did succeed in many areas. Geoff Zanelli did a good job writing the film's score and reprising old themes. Unfortunately, he didn't introduce many outstanding new themes like Hans Zimmer would with his scores. Salazar's theme is great, and the Trident has a cool motif too. It was great to see Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann return, even though their roles weren't huge. Supporting characters, like Marty and Scrum, also came back, and it was great to see them too. The return of the Flying Dutchman and especially the Black Pearl was awesome as well. Seeing Barbossa get killed off was heart-wrenching, as he's been such a well-developed character in the series, but I felt the character's story had been told. And he died so that his daughter could live - a person he always cared about, but had forsaken many years ago. <br/><br/>All in all, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a decent addition to the Pirates series that builds things up again after On Stranger Tides. Originally I feared the film would pull a Force Awakens and re-adapt the original installment in the series. While it draws inspiration in some aspects, as a whole the film expands on the series."

","Henry Turner (Will's Son) is in desperate need of finding Captain Jack Sparrow so that he can free his Father (Will Turner) from the Dutchman. Captain Jack Sparrow as always is up to no good and is in trouble himself! Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) is living in the land of the dead and will stop at nothing until Sparrow is dead.<br/><br/>The story starts out incredibly well and keeps your eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Within the first 30 mins or so it starts to slow down a little bit, which is a little disappointing. The acting by everyone is fine, including newcomers Brenton Thwaites (who plays Henry Turner) and Kaya Scodelario (who plays Carina Smyth). Johnny Depp is really what keeps the entire film going and you can tell he's having a great time playing the drunk, witty and hilarious Jack Sparrow! Javier Bardem is an excellent choice for a villain. He's very intimidating, straight to the point and wastes no time on killing whoever he wants, whenever he wants. There's no mercy with him. Problem is that the script doesn't allow him to shine as much as he could. He needed more screen time and more lines.<br/><br/>All in all it's the best Pirates Film since the 2nd one. It's a fun film, and you're bound to really enjoy yourself. Especially if you're a die hard Pirates fan. The critics have been too harsh on the film by saying it's pointless and how Jack is cruel etc. Completely over exaggerated. Dead Men Tell No Tales is fun on an epic scale, it's a vast improvement over the last installment in terms of script, tone, visual effects and chemistry. The professional critics may be mixed to negative about this one, but from me personally I knew what I wanted to see and I got it, leaving the cinema with a cheery mood and a feeling of satisfaction.<br/><br/>3.5/5 - Nick 3/5 - Jay Check out for more reviews on Instagram and our Facebook page."
"wolfordcheyenne","6","1","2","21 March 2020"," Forgettable
","Nothing about this movie is memorable. They turned Captain Jack Sparrow into a joke. In the previous movies he was clever, in this one he's a drunken idiot that gets out of situations solely because of luck. The best part was Javier Bardem as Salazar. I don't know why they're still making these movies."
"abhijith-alpha","5","1","2","12 August 2019"," Enough is enough.
","Basically a rehash of the last 4 movies, the fifth installment of the franchise shows how far Jack Sparrow has come since the dizzying heights of Curse of the Black Pearl. He has travelled far, but in a downward direction.<br/><br/>Not being as drawn out as At World's End or as droll as On Stranger Tides is not good enough. Even with the addition of two characters who can be compelling if developed further, Salazar's Revenge seems like the storywriters went back and cherry-picked the best things from the franchise and then tried to spin it out as a new story. There's the legend of a dreadful place that seafarers shouldn't go to, more than a few curses, the undead/evil-incarnate pirate captain with his ghost ship, the naÃ¯ve and idealistic young man seeking to free his father from a curse, the enterprising, enlightened and liberated young woman far ahead of her time, a hilarious robbery sequence, and of course, Jack Sparrow doing his thing. If only.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow ('Captain' Jack Sparrow, he would've insisted once upon a time) is a shadow of his former self, drinking himself away because he just can't bring back his beloved Black Pearl. Unfortunately, he doesn't get any better, as an uninspired Johnny Depp sleepwalks through the movie. Which is a shame really, as Jack Sparrow is a singularly unique portrayal of a hero in a mainstream movie franchise. The spark and the sashaying, the peculiar swagger and the cocky assuredness in the face of uncertainty are all missing. The script doesn't help either, as this movie doesn't use the character in any way. He's just there. Instead, Henry Turner and Carina Smyth do most of the things of significance, whether it is rescuing Jack from being executed (again), or figuring things out. It's surprising to watch the man who figured out how to escape from Davy Jones' locker being unable to decipher the open sky.<br/><br/>Ian McShane was a disappointment in On Stranger Tides as the legendary pirate Edward Teach. The performance was not suited to the pirate who all other pirates feared (If you want to see what McShane is capable of, watch HBO's Deadwood (2004-06) in which he turned in the performance of a lifetime). But Javier Bardem doesn't disappoint here. With Johnny Depp disappearing again, he's left to save the movie, interestingly, just like Penelope Cruz, his wife, had to with the previous movie. He commands the screen, chewing, spitting and seething as Captain Armando Salazar. There is something about this actor, and he has never failed to excite me in any movie he was in. Channeling something, perhaps left over from No Country For Old Men, he is easily the best character from the last three movies. I almost wish he had gotten his revenge, just to make sure they kept him around for future use.<br/><br/>Brendon Thwaites, who I saw previously in the tepid Blue Lagoon sequel in 2012, as Henry Turner, turns in a performance as a young man seeking to redeem his father that'd make Orlando Bloom proud. Bloom himself makes a cameo, as Will Turner, captain of the Flying Dutchman, to warn Henry that some curses cannot be broken, and to stay away from Jack Sparrow, which like every child in the history of humankind, Henry disobeys, setting the events on their turn. Kaya Scodelario, fresh off running around with Dylan O'Brien in the Maze Runner franchise, looks to replace Keira Knightley as the First Lady of the series, and may succeed if she's given enough material in the coming installments. Geoffrey Rush, always welcome to mess up Jack's plans as Hector Barbossa, returns to delight once again, even though there's an unnecessary character arc fitted in. This is somewhat surprising, as Barbossa doesn't need extra embellishments to justify his tag of being a fan-favourite. Kevin McNally does his best as Jack's first and best mate Gibbs to infuse some humour into the proceedings, even with the pirates-are-dumb trope getting old. Golshifteh Farahani doesn't get time to make an impact as the voodoo priestess, but I'm sure she'll return to mess with Jack soon. Even with excellent performances in Top of the Lake and in Marvel's Iron Fist, David Wenham is relegated to playing a black-and-white Royal Navy officer. Sure, he's no Norrington, but c'mon.<br/><br/>The action sequences are not entirely original. The bank robbery sequence is reminiscent of the bank vault robbery sequence in Fast Five, though funnier. Captain Salazar's ship is a barebones frightener as opposed to Davy Jones' slimy, rotting Flying Dutchman. To see it approach your ship, day or night, and do its jaw-opening thing, would be more terrifying, on the whole. The climactic action sequence disappoints as a set piece, doing its job and no more.<br/><br/>First Half: 5/10
Second half: 5/10
Direction: 5/10
Screenplay: 4/10
Acting: 5/10<br/><br/>Verdict: Not boring, not listless, but not exciting either. Go for Javier Bardem."

It has some fun scenes and good moments but it's mostly a bland filler entry in the Pirates Franchise and while it has a good ending it never truly justifies its existence.

","First one that is almost as much fun to watch as the original. EVery other sequrl before this one has been dreadfull. This is also the first movie with Johhny Depp, Ive seen since the original Pirates movie, where I didnt wanna strangle him for looking bored, constipated and half asleeo, phoning in his performance for a very big paycheck. Depp actualluy has fun here, which makes his performance that much better. He is not cunning and cool like he only ever was in the origfinal movie, but he IS Jack Sparrow. And that is a big compliment to him. <br/><br/>This movie has the best special effects in the series so far. And I'm not talking about the young Jack Sparrow scene, which is also well done, but every movie these days has to show a younger version of one of the main character these days. And just like the others: Carrie Fisher. Kurt Russel and so on and so on, its a little creepy and a little fake looking. A young Robert Downey Jr. is the most convincing youth version of a character/actor yet. With Depp coming in as second. <br/><br/>It is also nice to see a female lead played by Kaya Scodelario, who unlike the flat chested and no ass- Keira Knightley is actually sexy and a real woman. <br/><br/>Ive never liked Keira Knightley. Ive always found her body repulsive and her acting wooden. She has that obnoxious smirk that Lena Headey also has, that makes them good at playing upper class british women and pretty much nothing else. Kaya Scodelario who is not beautiful like Keira Knightley all though easy on the eyes is a much better actress. The actor playing Will Turners son is nothing more than a discount version of Orlando Bloom. Who is also not a very good actor. <br/><br/>*SPOILER AHEAD*<br/><br/>This movie finally concludes the story of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. And Hector Barbossa I will not tell you how. Will and lizabeth is not in the movie much, but a post credit scene could make them the stars of the inevitable sequel. All though Disney should quit while theyre ahead. After three awful money grabbing sequels, they finally recaptured the magic from the oiriginal and ended the saga well if you will."

The first one will be always my favorite, but this one did great. I did not love it, but I liked it!
And I found a lot of problems in this movie!
The humor most of the time was ridiculous and not funny!
The way we saw Jack Sparrow for the first time in this movie, was usual, it was perfectly CGI-ed, but made no sense!
The performance of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was not impressive as it was in the first movie, but it was good.
I am still hoping to see a movie such as the first one in this franchise, cause they made some wrong things right in this one.
The performance of the characters was not bad, but not really good.. less than fine to be honest!
I loved the performance of Barbossa, Salazar and I liked Jack Sparrow too.
The action scenes were pretty good, and the CGI was totally amazing!
Sometimes it was funny, but not every joke worked up with me actually.
The story was more than great, and the ending was the best ending in the franchise!
As a result, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is such a good movie, so I am going to give a 7/10.

The plot is boring and contrived, the acting is lackluster, and Johny Depp's performance can only be described as pathetic. The only thing keeping me from giving this one star was the fact that I was able to get through it. And even that was a miracle.

","In general, I am not a fan of the pirates series but I particularly enjoyed this one. It is an adventure that will keep you entertained without looking at your watch. I particularly like the acting from Bardem as Salazar while Depp is as usual a pleasure to watch him. The movie has a constant flow, well written with beautiful pictures. To sum up, the movie manages to deliver what it promises and more. I would definitely recommend it if you want to relax for a couple of hours in a world full of pirates, sailors, ghosts, ships and a monkey. Enjoy"

","The first POTC movie is still one of my all-time favourite movies, and I loved the second one too. I thought the third was awful, and the fourth was decent but not amazing. So going into a *fifth* POTC movie, I was sort of having a mix of curiosity and wondering if this would be really, really bad.<br/><br/>Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. Me & my family were cracking up at a few parts that were quite cleverly written. Salazar was an interesting villain, the adventure hook was pretty good, and I like that it tied into events from the second movie. It was just all-around a pretty good movie :)<br/><br/>And in my opinion, one of the places where the last 2 movies were weak was in their focus on Jack. Jack Sparrow is a great character, absolutely. But he's also the kind of character that works best when balanced out by a more serious character, the same way a comedic team needs a goofy guy and a straight man. This movie put him back with more ""regular"" types of characters in an equal share of the plot with him, and I think that really brought a good balance to the cast.<br/><br/>So yeah, all in all, me and my family enjoyed it. I'd put it roughly on par with the second movie."
"jjparish","Null","1","2","20 September 2017"," I am bored with jack sparrow.
","Especially this clownish/childish/third rate version depp lazily serves up in pirates films 4 and 5. This is something i never thought i would say after heartily enjoying films 1 to 3. However i must say now that without keira and orlando to slightly rein in depp's sparrow, it has become unwatchable. If keira and orlando turn out for pirates 6 then yes i will continue to watch. Without them, but with another lightweight couple like thwaites and scodelario, this flabby franchise will not get a penny more of my money."

From my point of view it is over the 4th part from 2011 and it is as good as the first 3 movies. The film is mandatory to be seen in the cinema, the effects are great, it has good humor and a Johnny Depp as we all know in a full form. I also enjoy the young actress Kaya Scodelario, who plays a pretty good role. The film must be seen especially by the fans of the series, it is not cinematic art, but it is a production that introduces you into a fantastic and special story, the story being well built."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","2","7 October 2017"," Much more entertaining than the last couple sequels
","Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has been around for quite some time now. While it is one of the few film series that was based on a theme park ride, it has shown to be quite profitable nevertheless. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) was a surprise hit, while the next two sequels after it were more or less just guaranteed to come with it. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) was about as entertaining and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) tried to finish off with a bang, but ended up making things overly complex. In an attempt to bring it down a notch, Disney made Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). The idea was to have a one-off story about Jack Sparrow and his adventures. According to critics, that wasn't why so many people enjoyed the initial three, thus it was the lowest earning sequel. Finally after a long wait, the mouse house made this sequel, which in all honesty is a much more glorified return to its roots.<br/><br/>The story turns its focus to that of Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who now serves the Flying Dutchman. Wanting to free his father from the curse, he sets out on the search for Poseidon's trident. He who is able to break the trident breaks all of the ocean's curses. While on his search, he meets Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) who is also looking for the trident and is a gifted astronomer. It is then at that point, they cross paths with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his crew led by Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Following closely behind is the zombie Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew hoping to kill Sparrow for his untimely demise. On top of that, Salazar hijacked Captain Barbossa's (Geoffrey Rush) ship in order to find them. The separate plot threads may sound a bit all over the place, but they all converge easily into one another unlike the stories presented in prior films like Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007). Plus the script has great character connections.<br/><br/>Much of the original background crew members have changed and surprisingly, it's almost like nothing was replaced. Penned by Jeff Nathanson instead of Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, the script stays faithful to the earlier movies. The reintroduction of older and newer characters is handled fairly well. Occasionally there is mistake like how a character played by Golshifteh Farahani manages to get her hands on item that belonged to Jack Sparrow. It's not explained. But overall the execution is clear on how the story is told. Nathanson was also the writer to Rush Hour 2 (2001), Rush Hour 3 (2007), Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) and Tower Heist (2011). These may not be the greatest sequels in existence, but they aren't the worst either. Directing duties were also delegated differently. Instead of Rob Marshall or Gore Verbinski returning, Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg took charge of the production. This was probably the biggest gamble the studio had ever taken.<br/><br/>The reason for this being that Rønning and Sandberg had only made one other American made film, that being Bandidas (2006). And that movie was just okay, nothing that really stood out as a breakthrough film. They did however direct two other films, but it was in their homeland of Norway so there's a good chance no one outside of Norway knew about it. Here they did a good job, which is great considering how little experience they have. One other big issue that comes up from this story is how if the trident is broken, it breaks all curses. For one thing, this could undo a lot of other things already laid to rest in previous films. Also this can make the fantasy end of stories harder to tell in future narratives. Oh well. The actors all have their moment to shine though and it's all done in a way that doesn't feel forced. Johnny Depp's return as Jack Sparrow is always welcome as well as the rest of the original cast members from previous movies. Even the new actors like Thwaites, Socdelario and Bardem do a great job.<br/><br/>The action is also well done. The scale at which these sequences are set aren't as big in scope but this is okay. There are still plenty of visual spectacles to behold. The designs of Captain Salazar are unique in look and the same could be said for their pet sharks. Helping make these scenes look presentable was cinematographer Paul Cameron. Unfortunately he is no Dariusz Wolski from every other Pirates film before it, but Cameron does capture a lot of beautiful horizons. There's actually more shots of the sea than there is land in this entry. Cameron also shot for Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000), Deja Vu (2006) and Total Recall (2012). Lastly, the film score was not even composed by Hans Zimmer shockingly. To think he would pass up such an opportunity. However one of his students picked up the reigns and his name was Geoff Zanelli. Realizing that, the sound of the music itself very much sounds like Zimmer. The theme is still there too. Zanelli also scored The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power (2015).<br/><br/>While the crew who produced this film are no way close to the original people who made the first couple so great, they actually maintain a lot of that greatness. The story also recalls much of what made the originals so fun as well. There still may be some questionable areas but it is far less than the other sequels. The actors, music, action and visuals are all entertaining to watch."

","This is the faith of all movie franchises, that go on for longer than 2-3 movies, and it is really saddening to see how people hate on movies only because they are already so tired of seeing the same stuff. This movie is getting bad reviews and ratings for no reason whatsoever, people are just tired of seeing Pirates of the Caribbean(i am not).<br/><br/>You are going into yet another Pirates of the Caribbean film, yet you people expect deep plot twists and serious drama? This movie is supposed to be hilarious, extra-ordinary and simply impossibly fantastic in all of its aspects, it has been like this since the first release and people absolutely loved it. One might argue that Jack Sparrow was portrayed as ''dumb'' here and he was not as witty and clever as we know him, but in reality his performance was great, yes he was not the main man doing 100% of the work here, but still he was great and we should all appreciate him returning after all these years and blessing us with another movie.<br/><br/>Of course like always the special effects, the scenery and i can say the whole setup altogether was simply amazing as expected from a movie of this caliber!<br/><br/>Was great seeing all the old characters and remembering all the films again, if you are a fan of the franchise - watch it and you will enjoy it despite all the bad reviews and ratings!"
"shannonmacneish","10","1","2","28 September 2017"," fantastic!
","first of all, idk why all ya'll are hating on these movies, you already dang well know your a$$ is going to go see every single one that comes out because it's Pirates of the Caribbean, so shut your pie holes! * the first 3 were obviously amazing, and the 4th one...less amazing but still very good and entertaining. You can't expect it to be as good when you watched the first 3 installments with all the same beloved characters (keira,orlando, weird eyeball guy and friend) and then expect it to be as good when those characters aren't in it anymore (bc the actors chose to opt out). I feel like a lot of people aren't admitting that they didn't like it BC of this reason, and not the reason of a poor script ( bc it was not a poor script). *continuing to Dead men tell no Tales, i thought it was an excellent movie. I will admit Johnny Depp was a little out of it with his portrayal of Jack Sparrow this movie, but other characters made up for it, like Carina. She was an awesome and strong female lead, and it was also nice to see Will Turner's son in this movie as a main character as well. The movie did a fantastic job on the storyline, visual effects, cast, character's and tied it all together quite nicely. It also had humor in it (echoing pirates movies before it-nostalgia) that made for an overall fun and entertaining film. I would definitely go see a 6th installment if they decide to make one! and this time, hopefully they can talk keira knightly and Orlando Bloom to have bigger roles !"

"enectere","8","1","2","23 September 2017"," So glad Captain Jack Sparrow is back and excited for the next one!
","If you're looking for a Pirates of the Caribbean film filled with fantasy, pirates, action, adventure and fun, this is the movie for you. However, don't expect it to be on par with the first movie of the beloved franchise. <br/><br/>I found the storyline of the film easy to follow, unlike what many reviews have stated. Yes, it does take ideas from previous films (eg. undead enemies who can't walk on land), but the story still feels fresh. Some people complain that the storyline was incoherent. I disagree; it was easy to follow - they're all looking for the trident and Salazar wants revenge. It was an easier plot to follow than At World's End, which I had to watch a few times and later research to fully understand the various plot lines and character arcs.<br/><br/>The film seems to tread on fine line between witty, clever humour and stupid, not-so-funny jokes. For me, I enjoyed it and found it fun to watch.<br/><br/>However, there were some elements of the story that were unnecessary. Firstly, the wedding scene. I have no idea why they filmed something like that. It was just out of the blue, served no purpose to the plot, rather revolting to watch, and a scene you could just remove and the film would still be the same. Even Wikipedia doesn't bother mentioning it as part of the plot. Secondly, the British Navy. They are somewhat prominent at the start of the film but once Jack and his crew set sail, they're just killed off later.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is still my favourite character and I wouldn't want to watch a PotC film without him. However, in this film, I admit that he seems to lack some of his wit and cleverness, and appears drunker and, dare I say, a bit stupid. Even in On Stranger Tides he was still smart and could conjure up ways to overcome the enemy. Eg. I believe the original Jack would know the value of his compass and never give it up like he did in this one. It is possible that the writers of this film wanted Jack to look like he was past his 'prime' time and really had lost his luck. If that was the reason, I can accept that. Despite this, there are still moments where we get a glimpse of the original Jack and his wit, like when he's threatening to throw Henry overboard or when he's teaching Henry how to properly raise a sword.<br/><br/>Henry and Carina – I think they're great. I think Thwaites and Scodelario did a great job. In their defense, it is hard to make your character stand out when you've got such interesting and popular characters like Jack and Barbossa.<br/><br/>The enemy, Captain Salazar, was menacing. I think he was a better villain than Blackbeard (On Stranger Tides). It was probably the backstory between Salazar and Jack that allowed me to understand him a bit more, which I think is crucial; understanding a villain's motivations.<br/><br/>I like the action sequences, particularly the scene where they're rescuing Jack and Carina from execution, young Jack doing the boot leg turn to evade Salazar, and when Jack and Henry are trying to escape the sharks. Unfortunately, you don't get to see much impressive sword fighting like you do in the first three films. All you get is Salazar taking a couple of swipes with a sword whilst Jack blocks him.<br/><br/>I've read some ridiculous complaints about pacing – the pacing in this film was fine. Honestly, there are films out there with much worse pacing. (I watched some other film recently and the horrible pacing made it even more confusing than it already was – it kept switching between flashbacks and present time, large scale yet really short action scenes to long confessions of love, etc.)<br/><br/>I was quite impressed with the CGI and visual effects. Particularly of Salazar's dead crew and the shot of the sea separating apart. I really liked the sequence where Salazar is unleashing the sharks because I thought it looked quite realistic.<br/><br/>The music, as always, is magnificent. It's one of the main reasons why I love this franchise. This film has a different composer – Geoff Zanelli. People have mentioned that he is just reusing themes from previous films, which I affirm. However, since I love all of those themes anyway, I'm not complaining. You do get to hear some new themes from Zanelli. I think when you watch the film again you can hear those themes more clearly (since the first time you're still absorbing all the impressive CGI effects). My favorite theme is Salazar's theme (""El Matador Del Mar"") and the new action theme (""I've Come With the Butcher's Bill"").<br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe Dead Men Tell No Tales is a great movie. I don't think it's as bad as some people say, so I encourage you to watch it if you're looking for a movie of adventure and fun. Whilst it doesn't quite live up to the first three movies, it's still a few steps up from On Stranger Tides."
"koplliyh3","9","1","2","18 September 2017"," Great tale for those who can just to watch and enjoy
","Maybe most people won't agree with me, but I think that most people who give bad reviews probably just shouldn't watch those kind of movies at all, as they forgot that this is tale. And it's a great tale for those who have open minded and able to abstract from everything and just enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a great adventure full of bright colors and bright characters. Full of action and emotions."

"tlrg-legend","7","1","2","9 September 2017"," Decent one time watch,Have fun with the pirates and Johny Depp
","Once again we get Johnny Depp as the ever funny and intoxicated Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is hilariously outrageous. He is very good and funny within the film. Unlike his performance in Stranger Tides his acting a characterization of the titular captain seems to have great passion and not the feeling of a called in performance.<br/><br/>I was going to give a 10 simply due to opening scene but then movie started to slow a little bit.Also, unnecessarily, the stone lady on the head of the ship started to jump ship to ship and try to hunt Jack with a giant stone spear,in a sudden.Nonetheless, I will surely watch this movie again. Seeing Jack moving around is always worth watching the whole movie.<br/><br/>The film starts on a positive note. I had good hopes that it could go somewhere, but mid- way through the story starts to split up and it didn't really have a good rhythm to it. In addition I think there are a lot of characters that just don't do anything to the story or adds humor or dynamic."

","POTC 5, is not as bad as critics say. It has its good moments and its pretty bad.<br/><br/>there was a very amusing and quick first part. Jack has a few nice lines and meeting him after 6 years is refreshing. Still, he seems a little bored of his role, something that, I believe, it's a script's mistake.<br/><br/>gradually the plot is evolving, and there the downfall begins. the story seems too simple, kind of stupid. Too childish. There's a lack of dark atmosphere that existed in the previews movie (exception: 4). That kind of trident, was a destruction weapon for the plot. The moment they break the Trident, there's a collapse of everything that this franchise has built over the years. I mean, WHAT? the thing about Pirates is the connection with piracy, the British empire and abnormal phenomenons, like curses, magic and places forbidden. so, now all of this beautiful stuff is gone.<br/><br/>as for the characters, we get a ""weak"" jackie. the new girl seems boring and quite useless, except for being the guide to their journey. The kid Turner is not much of his father. there's no development on him and looks so...empty. Salazar had kind of perspective but still, he proved to be just angry and dull. Yes, a catchy accent doesn't make a villain.<br/><br/>I wont event comment the part where Bill Turnet meets his wife...that was ridiculous and too good to be true. I mean, we had prepared our selves about them! we were sure that they were not gonna meet ever again...Though the script has to be fulfilled with something...<br/><br/>So, compared to the first three movie this could get a 3/10. But indepentend to them gets a 6 for me. Because I am a fan, I choose the second option.<br/><br/>Its sad, that is crearly a very TIRED franchise. <br/><br/>I strongly believe, though, that it must not end like this. POTC need a last STRONG, huge, and epic movie."
"asifahsankhan","6","3","12","30 May 2017"," If this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given...
","As far as swashbuckling adventures on the high seas go, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales – what a mouthful – is running on stagnant tides. It's amazing to think a film series based off of an amusement park ride would get to its fifth entry in the first place, a much wilder notion being that that fifth time out of the gate may actually offer up something new and inventive. That isn't to be the case, though, and this latest outing featuring the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow, still played by Johnny Depp and all of his crazy mannerisms, offers nothing special beyond the typical excitement to which we've been privy many times before. Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to re-energise the Pirates franchise with fresh blood and a younger cast, but, without any creativity to back it up, it all ends up treading the same blockbuster waters.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that Depp, still channelling rock stars of old, appears bored underneath the captain's hat and pirate flair that make up the character's grungy exterior. His eyes bulge and dart around as previously seen, and he delivers on the same mannerisms that made the character so memorable in the first place (and also garnered Depp an Academy Award nomination back in 2004). There isn't enough new about the character this time around, though, and, save for a brief flashback that depicts how Captain Jack Sparrow initially made his name, it's a completely forgettable performance this time around.<br/><br/>I don't blame Depp for wearing out his welcome as Capt. Jack - would you turn down tens of millions up front, and even more on the back end, and probably a lifetime supply of do-rags, to return to the series? He doesn't write this stuff, which is almost exactly the same old stuff we've seen four times before. I didn't actively dislike the movie, but I rarely laughed at the jokes or felt the tingle of excitement during the action sequences. It felt more than ever like a rote exercise in Disney accounting, and the adding machine will continue to whirr and click and spit out receipts - the studio has already green-lit a sixth film. I'll see you right back here in a year or three.<br/><br/>But if this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given, especially when it comes to Depp's character and performance. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't a complete wash for the franchise, but it's a definite indicator this series needs to take a new, more exciting course if it is to carry on much longer."

","It's summer time. The weather is hot. I have a half day off and enough money on my gift card for one more moviePerfect time to hit the theater and the high seas to check out Johnny Depp's latest and (sniffle) last foray as Captain Jack Sparrow. I've been looking forward to this one and hoping against hope that Depp and crew end the franchise on a high note. I'll be the first to admit the Pirates franchise has been uneven in terms of quality. I maintain that Dead Man's Chest was just filler to get to At World's End, but maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Anywho, I won't keep you in suspense.<br/><br/>To the haters, no, it's not Mutiny on the Bounty. It's not supposed to be. So lighten up.<br/><br/>This movie is good. Real good. Good as in I sat through the whole thing with a big, ear to ear, stupid grin plastered on my face I was enjoying it so much. Yes! Bruckheimer et al. did right by the franchise and audience and ended things on a high note.<br/><br/>Depp's Jack Sparrow is as drunk, incorrigible, and outrageous as ever. Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar is a worthy, relentless adversary. Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa's continues to be the double dealing, opportunistic, untrustworthy scoundrel you can't help but adore. Newcomer Brenton Thwaites' Henry Turner proves a worthy successor to Orlando Bloom's Will Turner in look (he really looks like Bloom's kid) and demeanor. Kaya Scodelario's Carina falls a bit short for me (too much Scullyness that puts a damper on the fun), but isn't half bad. As for Paul McCartney's cameo, brilliant.<br/><br/>The story fits perfectly into the overall franchise and hits on all notes. There's plenty of over the top (borderline ridiculous, but that's half the fun) action and stunts. Tons of humor. Outstanding visual effects. Revealing backstory. And of course enough heart and sentiment to pull you in and keep you invested. Happily many of the recurring secondary characters are also featured and get a well- deserved final bow.<br/><br/>If you've enjoy the franchise and are looking for a fun romp, set sail for your local theater, plunk down yer doubloons and enjoy the final escapades of Captain Jack Sparrow and company. It's a solid 8. For you people that bolt as soon as the credits roll, I say once more, stay through the final credits. There's an additional scene after they run."

","This movie is definitely the best movie of all the movies that came up in the years 2015,2016 and 2017(so far). In this movie Geoffrey Rush was without doubt the best and Orlando Bloom the worst and I strongly believe that it is about time for Geoffrey Rush to take an Oscar for his Barbossa role. I don't think that Barbossa should have died in the end of the movie but Rush's performance was outstanding and I believe that a sixth movie that may come up should have Barbossa in it or at least Davy Jones. If it shall have Orlando Bloom only it is better for this film to be the last."

It is as entertaining as the previous installments in the franchise namely, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl(2003), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest(2006), Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End(2007) & Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides(2011). However, directors Joachim Ronning & Espen Sandberg don't bring anything new to the series. The movie has a similar plot as all the other films in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. It is highly entertaining though & there's not a minute of boredom. The visual effects are flawless. The action set pieces are marvelous with my favorite being, the one involving the house. The 3D is fantastic. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Johnny Depp is spectacular as always, in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp makes us laugh-out-loud & cheer for him, due to his antics. Javier Bardem is brilliant as Captain Salazar. I still liked him better, as the antagonist in Skyfall(2012). Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Captain Hector Barbossa. Brenton Thwaites is superb as Henry Turner. Kaya Scodelario is great as Carina Smyth. Kevin McNally is wonderful as Gibbs.

","Hater are gonna hate on this movie no matter what but I have been a loyal fan of this franchise, love some, like some. Wasn't sure about this one but of course went to the first showing so I would not hear anything negative. <br/><br/>I really loved it. Don't look for some epic life altering experience, these movies are what they are: a funny action movie with some awesome special affects and the love of my life Jack Sparrow !

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","5","3","14","25 May 2017"," C'mon people it's the 5th PIRATES movie relax and have some fun!
","To take a quick stroll down memory lane before the new film I decided to rewatch every Pirates film the last few nights, and I wanted to give a quick overview of what I think of the overall series before diving into the new Dead Men Tell No Tales. Overall the first film is the best overall package till this very day, it had the right tone for a summer blockbuster. It was dark, had a unique sense of mystery that old adventure movies had like Raiders of the Lost Ark. I personally love the second movie more than most people give it credit for, but the third movie was overlong and overstuffed I dread watching it for every marathon viewing I have. It's not a horrible movie, but it can get over the top for me. The story gets convoluted and the character work is absolutely terrible. The fourth movie tries to do it's own thing and it's fine. I personally prefer it more than the third, but it lacks the overall package the first and second movie have. The Pirates series know what they are, and that's something I realized before going into this new movie. They're silly, fun action movies. When I first heard about directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg and their vision for the 5th pirates movie I was genuinely surprised, they wanted to just do more than that. They wanted to bring back the tone that first movie had. The swashbuckling adventure with a dark element everyone raved about when Curse of the Black Pearl first hit theaters. Did they do that here? For the most part yes, there are a few things I wish they had worked on, but overall I would say yeah they did their homework and really nailed it. This was hands down the best Pirates movie since Curse of the Black Pearl! It's fun, the action's exciting, it's silly, and it's funny! Overall the movie is back to it's true summer blockbuster roots and I'm genuinely happy these two directors brought Pirates back to what it was all about. A simple story, guided by silly characters and explosive action. This movie is a thrill ride there is so much happening on screen once the action gets going. The character work could've been taken further if I had to give it a negative. There would've been something interesting if Jack was given the old hero at the end of his days type arc where he has to somehow become that hero again. I thought for a second they were going there, with him being more clumsy than usual and getting even friskier with his rum, to a point where he's willing to hand over his own compass as payment for another drink. They could've done something cool with it but he eventually gets his act together with no real purpose and I was bummed they didn't take an opportunity for that. The supporting cast is very good but suffers the same problems like I mentioned with Jack. However one thing I appreciated what this movie does is finally give some answers to the fans. Nobody really needs to know what happened to Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, what their fates are etc, but they tell you and I'm so glad they did. It feels like what Pirates 4 should've done as far as setting up an endgame for these characters and it made me want to see what happens next. Especially at the post credits scene so stick around at the credits! I was led under the impression this was the final film and I'm glad it's not because we can make a really awesome conclusion to send these characters off properly. I want to see how their story ends, and how the legacy comes to a close. That's what this movie is about, it's the legacy of these characters. It's coming full circle, and I want to see it go further in a bittersweet but satisfying ending. Dead Men Tell No Tales is that perfect blend of adventure and mystery you're nostalgic about from the first movie. The movie has such bad ratings all across the board but who are we kidding people this is the 5th pirates movie just have fun with it. The bottom line is if you're here to be blown away, or are looking for something intelligent about it don't. It's stupid, but they have fun with it and so did I. Try and enjoy it for what it is.."
"kostyachum","6","2","8","29 May 2017"," It's not terrible
","The most pleasant thing I can say about the movie - It's not terrible. It is very simple and straight, there are no suspense or plot twists. Though there are great visuals, really tired Johnny Depp and very good Javier Bardem, probably you have to watch the movie just because of him."
"brendennsousa","7","2","8","28 May 2017"," A Great Send-off or a Resurgence for the Series
","It seems people are either heralding this entry in the franchise as being on par with the first or the further decline of the series. I disagree with both. <br/><br/>""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is not quite as good as the original, but it trumps the other three sequels. It feels more coherent than ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World Ends"" and feels more necessary and less hastily slapped together than ""On Stranger Tides."" While ""OST"" felt out of character for the series this new entry almost pays homage to the original. It hits many of the same beats and borrows many plot features from that first movie. And despite (or maybe in light of) that fact this one reaches the heights of the first film. Well almost. <br/><br/>Another complaint I have heard is how stale the character of Jack Sparrow feels. Though to be honest this seems to have been a complaint since the second film. I would hazard that the character only really had a shelf life of one film. So I would think of him as a plot device at this point and I would also couple that with some good news. Every other character is enjoyable and returning supporting characters are in top form. I would not include Bloom or Knightley's characters in the latter however as they really were brought in to draw back fans. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem's character (Captain Salazar) was creepy and the real show piece of this movie. Such a good villain. From his performance to the character's design. It all worked. Definitely the part of this movie that you'll remember. <br/><br/>Really my only complaint is that it felt so similar to the first film. But one could say that for the Force Awakens when compared to the original Star Wars and that was a fantastic film. Perhaps the only other issue is how some of the plot points in this movie might feel pointless if this is in fact the final entry. <br/><br/>Is it as good as the first? No. Is it damn good? Certainly. I'll be looking forward to a 6th title."

"lotte_snuffie","5","2","9","7 June 2017"," As a number one fan, I was disappointed
","I'm a big Pirates of the Caribbean fan. Have been from day one and always will be. I was the type of girl who corrected people when they talked about Jack Sparrow to tell them it really is 'CAPTAIN' Jack Sparrow. I have a miniature statue of Captain Jack in my room and had three posters of the three first movies. So you guys will understand how much I was looking forward to seeing part 5 of POTC. <br/><br/>So I went to the theater, all excited to see my favorite pirates at work again. The beginning was fun and entertaining, as I'm used to with all the POTC movies. But as the movie went along, my enthusiasm shrunk like the contents of a bottle of rum. Captain Jack wasn't the same captain I know from the previous movies. He was trying to be witty, like the whole freakin' movie. Do not get me wrong, I like witty Jack (reference right there), but I also like the serious and cool Jack. The tough Jack, who fights for his friends, even though it seems like he fights solely for his own good. The Jack I know, wouldn't make a remark like he did in the final scenes of this movie (spoiler alert! Will and Elizabeth are back together at the end of the movie and they kiss and are happy. Jack makes a remark about how horrible of a sight that is. The Jack I know would just smile and then look at his crew and yell at them). Because Jack is the main reason I love the movies, you can see how disappointed I was in him not being the Jack that I loved so much in the previous movies. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie just didn't really give me the POTC feeling I got from the previous ones. It just didn't have that touch to it, the sparkle that made the last movies so good. Even 'On Stranger Tides', which I didn't really like either, still gave me more of a Pirates feeling than this movie did. Yes, some of the old characters are back, like Gibbs (who leaves Jack for a lack of gold, which seemed a bit weird to me) and Marty. Still that doesn't make it work for me either. It just misses something. <br/><br/>The camera work was great though, as well as the special effects. Javier Bardem is really good as the spooky pirate who, like many pirates out there, wants to have his revenge on Captain Jack Sparrow. The music was great as well, as we are used to from POTC. I also liked Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario as the new love couple, although they could never replace Keira and Orlando as the ultimate love couple. Of course Geoffrey Rush was great as ever as Captain Barbossa. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is pretty enjoyable, just not so much for hardcore Pirates of the Caribbean fans, who will feel a bit betrayed after the long wait of 6 years for a new movie. So, if there are any other huge POTC fans out there, don't get your hopes up."
"aateamtennis","9","2","9","29 May 2017"," There's more to Pirates than simply Jack Sparrow
","It stands to reason that any synopsis of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie would center around the main character in the franchise, Jack Sparrow. Unfortunately, I think that ship has sailed. People are tired of following Jack as he drunkenly stumbles into the right situation. The best part of Dead Men Tell No Tales is that the story focuses on the journey of the other 3 characters: Henry, Carina, and Captain Salazar, as Jack is more of a plot device to bring those stories together. The film has more heart than 3 & 4, with a storyline that's much easier to follow. I enjoyed it greatly. Especially the conclusion of the movie. And be sure to stay for the after credits scene. It looks like they're setting up Pirates 6! Great fun."

"RLTerry1","6","2","9","26 May 2017"," Shallow Story in a Campy Pirate Movie
","Of all the tales that the depths of the ocean contain, this one is quite shallow. Disney's latest installment in the swashbuckling franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales proves that neither changing directors, writers, nor the inclusion of an undead Javier Bardem, can bail enough water out of a sinking ship. No doubt the next chapter in the life and times of Jack Sparrow was one to be anticipated by fans, but sadly the writing was not strong or developed enough to carry the waning film series. This film reminds me of the Child's Play franchise. What??? That is likely what you're saying. But hear me out. After the first two Chucky films, the studio realized that the series was not working as a hard horror film, so the studio went the camp route and capitalized on the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations. Dead Men Tell No Tales contains many camp elements such as completely ludicrous antics and escapes that are even too much for a Mission Impossible movie. Although there is an attempt at some closure between characters at the end of the film, it plays out as forced and on-the-nose. Still, there are moments that will mildly tug at your heartstrings during the showdown, but it's not enough to add any dimension to this flat tale. One thing that this Pirates movie has going for it is the impressive visual effects. Both the editing and score are pretty outstanding, and certainly add to the experience of the film. However, if you watch the movie in 3D, as I did because there wasn't a 2D option at the earliest showing, some of the magic of the undead pirates will be lost due to noticeability of editing. Over all, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a great popcorn movie and a fun one to watch with friends or the family. Be sure to stay after the credits for a sneak peek at the next (and hopefully last) one.<br/><br/>Return to the swashbuckling world of the franchise inspired by the iconic Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disney Parks! Many years after the encounter with Davy Jones, Jack Sparrow (Depp) is being sought out by a young Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites)–yes, that Turner. After witnessing his entire ship's compliment slaughtered by ghost pirates led by Captain Salazar (Bardem), Turner is even more determined to find Captain Jack. Unbeknownst to Turner, Jack Sparrow's fortune is not what it used to be. With his luck turned sour, Sparrow is captured and Turner must free him if the ghost pirates are to be stopped and the curse of Davy Jones lifted. By sheer happenstance, Sparrow is sentenced to die alongside an accused witch named Carina (Kaya Scodelario). If that wasn't bad enough, Captain Barbosa (Rush) has been cornered by Salazar into leading him to Sparrow as well. Other than a need to find Jack, Turner, Salazar, and Carina all share a common interest in locating the trident of Poseidon. That trident is the key to unlocking the power of the ocean and breaking curses.<br/><br/>Like so many franchises that have come before, Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean appears to have suffered the same fate. Although this can't be said of every franchise, the area that fairly consistently fails to deliver is strong writing inclusive of plot and character development. Often times it seems that story is exchanged for merchandising, impressive visual effects, or pandering in longstanding franchises. After an outstanding opening sequence that instantly hooks you, the rest of the movie just plays out so paint-by-the-numbers that it becomes nearly predictable and lacks any real substance. Sometimes franchises fall into the trap of realizing that it can no longer take itself seriously and allows the camp factor to increase significantly. That is the one word that pretty much sums up this film: camp. Whether you are talking the perpetually drunk Jack Sparrow (yes, even more than usual), unbelievable escapes that defy all logic and past precedents set is previous films, or the supernatural playing off more as a joke than a serious plot device, there are many elements in this film that attempt to cover up poor writing by going for the flash in a pan approach.<br/><br/>One of the down sides to the recent Guardians of the Galaxy I found was the film only focusing on Acts I and III, leaving out the chunk of story development typically found in Act II. By the same token, Dead Men Tell No Tales spends most of the time in Act II, leaving Act I and again Act III to be rushed through. The common variable in both scenarios is a weak third act. To explain where I feel that this movie should have ended and the next one begin would give away a plot spoiler, so I won't mention it. However, there is a place in this film in which there is a great opportunity to end this story on a high note of anticipation of what is to come but it just rushes through the rest of the story. Had more time been spent on developing a solid story, then this Pirates movie would definitely have turned out much better. Sadly, it seems like more time was spent in post-production and scoring the film. Certainly, the talent behind the lead characters is excellent. Perhaps the writing is poor and the screenplay was weak, but with a lead cast of Depp, Rush, and Bardem, the movie is fun to watch. And sometimes that's all you want–a good popcorn movie.<br/><br/>If you ARE looking for a good popcorn movie to watch with your family or friends over the holiday weekend, then checkout Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. Perhaps the sequel to this film will be stronger and pick up where this one failed to deliver."
"kermitkid","8","1","3","30 March 2020"," More fun than expected
","This....was actually a lot better than I expected. Considering how awful ''At World's End"" was (although I did enjoy ""On Stranger Tides"") I went in with low expectations. I thought at best it would be mediocre. But they went in a different direction with this one. It feels more like a reboot of the franchise than an actual sequel. But yes, Johnny Depp is still doing the same schtick, and yes, it does wear thin. However the new characters played by Brendon Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario were interesting, and had some surprise connections to other characters that I will not spoil. Also, the villain played by Javier Bardem, he was cool for the first 20 minutes he was onscreen, but sadly, like Depp, he started to feel like a caricature that wore thin. Out of all the ""Pirates"" villains, he was definetely the weakest. And there's a flashback sequence with a young Jack Sparrow where it's very obvious that CGI was used on Johnny Depp and it just looks awful. They couldn't have just cast a young actor? The story is the best story of the sequels, and it feels like there was some effort put into it, and it was actually pretty fun. A lot of the dialougue was witty and I did laugh a few times. Considering this is ""Pirates 5"" it was better than it had any right to be. Nothing will ever match the first one, because the first one was unique. It took something that shouldn't have worked, and not only did it make it work, it made it work well. That's something that will never be able to be repeated, and I agree, these films do need to stop. I think having different writers and directors helped this film. It made sense, wasn't too terribly long, and knew when it needed to give more, or give less. That's something that the other sequels haven't been able to accomplish. Is it worth paying full price? No, but it wouldn't hurt to go see it on a $5 Tuesday if you have that or waiting for a discount theater.

"justinpkelly","6","1","3","27 June 2017"," An improvement over the sequels, but not as good as the first
","I was INSANELY pumped for this movie. The first Pirates of the Caribbean film (the Curse of the Black pearl) is one of my top 20 favorite movies of all time. It is nearly a perfect film; its characters are fun and lively, the story is engaging and interesting, and the action setpieces work marvelously. Unfortunately, the sequels really did not even come close to reaching that level of filmmaking. They were overly convoluted with an overabundance of CGI and uninteresting, boring stories. They also got the character of Jack Sparrow wrong. They weren't awful movies, but they were certainly not good either. <br/><br/>The trailers and what I had heard about the production of this film had me hyped. It was clear from both of those that they were going for the look and feel of the first film. The fact that they had cast Javier Bardem as the villain also greatly intrigued me. Unfortunately, this film is not as good as the Curse of the Black Pearl. I did enjoy watching the film, however, and I think it improved many of the bad elements of the sequels.<br/><br/>Firstly, the character of Jack Sparrow is improved here. He's not as fantastic as he was in the first film, but he is not just a bumbling idiot who ""accidentally"" succeeds like he did in the last three movies. He has moments like that, which was disappointing, but there were a few that made him look like the Sparrow of old, who was badass, clever, and occasionally silly in a lovable way. If they do decide to make a sequel to this, they really need to focus on improving him even further.<br/><br/>The side characters were actually quite good in this film. In ""On Stranger Tides,"" some of the characters felt like an afterthought, like the writers knew that they needed side characters and wrote them in two seconds. The side characters here were really awesome. Henry and Carina were fantastic new characters and I actually really cared about both of them. Barbossa was also a major bright spot. Salazar, played by Bardem, was a cool villain with very clear motivations and I enjoyed his presence.<br/><br/>The action was really fun as well. There was definitely a lot more practicality in the setpieces than there was in the sequels. I would have liked the action to have had more emotional weight to them, though, and I felt that the only time where that was the case was in the last half hour. There was nothing insanely remarkable about the action and it was not quite as good as it was in the first movie, but I still enjoyed it. <br/><br/>The special effects have always been a staple of this franchise, and I would say that this film has the best. The ship-to-ship battles looked phenomenal and the CG for Salazar's pirate army also looked a lot better than I thought it would. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, however, this movie is a gigantic mess. There are far too many subplots and the film felt extremely bloated. The last 30 minutes were absolutely phenomenal, but the rest of the movie dragged along without anything really happening. I loved Carina being Barbossa's daughter and thought that his death was actually really emotional, but I wanted even more of that. The way they searched for the Trident of Poseidon was also ridiculously convoluted to the point where I honestly do not even fully understand it. A lot of things are left unexplained as well; for example, The Devil's Triangle was never explained and I guess that we were supposed to accept the fact that it just curses people. <br/><br/>The humor also did not fully work for me. The first film was clever and was extremely funny, and this movie has moments like that. But there were a lot of jokes that really did not land for me.<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed by Dead Men Tell no Tales; it should have been slimmed down and simplified. The last half hour, like I said, was absolutely awesome. I just wish the whole movie could have been like that.<br/><br/>5.5/10 Grade: C+"
"theandrewahern","5","1","3","27 June 2017"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) Movie Review
","For a series so keen on featuring hordes of pirates eternally seeking the means to free themselves of their curses and troubles, the fifth installment in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales', can't seem to break the curse that has plagued the last few entries in this franchise. While it is an improvement over the previous entry in the series - ''On Stranger Tides', Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg's 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' simply can't compare to the first three films- especially not the original, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', even though the original film supposedly served as inspiration for the plot and story of the latest entry. Even Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow couldn't save this sinking ship.<br/><br/>In fact, one of the biggest issues with this film revolves around Depp's portrayal of the drunken captain. Throughout the first three films in the series, Captain Jack Sparrow is shown to be an extremely clever individual. While it's true that Jack often found himself in unfavorable situations, there was almost always a reason for his being there - and it was usually by his own doing. Jack Sparrow always had a plan, and was even referred to as ""the best pirate I've ever seen"" by British sailors. In the most recent two entries in the 'Pirates' franchise, however, Jack is depicted primarily an unprepared drunk who just happens to get extremely lucky when the stakes are most high. The truth is that Captain Jack Sparrow is better off as something of a side-character - what he was in the original film.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, returning pirates and newcomers alike did well enough in their roles, although Brenton Thwaites' Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario's Carina Smyth didn't have the same pull as the young lovers that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly had in the original trilogy. Javier Bardem's villainous undead Captain Salazar too did fine in his role, but didn't seem truly terrifying. Similar to how, in the previous installment, Ian McShane's Blackbeard fell short of feeling like ""the pirate that all pirates fear"", as he was supposed to, Bardem's Salazar didn't seem scary or threatening enough to warrant being referred to as Jack Sparrow's ""greatest fear"".<br/><br/>In addition, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' introduced many plot points and details that are inconsistent with revelations made in the previous films. While the casual moviegoer probably won't notice any of them, for die-hard Disney and Pirates fans, the inconsistencies are painfully obvious – and that's a shame. With a series as successful and fantastical as 'Pirates of the Caribbean', one would think that the integrity of the lore set up in the previous films would be protected and valued.<br/><br/>On the brighter side of things, however, the cinematography, done by Paul Cameron, and the CGI in the film looked wonderful. This is certainly the best-looking film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. The colors are vibrant and the production design is creative and unique, and offers plenty of cool things to look at and ogle after. Even the musical score in the film, now done by Geoff Zanelli and not Hans Zimmer - as in previous installments - was done well. The score adds to the weight of the emotional moments and successfully amplifies the fun and sense of adventure throughout the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is not a terrible movie. While it certainly doesn't reach the height of the original film, and contains plenty of things to complain about, it is without a doubt fun. People heading to the theaters with the hopes of seeing plenty of cool visuals and laughing at silly jokes will not be disappointed. The same probably can't be said for the hardcore 'Pirates' fans looking for a well-developed story, however. Hopefully this isn't the last film in the franchise – it still has the potential to be something great and end on a high note.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is a fun adventure movie with plenty of pretty visuals but lacks the character, charisma, and integrity that made the original film so special. While not a complete waste of time, it's certainly not the treasure we were all hoping for."

","I must say after stranger tides I wasn't expecting much of this movie but since I liked the first 3 movies I thought it wasn't a bad idea to watch this one. And I must say I was quite surprised, the movie was actually pretty good it felt much like POTC 1 was which I loved. Especially the ending of this movie was really good to me. The only thing I didn't like was that Jack was mostly drunk during the film and therefore he didn't fully feel the same as the smart jack in the first 3 movies. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie and in the case of a POTC 6, I would definitely go back to the cinema to watch it.<br/><br/>EDIT: I've given it a bit more thought and watched it for a second time and now feel a little bit different about the movie. I still love the ending, but I just really hate jack in this movie, he's just stupid, all his smart planning is gone. It's just luck that get's him true.

Geoffrey rush and Kevin mcnelly are great as a original cast which appears in every single pirates movie and still doing there job amazingly done.and then there is Johnny Depp. Character that every one has been waiting for. With some impossible stunts yet funny.(unlike Bollywood and Tollywood movies) screenplay is just great as acting and direction. Overall it can save the franchise."

","The original Pirates movie will always be the best because it was new and unexpected. I thought 2,3 and 4 were OK. Passable movies. But this one felt more like the original. First, it had a plot...always a good place to start. There was action, humor and enough violence to keep the males awake. It did a good job of wrapping up the series. To be sure, another movie at this point would be a HUGE mistake. Time to call it a good run and put it to bed. I don't know why it has gotten the bad press, and the current 29% tomato meter is much too low IMO. Just go see it and enjoy!"

","Nothing wrong with this latest film in the PotC franchise. Johnny will always be a delight to watch as Captain Jack Sparrow, it will never get old in my opinion. & Brenton Thwaites is a thoroughly engaging up & coming actor, & not to leave out Kaya Scodelario who put in a fine performance as his genius love interest. Of course we got to see Geoffrey Rush again as the insane scurvy dog, Captain Barbossa. & this time around we got the eerie & creepily fun performance of the big bad Javier Bardem. & last, but not least, we get some fine cameos from a few characters that I really appreciated."
"orfeasana","6","1","3","20 June 2017"," An improvement over 4, but still, not really good.
","I had relatively high expectations for this one, since I love the original trilogy (but hate ""On Stranger Tides""). The trailers looked interesting, but after all it's just an ""OK"" movie for me.<br/><br/>First the positives: This, like all the other Pirates movies, is a real fun popcorn movie and summer blockbuster. Most of the CGI was pretty great, so was most of the action,the cinematography was at points beautiful, there were many interesting ideas and the acting was fine, with the stand-out being, once again,Geoffrey Rush as Hector Barbossa and, of course,Javier Bardem as Salazar. The soundtrack is once again great.<br/><br/>For the negatives: This movie doesn't really bring much new to the table. It has the same plot as the previous ones and the character of Jack Sparrow is getting old.<br/><br/>The movie is also full of awful exposition and jokes that at first are kind of funny, but the movie keeps repeating them and they become really exhausting and unfunny. Plus,the character of Carina was extremely annoying. The overall script isn't that good either.<br/><br/>If you just want a fun blockbuster to spend 2 hours on, you will love this one. But if you are a more demanding viewer, you might hate this. I was kind of disappointed.<br/><br/>Personally, I just want an R-rated prequel about young Jack and Barbossa."

","One of the highly anticipated releases of the year has fallen flat on its face. It tries to be a fan-service, but rather than feeling like a satisfying ending, it rather feels like a rehash of a tired old formula. A lot of its plot elements have been borrowed by previous entries in the franchise. The two mismatched lovers going on an adventure with the drunkard pirate. The story starts with a boy searching for the ship of his father (the flying Dutchman), he encounters his father (Orlanda Bloom reprises his role as Will Turner) and is instructed to return home. Fast forward a few years and the boy has grown into Brenton Thwaites. Henry Turner, son of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan, is an uninspiring bore of a character and is portrayed more wooden than the black pearl's floorboards and gives Sofia Coppolla a run for her money. The uninspired dullard somehow has studied all the fisherman's tales and addresses the captain directly, an evidently treacherous act. He lands on the Isalnd where an evidently bored Johnny Depp reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. The character is not essential to the plot and serves as an irritation this time around. He robs a bank and sleeps with the governor's wife in true Jerry Bruckheimer style. An interesting chase ensues that leads our young Turner to cross paths with Jack Sparrow and a lady named Miss Smyth. Miss Smyth is a woman ahead of her time and is deemed to be a witch, the character is related to a another character of the series.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, the terrible threesome share most of the scenes. Geoffrey Rush returns as Captain Barbossa and gives an excellent performance equalled only by the brilliant Javier Bardem. Bardem and Rush are the only reasons to watch this film and when the two share the screen it is magical. Bardem stars as a Spanish Captain that seeks revenge on Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot as there is still a reason to watch this film and those two are the reason. Orlando Bloom also gives a good performance for the two scenes that he has been given and Kiera Knightly does not speak any words. Despite this, they easily overshadow the two wooden and chemistry less couple that we have the misfortune of being introduced to. Another reason to watch this is for the few seconds that Sir Paul Mccartney does a scene stealing cameo.<br/><br/>All in all, the main characters are boring, lifeless and wooden. It is their co-stars that make the film worthwhile. I would have loved to have seen the film focus on Rush, Bardem and Mccartney."

","We waited a long time to see this sequel and weren't disappointed. Fortunately we overlooked all the negative reviews because we certainly would've missed some good laughs, thrills, and, overall, excellent entertainment. I'm not sure what all the critics were expecting but doubt that the movie could've been much more than it was. It was great to see some old characters returning - there were a couple of favorites, conspicuous by their absence - but this didn't detract from the story line. Go see it - you'll enjoy it."

","After watching ""On Stranger Tides"" I felt that the film series was quite finished. The trailer made me believe the movie to be boring and it didn't give me the same feeling the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies did. Critics was poor at a start and many of my personal friends said they were disappointed, hence I didn't expect much when I went to the cinema. <br/><br/>But after watching the movie I felt very surprised. Casting, effects, and story line are terrific, however I do feel some of the scenes were a bit too long, and could be shortened down a bit without affecting the story. But in general the film is good and very entertaining.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting I'd say that Johnny Depp did a good performance of his character like he always does, there is more of a lack in the writing than in his acting. The original cast and characters did a solid performance. Brenton Thwaites portrays Henry Turner, the son of William Turner brilliantly. <br/><br/>In the movie we look back at Jack Sparrow's younger self and this helps tie the entire franchise together very well. <br/><br/>The special and visual effects in this movie were brilliant, no doubt. <br/><br/>Was this an ingenious movie? No. Was it entertaining and worth my time? Yes, indeed. If you are disappointed in On Stranger Tides, I do recommend watching this one to get the Pirates of The Caribbean feeling back."

Also, in this film, we learn the origins of Jack Sparrow's name, very interesting, as Jack would say.<br/><br/>Anyone who has not seen the first four films will certainly be lost if this is the first one you see.

","Captain Jack Sparrow with the help of some new companions tries to end all curses while being pursued by an undead Spanish sea captain who wants revenge. <br/><br/>Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg offer an enjoyable Pirates adventure which almost briefly reunites the original cast including Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. With impressive, locations sets and setups packed with effects and stunts, it's a more than satisfying instalment. Granted it loses some wind in its sails in the latter half but it holds enough water to remain charming and well staged throughout. <br/><br/>With quality props, makeup and costumes the cast are on sea worthy form. There's a wave of returning crew members of the series. The new cast additions are likable, Kaya Scodelario as strong female Smyth is refreshing and Brenton Thwaites captures Turner's spirit. David Wenham is his usual reliable self and Paul McCartney cameos humorously as Jack's uncle. Sadly, with a great backstory (where we see a de-age Johnny Depp), as good as Javier Bardem is as the menacing Captain Salazar he's not actually given much to do. <br/><br/>Depp thankfully holds screen presence as usual as Sparrow and it's nice to see Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann incorporated at arms length into the secondary plot. Geoffrey Rush deservedly steals the show as Captain Hector Barbossa offering some weight to the fantastical on screen antics that are accompanied by a swashbuckling score. <br/><br/>Writer Jeff Nathanson offers a few little twists and turns here and there and the comedy mostly hits the mark. If only Barbossa had popped up at the end and returned Jacks hat!<br/><br/>Overall, a shipshape return to form with a strong revival feeling that heightens this instalment and points to more promising things to come."
"lesleyharris30","8","1","3","14 June 2017"," A Delightful Addition to the Beloved Franchise,
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, or, Salazars Revenge, as it is called in some places, is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is honestly my favourite Pirates film since Curse of the Black Pearl, it combines a lot of the elements that made that movie good and took away a lot more serious, melodramatic plot lines that made the likes of Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End a lot weaker. It is simply very fun, it never takes itself too seriously, it does not diverge on any grittier plot details, it is a good time at the movies. <br/><br/>I was very underwhelmed by Will Turner's contribution to this movie, Orlando Bloom promoted the movie and advertised in a way that he was making a return to the franchise. However, he is only there for two key scenes, and it felt more like fan service, rather than him gladly stepping back in this role. <br/><br/>The cast is certainly what makes this franchise, and it is as good as ever here. Johnny Depp is still in excellent form as Jack Sparrow, having fun and not looking like he is having any trouble stepping in to this role, and as long as he keeps returning to these movies, I am happy to see them. I was also glad to see Geoffrey Rush, as good as ever as Barbossa, and Javier Bardem shines in a role he is very use to by now, the main antagonist. He is intimidating and has an amazing presence as Salazar that make him thrilling every moment he is on screen. <br/><br/>It is great fun from from start to finish. Exciting, and quite often hilarious, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is worth the watch for anyone looking for a fun adventure or action film. <br/><br/>Salazar, a resurrected sea captain, searches for Captain Jack Sparrow, and his crew, as pay back for what he did to him. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp"
"mm-39","7","1","3","13 June 2017"," Better than I thought!
","Dead Men tell no tales aka Pirates of the Caribbean is better than I thought, but I had low expectations. What worked: The beginning with the over the top bank heist. The vault going through the town. The mystery and magic with the boy, and the attractive women all needing to find Captain Sparrow. Strong acting by the main characters Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp etc. All the main antagonist characters' story-lines collide with wanting revenge with Captain Jack Sparrow. The antagonists' anger creates humor and interest about the flawed character Jack Sparrow. What did not work: The formulated all work together story-line which is getting old. The conclusion ends with the usually C G I special effects which is redundant and predictable. Not the movie of the summer but better than I thought! Entertaining. 7 stars out of ten."

","I believe the two new leads, male and female, have a great chemistry together and breathe some new life into the movie franchise. The show starts off with some more forced humor that I didn't find funny, but as the show went on the humor improved a great deal. By the end of the show I found that I was entertained throughout, satisfied with the time I spent watching, and I came away believing they could create one final great movie to end the franchise with a bang. I liked the movie a lot and only took one point away for the parts in the beginning that I didn't find funny (but were intended as humor). There were exciting moments, funny moments, a little romance, a little sadness, and a lot of fun."

However, the story is not about them neither. <br/><br/>Consider the disappointment to the last one, I found this one is acceptable though there are many parts of the story does not make much sense. And since the last one, it seems that Jack Sparrow is not doing the main acting or we say not the actual leading character in the film. Rather someone attached to the story for a very unique and not so firm reason. Certainly, I would like to see more sea battle between the captains or legends. <br/><br/>Needless to say, the graphic design is marvelous.

"BadSausages","7","2","10","26 May 2017"," Thrills, Excitement, Good Acting, Lousy Script
","As is typical with franchises, each new installment is worse than the last.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of the franchise is the acting of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. The more they give them to do, the better the film. Unfortunately, as has been noted by other reviewers, they don't give them much to do in this film, despite that they are on screen a lot.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a good job. But, again, they are saddled with a lousy script.<br/><br/>One of the desirable qualities of a script, or any story, is that you don't know see what's coming. The element of surprise. Unfortunately, in this film, you can see everything coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>The ending obviously has been designed to lead into the next film. Like it or not, there's a major issue that must be resolved.<br/><br/>It seems that the only thing important to the studio is action. There's plenty of that. And, can't argue with success, that makes them money. That's what makes everyone in Hollywood money.<br/><br/>The entire franchise appears to be set in the late 18th century, with the latest film PotC 5 set approximately 20 years after PotC 4. By this time, no one was killing witches. So, I consider that aspect of the film to be a flaw. It really doesn't have any notable effect on the film, but it really doesn't have any good reason to be there. either."

Jack has changed a bit but still has the same mannerisms and personality like he had in the other movies he's just stepped it up and I like it! The bad guy *totally forgot his name* but no one else could play him! He was incredible and such a good pick for that role! You think during the entire movie that they will be done and won't make another one. Everything gets summed up. Jack gets the Pearl back, Will is back with Elizabeth and everything is right with the world. Stay after the credits though! It gave me goose bumps! They will have to make another one with the clip they play after the end of the movie! If you don't stay to watch it you will miss a big plot twist!"

","It can be said that there hasn't been a truly good Pirates of the Caribbean film since the first one, The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Dead Men Tell No Tales is probably the next good Pirates film, but much like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it probably owes many of its good elements from the first film of its franchise.<br/><br/>Indeed, in this fifth adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, both current and a surprisingly effective de-aged version) we once again return to the well of an undead sea crew and a captain with a personal grudge against Sparrow (played by Javier Bardem, but not quite as menacingly as Geoffrey Rush's first time as Barbossa).<br/><br/>Much like the first film, Jack Sparrow is found rather down on his luck, and he must be rescued from the executioner by a Turner (this time the grown son of Orlando Bloom's William Turner) and seek a mystical artifact which will solve everyone's problems.<br/><br/>Let's set one thing in stone: this is definitely not the worst film in the Pirates franchise.<br/><br/>There are many great aspects of this film, mainly stemming from the fact that this is more or less an adventure film with not too much emphasis put on the made-up rules of the mystical elements of the story.<br/><br/>While Depp's Jack Sparrow is still the main man of the film, his role is significantly curtailed with the elements of Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar's motivations and the budding romance of Turner and Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.<br/><br/>The problems with this film, however, stems from the fact that these two elements take too much of the film away from Depp. He tends to fade into the background while we learn about Salazar's backstory, which has a few cool Easter eggs, but not much substance, and the romance with Turner and Carina feels very, very forced.<br/><br/>All told, even some well-placed innuendo isn't enough to take away from the fact that while this film is a return to form, almost as satisfying when the credits roll (don't forget the tantalizing post- credit sequence) as the first film, but 14 years later, the Curse of the Black Pearl is still king, and this film does not displace it.<br/><br/>Still, this film will definitely leave you with enough of a smile on your face to make the price of admission worth it."

This is an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>I'd even say this installment just may be my favorite one of the franchise yet and here's why. The positives of this franchise, the huge spectacle, silly humor, and grand sense of adventure, also tended to be bogged down by its convoluted & confusing plots & mythology.<br/><br/>But by now that we've reached this movie, it feels like they've smoothed out all the old defects in the formula, so to speak, and the result is a streamlined pirates movie, retaining all the elements that worked in the old ones, while simplifying some of the excessive plot details that tended to bog down the old ones. So while this movie doesn't necessarily feel like something new, it does feels like we're getting the same formula from all the way back to the first movie but improved.<br/><br/>And I actually quite like that Jack Sparrow is a character who hasn't evolved one bit throughout this 14 year franchise. He's the exact same buffoon from the first movie. It's like he hasn't learned a single thing or changed at all in any of these movies. This may be the most brilliant thing about this franchise. That's why we can have this movie, so many years after the first one and still feel so much like nothing's changed, because the story really hasn't even tried to have him change as a person. And that's a good thing, because we can like his character as he has always been."

The only downside is not seeing Will Turner and Elizabeth not having too much on screen. I was little hoping that Will will at least show up in the final scene.

","I am by no means a fan of the POTC franchise. I enjoyed the first one but didn't care a whole lot about the rest. After the trilogy they should have buried the franchise but instead returned with On Stranger Tides and now a new installment. Marketing for this was low, as it just came and went without making a wave or splash (hehe). I heard some really awful things about the film. I do agree that the franchise really needs to retire itself but at the same time the film isn't actually terrible. Its not very good, however a few things stand out.<br/><br/>The film follows the adventures of Jack Sparrow once again this time accompanied by the son of Will Turner and a potential love interest. A dead crew led by Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar are after Sparrow and are ruthless in their approach to get him. We once again get large scale nautical adventures with exactly what you would expect out of a Pirates film. The film doesn't tread any new ground. Its a case of, ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all.""<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow's whimsically drunken and eccentric nature is running its course. Its the same old for five films now. The film still does feel overlong, despite being the shortest in the franchise. There is some nice back and forth, especially from Kaya Scodelario's character but overall even the dialogue feels worn. The air of familiarity is present throughout. I must say though Javier Bardem is a stand out as Salazar. That man was born to play a villain.<br/><br/>The best aspects are when we see Salazar and his crew. The effects for re-creating the crew are actually quite spectacular and you notice this just from seeing the trailer. There are some stupidly enjoyable moments but they don't often come around. Still, I'd rather have seen this then check out the newest Transformers film (I am dreading seeing that horror show). Overall, nothing new in a tired series but special effects are top notch.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Dead Men Tell No Tales is a return to form for the franchise that has great action set pieces, some really funny jokes, and unlike On Stranger Tides, has a very fast pace that will never leave you bored. Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush can play these characters in their sleep by now and nail their characters again. Also the new comers all did a good job as well especially Javier Bardem who chews up every scene he's in with relish. In my opinion it was worth the price for admission. My only problem is that the pace could sometimes work against the movie because it can be so quick that if you miss a certain line you might not understand something later on. They are probably simple enough stuff that you can probably figure it out but they can slightly take you out of the movie if you do.

","Let me begin by saying that I might have been a pirate in a previous life. I love this franchise and there have been moments in all of the movies that have made my heart beat faster. Except this one. While many reviews talk to Jack's drunkenness, I feel that when the movie opens, this is a man on the skids. When he gets back to where Jack usually is Johnny Depp's performance doesn't change with his circumstances. His coolness, cleverness and charm are not in evidence. There were crude jokes sprinkled throughout the movie which was surprising and sometimes were carried on too long. There was too much time spent on a forced love interest. Destruction for destruction's sake and not enough time spent at sea as well as not enough good sword fights. The fight scenes may have been more realistic but that may not be what you want in a movie. I like to clearly see the swordplay. The music was not memorable. I think that the movie carried a dissonance that seemed explained by two people sharing the directing duties. By now, you are asking whether there was anything good about this movie. Javier Bardem and Geoffey Rush were excellent. The production design was excellent even if at times some environments were too busy. Costuming was amazing. This franchise should either go back to it's roots in a more lighthearted tone or be retired. It is a sign of trouble when these are the only things a piratical Johnny Depp fan can say about this movie."

But this is a Pirates of the Caribbean film! So you must join the crew, down the rum, and raise the damn flag!<br/><br/>As a Pirates of the Caribbean film, this has all you could love! Jack Sparrow. Witty dialogue. Campy scenes. And of course, the cringe worthy jokes. It may not be the first film, but is certainly no third. It's a mix of good and bad. But it's not exactly meh. <br/><br/>If you liked the others, you'll like this one. If not, then maybe this'll raise your sails to the franchise! <br/><br/>I personally was disappointed no Alestorm songs were used in the film (wasted opportunity) and I personally forgot the tongue in cheek style of the franchise. So of naturally I was put off course in the theater.<br/><br/>However, there's one scene, (not saying what it is because I want this to be spoiler free) that made me realize that despite it's flaws and tattered sails, people care for the characters this world has made. And that takes true film craftsman'ship'! <br/><br/>Overall, if you go in expecting a campy Pirates of the Caribbean film, you will NOT be disappointed. But if you expect something serious or cinematically fantastic, you'll be let down, but still be able to enjoy the film. And other than a few godawful jokes. This film is pretty good! And I would recommend it to a fan or someone interested in the franchise any day!<br/><br/>...sorry for all the pirate puns. I'm personally sad I didn't get to make a 'why is the rum gone?' joke but I hope you enjoyed and found this somewhat helpful anyway!"
"WritersCredence","6","1","4","18 June 2017"," Another Exciting Chapter for this Beloved Franchise!
","I grew up with PotC, so finding myself in another adventure with these beloved characters is just wonderful. There are mixed reviews on Dead Men Tell No Tales and I believe this movie is being underrated. So as a loyal fan, here's what I have to say:<br/><br/>Immediately, you are met by nostalgia as new characters (with links to original characters) come aboard. Henry and Carina are very strong characters that bring a lot of freshness to the series. Other great supporting characters make returns too, and not to mention Elizabeth and Will. Seeing them again was a sight for sore eyes! As for Capt Jack Sparrow, in this chapter he's at a very low point in his life and very depressed. He's grown to become extremely careless, and instead of masking with a darker demeanor, he's put on a severe joker mask. Jack does have a few moments of seriousness, but for the majority of the film he isn't himself. Nevertheless, by the end, Jack does transition back to his normal self as he retrieves back everything he lost including his confidence. There's been a lot of debate about the character's behavior as it took people by surprise, but I ended up enjoying it as this was a side of Jack we've never seen before. And the change makes sense as Jack has never been a predictable person.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes or minor plot changes from the original trilogy, which leaves me a little annoyed at the writers. But don't think too hard about it because we can't do anything about that. Either way, Salazar was a great villain in my opinion. I really liked him because he was quite dark. Dark and intimidating to a point where I don't think young kids should watch this movie. There are some really humorous adult jokes as well, but vague enough that it would fly over any child's head.<br/><br/>The comedic aspect was outstanding! It had me laughing and smiling throughout a great portion of the film. The action was creative and exciting, it was extremely entertaining for the entire run time. Even at the more emotional points of the movie, it was fantastic. And it all ran harmoniously with the soundtrack, the soundtrack was amazing!<br/><br/>Aside from the few flaws there were, I really liked this movie, I've seen it 3 times. The actors, the directors, it was put together very well. Dead Men Tell No Tales was a great film full of nonstop fun. I really enjoyed it and I hope other lovers of PotC do as well."
"doglueck","8","1","4","18 June 2017"," Didn't disappoint
","As quite a fan of the franchise, I got what I wanted from the film. It was funny, light and entertaining, with the cool pirate vibes. Some of the supernatural moments were pretty ridiculous, but I guess it was always part of the franchise as well. The only thing that bothered and I feel could've been done better was the ending (pre credits), with Turner Senior coming out of the sea at the perfect time and place (where was that even?), the two young ones waiting and Ms Swan coming out from the other side. Felt like they wanted to squeeze in a scene with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley for the old fans, but had no idea how to do it."
"ancarofl","7","1","4","16 June 2017"," Fun.
","The main point to take away from this review: it was FUN. <br/><br/>And possibly - for me - better than the last 2 movies or so - though admittedly it's been years since I've watched them - which is why the box office earnings seem surprising. It was somewhat easier to understand, in spite of still containing plenty of over-the-top fiction. I mean magic, curses etc are all nice and dandy but they somehow don't fit as well here as they would a film FOCUSED on magic, since there is no world-building, no real explanation of the made-up rules governing them, etc... they're just being served to us and we have to accept them. Personally I don't mind that greatly, though I understand why others might not: it leads to confusion, and even MORE difficulties in keeping up with the already convoluted plots. Either way, this installment was easier to wrap one's head around than some of the previous, at least in my opinion. <br/><br/>And, keeping in mind that this is what it is, a comedic family film, I believe it fulfills its purpose of entertaining, and it does not claim to be anything that it's not."
"malynnkiss","10","1","4","15 June 2017"," Dead Men Tell No Tales... as good as the 1st POTC movie!
","With so many movie critics giving this movie mediocre reviews, I just wanted to take a moment to tell any fans of the first 3 POTC movies out there reading this... don't miss ""Dead Men Tell NO Tales"" on the big screen! It's FANTASTIC! If you enjoyed the first 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies, then you'll enjoy Dead Men Tell No Tales. The 5th installment has several interesting, imaginative, and entertaining stories (including some interesting history on a couple characters), with the original cast, plus a few new characters that I did enjoy very much. The movie also has great CGI special effects I had not seen before in any other movie, and the action/stunt scenes, as always, were creative with jaw-dropping effect. The movie score, as always, sounds amazing in a theater. This movie also has a lot of heart to it, leaving me with that ""Please sir, may I have some more"" kind of feeling as the movie ended. :) I'm so glad I didn't listen to the critics. IMO this movie is epic, and as good as the first POTC movie. For me, when it comes to entertaining movies with good stories, good acting, and well-developed characters you care about, the POTC movies are right up there with other great imaginative worlds such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Jurassic Park movies. Tip for those going, at the end of the credits there is an extra scene, so wait for it and enjoy! :D"
"MissyH316","9","1","4","13 June 2017"," Captain Jack IS Back!! :-)
","Well, I'm so glad I avoided reading any reviews before seeing this movie so I could decide its merits (or failures) for myself, because I thoroughly ENJOYED it!! Heck, I was so enthralled that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen even to enjoy the refreshments I bought (most unusual-lol)!<br/><br/>Anyway, to me this was far superior to last film (""On Stranger Tides""). It has a better blend of the action, drama, comedy, eeriness, the supernatural, and interesting characters for which the POTC franchise became known. The story brings some things back around full circle with old and new faces alike, and it has a few small nods / in-jokes to earlier films that us hardcore fans in particular would appreciate.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I thought it was a dark, thrilling ride that I'm sure I will watch repeatedly and snatch up the DVD when it comes out. Welcome back, Captain Jack!! :-)"
"Pansarfluff","4","1","4","11 June 2017"," Visually appealing, that's it!
","I feel very generous for giving this movie 4/10 as the visual effects is the only good thing about it. The plot feels like the previous movies over again but watered down and the countless desperate attempts to make jokes are based on either sexism or strained stupidity. The few times the jokes are actually funny they are elongated or repeated to the point were they just get annoying.<br/><br/>Though, if one would cut this movie down to 15 minutes of sailing ships and naval battles it would be quite entertaining."
"tom-43722","6","1","4","10 June 2017"," Funny and touching but very flawed
","This film has a lot of problems but it still managed to make me shed a couple of tears. Let's get the problems out of the way first. The script was a mess. Some scenes were pointless, such as when Jack spoke to that pirate in prison as he was being dragged to the gallows, others were rushed or had no satisfactory build-up, such as when Barbosa realized Carina was his daughter and they stuffed all the build-up, aside from Carina mentioning that her father left her the diary and ruby, into that one scene, and overall the writers didn't seem to know how to make the story flow properly. Also I didn't like Salazar and right from his first line ""Death"" I knew he wasn't going to be as good as past Pirates of the Caribbean villains. Despite being an important character in the story, he left very little impact on me.<br/><br/>Carina could have been a great character - witch, scientist, astronomer - but unfortunately Kaya Scodelario wasn't the right actress to bring her to life. She wasn't bad and some of her banter with Jack Sparrow was pretty entertaining, especially in the scene where they were about to be executed, but she didn't stand out much. I did like it when she told Salazar's crew to ""piss off"" though. Scodelario got the feisty part of Carina's character down well but aside from that, there wasn't much to her. Henry Turner was a pretty dull character as he was basically just Will Turner all over again, having very little to distinguish him from his father. Also I've noticed that Brenton Thwaites isn't good at creating chemistry with the actresses he works with. This was also a problem in Maleficent where he showed no chemistry with Elle Fanning.<br/><br/>Okay now let's get to the great stuff. Johnny Depp never disappoints as the eccentric Jack Sparrow and just like the past Pirates of the Caribbean movies, his comedic timing and delivery provided a lot of humour. However, I am going to have to bring up the sloppy writing again because Jack would never give up his compass. I did like learning how he got his name though. Also I liked the scene when he threw his sword to Hector Barbosa while they were clinging on to the anchor. That part told me that despite their very turbulent relationship, Jack considered Barbosa to be his friend in a strange kind of way.<br/><br/>As great as Johnny was however, it was Geoffrey Rush who stole the show in this movie, conveying facets of Barbosa's character that we never saw in the other films. For one thing, this is the first time I can remember Barbosa showing fear. When Salazar's ship crushed the English ship and Barbosa ordered his crew to prepare for battle, there was something in his voice that told me Barbosa was actually frightened at that point. I was also touched when he called Carina ""Treasure"" and upset when he sacrificed his life for her. Barbosa had finally found someone worth dying for and I was sad to see him go but it was a beautiful and touching swansong which made me shed a tear as Jack, Carina and the others mourned his passing.<br/><br/>They also brought back Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley but their roles in this movie were only cameos and Kiera didn't even get a line. However, I'm actually fine with that. Will and Elizabeth's story was all but finished in At Worlds End so all they really needed was their happily ever after and that's exactly what they got. I shed my second tear during their reunion before laughing at Jack's disgusted reaction as he watched them through his telescope. That one scene lives up to the ""funny and touching"" part of my title perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole isn't great, despite Geoffrey Rush's brilliant performance, but it had enough going for it to make it enjoyable. It was carried by Geoffrey, Johnny and a healthy dose of nostalgia and unlike other movies that rely on nostalgia (such as The Force Awakens) it didn't betray or tarnish the legacy of the previous movies. Despite it's flaws, this was a decent film."

","This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen and wish I would have skipped! I actually disliked this movie so much, I created this IMDb profile to write a review! The plot is thin and the special effects are ongoing to no end. This creates a movie that never takes off. <br/><br/>The story fails to draw you in, unlike the previous movies were the humor is combined with a (relative) reasonable plot. I have the feeling the director noticed the lack of anything good in terms of plot and humor during production and tried to hide it. In that brave attempt to hide all of the terribleniss, what is Pirates 5, he used special effects to draw attention away from the lack of a depth or any natural humor. <br/><br/>I highly advise to skip this new movie if you have any good memories with the previous parts, it leaves a bad after tasted for the movies you once liked."

","6.5 of 10<br/><br/>Having a look at all five existing movies up to now, for me, the first one still stands out as the only ""true"" one in many ways - where the three proceeding ones decrease in quality from movie to movie.<br/><br/>""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" does not make any technical mistakes, improves to the 4th ""On Stranger Tides"" (I even forgot watching that one which obviously did not leave any impression) but also does not provide anything more than a standard Disney movie. On the positive side, we have: nice well-known beloved characters, animations, costumes, setting, coherent plot, jokes, ...<br/><br/>However, the whole movie I was asking myself if it can really tell me something new about these beloved characters and the ""bigger story"" behind it. They try but I did not buy it.<br/><br/>When a movie is getting too straightforward in the fifth sequel, too focused on Hollywood animation with fun, fire and blingbling - so to say tries too hard to artificially entertain - and does not take itself serious at any point up to the end, why should I as an observer do? Many scenes contain very unlikely behaviour of humans and material even for a fantasy movie which makes this movie feel more like a musical than a fantasy movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, the turn to a more epic story with a bit more complex leitmotiv than a children's tale will never happen with today's Jack Sparrow - sigh :\.<br/><br/>I recommend watching if you aware of what to expect from a ""nice-evening, don't know what to do, oh yeah Jack Sparrow"" perspective.<br/><br/>Watched in English."

"pokedom","2","1","4","2 June 2017"," Ten Times Better than I Expected!
","The Pirates films have had an odd history. Curse of the Black Pearl is clearly the best. Dead Man's Chest isn't too bad. At Worlds End is a confusing mess but it does have some good moments. And On Stranger Tides was such a trainwreck I'm still surprised it grossed over 1 billion dollars. Seriously, you cannot tell me the plot of On Stranger Tides without looking it up. So I went into this one cautiously optimistic. It could very well suck, but hey, it could be fun! The last 40 or so minutes of At Worlds End made up for some of the stupidness, maybe this could do the same. And... wait, there's no stupidness this time? Sweet!<br/><br/>This movie doesn't waste time with talking, useless subplots that go nowhere, weird pirate objects and old sailor's tales to tell the ""plot"" like in the previous two Pirates films. It cuts straight to the action and humor and holds on those two things for as long as possible without resorting to plot. There is some good plot and the movie does have the guts to kill someone off (who that is, well... DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES HEHEHEHEH), but thank GOD for making it so it isn't explained in 10 minute long sequences that go nowhere. In fact, there's so little actual discussion in the movie that it makes it the absolute shortest Pirates film! At just 2 hours and 6 minutes, it's MERCIFULLY short, even shorter than Curse of the Black Pearl!<br/><br/>Johnney Depp is as good as ever, and all the other cast is good as well. There isn't any Will Turner or anyone like that to derail the plot (well there's still Barbosa and Will's new son trying to break his father's curse), and the writing is still on point! Even with On Stranger Tides being a convoluted and stupid mess, there was still good lines and humor. Here, we get that and then some.<br/><br/>The new villain is surprisingly cool. Salazar (SLYTHERIN) has some good personality, backstory, and even a cool design. He's no Davy Jones, but to be fair Davy Jones is pretty ""eh"" villain material anyways.<br/><br/>I did have some problems. The mystical artifact the characters are trying to find this time around is Retcon-The Plot Device. It breaks every curse of the sea... except for the sequel curse it seems. It also, as the name implies, retcons the previous four movies out of existence. Not by saying they didn't happen, but by simply removing the curses that plagued those movies from existence. Like the Flying Dutchman and its crew are now regular people and such. Which is pretty stupid. That and some of the action seems... weak. There's a good scene where Jack is fighting off some zombie sharks (it's fiction!) and another where Jack is constantly about to be beheaded by a Guillotine, but at the same time when Jack actually fights Salazar, it's... kinda boring. When Salazar gets his hands on Retcon-The Plot Device, he just waves it around and Jack is thrown around with some admittedly decent effects. And... that's it. The side characters are the ones that end this conflict.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I enjoyed this one fine. For a Pirates of the Caribbean film, this was actually great! For a film that stands on its own... eh, not so much."
"valen060","7","1","4","1 June 2017"," Sluggish Story, But Slowly Picks Up the Pace
","Johnny Depp returns to the high seas as Captain Jack Sparrow in this fifth outing of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' titled Dead Men Tell No Tales. It was definitely a movie to watch and I have to admit that it felt pleasing to see a few familiar faces return for old time's sake and a few likable new faces thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>The plot centers around Captain Jack as he and his new companions Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina (Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario) venture out to search for the mystical Trident of Poseidon believing it would end the curse of Henry's father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). But an old nemesis named Captain Salazar seeks the trident as well and holds a long-standing vengeance against Jack.<br/><br/>For a running time of 129 minutes (the shortest of the previous movies), I have to say the story in this latest installment felt slightly more understandable and not as dreary or dismal as its 2011 predecessor On Stranger Tides. Javier Bardem's portrayal of the nefarious Salazar is a formidable foe, but when comparing him to other villains of the previous Pirates films, it feels too routine. Nevertheless, his menacing presence proves that he will resort to any cutthroat tactics to vanquish his enemies (much like Davy Jones).<br/><br/>The blending of CGI with practical effects flows seamlessly well and several comedic moments balances out the swashbuckling action that made the film series well-known. To avoid spoilers, there's more to the story once the closing credits finish rolling. It's nowhere close to the ranks as the 2003 original ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but it's a movie that definitely stands out on its own. Despite a few sluggish moments in some parts, it was tolerable enough to follow."

","Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew return for another adventure in the fifth installment of the POTC franchise. And while it was a good looking film all around, with great special effects and set pieces, the convoluted story holds it back from being truly great.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is the better half, featuring plenty of hilarious moments, scenes filled with action and comedic charm. Dialogue is entertaining and interesting while the story makes sense for a first time viewer in the franchise. However, more and more things have to be explained as the film goes on and it becomes very confusing. Certain fights and ideas added to the plot feel unnecessary and odd. Multiple characters are given screen time but then disappear for the entire movie. (A few in particular are tossed in at the end for closure that felt rushed and not expanded upon). So many characters are given their purpose for being there that it's difficult to keep up with everyone's motivation!<br/><br/>This film is a step above stranger tides, but a step below dead man's chest and black pearl. Still, see this movie and you will have a fun time! Just try to keep up with everything that's going on the best you can."

And I really like certain parts of this movie. The special effect are brilliant and the CGI is great. However the script is sadly lacking. It's not the actors are bad they just simply don't have anything to work with. I'm really not appreciating the direction they took Captain Jack Sparrow with constantly being flat-out drunk. It more feels like they were trying to wrap up a bunch of loose ends they left dangling 10 years ago and introducing a whole bunch of new possibilities at the same time. That's a tall order for any movie let alone one with a very short run time. To do such a thing would require a tight script tight pacing and everybody being on point. None of that really happened. Now the story is certainly more comprehensible than some of the previous installments. It lacks all the wit and charm that one expect."

Ship to ship boarding, check. Execution escape, check. Barbosa octuple-cross, check. It's all rehashed from previous films, but it's what this franchise is all about. There's a handful of funny/well-done scenes. There's a beautiful and quite creative island scene that makes the rock formations look like the stars and space, a short but memorable moment. This movie is very dark, as in pitch black, really irritating at points as some scenes would have benefited from that glorious Caribbean sunshine. Overall, similar concepts to the previous films with a couple of re-imagining of old ideas. Solid stuff if you like the other films. <br/><br/>Now for him. Jack Sparrow. Strange is the best description. Really poor in the first part of this film. Very hard to understand when mumbling and always seems to be on the annoying drunk side, rather than the funny. Has some funny moments in the middle section and some pretty pedestrian action scenes. The final part of the film is his worst. Depp just loses control. He's constantly screaming and completely helpless. It's awful. Sadly, the figurehead of the franchise was a shadow of his former self in this movie. <br/><br/>Pros: Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa - the man just does his job, good stuff. The new characters slotted in nicely The story is simple enough that everyone's motivations are clear Execution scene and Island scene. <br/><br/>Cons: Johnny Depp - carries on with the decline of his career. Javier Bardem - mumbles, says Sparrow unintelligibly, nonthreatening Too dark The stone lady. WTF. Terrible de-aging."

","A FAMILIAR STORYLINE DOES NOT STOP THIS NEW YO-HO WORTHY ADVENTURE MOVIE FEATURING AN UNDEAD JAVIER BARDEM! A Movie Review By: Jake Werling *may contain spoilers* Statistics: Releases Date: May 26th, 2017, Run Time: 2 h and 9 min, Genre: Adventure, Fantasy, Studio: Walt Disney pictures, Stars: Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario, Geoffrey Rush, and Kevin McNally, Directed by Joachim Rønning, Espen Sandberg, and Jerry Bruckheimer, Rated PG-13 for sequences of adventure violence and some suggestive content. <br/><br/>I bet we all know that in 2011, the new fourth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, On Stranger Tides was almost universally hounded by critics and fans alike. The story was too obvious, the action sequences were kind of noisy, and sort of mixed in some random missionary/mermaid love story. This new installment in the franchise finally gives us the rip-roaring pirate movie that we've waited six years for. To start off, the plot centers around a down on his luck Captain Jake Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's misfortune even leads his best friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally) to question whether this man should be the captain of him and the crew. When his old undead nemesis Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his undead crew escape the Devil's Triangle vowing to kill every pirate at sea including him, his luck just turns worse. However, after coming across the son of his old friend Will Turner, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and a young, but brilliant orphan astronomer Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), his luck suddenly changes. Together, they embark on a journey to find the Trident of Poseidon, a treasure that will give it's user control over all the oceans in the world. Along the way, they encounter the turned pirate Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Captain Salazar who wants revenge on Jack and is also looking for the Trident. The new story featuring a pirate killer and the son of Will Turner is a new improvement. A nice change of directors and an undead Javier Bardem also helps because WHO DOESN'T LIKE AN UNDEAD JAVIER BARDEM! Even though the story is new, the plot elements might be a little familiar with the opening scene being a little familiar to the opening scene in On Stranger Tides. That is my only criticism in fact. The new cast editions of Javier Bardem, Kaya Scodelario, and Brenton Thwaites was also a very good choice. This film also pays tribute to the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies. In other words, this is the best pirate movie since The Curse of the Black Pearl!"
"cruise01","6","1","4","30 May 2017"," Dead Man Tell No Tales is fun and all with visual set pieces but does feel like its on hallow waters.
","Dead Man Tell No Tales may not entirely be dead on the water as the series may be running its course after a pointless fourth installment. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales is a slight improvement over the last movie which focuses on new characters and a plot with emotionally driven characters that are on the search for the trident of Poseidon. Like how the first three Pirates movies were, when the story usually focused on Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth ( Keira Knightley) and Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was just the comic relief. Then, The Strangers Tide film had Jack as the center of the story and failed to carry the movie, also besides the fact Johnny Depp has been struggling to carry a movie and been a decent actor with his latest work. <br/><br/>Beware of spoilers, the plot follows Henry (Brenton Thwaites) the son of Will Turner, who is emotionally driven to break his fathers curse. The only way to break the curse is to find the trident of Poseidon. After encountering Salazar (Javier Bardem), who wants him to find Jack Sparrow. So he can get his revenge after his confrontation with Sparrow left him and his crew cursed as a ghostly undead on the ocean. Meanwhile, Jack has been causing a stir up with a poorly executed bank robbery which he runs into Carina (Kaya Scodelario) who is an astronomer and believes in science that is causing everyone around her believing she is studying witchcraft. Henry enlisting the help of Carina to locate the trident and Jacks help to navigate the sea. As Salazar is on their trail with his ghostly ship crew that will stop at nothing that gets in their way. <br/><br/>The positives about the fifth Pirates movie is I love the concept idea that Henry and Carina are both the focus point of the story this time. These characters are emotionally driven and are on the search for something. And Jack Sparrow is put on the comic relief sideline this time as he wrecks havoc wherever he goes. <br/><br/>The film does have some fun big action set pieces from the opening with Jack being dragged along with the building in a bank robbery to ship battles and impressive climax that has these characters walking on the oceans floor. The visual effects were awesome. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem was a fun addition as the villain, who is mostly cgi with his ghostly movement and face. Brenton Thwaites was better than expected. After his dull work on his last films like The Giver, God of Egypt, or The Signal. Kaya Scodelario was good playing an independent women that is driven by science and knowledge with astronomy. <br/><br/>Like most Pirates films that is set up with fun big visual set pieces and Jack Sparrows clumsy humor. The humor with the character is no longer entertaining or funny. The character appeal is running into a dead mans tale. Johnny Depp performance is becoming dull. But if you enjoyed his humor in every Pirates movie, than this film is no different. <br/><br/>Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man Tell No Tales is a fair film with exciting visual action sequences, some fun new characters. But the plot is running its course and along with Jack Sparrows repetitive slapstick humor that does not bring anything new to the table. On the high note, there is a post credit scene that is worth checking out teasing for the next film."

","Salazar's Revenge It wasn't the best PotC movie, but it was good. I smiled while watching it, just waiting to see Johnny back again! It had more action on the ships, that the last movie had, so a plus for that. It was good to see old faces again like Orlando and Keira, but i felt like it was hyping up for a final that never really happened. As i said earlier, it wasn't the best, but i don't understand how this movie is getting hated by many and not liked. IT WAS GOOD, maybe not a lot of new stuff, but HEY! It have always been light-sabers and hips in Star Wars, and their ""the force awakens"" movie was almost the same as the original, but still loved by many. <br/><br/>I just hope this is not the last movie. I feel like this is a type of movie that is charging up for a new movie. The second had an adventure being planned. The third had hints for the next movie on the map and so on. Just watch after the credits and you will understand what I'm talking about ;)"
"absolutvodkacitron","7","2","15","24 May 2017"," Great film that follows the formula
","If you have seen the other Pirate of Caribbean films, you know what to expect. This feels like one of those we have seen in the past and finds a firm place in the series.<br/><br/>I would say that it's on par with the last film (On Stranger Tides). But we now get to see ties with the old stories, what happened with Willian Turner? How did Jack get his nickname ""Sparrow""? Making this film seem more like a piece of a puzzle.<br/><br/>The plot is the same that we always have seen before, so you shouldn't be too disappointed that they didn't try anything ""new"". Jack gets in trouble, they are in need of getting a treasure and everyone wants to fix their ""daddy issues"".<br/><br/>The new additions to the cast fits in well. We get a new couple that's similar to William and Elizabeth. While we get Captain Salazar which suffers from a curse that he want to resolve, like Barbossa did in the past, with abilities that reminds us of Davey Jones. But the character lacks depth like Blackbeard did, if not more, but he still seems very threatening.<br/><br/>The film is full of comedy in the same style that we have seen before.<br/><br/>In other words, if you have enjoyed all of the Pirate of Caribbean films so far, you will enjoy this one as well. And if you didn't like the past film at all, or maybe just one of the better ones, you won't like this one either."

"joshfedderson","10","1","5","10 September 2017"," Aye there be pirates here, and remember, Dead Men Tell No Tales
","Out of all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, this fifth one ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is by far my favorite out of all of them. There is just something so piraty about the title Dead Men Tell No Tales, sure the rest had good pirate themed titles but this one just rings true out of all of them.<br/><br/>Reason's this is my favorite and I am big pirates fan. Is the story is good, I like how they go after the trident of Poseidon the one thing that can break all curses in the entire ocean. The characters were great, Captain Jack Sparrow returns as the classic awesome pirate played with golden talent by Johnny Depp. They bring Will and Elizabeth's son into the picture which I found really creative, it's like a whole new generation of pirates is being created. The Female lead, Carina Smyth is excellent and is played by Kaya Scodelario really well, I find her quite attractive in my opinion. Captain Hector Barbossa returns with his ""Don't mess with me I'm a pirate attitude"" he always brings. And a bonus that I love is they bring back Will and Elizabeth even though they are seen only for short times in the film. And the villain, Captain Salazar or ""The Butcher of the Sea"" as he is known, is by far one of the best pirate villains in the series, I believe he even out ranks Davy Jones, for one he is this bad attitude ghost filled with hate and revenge against Jack Sparrow, the CGI affects for him are amazing. And he is also the creepiest out of all the villains. I loved the villain in this one. <br/><br/>List of Villains Ranking 1. The Ghost Captain Salazar ""The Butcher of the Sea"" 2. Davy Jones 3.Captain Barbossa (In the First Film) 4. Captain Blackbeard 5. Lord Beckett (He was the worst, short wimpy man who thought he was tough)<br/><br/>A lot of people said this pirates was not good, but I say it was the best it had everything pirate you can think of in the book. Ghost, ships, rum, you name it. I would strongly recommend this pirates because it rocks all the others. But ye be warned, someone dies in this fifth installment of Pirates, I won't say who my fellow buccaneers you just have to watch it and find out. There is also a post credits scene which made me want another pirates then and there. Heads up me swabs there be a sixth pirates a coming. I loved this pirates my favorite by far. <br/><br/>10/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales! Arrrgh the dead be coming for ya!!"

","I've never really watched the Pirates of the Caribbean movies however I really enjoyed this movie, great special effects, great comedic moments as I've been told is in all the POTC movies great acting by Johnny Depp and Antonio Banderas (Salazar) great action sequences I watched this movie in 3D and I really enjoyed it great entertainment movie."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","10","1","5","12 August 2017"," 9/10 kinda deal but I'm rounding up
","Are you people crazy?!?! This movie is awesome. Hands down the best Pirates movie since the first one. This film has great action, flow, adventure and etc. I almost hope this is the final Pirates movie because this would be a great way to close out the series. Plus no one wants to see Davey Jones again; he was a lame villain the first time around. Speaking of villains, this movie has a great one who is no only menacing but is flushed out well with a great backstory to boot. The whole movie is great, even the newbies are good. The biggest mystery is way there is so much hate behind this film. Anyway, I can not wait to watch it again. I may even buy it on Blu-Ray."
"blazedounal","9","1","5","11 August 2017"," Movie from Johnny Depp alway is great
","I loved it! Yes, it is made for the family audiences but it really kept me going for two hours! It is an action filled adventure on the high seas from the times when Britannia ruled the waves. It has it all! Action, pirates, sailors, ghosts and what not, but it really is entertaining. I am a huge fan of Pirates of Caribbean franchise. I was desperately waiting for this 5th installment. I watched it in IMAX 3D. The movie is full of actions, adventures and there are a lot of surprises and you will not keep your eyes away even for a min. This franchise has some of the perfect special effect. I love this movie.<br/><br/>In first movie, 12-year old Henry Turner boards the Flying Dutchman to inform his father, Will Turner, that the mythical Trident of Poseidon is able to break his curse and free him from his ship, and of his intent to seek Jack Sparrow's help to find it.<br/><br/>Nine years later, Henry works on a British Royal Navy warship. While chasing a pirate ship, Henry realizes they are sailing into the Devil's Triangle. The captain dismisses his concerns and has Henry locked up for attempting mutiny. Upon entering the Triangle, they come across a shipwreck, and are attacked by Captain Salazar and his undead crew, who slaughter everyone on board except Henry. Salazar sees that Henry is searching for Jack Sparrow, spares his life and asks him to tell Jack Sparrow that death is coming his way.<br/><br/>In Saint Martin, a young woman named Carina Smyth has been sentenced to death for witchcraft because of her knowledge of astronomy and horology. Carina later meets Henry, who is awaiting execution for his actions aboard the ship, and says she knows of a way to find the Trident. Carina helps him escape, but is caught by the British Army.<br/><br/>Disheartened after losing his crew, Jack goes to a local tavern and gives away his compass to pay for his drink. By forsaking the compass, however, he unwittingly unleashes Salazar and his crew from the Devil's Triangle. Shortly after, Jack is caught by the British Army. As he and Carina are about to be executed, Henry helps them escape with help from Jack's crew, and together they sail away on Jack's ship, the Dying Gull. Carina reveals a map that will lead them to the Trident, and reluctantly decides to team up with Henry and Jack in order to achieve their goals. Barbossa meets with Salazar and offers to help find Jack in exchange for sparing his fleet. Salazar explains to Barbossa that he and his crew once sailed the seas hunting and killing pirates, and had nearly cleansed the seas of piracy before they ran into a young Jack Sparrow, who tricked them into sailing into the Devil's Triangle, where Salazar and his crew were cursed to remain undead.<br/><br/>When Salazar's ship finds the Dying Gull, Jack, Henry and Carina escape on a rowboat while the crew remains on board to cause a distraction. Salazar and his crew chase Jack, but upon arriving at a small island, Jack realizes Salazar's ghost crew can't step on land. Barbossa arrives at the island and allies with Jack, restoring the Black Pearl, which had been trapped in a bottle in Jack's possession, to its original size which is a huge pirate ship. With Jack's compass, which he obtained from the sea-witch Shansa, Barbossa takes command of the ship and lets Carina navigate them to the island. During the trip, Jack and Barbossa realize that Carina is Barbossa's long lost daughter. Barbossa tells Jack that he left her at an orphanage with his diary to make sure she lived a better life, never imagining that he would see her again.<br/><br/>The Pearl narrowly escapes a British Navy warship, which is destroyed by Salazar's ship. Jack and Salazar's crews clash. Meanwhile, Jack and Carina manage to activate the island's magic, which parts the ocean to reveal a hidden path along the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and possesses his body to pursue them. Jack and Carina locate the trident, but Salazar intervenes, fighting Jack and seizing the Trident. Henry, now free of Salazar, realizes that destroying the Trident will break all curses upon the sea and shatters it, returning Salazar and his crew to life. As the divided sea slowly caves in, the Pearl attempts to rescue Jack, Henry, Carina, and Barbossa, lowering the ship's anchor into the narrowing trench to pull them to safety, but—still intent on killing Jack—Salazar grabs the anchor as well. Carina notices a tattoo on Barbossa's arm, matching the cover of her diary, and realizes that he is her father. After proclaiming his love for her, Barbossa sacrifices himself to take down Salazar and his crew and save Carina and the others. Following Barbossa's death, Carina changes her last name to Barbossa.<br/><br/>Sometime later, Henry is joined by Carina, as they watch his father finally set foot on land again, no longer bound to the Flying Dutchman. As Henry and Carina kiss, Will is reunited with his wife Elizabeth. Watching from the deck of the Pearl, Jack sails away with his crew, opening up his mystical compass to reveal their next heading."

","Pirates of the Caribbean is sourly best movie of the world, the 5th POC made it and now no other movie can replace it. the movie of Faith and Furious 8 was also a great movie but not as much as POC (Pirates of the Caribbean) is, and the homecoming Spiderman also is not in the limit of POC, POC is now on the top of movies. but, the problem is this which Johny Depp is getting old and he may not be able to act as Capitan Jack Sparrow in any next movie of POC so this movie may not be able to create the Pirates of the Caribbean 6, and if they do, Pirates of the Caribbean movie is nothing without the Capitan Jack Sparrow, unless Williams make something like Jack Sparrow"

","Fifth part of the saga and that is at the height of the first 3. It caught me from the start, wonderful scenes and visually entertaining. It takes time to boot but I liked it a lot since it takes the time to present the plot and new characters. The cast's excellent performances, Johnny Depp does not disappoint, Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites amazing and Javier Bardem loved it. It's a movie that entertained me, made me laugh a lot, get excited and enjoy it. The 3D is very good (except for some scenes like the beginning it looked very dark). It's a fun movie and the fans of the series will enjoy it. The post-credits scene I loved and hopefully confirm one more delivery."
"ryanskywalker-87402","7","1","5","9 June 2017"," Treasure
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a prime example on how to resuscitate a franchise. I consider myself a Pirates fan, and I am happy to say this film is a worthy addition to the franchise. As soon as the movie started, all the shameful exposition made me think this would suck, but as the new characters are introduced, and the old ones etch their way in, the movie improves greatly. Dead Men Tell No Tales spends the necessary time in character development, and Kaya Scodelario makes the otherwise dull plot devices tolerable. She is the single best addition to the franchise and should be what the next movie should focus on to make it the best it can be. Her screen presence is completely magnetic and she steals every scene she is in.<br/><br/>The other new elements, like Captain CGI and Henry Turner, are solid, but nothing extraordinary. I really wish they had used more practical effects instead of a motion capture transparent army, but it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>The movie also has some GREAT set pieces, and I swear the guillotine sequence is one of the funniest I've seen in some time. Depp and his antics are perfect for set pieces so that really helped the movie, and the script was sharper than I thought it would be. That last death scene was also very good, and though the reveal seemed a little gratuitous, it didn't negatively affect the end product that much.<br/><br/>The score is mostly evocative of the previous movies, as it is expected, but it embraces that and does it well, unlike some other Disney movies. Geoff Zanelli also introduces some new themes that are good, but his spotting for the old Hans Zimmer themes is remarkable. The fleeting french horn motif he uses for the small Black Pearl was magnificent, expressive orchestration. I really hope he stays on for the next film.<br/><br/>Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is a good movie that is fun to watch, and that is all that really matters. Taking into account the non-existent source material (a theme park ride), Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg do a pretty good job at directing it, and Jeff Nathanson and Terry Rossio pulled a pretty passable script out of their asses, even though there are some pretty blatant continuity errors (compass origin story) that hopefully most fans will overlook. Combined with very sharp cinematography by Paul Cameron (Deja Vu, Collateral), and a good score by Geoff Zanelli, Pirates 5 ends up being a pretty good movie, setting the stage for a much better continuation."

","Johnny Depp is my favorite Hollywood actor! he do best acting! When he do some roll then he puts his all efforts! I am his big fan. Pirates of the Caribbean is my favorite series. Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't worry about building a trilogy of films (there is no cliffhanger) and takes the time to tell its own story on its own terms. The story is easy to follow (which is saying something for this series), the action isn't confusing, and the situations are often fun and funny. You can't say any of that about the previous sequel. Series newcomer Kaya Scodelario is a stand-out, and Javier Bardem does a fine job as the film's villain."

","I am so sick of lazy writing this one was suppose to take place before the others but they kill off a character who is in the other one's ! The black pearl is in a bottle but they take it out again not until the others. I swear they should be made to watch the others before they can write for it and take a written test. Starting with questions like who can not die in this one since they are alive in the other's. This was just a sequel for the money I heard Johnny Depp is as dumb as his character he plays and is going broke fast so he did this for the paycheck. It is almost as sad as Depp still thinking he is 21 and that young women want him or his so called ""band"" that he pays 100% of all the money it takes for them to tour and no one knows the name of any of his songs. If you like the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise don't watch this if this was the first one there would have been no sequels at all."

","The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best one, Dead Man's Chest is good, At World's End is rubbish, and On Stranger Tides is reasonable, I didn't know what to make about a fifth entry in the popular Pirates series. Basically young man Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) has been seeking to find the mythical Trident of Poseidon, it has the ability to break all sea curses, since age 12 he has wanted to break the curse of the Flying Dutchman and free his father, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Henry now works on a British Royal Navy warship which is sailing into the Devil's Triangle. Sailing into the Triangle, the crew come across a shipwreck, this comes to life and undead sailors board the ship, the ghost crew are led by Captain Salazar (Razzie nominated Javier Bardem), they kill everyone aboard, but Henry is spared when Salazar sees he has a wanted poster for pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Razzie nominated Johnny Depp). In Saint Martin, young woman Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario) is accused of witchcraft because of her knowledge of astronomy and horology, she is sentenced to death, she runs into Jack when he and his crew are attempting a bank robbery, they manage to evade the British Army, but the stolen safe is empty, Jack's crew abandons him for not delivering any loot. Carina next meets Henry, who is also sentenced to death for supposedly committing treachery, Carina tells Henry she knows a way to find the Trident, meanwhile Jack is down on his luck and wanting a drink, so he reluctantly trades his mystical compass, this causes the Devil's Triangle to crumble and allows Salazar and his crew to sail the seas freely. The British Army capture Jack and take him to the newly made guillotine for execution, while Carina faces death by hanging, with the help of Jack's crew, Henry helps them escape, they all set sail on Jack's ship, the Dying Gull. Carina reveals a map to take them to the Trident, to achieve their goals she decides to team up with Jack and Henry, Carina and Henry become closer as things go on. Salazar and his crew roam the seas and destroy many ships, including those in the fleet of Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Salazar and Barbossa make a deal that his crew will be spared for the capture of Jack. Salazar tells the story that he and his crew once sailed the seas to kill every pirate, they were undefeated, until young Jack Sparrow tricked them into sailing into the Devil's Triangle, there the crew died and were cursed to remain undead, Salazar seeks revenge, Jack handing over the mystical compass freed them from the Triangle and unleashed them onto the sea. When Salazar's crew find the Dying Gull, the crew remain on board to distract the ghost pirates, while Jack, Henry and Carina escape on a rowboat, Salazar and his crew chase them, they arrive upon a small island, they realise that the ghost pirates cannot step on land. Barbossa arrives at the island, he decides to help Jack, Barbossa breaks the Black Pearl out of the bottle is was placed, it returns to its original size, Barbossa has also recovered Jack's compass, he takes control of the ship and has Carina navigate them to the island. Both Jack and Barbossa come to realise that Carina is Barbossa's long lost daughter, Barbossa left her as a child with his diary at an orphanage to grow and have a better life, he never imagined he would see her again. A British Navy warship attacks, but this destroyed by Salazar's ship, Jack's crew battle the ghost pirate's men, during the fight they find an uncharted island that the Trident is located. Henry is captured by Salazar, Carina activates a path to the Trident, parting the sea water, the Trident is hidden on the ocean floor, Jack and Carina find it, but Henry is possessed by Salazr, to allow him to walk on land and seize the Trident, and he fights Jack. Salazar releases himself from Henry's body, Henry realises the only way to lift all curses upon the sea is to destroy the Trident, before Salazar can deliver a final blow Henry destroys the Trident, returning Salazar and his crew to the living. As the divided sea caves in, Barbossa helps Jack, Carisa and Henry as they are pulled up by the Black Pearl's anchor, Salazar grabs on and is still intent on killing Jack, while Carissa notices a tattoo on Barbossa's arm, matching an image on the cover of her father's diary, she realises their relation. Barbossa decides to sacrifice himself to save his daughter and the others, taking Salazar and his crew down with him, on the Black Pearl, Carisa declares her last name is not Smyth, but Barbossa, in the end Henry watch his father Will finally walk on land again, having been freed from the Flying Dutchman, Will is also finally reunited with Herny's mother Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), meanwhile Jack opens up his compass, he and his crew set sail to their next heading. After the credits, Will and Elzabeth are in bed together, a silhouette of Davy Jones enters the bedroom, Will wakes in terror and assumes this was a nightmare, but he does not notice there are barnacles on the floor. Also starring Kevin McNally as Gibbs, Stephen Graham as Scrum, Golshifteh Farahani as Shansa, David Wenham as Scarfield and Sir Paul McCartney as Uncle Jack. Depp remains just about enduring as his anti-hero pop icon inspired by Keith Richard, Bardem is reasonable being creepy as the villain, returning Rush gets to have an interesting subplot, and Thwaites and Scodelario do fine. The story is just like the others, a big pirate treasure hunt with lots of fight sequences, inventive set pieces and fantastic special effects, but it has many cliches, it feels a bit repetitive, there are a bit too many characters, and it can get almost boring, a slightly below average fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screen Combo for Depp & His Worn Out Drunk Routine. Okay!"
"ngocnu","7","1","6","30 May 2017"," The role of Jack is not too important
","I love this movie because in general, this is one of a few great movies in this summer. However, Jack did not play any important role in this movie. I watched the whole series again and recognized that Jack used to be a very special character who can not be removed in previous episodes. He used to be a wonderful leader, clever captain, and strange friend. However, this movie just needed him as a joke maker or even did not need him to make it complete. He was just a reason to have a story and that was all. Nevertheless, I think this movie is still attractive and worth watching."

His personality is also charming: seemingly careless, but sensitive inside, sometimes sly, but always follows the code of pirates which makes him a trustworthy man. <br/><br/>The second time watch the movie, I love it more when I understand it better. I also have to chance to pay more attention on details, such as costumes, medals worn by Salazar, and so on."
"taryllsbaker","8","1","6","29 May 2017"," ""A fun, visually incredible, swashbuckling adventure and worthy sequel.""
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge (originally & more fittingly; Dead Men Tell No Tales) is directed by Joachim Rønning & Espen Sandberg and stars Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario, Kevin McNally, David Wenham.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow searches for the trident of Poseidon. (12A cert; 129 mins)<br/><br/>It's been 14 years since we first met Jack Sparrow on the big-screen. Johnny Depp handed in a truly unique and intricate performance that earned him a nomination for Best Actor at The Academy. The first film was a genuine surprise for everyone, followed up graciously with two fantastically fun sequels shot back-to-back. 6 years ago, a stand-alone sequel (On Stranger Tides) was released, with it came a disappointing response. Jack Sparrow's solo outing was still mostly enjoyable, but the magic of the first three instalments was lost, largely due to the absence of the original cast. After years of waiting, we are able to return to the world of Pirates.<br/><br/>Does Rønning & Sandberg's Salazar's Revenge live up to the original? The answer: No. However, I felt the exact same feelings that I did with the first when watching this fresh instalment. It's fun, colourful, action-packed, visually incredible – clearly a very expensive production overall – and it features some particularly likable characters.<br/><br/>As soon as the screen opens we are introduced to Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), who seeks help from Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his father (Orlando Bloom) from a terrible curse. However, due to previous events in Jack's past, the ghostly Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) longs for bloody revenge and will not stop until Sparrow is no more.<br/><br/>There's no doubt about Depp's performance as the witty Captain Jack Sparrow being truly brilliant. Although it's clear that some of the charm we loved so much in the first few films has been degrading over time. It's no different in Salazar's Revenge, Depp looks to be enjoying every moment, but something feels 'off' in his delivery. Of course, he still manages to lift the film to extraordinary heights and he still performs wonderfully in some of the funniest scenes (the guillotine, anyone?) but you can't ignore the strange evolution of his lovable character.<br/><br/>Bashing heads with Depp is Javier Bardem who turns in a dark and scary performance as Salazar, quickly becoming one of my favourite Pirates villains. Watching his scenes unfold and seeing his enthusiasm for the role is a real treat. On the 'good side' is Thwaites & Scodelario, fighting the ghost army as they journey to their destination. Two genuine and pleasant performances, somehow filling the missing pieces that Will & Elizabeth leave behind. Some of the original crew of the Black Pearl return, including Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and Marty (Martin Klebba) proving to be a key part of the franchise and a terrible loss if underused. Here, they provide a comical back-and-forth between Jack, Carina and Henry and continue to make the audience chuckle. Finally, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is back and he's as great as ever. The character has seen some 'spotty' times but Rush's passion for Pirates is unbroken.<br/><br/>After four instalments featuring the music of Hans Zimmer (including The Curse of the Black Pearl which Zimmer overproduced), Geoff Zanelli takes the reins with a powerful and engaging original score. Not only does Zanelli revive several main themes throughout (and rightfully so, having worked with Zimmer on previous occasions), he writes with clear knowledge of the characters and produces an exciting and thrilling listening experience.<br/><br/>Although the story isn't the strongest and the many situations are somewhat unrealistic and exaggerated, it's still a heavily energetic production. Everything from the clean editing and glistening visual effects to the stunning make-up and beautiful Australian locations is simply amazing. Fans longing for something close to the original trilogy should have a lot of fun watching this film.<br/><br/>Verdict; Salazar's Revenge (Dead Men Tell No Tales) may not be as smart or as charming as the original, but it's pure swashbuckling entertainment for the fans. Familiar faces return as new faces are introduced, and Captain Jack Sparrow continues to command with a bottle of rum in hand.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge – ★★★★ (8/10)"

Prior the 21st century our greatest pirate phenomenon was considered to be the Treasure Island. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote an excellent novel which was based on the great pirates' life of that time period , but who could have predicted that the mouse-company would be inspired by this great 19th century writer? In that story , the main protagonist is a boy , who's life is influenced by the legacy of a great treasure. He sails off and the winds of luck sends a band of pirates into his route. Because of conflicted and shady intentions they team-up to reach the treasure.<br/><br/>So , turning back to the protagonists whose lives are influenced by a legacy. The key characters have always been the Turner-boys. Will turner owned a coin which was stolen from a cursed treasure. He had to realize that he was not just a smith , but was a pirate's son and he can't deny his roots. Last but not least he was driven buy love. He felt guilty , because Elizabeth Swann was taken by Barbossa instead of him , but eventually it turned out that not only gold and money can be a treasure , but a woman's heart. In the conclusion of their arc he gave his heart to Elizabeth , because Elizabeth did the same thing for him. Their love resulted in the birth of their son , the new protagonist of a new story , Henry Turner.<br/><br/>Henry inherited a cursed father. He declared his life to his father's redemption which eventually happens of course. Although I marked this review to have some spoilers , I don't want to talk about the story itself. I would like to let you know about the character's acts , the way they appear , and the conclusion of this great franchise.<br/><br/>Directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg put serious efforts into this film to hit a level of quality which the film's predecessor , On Stranger Tides wasn't able to hit. They wanted to summon the feeling of the first movie , and eventually , I think they succeeded. Putting Jack Sparrow into the sidekick role is a good thing. The Verbinski-trilogy saw that Jack Sparrow as a main protagonist would be too much for the audience , so they focused more on Will and Elizabeth's love and act. Johnny Depp was put into a supporting role whose task was to pull the strings of the other puppets. It can't be told about OST , which used Jack Sparrow as the only and main protagonist. Johhny Depp is a brilliant actor , and Jack Sparrow is the embodied Johnny Depp himself , honestly by now we can't separate Depp's personality from Sparrow , but it was too much of him for two or so hours. The new directors saw that they have to go back to the roots and they introduced us Kaya Scodelario's Karina Smyth (you can predict Smyth is not her real name) and Brendon Thwaites' Henry Turner who wanted to solve the curse of his father. These actors are both satisfying in their roles and they are totally likable and sensible. Among the other great actors there are two whose's performances stand out : Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush. Rush always nails it as Barbossa , I think I liked him the most in this film. Javier was a great choice for Salazar , his acting is good but can't hit Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. As for Johnny Depp it was his worst performance as Jack Sparrow. Its reason maybe is that it is the fifth time he has to play the same character , or maybe because there wasn't any character transformation for Sparrow in fourteen years His witty dialogues are gone , for most of the film he is drunk and instead of being funny , I couldn't feel more than pity towards Sparrow during the movie. I don't want to say I didn't like him this time. He is still a great character and will always be , but he could be even better this time.<br/><br/>All in all , I liked the film more than On Stranger Tides , it is much closer to the original trilogy. It is (presumably) a great conclusion to a great franchise , Pirates will be missed. Thank you for your attention! :)<br/><br/>+Barbossa +Salazar +Full circle , no cliffhangers +Tribute to the first movie +Great new actors<br/><br/>-Jack Sparrow -Overcrowded -There could be more Will Turner"
"iller1234","7","1","6","28 May 2017"," A mix of good and bad
","I thoroughly enjoyed all iterations of Pirates of the Caribbean. I have mixed feelings about this one, however. First thing's first - the plot.<br/><br/>The story is fairly complex, especially if you haven't watched any of the previous ones. The two famed pirates we know from before, Cpt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Cpt Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), find their paths intertwined with Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). They all come to seek the trident of Poseidon. Needless to say obtaining it is easier said than done. One of the factors stalling their progress is Captain Salazar, brilliantly interpreted by Javier Bardem. <br/><br/>The movie shifts from being an uncomfortable teenage romantic movie, to a bad sitcom and then to a fascinating fable with jaw-dropping special effects. The two former spoils the experience for me, the latter pulls me right back in. The typical Hollywood script of boy meets girl and girls body gets highlighted in various camera angles and talked about throughout the movie is there. Together with not-very-fun punchlines in almost every scene. The serious story and scenes of significance that Jack Sparrow and his ludicrous crew normally are supposed to bounce on are too few here. The ones that are there, though, are really intriguing. This is where Captain Salazar shines and reminds us of the magical, unforgiving and endless universe that is Pirates of the Caribbean. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole is still good, and if you're a fan of the previous ones - worth your time. <br/><br/>At the very least your top villain of all time list will get a little longer"
"asb_deutsch","6","1","6","28 May 2017"," It is an okay film, but nothing hugely spectacular except for the IMAX screen and hence easily forgettable!
","I watched Dead Men Tell No Tales in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!<br/><br/>I feel people like me went only to see Jack Sparrow and the awesome visuals. The movies is Depp's recovery and comeback movie as all of his films have become flops between Stranger Tides (2011) and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).<br/><br/>The story seems to be written as it goes along, so you lose track of what's going on and who's doing what and why we even care. The jokes have become all stale now.<br/><br/>The good news was at two hours and twenty minutes, this one being the shorter films in the series. The bad news is this aging franchise has long overstayed its welcome. There is a lot to like about this movie, but unfortunately it's all the stuff we've seen before.<br/><br/>My significant digit score: 6.3/10"
"DKosty123","7","1","6","27 May 2017"," A Better Tale With Less Sparrow, More Humor
","This one seems to have realized one thing that makes a good film, it has a better script than some of the previous sequels. It also has the largest cast as now we have several characters doing flashbacks and current characters. The story line is more complex characterizations, but the plot is easier to follow.<br/><br/>Now, with some Rum for sure, Jack Sparrow is indeed here in spirit. One thing different is Jack is used more as a punching bag as more often than not someone is trying to kill him. He even compliments the French until he finds out it might kill him.<br/><br/>The humor here is sharper than other episodes. There is no Davy Jones here which is okay as his make up in previous films sometimes makes me think of Ja Ja Bings, as far as the way their character was developed in the previous installments. I think that unlike Ja Ja Davy will return. Hopefully they will have better make up.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the development of a next generation to replace the old guard appears to be in progress here. Let's just say that the sons and daughters of a lot of the main characters from the first 3 films are now appearing here. The film is a lot of fun. Most of the humor is of the type that adults will find funny, while young kids might miss it entirely.<br/><br/>Sparrow does seem to get more humor lines here which is a throwback to the first film. I enjoyed the film, and while it is a notch below the first one, the return of the Black Pearl to the seas is a good endeavor with plenty of action to enjoy."
"harrytaylorphysics","6","1","6","27 May 2017"," Fun but Flawed
","Just to provide some background for the review--I would consider myself a casual fan of the POTC series. I've seen and generally enjoyed the previous installments, however I certainly would not consider myself a dedicated or avid follower of the series. <br/><br/>The 5th chapter of Captain Jack's adventures is certainly a fun and entertaining ride. I left the theater feeling satisfied that I went. While there are many things about the movie that didn't quite work, I feel as though the most important conclusion when reviewing a movie is to simply ask if it was enjoyable: and I believe that it is. <br/><br/>Starting with what I enjoyed about the movie: the action sequences are still lively as ever. The heart racing and (characteristically for the series) a bit ridiculous high intensity moments will provide some nostalgia as Jack swings to and fro as the theme song blares in the background. All of the silly but exhilarating action is there, and for the most part they do a good job of bridging the line between serious and comedic. Javier Bardem does a good acting job with an interesting, albeit limited villain. My favorite part of the film is that we get a Jack Sparrow ""Origin Story"" of sorts that explains how he came to achieve some of his initial fame and notoriety. And as always the special effects are stunning. I do feel as though they traded in realism in favor of showy tricks (I went back and watched the 1st film, and the setting of St Martin in this film is colorful and cartoonish compared to the realistic portrayal of Port Royal). <br/><br/>As for what I did not enjoy: Bloom and Knightly were clearly added to the movie as a cheap way to capitalize on nostalgia, and have virtually no screen time or purpose (Depp, Bloom, and Knightly never appear in a scene together). I was underwhelmed with the acting of our two new young pirate sidekicks, and felt as though their individual stories didn't quite work- -and of course they played the cliché role of star crossed lovers, because what's a Disney movie without a heartfelt kiss at the end? However, most disappointing was the quality of the comedy and the plot. Much of the comedy was cheap in every way: sexual innuendos and entendres, drunken slapstick, a hillbilly pirate wedding. Some of the early films had clever adult comedy, but this film felt more like the script was approved by a group of grinning 14 year olds. Likewise the plot was lazy and predictable, and was largely a retread of old ideas. Whether old ideas were recycled on purpose or for nostalgia's sake simply because of a lack of creativity is unclear, but it was obviously evident. Ghost pirates/pirate ship? Yup. Barbossa's shifting allegiances? Mhmm. Mythical item that is incredibly powerful that most characters don't believe exists? You bet. It's all the same old tricks. The plot doesn't always make much sense and many things are never explained in detail and the audience is essentially just supposed to play along without thinking too deeply. <br/><br/>All in all-It's an entertaining movie that has a little bit of everything that has made the series so fun and famous. Is it a ""good"", well-written, deeply thought out movie? Absolutely not. But it's a fun way to spend a couple hours if you're in the mood for another exciting and silly Captain Jack Adventure."
"bb13phills","8","1","7","30 May 2017"," More like the first three Pirates
","This movie was more like the first three movies of the series. A step up from the fourth one. The graphics, the story, the humor and the action was just what I want from a Pirates movie. It returned to it's formula that made me like the movies in the first place.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie at least tied into the others besides Stranger Tides. Salazar was a good villain and had some good backstory of Jack.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next one to come out because it seems it's going to have my favorite character ever in the franchise."
"StregaAsuka","7","1","7","29 May 2017"," The pearl, the girl and the Sparrow
","First of all, you can forget the previous film. As it never existed, but keep in mind the first trilogy, as this movie is kind of soft reboot of that one and we might see some familiar faces on it, and also some similar situations by the way.<br/><br/>As we are used to in all Pirates of the Caribbean movies, the action never stops. With long action scenes that never seem to end, with all details under control and crossing paths with all the characters, this movie is a good way to entertain ourselves and feel melancholic about the first (and movie) of all of them. In here different paths find their way to the same solution: they needs to find the trident of Poseidon for different reasons, and that makes all different characters having to work together. Does that sound familiar?<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays again Captain Jack Sparrow and while he makes us laugh sometimes, we are already used to his performance so it feels like there is nothing new in there, specially after five movies of the same. As the new comers are the youngsters who display a good chemistry trough all the movie and that gives a bit of fresh air although we cannot help ourselves to think about Orlando and Keira in the previous installments. Then we have a new villain Captain Salazar played by Javier Bardem who gives great and sometimes funny performance, specially when he goes like: ""Spaaarrrow"""", Sparroww"", that I cannot help myself but think of Robert De Niro in Cape Fear.<br/><br/>A good adventures movies that recovers the spirit of the first movies of the saga and keeps up with the humor that is also always present in these movies. Plus stay tuned for the post-credit scenes, a fan service scene that leaves doors open"

","Grade: B<br/><br/>Rating: PG-13, 135 minutes<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: I guess this is what you call ""Franchise Fatigue."" Audiences are getting a little tired and so is this series. Disney might see a surge in the 50 year old theme park favorite, but overall, fans are wistfully remembering back to the old days when Jack Sparrow was fresh and new.<br/><br/>It's better than the last couple of installments, and you'll be entertained if you're not expecting much. Will there be a #6? Probably. What am I saying? Of course there will be! This is the 12th highest grossing franchise film of all time.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: ""Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there."" – Carina Smyth Friendship, loyalty, family <br/><br/>Things I liked: Great special effects. Pretty amazing visuals above and below the water. While totally over-the-top, Javier Bardem plays a sufficiently scary villain named Captain Salazar. Did you know he was married to the beautiful Penelope Cruz, who starred in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ? Brenton Thwaites is just the eye candy young female fans want. SPOILER: I love that Orlando Bloom makes a couple of appearances. SPOILER: Great ending! The audience cheered when they saw Keira Knightley. At first, she said she wasn't interested in being in the movie, but audiences will all be grateful that she changed her mind.<br/><br/>Horologist. Ha ha<br/><br/>CGI Jack Sparrow when he was young. Interesting. At first I thought they found a young actor who looked like Johnny Depp, but then I could see when the lips didn't quite match the words and could tell it was CGI. Captain Jack Sparrow's father was played by a Rolling Stone (Keith Richards) and now, his uncle is played by a Beatle (Paul McCartney)! He's seen singing ""Maggie Mae"", which is an old drinking song of the sea from Liverpool. ""A skeleton walks into a bar, orders a mop and a beer...."" is the same joke told by Al Pacino to Johnny Depp's character in Donnie Brasco<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: It's so loud that a lot of the lines get swallowed up in other sound effects and so you can't always hear what people are saying. Kaya Scodelario just a good job as Carina Smith. Her dress was so low cut and she was always out of breath that I got tired of seeing her heaving chest in almost every scene she was in.<br/><br/>Slapstick comedy and goofy lines get wearisome. As much as I love Johnny Depp, his character didn't bring anything new to this movie and was far less interesting than the others. He supplies some humor, but that's about it. He's not clever and witty, like in the first movie; he's just a drunk buffoon. A lot of jokes are recycled over and over. There's no sense of urgency. The pacing kind of lags and I started actually getting sleepy. It feels long, even though it has the shortest running time of all the Pirates flicks. They filmed some of the boat scenes in the first movie on the actual ocean, but a lot of the similar scenes in this movie look like they're on a set with a green screen. Disappointing.<br/><br/>Funny lines: ""We'll honeymoon in the barn."" – ugly lady who Jack Sparrow is forced to marry <br/><br/>Interesting lines: ""Dead men tell no tales."" – Captain Salivar ""Who am I to you?"" – Carina ""A treasure."" – Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)<br/><br/>Tips for parents: Lots of fighting, violence, and high body count.

","I don't write reviews often because I'm told I nitpick which isn't fair, but I have to say this movie lost me almost right from the beginning. The opening scene was quite ridiculous on both counts - yup I'm talking about the preface being 9 years earlier and the opening surrounding good ole Jack himself. I literally cringed into the side of my girlfriend as I couldn't believe what had just happened twice. I grew up with the pirates series and the first 2 were quite incredible, they've gone down hill since, and by down hill I mean more and more outrageously hard to believe. The first movie and almost the second you could stow away your better judgment or understanding of physics and science and accept it for what it was, a swashbuckling good time. Now you have to be outright stupid, or mindless to not want to question who the heck wrote this movie... It still passes the two hours well, but there were too many moments that I almost couldn't bare to watch."

Geoffrey Rush is awesome as usual. Unfortunately Jack Sparrow seems to have become a caricature of himself, with ""comic"" situations really a bit exaggerate. Oh Johnny, why?"
"samyoung-82648","3","1","8","10 June 2017"," Terrible, Awful
","*** This film is filled with sexism and political correctness. While this is the standard today, this comment helps mindful people filter movies ***<br/><br/>The series has been hit and miss. However, I believe this movie could have been great if it had Keira Knightley in it. Keira knows how to play independent, strong, yet, not sexist. Unfortunately, Kata Scodelario is none of those things. Her dialog is laced with sexism and the usual pseuo-intellectual without the chops to pull it off. Brenton Thwaites (whilst having a character with humility) was flat. Something must have seriously been wrong because brilliant actors like Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) and Javier Bardem (Captain Salazar) were not their usual standard. Thankfully, Kevin McNally (Joshamee Gibbs) was as lovable as ever.<br/><br/>The story was average, not good but not bad. It retains some of its usual humour as we see Jack Sparrow in a series of humorous circumstances, although, the layering of crossing and double crossing from the previous series was sadly lacking.<br/><br/>I suspect a box office failure of this movie will be an end to the Pirates of the Caribbean series. However, i'd argue with better actors (especially Knightley), the series could continue. However, this will only work as long as mainstays such as Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp stay on board."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" charts the distinctly inspired course under Directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. Shimmering new star Kaya Scodelario as Carina touchingly says, ""For a moment I had everythingÂ…"" Surprisingly, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is about the human treasure: the fulfillment in discovery, and the poignant sadness in loss. Jeff Nathanson and Terry Russo's story and screenplay remain true to the familiar levity and whimsy of the past, and the iconoclast hero Captain Jack Sparrow, reprised with aloof perfection by Johnny Depp. Refreshingly, Ronning and Espen venture into undiscovered seas of family and redemption. ""Dead Men"" is visually spectacular with breathtaking beaches and high seas cinematography by Paul Cameron (""Collateral""). <br/><br/>Personally, Depp's Jack Sparrow has been the hero's enigma throughout the series. At times he is comically dim for effect, and Depp embodies the breezy stoned cool and indifference. Yet, he fights valiantly for the just cause, usually if not accidentally. Often he occurs as the expository non sequitur. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Will Turner's son, lead as the classic heroes, who fight for love and family on the journey. The level of talent captivates in ""Dead Men"". Depp is the gifted actor with several Oscar Nominations. Academy Award Winners Javier Barden and Geoffrey Rush play the ghost Captain Salazar and Jack's fierce rival Captain Barbosa. At times Barden seems to gnaw the scenery. However, at the story's dramatic arc Depp and Rush are sublime revealing Barbosa's past life. Furious action and splendid CGI aside, amazingly its ""Pirates'"" humanity that resounds. <br/><br/>As ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" opens 12 year-old Henry Turner finds his cursed Father Will, played with gravitas by Orlando Bloom. Will is the spirit trapped on his shipâ€”the Dutchman. Will instructs his son to locate the map for the Trident of Poseidon which has the power to free Will. The only man who can help him find the ""map that no man can read"" is Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>Nine years later aboard the British naval ship, grown Henry, played by earnest and strong Thwaites, encounters the ghost ship captained by Salazar. Wisely, Henry escapes the doomed British ship. Captain Salazar seeks revenge upon Jack, who possesses the Compass that sentenced him and his men to their ghostly eternity. Everyone wants a piece of Jack. <br/><br/>Meanwhile on the island of St. Martin, Scodelario's Carina is imprisoned for witchcraft. Really she is jailed for being too smart. Scodelario is beautiful with the piercing gaze of intellect. Her Carina is the horologist, scientist in time measurement, who holds a book from her Father. In that book lies the location of Poseidon's Trident translated through the stars. This is Carina's legacy, her bond to her unknown past. Jack is also on St. Martin, but drunken asleep in a bank vault; part of his crew's botched robbery attempt. He too is eventually jailed by authorities. Both Jack and Carina are sentenced for execution. Well, you probably know how that goes. <br/><br/>In the unlikely although necessary partnership, Jack, Carina, Henry, and Barbosa sail the high seas to find the Trident before evil Salazar does. Salazar has his own agenda of power and vengeance. Carina and Henry's noble purpose is the love for their father, and ultimately for each other. In a weird way, Jack transforms as Carina and Henry's protector. Depp is brilliant in balancing Jack's aloof charm and nobility. I guess Jack too is the surprise. <br/><br/>In the end the visual effects astound, and yet it's the touching humanity that moves in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"". As with the great hero stories the losses are heartfelt, and the triumph is freeing. Depp, Scodelario, and Thwaites are amazing acting partnership. The touching closing homage may even draw tears. Yes, this is the wonderful surprise. Perhaps, there shall be more high seas adventures filled with love, family, and courage."
"SAMTHEBESTEST","6","1","9","27 May 2017"," Captain Jack Sparrow's Charisma saves the weak Script, a Fulfill End to the Franchise.
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES REVIEW - I have seen all previous films of this Franchise on TV unlimited times and enjoyed each one of them. But i never got a chance to watch Captain Jack Sparrow on Big Screen and today i got the chance and i couldn't resist myself. I wasn't expecting much but was expecting a Fulfill End to the Franchise and i enjoyed the film a lot but not upto the mark. Script and Logic wise this is the weakest film of the franchise but still it didn't fail to entertain you as promised. Captain Jack Sparrow's charisma saved the weak script and dull direction. Beginning 15 minutes are let down and then Johnny Depp aka Captain Jack Sparrow arrives and takes the charge of the Ship. Once he arrives film doesn't lose the tempo but some illogical scenes irritates you. For instance, Pulling a house with the help of 4-6 horses is not acceptable, sometimes gravity doesn't exist, no specific reason to why Barbossa die. Excluding these minuses film has everything to entertain you with it's barrier. I don't think any other Actor would have done the role Jack Sparrow as Johnny Depp has done. All 5 films of the franchise revolves around his character, others disappoints but he kept entertaining us. Thank you Johnny Depp for playing memorable Captain Jack Sparrow with such an ease, you will be remembered for years as Mr. Sparrow. Editing of the film is tight, probably shortest film of the franchise. Cinematography is Good. 3D effects and Visuals are excellent except few scenes. Comedy and dialogues could have been better. Direction is the weakest aspect here, i don't understand why Director went away from the line and tried to make good logical film, a fictional one. Overall it is slightly down but yet another Entertaining film from Disney's Pirates franchise. You will get what you want to see, just don't keep expectations high. Hopefully it is the last film of the franchise and i think it was a fulfill end to the most entertaining franchise ever, so i would like to thank Disney and Johnny Depp for giving us Pirates series and Hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow. Go for it If you're a fan of the franchise or Johnny Depp. Compared to previous films i must say each film of this franchise has lost some comedy and some logic consistently with each upcoming film. POTC1 > POTC2 > POTC3 > POTC4 > POTC5. I'm going with 6/10* as i found this one as One Time Watch, but will watch on TV many times only because of Captain Jack Sparrowwwww...."

"david_rudy_lee","7","0","1","21 March 2020"," Another Fun Installment
","I will lead off this review stating that I am fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. It is interesting that this all stemmed from a ride at Disney that has spawned into this series of films. One thing that does help is that there is a lot of lore involving the ocean and seas out there. The synopsis for this film is Captain Jack Sparrow searches for the trident of Poseidon while being pursued by an undead sea captain and his crew.<br/><br/>This film introduces the son of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). He is a young boy named Henry Turner and trying to find his father. He ends up performing a ritual that allows him to see Will. He is told that he needs to move on and that there is nothing he can do to help him. He is stuck on the Flying Dutchman for all of eternity.<br/><br/>Henry grows up to Brenton Thwaites and he is working on a British ship. They are chasing after some pirates and this takes them into a cove. Henry is branded as a mutineer by having his sleeves ripped. They don't listen to him though. We do find the villain of this film, Javier Bardem as Captain Salazar. I really enjoyed this character's back-story. He was a Spanish navy captain who was hunting down pirates. He had scourged most of the waters, but was foiled by a young Jack Sparrow. He has been sealed in the cove since, waiting to be free.<br/><br/>Reprising his role as Jack is Johnny Depp. We see that he is still a bumbling pirate and goes right back into this role as if he had never been away. His crew abandons him and he is penniless. He gives away his famous compass that directs him to where he needs to go. In giving it away, he frees Salazar. Also on this same island is Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). She is being tried as a witch for studying astronomy. She does free herself from her cell. Also washing up on the island is Henry. The three of these meet up to try to find Poseidon's Trident. Henry needs it thinking it will free his father from his curse.<br/><br/>The story of this film does do some good things for me. I love the concept of Salazar. He is a pirate hunter who is now a ghost that now he is freed is back to eliminating all pirates. His hatred for them is even more. He even wants to find the trident as he believes he could use it as a weapon. These films are geared down a teenage or a younger adult audience, but I like that it took a bit darker ton. There is quite a bit of bloodshed. To get around this, we don't see a lot of the blood though. This is also a CGI fest with Salazar and his men. I've come to expect with these films though. I will give it credit as it does look real enough. It's enjoyable in seeing him and his men attack other ships as well. They do some creative things with it.<br/><br/>We do get Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) back in this film as well. He is a solid actor and really becomes this role. I even like that they tie his story into everything. It doesn't feel forced to have him back as the back-story involving him works. It is also fun to see him as he is that character who constantly is just out for himself, much like a meaner version of Jack.<br/><br/>The two younger stars, Henry and Carina do give the film a fresh feel. They are both good looking and breathe some life into franchise. It also affords them the opportunity to continue it on if they want to as well. I really like the concept of Carina being into astronomy which gets her persecuted as a witch, much like the scientists of the time. Using stars is the best way to navigate while being on the ocean from what I've learned since there's no real landmarks aside from land. It is great though for this film as it incorporates mythology. The beings from these stories are also in constellations in the stars which I thought is a solid touch.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is really good as well. We get Kevin McNally back who is Gibbs. He has become a somewhat faithful partner to Jack and fun to see. Martin Klebba, Marty, is also back in this film. I did like to see the inclusion of David Wenham. He is Scarfield who is a British soldier. I think he is a solid supporting actor and his performance is good in this film.<br/><br/>Now the editing of the film itself is fine. We get the different groups where we can learn about them and then it works amongst them until the climax when everyone converges on each other. I think that is important when you are working with a film like this. An issue I have with all of these films is that they run a little bit long in my opinion, but it is hard to really see where to cut things to shorten it.<br/><br/>The score of the film was pretty solid. Geoff Zanelli composed this film and this is the first of the series he has worked on. I do feel that followed what the previous films did so I can't give him too much credit. The theme was the same as the previous ones. He did go with the grand, classic style music that just fits. A lot of that is keeping up with the time period that the film was released, but also being on the open sea this is the type of music I'd associate with it as well.<br/><br/>I am adding this to the horror film research that I am conducting due to having horror film creatures like ghosts and zombies. It also has a lot of killing, which is kind of rare for a Disney based film. You don't get to see a lot of it, but we still know that it is happening. This one especially as it seems to have a darker tone that many of the others.<br/><br/>And with that said, I would recommend seeing this film if you like the series. The actors that you've seen in the past reprise their roles and it seems like they never left. Bardem joining as Salazar was good. His character is quite dark and menacing. I liked the story as well as the mythology. This film doesn't really violate anything that happened in past films, so that is good. The only thing is that the compass that Jack has is important again. I do have question in regards to that I need to check back on the previous films. The editing itself is fine, but it does run a little long. The score of the film is grand like the other films. It fits what the film is going for. Now this is a popcorn film with some horror elements to it. I enjoyed it, but do not come in expecting too much. I think this film is above average."

","SALAZAR'S REVENGE is the fifth instalment in the seemingly endless PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN franchise, one of my least favourite in modern cinema. If you want to see something adult and serious involving pirates, I recommend the excellent TV series BLACK SAILS. Anyway, this one's another mindless CGI adventure in which the baton is passed to new, more youthful stars who are carbon copies of the Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley characters from the original trilogy. Depp is yet again on autopilot, genuine actors are constantly wasted (hello, Javier Bardem), and the whole thing is an excuse for CGI artists to offer endlessly vapid action scenes, one after another. Add in queasy humour, typically at the expense of the female characters, and you have a real dud."

But in the end Sellers' performance still rang more true. As another reviewer commented, the rhythm of this newest movie just isn't as smooth as earlier versions. Admittedly, the special effects are amazing as will other blockbusters will be coming out this summer. The storyline is indeed impressive helping to tie up some lose ends. There are the various requisite emotive, sensitive scenes. Overall, this blockbuster adventure holds one's interest for the most part, offers the audience something that is both understandable and entertaining. It is perhaps the overdone jokes, so many of them, like a live stage comic act, whereby some jokes are winners and others are so-so. I really wanted more, but since I really didn't want to go see this movie in the first place but was forced to, the movie was actually good and I'm glad I did."
"chakor-74657","8","0","1","30 December 2018"," A return to form for the Pirates series
","Let me first start off by saying that the first two Pirates movies are the air that I need to live and breath - they are the Star Wars and Empire of my generation, so my view on this film is going to be a bit bias. As a big fan I wanted to like this film but at the same time I never went into it with high expectations - and I kid you not, it is up there in my list of top 5 movies that I enjoyed the heck out of in a theatre. I am rather surprised by the amount if negative critical reception this got, and I could not disagree more about it being bland because I honestly found it rather refreshing in an age where it seems like Marvel and Star Wars are the only films that matter and the only ones that people like.<br/><br/>Let's start out with what I liked:<br/><br/>Captain Salazar was a really well-done villain by Javier Bardem and definitely my favorite part of the film. Just this character alone makes this movie a win IMO. Loved his performance and Spanish accent even if he was hamming it up a little bit here and there. The CGI for his weightless hair was also probably some of the best in the series since Davy Jones. It was also impressive how they managed to completely digitally erase the right side of his head, which was often covered up by the hair. Him and his crew being brought back to human form during the third act was predictable as hell and his demise was rather silly (as was the entire final battle), but he was definitely leagues better than Blackbeard and made for a memorable villain. Also unlike Blackbeard he had a really strong connection to Jack which made his character work well. As much as I loved the film for what it was, I really feel like it would have benefited tremendously from seeing more of Salazar as opposed to Henry, Carina, and the nonsensical Trident of Poseidon business which I'll talk about later.<br/><br/>I really liked most of the visual gags and thought they were very well-choreographed.  You can see the whole bank heist thing coming from a mile away, but it was still hilarious. The battle between the Silent Mary, Salazar's ghost ship, and the Black Pearl was also pretty good, especially the one part where Jack using one of the Mary's canons to destroy the figurehead come to life.<br/><br/>While some of the score was just remixes of soundtracks from CotBP and the other films, there were some really good tracks here and there. I especially loved Salazar's theme which took me by surprise and sent chills down my spine when it unexpectedly started playing about midway through the end credits. While it was directly remixed from CotBP, I also loved the track that played after the big final battle when we see the lighthouse from the beginning for the second time. I darn near teared up.<br/><br/>Jack was sort of a positive and a negative at the same time. Depp definitely seemed like he was enjoying it more this time around (whereas in OST he was totally phoning it in and looked bored), although I think they somewhat missed the mark on the character himself. That whole flashback scene detailing the story of Jack and Salazar was very well done and definitely gave us classic Jack Sparrow in all his witty glory, but in the present day during the main story here he seemed like too much of a buffoon who couldn't do anything right and he had no standout moment where he planned out an escape or whatever, which is something that almost all of the previous films had.<br/><br/>Now here come the negatives. Most of these didn't hinder my ability to enjoy the film, but they are definitely worth bringing up:<br/><br/>In terms of writing - and this is probably what bugged me most - I was actually surprised by how much stuff they seemed to neglect from the previous films and expected fans of the series to ignore. I could go on forever, but things like Will Turner being cursed to captain the Flying Dutchman when the rules in DMC and AWE established that Jones was only cursed because he neglected his duties is a good example. I really wonder if the writers even saw the previous films. There being no explanation as to what, specifically, cursed Salazar and his crew when their ship crashed in the Devil's Triangle also annoyed me a little. I can't say it was good from a writing standpoint overall, but none of those inconsistencies and little annoyances took me out of the film.<br/><br/>The wedding scene - yuck! Why was this even in the film at all? Who thought that an audience would actually find it funny? I seriously closed my eyes when it came up. It was so gross and pointless. Why give nonfans more ammunition to trash the franchise?<br/><br/>The zombie sharks - why have them at all? I just thought they were a little too OTT even for Pirates because Salazar had no real need for them and I think they tried too hard with the gross factor by adding flies in their mouths... Blah. The CGI for them also looked pretty bad, but that entire chase scene was actually pretty fun despite being too OTT.<br/><br/>The Trident of Poseidon - this is kind of an issue with the writing, bu I didn't care for this MacGuffin at all. Much like Henry and Carina who I'll talk about later, I thought it was completely unneeded and detracted from the story. I really didn't like the phoned-in rule that all curses at sea were held inside the Trident because it again contradicts rules established in the previous films.<br/><br/>Henry and Carina - I thought both actors were pretty good, but the characters themselves couldn't escape feeling like complete ripoffs on Will and Elizabeth. They were obviously trying to recapture that CotBP love story vibe with these two characters, and while they were enjoyable to see on screen unlike that awful clergyman and mermaid love story in OST, I thought they were also unneeded characters at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Barbossa - as much as I love and welcome Geoffery Rush in the role, I feel like the ending of OST where he killed Blackbeard and took the Queen Anne's Revenge was a great end for his character arc, with him finally sailing the seas as a pirate yet again. Here I feel like he didn't even need to be a part of the film and the only purpose his presence really served was to release the Black Pearl from the bottle and for sake of a really hamfisted twist that didn't jive with me at all. Ultimately I feel like they really screwed up Barbossa.<br/><br/>So at the end of the day, I feel this film is nowhere near the level of bad 0/10 that critics and nonfans want it to be, but at the same time, it is simply a lazily-written entertaining film. For all of their faults, Pirates 3 and 4 are honestly more solid films than this from a writing standpoint. Technically I would rate this about a 7, but to bring the IMDb user consensus score to a more reasonable level, I'll give it an 8."

","The fifth film of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise is in every way ""the same"" as its predecessors. With minor exceptions, where it fails or shines for a moment, the whole franchise leaves an impression of one big movie. In terms of the story and in terms of directing, editing, camera, effects, sound and acting, all five movies are more or less at the same level, therefore I have nothing to say about this movie that I have not said before about previous four. I just want to mention the end, which simply screams ""Disney"" and ""Hollywood"". Very emotional happy-end, with no humor and without any cliffhanger or at least an indication of the temporality of happiness, somehow does not fit into the tone of this franchise, but although it is typically Hollywood pathetic, or as Captain Jack Sparrow said: ""What a truly revolting sight"", I admit that it has achieved its purpose and I ended up with a few tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>8/10"

This time Captain Salazar has released the most deadly ghost pirates of the sea from the Devil's Triangle. The only way to beat these pirates is to gain control of The Trident of Poseidon as whoever possesses it will be in control of all the seas. Will Jack and his allies reign victorious? The movie is a rehash of the gags, physical comedy, sword battles and character personas as you'd expect but the effects seemed more impressive. I have to agree with a comment from an actual critic about the more I see of these movies the more I begin to ""retroactively wonder why I liked the original film so much in the first place."""

","Despite On Stranger Tides not living up to expectations of other films in the franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales delivers on all the action and comedy that made the franchise popular in the first place.
While Jack Sparrow at times is a little too drunk, it is made up for by the hilarious comedy and awesome action. The scene where he was spinning around on a guillotine was one of the most memorable parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The new characters, Carina and Henry, are also enjoyable. It's nice to see characters who are not always in need of rescuing. <br/><br/>Captain Salazar is by far one of the best villains in the franchise. He is ruthless and menacing. The design for him, the crew and the Silent Mary are all spectacular. One of the best moments was when his ship came crashing down on the British on and it showed how monsterous Salazar really is.
I also liked the British captain in this one much better than Beckett who was not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>For me though, the breakout performance was Geoffrey Rush's Captain Hector Barbossa. Barbossa has been my favorite character since the first movie and Dead Men Tell No Tales delivers. In this movie, Barbossa is more vulnerable than he was in Stranger Tidea and World's End. For one thing, he is defeated by Salazar and forced to make a deal in order to spare his life. While a similar thing happened in Stranger Tides, this time, the stakes are up and it feels more intense, like Salazar could kill him any time. Barbossa is also much older in this film and it clearly shows plus the fact that he is handicapped. His relationship with Jack was very entertaining and the fact that Carina is his daughter allows viewers to see a more compassionate side to him. His sacrifice at the end, while heartbreaking, was a nice way to send him off because Barbossa became a true hero in that moment, thus completing his journey from villain to antihero to hero. Captain Hector Barbossa was truly one of the most amazing and complelling characters in Dead Men Tell No Tales.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film had some fun cameos including Paul McCarthey(idk how to spell it), Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly.<br/><br/>Criticisms: Jack Sparrow was at times a little annoying and too drunk.
Like Dead Man's Chest, they had this one really unnecessary scene which involved Jack once more trying to escape from the bad guys, wind up on an island, and get captured by angry natives (sound familiar?). <br/><br/>Anyways, I give Dead Men Tell No Tales a 9/10 for great characters, cool actions and hilarious comedy."

And how Captain Jack Sparrow became who he was. I'm my opinion it's the best film out of the series of Pirates of The Caribbean. And Shalzar dies in the end because of his anger in his heart to kill Jack. Jack loose his best friend Barbossa. Barbossa saves his daughter by sacrificing himself to stab Shalzar in the back. In the end it leaves you a big cliff hanger. Then it makes you think there's going to be a 6th film. There will be in May 29, 2020"

The return of some past characters, and a romance between the side characters that wasn't forced for once, made for a nice romp. Barbossa being back was as great as ever since he's one of the highlights of this series. However, I felt that Gibbs was a bit underused even more than in On Stranger Tides this time around.<br/><br/>The action scenes are a bit of an improvement over the last movie, but still nowhere near the first two movies in the series. The whole first chapter that took place before the characters took to the sea was insanely enjoyable, and I wish we had more of that. The story once they got onto the sea was a bit less interesting, and I felt like the villain in this movie, Salazar, kind of sucked and is probably the worst villain out of all the movies so far. I had so much trouble understanding what he was saying most of the time, but thankfully Netflix subtitles saved the day for me.<br/><br/>Overall, despite the villain being a little underwhelming, I feel like this is a much better installment to the Pirates franchise than On Stranger Tides was.

","Jack Sparrow, drunk and with a shrunken Black Pearl in a bottle in his pocket, finds himself tasked with helping Will Turner's son Henry find the Trident of Poseidon which will enable him to lift the curse on Will, doomed to captain the Flying Dutchman. Having accidentally acquired the company of young female astronomer Carina, they find their quest dogged by savage anti-pirate undead spirit, Salazar, out for revenge against Sparrow.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's 5th outing as Jack Sparrow - sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow - marks a return to form. The first film was a surprise and delight. But, notwithstanding good moments, I felt each of the following films was more disappointing than the one before. Number 5 is pretty good, though.<br/><br/>It has a strong story which is quite complicated, but well put together. And it deals with dangling threads from earlier films and resolves them satisfactorily. For that reason, I think it would be a fitting film with which to end the franchise - go out on a positive note!<br/><br/>Depp can play Sparrow in his sleep by now, but Jack isn't really the main character here. There are plenty of funny lines for him, and good opportunities for drunken mincing, but this film is really Harry, Carina and Salazar. Like I said, there is quite a lot of story on board, and Jack Sparrow's share is quite small. Fortunately, Brenton Thwaites (Henry), Kaya Scodelario (Carina) and Xavier Bardem (Salazar) handle the heavy lifting well.<br/><br/>The other cast members are, of course, more than reliable, from the familiar (Geoffrey Rush, Sparrow's crew etc.) to the new (David Wenham). The action set pieces are every bit as extravagant as we have become used to: the bank robbery is great fun, and the finale is excellent. The CGI is as good as one would expect - the skeletal sharks are hugely impressive, especially in 3D.<br/><br/>And, like so many films this year, there is a strong emphasis on family. And that isn't just Harry Turner's family: a family connection turns up in the most unexpected place, and pays off beautifully.<br/><br/>No one expected a theme park ride to provide the inspiration for a series of hit movies, but I have enjoyed all the Pirates films. This is the best since the original, and - for a number of reasons - it would be a fitting end to the series."

","(A liitle bit predictable as well. Still enjoyable though)<br/><br/>When we first saw the Pirates of the Carribean film with Captain Jack Sparrow, there were lots of indications about Jack's past. And everyone was curious as hell. But now, everyone is unhappy with it..what do you mean you are bored? Too much movies? I do not understand that we got the story, we got the film - it looks pretty swell too- and people are not satisfied. Don't you lie to us or yourself, this is what all of us were wondering about. <br/><br/>How he got the compass? How did he become captain? This movie has the answers, let's just enjoy."
"FilmNerd2017","8","0","1","5 May 2018"," Dead Men Tell Fairly Decent Tales
","So is this movie as dead as the critics are saying? No. Is it better than the original three? Sadly no. Is it better than the 4th? HELL YEAH!!! Here is my critique. Be prepared for some SPOILERS.<br/><br/>First of all, I just want to quickly say that the overall direction for this movie was thought out pretty well. Of course, the execution and final result are a bit different.<br/><br/>The overall story about Captain Jack Sparrow hitting hard times and is then pursued by an army of blood thirsty Spanish Navy ghosts, lead by their psychopathic captain on a quest for revenge, which leads to him going on another adventure where he teams up with two young adults, one of whom being the son of his old comrades Will and Elizabeth, was a great idea. It also has a slightly darker tone that I thought was great. I especially liked how the film has a look and feel that calls back to the original three films, or just the first one, in terms of, again, the tone, as well as in terms of characters and ships. The film could've been a lot deeper and more emotional, especially on Jack's side of the story. It could've been more like Logan where he's lost his way, and everything that goes on makes him emotionally whole again. I especially would've preferred, as always in these sequels, that the story would be more centered on him, but it ends up being spread a bit, which is unfortunate because Jack is generally the only guy I care about in these movies (minus a few exceptional characters). The story may also not be super original since it involves another undead villain with a grudge against Jack of all people, but it still makes the story fun, especially since the villains for this one are ghosts who are already dead.<br/><br/>Now, let's nitpick on acting. I will admit that Johnny Depp isn't at his best in this one. For whatever reason, the level of seriousness for his character went from 90% down to 50%. But honestly, at the end of the day, I'm just glad Johnny Depp is in this film as the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow to begin with, especially with a sword to fight with for that matter, plus Depp still carries some of the iconic quirky charm and clever wit that has made such a great character. The biggest sin for a Pirates sequel would be to not have him and his sword at all. So, yeah... yay Johnny Depp! Javier Bardem is great as the villain, CapitÃ¡n Salazar. I just loved seeing him be so tortured and psychopathic. Sure, he's not that scary, but he is an entertainingly terrifying villain. And of course, always love Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa. Can't say a whole lot about Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner. I liked that they decided to give Jack another morally-straight partner who happens to be the son of Will and Elizabeth, but kinda like Orlando Bloom as Will (mostly in the sequels) Brenton isn't really that interesting as the goody-two shoes guy, especially since he apparently has almost the majority of the focus in this story. Kaya Scoldelario was a little more okay than him as a stubborn and adamant young woman fighting for her rights to pursue astronomy in a time of 18th century sexism. I'm also glad that this film brings back a few likable supporting characters like Gibbs, Scrum, Marty, Murtogg and Mullroy (the two British soldiers who keep bickering), and some of the new crewmen were an interesting bunch too, but man do I miss Pintel and Ragetti (the short fat guy and his skinny buddy with the wooden eye). <br/><br/>Now for another big part of the movie: the action. (SPOILER) In regard to the one scene I was anticipating the most in this film, let's just say that the eventual Sparrow vs. Salazar sword duel is a lot shorter than I had hoped and preferred, but what little there is in the film is enough to make it even remotely awesome. In fact, overall, all the action scenes combined make the movie pretty awesome, especially this one bit with these ghost sharks, so cool!<br/><br/>Another thing to consider would be the VFX. The VFX is used to terrific effect. The film has so much cinematic beauty. Even the set design is visually pleasing. The VFX definitely helps make the best villains we've seen since Barbossa and his skeleton crew and Davy Jones and his fish men crew. Not like Blackbeard and his zombies, or should I say, a bunch of dudes between 30-60 years old with weird tats and piercings who say their ""zombies."" And again, ghost sharks are awesome!<br/><br/>If I had to critique on one last thing, it would be the ending. It may not be the ideal ending, but it comes pretty close since it resolves certain issues that the last two movies left unsettled, and is done to beautiful effect visually and emotionally. Definitely a worthy enough ending for the series. But then came this particular scene after the credits. Without giving too much away, the post-credits scene at the end features a vague but huge surprise. It's both awesome, but at the same time shows that they're hoping to make a sequel, that I personally don't need or want, with an idea that they scraped from under the barrel.<br/><br/>Another last thing, I love the music. Geoff Zanelli was a terrific replacement for someone as talented as Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>So overall, this movie may have a few disappointing moments, but it's still a fun film to watch, and one of the best films of the year. If you're as devoted a fan to Pirates as I am, then I highly recommend that you go see it. Pirate's Life!!!"

Coming out of the movie, we talked and laughed about it and retold the story for good further hour and a half. My grandkids favorite activity for the next week was thinking up their own ideas for 'Where will Captain Jack Sparrow go next?'
Thank you very much to Disney and the producers, directors, and cast... and kudos to Mr. Depp from being willing to provide us with another visit with a most remarkable character!

","I'm not going to lie, but when I went into the theatre I had mediocre expectations. Instead this film exceeded my expectations and got amazing performances mainly from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp. Amazing visual effects and amazing storytelling. Back in 2003, Johnny Depp received an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl and Recieved another Golden Globe nomination for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and I can go as far saying that he deserves at least another Golden Globe nomination for this Fifth Film installment. Johnny Depp needs at least one Oscar winning performance and he deserves one for this movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. But Surpisingly I enjoyed Geoffrey Rush's performance more than Johnny Depp and until you see this movie, you will understand why. He is has an Amazing performance as Captain Barbossa. Trust me, you won't be disappointed despite of the bad reviews. If your a big fan of this franchise, you will definitely see some cameos and will get excited from the Easter eggs. This is the 10th best selling movie of the year which is impressive. No wonder this a 4.5 Billion dollar Franchise !"
"philipposx-12290","5","0","1","26 January 2018"," A Solid Movie for the Fans
","The 6 year wait was over when Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales was announced for Summer 2017 and many fans of the franchise including me were looking forward to this one. 
The POTC Franchise started with a banger and a must watch classic in The Curse of the Black Pearl 2003 (10/10), had a worthy and great sequel 3 years later in Dead Man's Chest (8/10), an epic trilogy conclusion in their third movie that lacked a little bit Pacing (7/10) and a cool 4th movie, that sadly felt a little bit out of place (6/10).<br/><br/>Dead Men Tell No Tales is in no way a very good movie, but is delivers on a nostalgia level (although having 1/2 plot holes). The movie is again driven by it's character performances as Depp (Captain Sparrow), Rush (Barbosa) and Bardem (Salazar) deliver once again. 
The story itself is okay, but offers nothing really new to the franchise but the film pacing and the action scenes are nearly on the level of the first two installments. All in all, it's a fun summer movie, that I wouldn't personally recommend to anyone who is no fan of the franchise: 6/10"

If you liked the ones before you probably will like this one as well. You have to have an open mind though, it's just fantasy. Most of the action scenes are just overexagerated but that's just how those movies are. If you can't get over it you should just not watch them. To me it's a good movie for a lazy sunday afternoon. The CGI's are like always very good. Johnny Depp plays the usual Captain Sparrow, a most of the time drunk pirate that has no fear of dying or at least he always acts nonchalant about it. All the movies are like this and I don't see why they should change the concept. I'm ready for the sixth Pirates of the Caribbean. Bring it on!"
"cmerrittphantom","7","0","1","7 January 2018"," Stale, but fun.
","Unlike most people I've heard voice opinion on this flick, I enjoyed myself watching this. The unfortunate fact of the matter is the Pirates franchise is no longer quality cinema as the first and arguably second films were... Heck, even the third film had moments of cinematic brilliance. The fourth entry was a huge visual drop off and plot-wise was a mediocre filler episode with some mildly entertaining chemistry between Sparrow and his female counterpart.<br/><br/>It had become clear the plot was leaning toward pirate lore rather than a clear arc or saga route. Whereas the initial trilogy was reminiscent of the Star Wars original trilogy in structure and tone, the more recent entries don't even attempt to articulate a grand personal journey like the aforementioned franchise's prequel escapade. <br/><br/>Immediately I think this Pirates movie stands out from the last one. A strange decision made in one of the earlier films immediately comes to a head, and I was hooked. But then we are treated to an evolution of familiar characters that took me off guard. I was wondering since the second film how this universe would survive with the evolution of its setting, and now we are seeing my question play out... it's not so pretty. In a way, as a prelude to the aforementioned franchise's similar story this year, this depiction of that core element is far more satisfying, despite being in far less demand.<br/><br/>I was surprisingly invested in these new characters. The female lead is genuinely charismatic, but the bland male lead only manages to be interesting because of his back story, which is briefly detailed in the intro scene as a fantastic hook. Some of the story progressions of these characters are to roll eyes at, but I think it works. Just barely.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is far superior to the Black Beard adventure last time around. Visuals are always a highlight of these films, but this time it was THE highlight. Not particularly imaginative, but serviceable and immersive.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little wobbly, like the sadly predictable at this point Jack Sparrow, who is pitiful in this film. That's not a spoiler so much as fair warning. If you go to see these movies to see Jack Sparrow, don't bother. He's moderately entertaining, but a point is made of his devolution. I found that entertaining in its own right, but all short of former glory. I don't think Jack would be as entertaining as everyone thinks he'd be if he were still the wild card he once was in every film, so I appreciate his character having a trajectory that at least resembles an arc, even if it's the opposite of one of those.<br/><br/>The tone is par for the course. I didn't regret seeing this movie, but I do wish I could have had my way with this plot line, even as an amateur inexperienced writer. There was some missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the strange surreal ending of this movie. It seems like this movie could have been two, and more epic if it were. But it works fine as one, and that's always been a complaint I think is useless. It seems weird and rushed that this thread is set up and wrapped up in one film.<br/><br/>There were two parts to the ending, one I liked but thought was rushed and not unsatisfying but less satisfying than it should have been, and the other one I thought was totally wrong and slightly infuriating... but understandable as decision all things considered.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad, not good. It was fun. It wasn't boring. But it is a far cry from the bombastic epic film-making classics the initial trilogy films are. It is not exciting or exhilarating anymore, it's a mindless popcorn flick with some personality injected into it. It's average. That's kinda sad, but I'm okay with it. If some people aren't, I understand. I loved this series too, and I wish it could somehow recapture its former glory. But all good things must come to pass. No great film streak lasts forever. You either die a hero, or live long enough to - you get the idea. <br/><br/>It could be so much worse than it is, honestly. I'm seriously okay with solid b-grade movies over the series dying out or becoming a monster of its former self like other franchises we've seen live this long or longer. Look at Star Wars... took a nose dive with The Last Jedi. Look at Fast and Furious. Look at Transformers. Streaks of high grossing easy money cash in crap shoot franchise Hollywood machine cancer with no signs of slowing down. I'm totally fine with coherent, inoffensive, mildly entertaining b-movies."

","The seemingly endless series of the Johnny Depp films PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN seems to be coming to an end with this 5th installment. For fourteen years this tale has been on screen, television, video games, Halloween costumes etc and this latest version – DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES – seems to have a prescient subtitle! The story is more reflective this time round (we see the initial seeds for the series as we face the past), most of the cast members remain (if only for a brief moment for some like Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom), some fresh actors enter (such as the very welcome Brenton Thwaites and Kaya Scodelario), the mainstay actors remain (Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush et al), and the newest aspect is the increasing imposing use of CGI graphics. <br/><br/>But on to the story as written by Jeff Nathanson based on characters created by Terry Rossio, Ted Elliot, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert and directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) searches for the trident of Poseidon while being pursued by an undead sea captain Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) and his crew and finds the winds of ill-fortune blowing even more strongly when deadly ghost pirates led by his old nemesis (Captain Salazar) escape from the Devil's Triangle, determined to kill every pirate at sea...including him. Captain Jack's only hope of survival lies in seeking out the legendary Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that bestows upon its possessor total control over the seas.<br/><br/>Oh, there is more detail to the tale and the actors employed are excellent. Nigel Phelps designed the production, Paul Cameron is in charge of cinematography and the musical score is by Geoff Zanelli. The movie is a bit long in tooth (a slow excess of two hour) and for the most part the CGI effects are the stars, but for those addicted to the Pirates series this final (hopefully) version will satisfy.

","The latest ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is another entertaining romp across the high seas, never stopping to make much sense but that's OK. The first half of the movie finds Captain Jack drinking and half-drunk all the time, which is kind of a shame. I guess the film makers were trying to emphasize how down and out he'd become. But some fresh faces inject some new life in the series, and the same thrilling chase scenes and impossible rescues are still in abundance. The English soldiers still can't shoot any better than storm troopers. It's escapist entertainment at it's best, which is all it is trying to be. I wouldn't be surprised though if they tried to make the next one without Captain Jack Sparrow."

","My wife and I watched this at home on glorious BluRay from our public library. They seemingly spared no expense with sets and special effects, the sound and picture are great, and a reason to see the movie even if you don't care about the story.<br/><br/>It is a continuation of the Jack Sparrow chronicles started 12 or 13 year earlier, although in the story the official lapse of time is 20 years. Many characters continue through the series of 5 movies, and even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return at the end for short cameos.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most fun cameo is by Paul McCartney of the Beatles. He has one short scene where he is in prison as Uncle Jackie, awaiting execution. Depp and McCartney have been friends in real life for many years and he did the role as a favor to Depp.<br/><br/>There is a story here, but really who cares? Jack Sparrow has to endure several near-death encounters before encountering the Trident of Poseidon, and allowing the un-dead captain and his crew to go to their final resting place. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem is the un-dead Captain Salazar, and Geoffrey Rush back as Captain Barbossa. Each of them is great in his role.<br/><br/>The fresh faces, who as teenagers grew up enjoying the earlier Pirate movies, are Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner and Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth who holds the key to locating the Trident. <br/><br/>For any viewer who enjoys this type of movie it is a totally entertaining 2 hours.

The trailer made it look exciting and new and showed that it was not the typical Disney ""happy-go-lucky"" movie.<br/><br/>I think the actual movie was OK but nothing special. Some slightly wooden acting in places and mediocre character development but was a fun introduction to those who has not seen the previous movies.<br/><br/>I did, however, feel that the plot was a little too far fetched. The previous movies presented a pretty believable plot and kept space for Johnny Depp's witty remarks from time to time. However the ""splitting of the sea"" scene seemed a little too far fetched for me. Furthermore, the magical/sorcery aspect(Poseidon's trident) was just that bit too much for reality. Yes it is only a movie but it was supposed to be about pirates and not about a this mystical fork that lay at the bottom of the ocean that everyone had to race to find. <br/><br/>As far as i'm concerned, this is the first installment in this franchise that features unrealistic effects such as Javier's ""ghost"" her swishing about as he moved. It all seemed a little false. Not to start on his floating ship that could rise out of the water and engulf another ship. It almost reminded me on Monster House in places.<br/><br/>Not all was bad however, Javier's role seemed to be executed pretty coherently and Johnny Depp held his water being the funny, poor excuse for a pirate that he is.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was OK but felt a little plot-stressed in places making it feel far-fetched."

It had a few really well pulled off set pieces, (the bank job, all the sea footage etc etc), and a stunning ace with Javier Bardem's revenge driven character. Geoffrey Rush added new depth to his character while keeping the ground he'd already made with him intact, as did Kevin McNally with his Gibbs character. The backward steps didn't really detract from the ride but certainly didn't help. Depp's Jack Sparrow didn't add anything to the soup except a few cheap laughs,although flash back scenes were nice. The new characters were sufficient in their roles as Henry Turner (Will and Elizabeth's son) and 'scientist' Carina Smyth. The special effects and stunts were outstanding. Especially Barden's effects makeup, matched with his delivery, adding real menace to his character. The aforementioned bank scene, the guillotine scene, multiple sailing ship battles and crashes, all looked and felt stunning. And foremost, the story was tight and relevant to the POTC legend. It linked in with the themes of the series and expanded on them nicely. This is nowhere near as bad as I've read it is, and is much better than the last 2 installments thanks to the points noted above. Totally worth a watch."
"mj68538","4","0","1","22 October 2017"," A typical sequel of a sequel of a sequel of a sequel
","Riddled with plot holes and finished off with pointless clichés, the weakest of the series so far.<br/><br/>First the good - Javier Bardem made a great villain, the special effects were very special, and there were a few good jokes in the first 20 minutes (though the over-labouring of the Horologist joke got a bit irritating).<br/><br/>And now for the bad - in the first few minutes it tramples all over the end of Dead man's Chest - the Flying Dutchman needs a serious lick of paint and William Turner has turned into a new Davy Jones, seemingly for no reason whatsoever. And then there's the whole Salazar business - no big back story, a young Sparrow just out-maneuvered them. So why on earth would he and his crew hold an everlasting grudge against Jack Sparrow? Surely Salazar's crew would be far more annoyed their idiot captain had been outwitted by a teenager, and sailed them into a volcano? <br/><br/>And what happened to the Queen Anne's Revenge? No explanation was given for it's disappearance, so all I can assume is Barbosa must have left it in a car park one night when he was drunk, and staggered home forgetting where he's left it. And then there's Jack himself - Sparrow basically did nothing the whole movie except booze, so if I were Turner Jr I'd have headed off with Ms Smyth and avoided all the extra needless danger and irritation of sharing a ship with a hopeless drunk pursued by undead pirate hunters. <br/><br/>Finally, just to add insult to injury, Barbosa, who had never shown any signs of affection to anything except the Black Pearl and his monkey, was suddenly willing to sacrifice his life for a daughter he's never seen and fling himself into the wild blue yonder to fight the newly alive Salzar, who by that time wouldn't have given a monkey's about fighting Sparrow, much less some random fool with a wooden leg. Oh, and why did they have to rehash the ending of the first film and make Salazar and his crew alive again? Couldn't they have come up with something more original?<br/><br/>So, erm, it'd probably be bearable if it was the first one you'd watched or you'd conveniently forgotten all the previous movies, but if not it's just a tired old rehash with some stupid clichés and idiotic plot holes, glossed over with some nice special effects."

No characters, no plot, no music....nothing!<br/><br/>Before going to the cinema, i was convinced that this movie was going to be great! I was wrong.

Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow was the greatest thing in the series and now is gone...<br/><br/>1 star goes to the effects. The only good thing in this movie is the cinematography and the special effects. That's why the film is so bad.

"wonacottwilliam","8","0","1","18 October 2017"," Dead Men Tell No Tales; Odd Pirates Movies Tell Good Tales
","I was beyond worried about this movie after because of the fourth. Usually when you make another movie after a more or less lackluster movie, it's going to be worse (At Worlds End is an exception to this because it was direct sequel to Dead Man's Chest). I'm very happy that Dead Men Tell No Tales does not follow being worse than On Stranger Tides. In my usual review format I'll go over the Good, The Bad (Meh), and The Ugly(Bad).<br/><br/>The Good: The opening scene before the title pops up sets the pace and major plot point of the movie. From a young Henry finding Will and promising to break his curse with the Trident of Poseidon as well as finding Captain Jack. As well as being greeted by the movies main villain Captain Salazer.<br/><br/>In typical Pirates fashion each character, from Henry, Captain Jack, and Carina all work together for the same goal, but driven to it for very alternative reasons.<br/><br/>The movies pacing was excellently, not really giving a dull moment; and giving back stories of both Salazer and Captain Jack in perfect places, while hiding Carina's back story long enough to make the realization of who she is a very shocking twist.<br/><br/>When you think of the Pirated movies, two things pop into your head: Captain Jack and the musical score. Needless to say, the musical score is on point, making the 5th Pirates movie still feel like an epic seafaring adventure.<br/><br/>The last bit of Good comes in with another guest appearance. Seeing Will pop up at the beginning, I was hoping to see Erlizabeth Swann pop up sometime; and following the pacing her brief appearance was nearly tear jerking. Especially because it came very near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The Bad: Captain Jack was funny, and everything he did had a purpose; however, it seemed as if Captain Jack had fallen very far from grace. A once drunk, but still brilliant, formidable, and Captain character, we see more of a drunkard almost embarrassment of the original Captain Jack. He finally redeems himself at the end, but being the 5th Pirates movie, Captain Jack shouldn't need a sub plot of redeeming himself; or they could have executed it better. He's still funny and still very much himself, but his character let me down a lot.<br/><br/>This also brings us to Captain Barbossa. His introduction and how he carried himself for most of the film made me feel like he wasn't himself. The banter between Jack and him were done well and Barbossa was able to be the same Captain Barbossa I know and love. A very well done sub plot of Carina being his daughter, the clear anguish he showed for knowing but not telling, and him never fully admitting he was her father by telling her his tattoo of Carina it meant treasure.<br/><br/>Even though the pacing was well done, there were a few scenes that were needed to move the plot forward, but they felt empty; such as when Jack almost being forced to Pig Kelly's sister. Not only did it seem like we should recognize the characters, and we didn't, it was only used to get Back and Barbossa together and bring back the Pearl. <br/><br/>The Ugly: The sea battles with cannons and boat invasions were very boring; especially because Salazar and his crew were ghosts so there was nothing that could be done in any type of defense.<br/><br/>They used a lot of boat coming out from being submerged... A lot. It is a very cool effect, but when done excessively it makes the events boring and painstakingly long to endure.<br/><br/>There are more characters I can count that show up that are apparently very important, given a nice amount of screen time, but no explanation of really who they are and why they're doing what they are. It's not like an unimportant bar tender who takes Jack's compass who doesn't reappear throughout the film.<br/><br/>Also, Jack giving his compass up for a drink felt so unlike Captain Jack Sparrow. I understand it was more to have Henry find Jack and seeing that he isn't the pirate he thought of; but a character as established of Jack shouldn't have changed so drastically.<br/><br/>There are a few times of lines being repeated throughout the film that were more cringe worthy than funny or awe inspiring. Finally, the death of Barbossa felt so rushed. Yes, he saved himself to save his daughter, but someone as big and very well known as Barbossa should have been a bigger, longer, heart breaking, and meaningful death. And Jack's line of ""Pirates life Hector..."" didn't come off as sincere as it should have. <br/><br/>Finally the conclusion, although heart warming of Will coming home, greeting Henry in a very fatherly hasn't seen son in a long time fashion, to Elizabeth showing up and him running to her; forgetting Henry even existed. I loved the Elizabeth cameo; however they could have extended the scene a little more to not only truly build the father/son bonding, but the suspense of thinking of A. Will Elizabeth make a cameo or B. Did something happen to Elizabeth?<br/><br/>The Verdict: Dead Men Tell No Tales does a superior job on introducing new Characters and developing them into lovable characters before the film's closure. Again, it takes you on a seafaring adventure you'll be happy to watch a second time. A few Pirates veterans had major character changes before the film even started, so it actually was weird to see them turn back into themselves. But the movie has the pacing, characters, story, and cameo's to make it my 2nd favorite Pirates movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Setting aside the impressive inflated-budget visuals, Pirates 5 is full of wasted potential. There's flat new characters, a lazy attempt at a Dumbledore-esque character exit, and Depp at his most unlikeable and distant than ever. SIDE RANT: Literally every moment of tension in this movie was threatening Jack Sparrow's plot armor. Need to buy the film time? Throw Sparrow's drunken stupor literal inches from the blade of a guillotine, or on the gallows, or in front of a cannon while the other characters save him.

","Review: This is another one of those movies which look great but failed to entertain. The main problem with the film is that the storyline is all over the place, and the 2 new characters, Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) and Kaya Scodelraio (Carina Smyth) wasn't that great. It was good to see the old cast back, especially Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but there was too much happening at once. Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) was a decent addition to the cast but the director went a bit overboard with the CGI on the ghost pirates. Anyway, Captain Salazar escapes the Devil's Triangle, with his crew, and is searching for pirates to kill them, including Jack Sparrow. The only way that Jack can survive, is to get the Trident of Poseidon, which will give him the power to control the seas. With the help of Carina, who is an astronomer and horologist, who believes her father wanted her to find the Trident, and Henry, who believes that he can free his dad if be found the mythical object, they set out on the tough mission, whilst fighting against various baddies who are trying to stop them in there tracks. There are many other elements to the movie, which I haven't mentioned but it's way too confusing to write then down. In terms of scale, the movie is extremely epic, and you can see why they needed such a huge budget to pull this off but the storyline was all over the place, and the action scenes were pretty messy. With that aside, the wit from Johnny Depp was top form and the banter with his old crew was enjoyable but I missed Bloom & Knightley, who made a weird appearance towards the end. Anyway, I personally can't see myself watching this movie again in a hurry but I'm sure I'll enjoy it more if I watched all of the movies back to back. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by Joachim Ronnie and Espen Sandberg, who also brought you Bandidas starring Penelope Cruz and Salma Hayek. With there lack of experience behind the camera, I'm surprised that they took on such a huge project, which has been a successful franchise up to now but judging by the profit at the box office, I'm sure the studios we're happy with the outcome. Compared to the other Pirates movies, I didn't feel a big buzz around this movie, and it seemed to leave people's minds quite quickly. The clip after the credits left the movie right open, so I'm sure we're going to see another movie in this franchise but it seems like the concept has hit a bit of a brick wall. I won't be rushing to the cinema to see another Pirates movie but I can understand why families will.<br/><br/>Budget: $230million Worldwide Gross: $795million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies, starring Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Geoffrey Rush, Brenton Thwaites, David Wenham, Stephen Graham, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Paul McCartney, Kaya Scodelario and Kevin McNally. 5/10"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales<br/><br/>Historically, pirates buried their fortunes in the holes of the nearest whorehouse.<br/><br/>Real items of value, as confirmed by this adventure/fantasy, were hidden.<br/><br/>To free his captive father (Orlando Bloom) from the Flying Dutchman's curse, Henry (Brenton Thwaites) must obtain Poseidon's Trident.

However that distinction doesn't mean that it's still not a bloated rehash of plot points with a derivative villain and a worn-out hero.<br/><br/>Incidentally, it's more lucrative for pirates today to hijack a Backstreet Boy cruise ship. <br/><br/>Yellow Light<br/><br/>vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"

"johnplocar","5","0","3","24 September 2017"," Same old crap, another 'Pirates' sequel.
","Wow that was so...umm...honestly, I forgot what I just saw. It was so forgettable. It blends in with everything I've already seen so many times in the last four movies. Look, I liked the first film from 2003; I find it to be a very fun and entertaining flick. Even the second movie I enjoyed, not as much as the first but I still thought it was fun enough. Then every installment since the third has been more or less the same crap now. Taking what was cool and exciting in the first two movies and recycling the hell out of them with an over abundance of characters, convoluted plot lines and a convenient series of events that lead the action sequences along. By the fifth time of seeing it all yet again, I'm just done. These movies have completely stopped giving me a reason to care at this point. Not even Johnny Depp seems to care anymore, yet he's basically supposed to be the driving force with these movies. But you can just tell that his heart is not in it anymore. The look in his eyes screams, ""Alright, I'll do it but if that check doesn't clear I swear to God..."".<br/><br/>These later sequels, including this one, I can't say are terrible or even all that bad by any means. However, they are wildly unambitious being comprised of everything we have seen several times before in the previous installments of the franchise. The series has simply run out of steam. Why the studios insist on pursuing more sequels now is unbeknownst to me. Aside from simply being unnecessary and forgettable, there are some legitimate issues I have with the film. Such as, like I had mentioned before, too many characters. Pointless characters at that. There are whole character arcs and subplots that are introduced only to be dropped right smack dab in the middle of the film, making it a total waste of my time since there was no satisfying conclusion or payoff in any way. The acting, for the most part, is fine. Although no one stands out or even seems to be giving this movie much effort at all, especially Depp as I had said earlier. Javier Bardem does seem to be having a bit of fun as the baddie, but that's far from coming close to carrying this movie at all. There is a replacement type character that is basically a stand-in for Orlando Bloom, Brenton Thwaites, who plays Will Turner's son. And Thwaites is...awful. This is the second movie I've seen try to force him into being an action lead and it does not work at all. He has zero chemistry with everyone on screen, including what time he shares with his ""love interest"". I mean, seriously, I believe a block of wood holds more charisma than this guy. He seems to be typecast as the pretty boy bad ass, but he's not bad ass and his character is so incompetent and honestly relatively pointless to have been included in the story in the grand scheme of things. I am not joking, if he was cut from this script, the story would almost be no different. A few easy rewrites and he could be entirely vanished from this movie without a single trace.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me was that characters seemed to just be able to get exactly where they need to be without any explanation whatsoever in order for the plot to continue. We'll get entire pointless character introductions to characters that will only cease to be in the film by the halfway mark, but God forbid we get an actual explanation as to how the villains somehow always seem to navigate as to where the protagonists are; among other slight nagging plot holes and anachronisms.<br/><br/>If I have any positives to say about this movie...85% of the effects are solid. There is a bit of awkward green screening and Javier Bardem's hair...yeah, why did that need to be CGI? Whatever. Umm...let's see, what else can I say is decent about the movie? It wasn't nearly three hours long. I will give this movie a little bit of an edge over the last couple of sequels because this sticks closer to only being about two hours long rather than pushing the screen time to suck up as many hours out of the day as possible. In that regard, this is probably the best sequel since the second film...maybe. Other than that, this movie is stale. It's a series that is trying so hard to keep on trucking, but this bitch is long dead.<br/><br/>I suppose if you're a big fan of all the other movies and you're curious then I guess this movie is fine to check out on Netflix or a cheap rental. Like I said, it's technically not a bad movie, it will be something you can watch and pay little mind to I guess if you want to try to pass the time. But at the same time, there are so many better options if you're in that sort of situation so I really don't see this movie being all that necessary. Just watch the first movie again if you want to watch a Pirates adventure; that's a hundred times better than putting this on. Granted, I doubt you'll be mad or hate having spent five bucks to rent this if you chose to, but what would be the point when you have four other movies that do the exact same thing as this movie. Two of which do those things in an actual lively and energized way. So in my opinion, you can probably skip this one and be just fine."

","Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) has searched all his life for Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the Trident of Poseidon to free his father Will Turner.

The trio is pursued by Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem) who escaped from the Devil's Triangle which a young Sparrow put him in. Salazar finds Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and destroys his fleet.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted and incomprehensible. The action is bloated and chaotic. Of course, this is a Pirates movie. None of that is surprising. I'm actually surprised that I stayed with this one for a long time. Carina is a feminist in the way that SJW is actually an apt description. It's rather annoying. Thwaites lacks charisma as the young lead and is overwhelmed by the screen. Johnny Depp is less outrageous which is both good and bad. When he's crazy, there's something to point to. I like the guillotine action scene and Salazar's flashback to his Sparrow encounter. Otherwise, everything else is either a muddle or an unlikable watch. This franchise may be unsalvagable."

"CountJonnie","5","0","2","18 September 2017"," Jack Sparrow, nothing more than a gimmick
","PotC 1 was a unique movie that took cinema by storm. The adventurous tales, the overacting and the atmosphere made the movie a delight for old, and also for young, even with the horror elements. Depp's phenomenal acting combined with the fairy tale feeling of the movie made it a delight for us all.<br/><br/>The sequels proved that even a unique feeling will suffer when the underlying script or motivations are messy, and PotC drowned (or should've drowned) after part 3. Somehow a life raft saved what became On Stranger Tides. Maybe Jack Sparrow has 9 lives as long as he was cursed to do standalone movies, that escaped from the complexity that killed part 2 and 3 from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Alas, Salazar's Revenge offered none of what On Stranger Tides delivered. After a moody and atmospheric opening with links to open ties from the trilogy we (too soon) get to know Salazar who is a ghostly adversary, locked away from land. Nothing wrong with Javier Bardem's acting, but his introduction and later the ""escape"" of Salazar, take away anything that was threatening or frightening.<br/><br/>A little later, Jack Sparrow enters the scene, which reminds us of every reason to not let this series continue. Funny as Depp is, with perfect comedic timing, Sparrow has become nothing more than a background gimmick who has no reason to be on screen any moment during the film and has become a parody of the brilliance and subtle genius of comedic stars like Buster Keaton. Halfway the movie you'll have forgotten that Bardem and Depp should've been the main focus. No charm, no charisma, no masterful screen presence.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor is that at the end, they tie a loose end from the trilogy in a feel good way. But even that is ruined with a post credits scene that suggests that more is to come, for no reason or explanation. PotC has become like Transformers: fillers for cinemas."

","It's watchable in a mild sort of way. It's not terrible. There's just too many problems.<br/><br/>1. The elephant in the room is that the dialog is really bland. I was getting into it until there's a part near the beginning(not a spoiler) where this kid drops a bunch of leaflets for Jack sparrows capture, This prisoner picks one up and says in the most monotone line ever ""Jack sparrow. Hes dead buried on"" etc etc. Not in a mischievous or or foretelling way just ""hey jacks at such and such"". There's slick line in Deadpool where this bartender says ""You should go see want he wants..might further the plot."". It's meant as an in joke. However thats 90% of the lines in this movie. There's a very occasional quip but most of the lines are people saying lines indicating whatever furthers the plot. Worse in some cases even the delivery is phoned in. Thats a directorial problem.<br/><br/>2. It's too much again. There's a villain a maguffin and about 5 or 6 nonsense subplots. It's tiresome and they work they put into tying up each one takes way too long.<br/><br/>3. The villain wasn't empathetic or interesting or even fun. The first film was a pretty fun, straight forward ordeal and the villain was likable. In the last two watchable ones, The dads plight emotional and Davy Jones was well done and empathetic. This one has an angry ghost who's a jerk with a yawner backstory. He was well acted just boring. This leaves the entire enterprise lacking in that Epic tone the original trilogy was going for. The whole thing reeks of people being paid to make a movie and there's no soul to it.<br/><br/>All that said it's watchable. The acting is mostly fine and the special effects are nice. It also moves a nice clip. I remember the 4th film losing me at this chase scene early on that goes on for like 10 minutes with no payoff. If I watched the rest of it I can't even remember. This one I suspect I'll at least be recall the major points a year from now.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this if you've sincerely run out of things to watch and are at least a couple beers in."

Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is always excellent, and I'm not just saying that because he is my favorite actor, but all petrels of each main character is thought out and they add to the storyline. However, this movie is more for the kids, and reaches a more comedic role due to random shout outs and occasional crazy circumstances that only Jack himself can get into. And of course, The return of the original cast will make any pirate fan excited. In this movie, you grow with the characters as it progresses. The effects are top notch and really spectacular. They make the movie seem more real and I'm sure we all would like to see, yet stay very far away from, burning ghostly pirates and dead swimming sharks that come back to life when they hit water. All in all a great 5th Film in the franchise, and I hope they follow through by making more. After all, it may happen...

Let's face it, both films are trying to capitalize on our love for the original by evoking its spirit with familiar story beats -- two star-crossed love birds, another undead CG army, a plot to seek out a McGuffin treasure of sorts - except Pirates 5 captures that spirit while still adding something new to this installment. Clearly, Carina and Henry were designed to evoke Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, but the actors do such a good job of winning you over that you stop making the comparisons. Of the two, Kaya Scodelario is the breakout star. She's beautiful, charming, feisty, intelligent and has all the qualities you want in a strong heroine lead. Pirates 5 also feels like a course-correction, learning from past mistakes - no more convoluted plot and bloated runtime!<br/><br/>But what about Jack Sparrow? Alas, this movie isn't perfect, and Sparrow isn't the same swashbuckling anti-hero, instead he's become a bit of a buffoon who gets away with sheer luck rather than wit. But none of this matters coz you'll be too busy marvelling at the inventive action sequences of which Sparrow still gets to do lotsa cool stuff, including a flashback scene where he reminds you why he's the badass, iconic character of the franchise. Not to mention the movie has an incredibly heartfelt ending that is emotionally satisfying for the fans of the franchise, of which there are still many :) Here is a film that finally rewards their loyalty."

","This movie is very simple. The topic sucks. This movie did not suit Caribbean. After the first three films, the series broke down. When they want to fix it, they fail even more. Only the effects are not enough for a movie. However, the only success of the movie fiasco is the perfection in the effects."
"kastenmeier-andreas","6","0","3","22 July 2017"," Same Procedure as Every Year
","To start with the conclusion: There is nothing wrong with ""Dead Man Tell No Tales"", but it feels like every other ""Pirates of the Caribean"" movie. Johnny Depp acts silly, there is a young couple which is constantly fighting but secretly in love, there is rivalry with Captain Barbossa, there is also an army ship searching for them and they are all chased by an evil ghost ship and it's ghost crew. You'll probably guessed it, all of them are chasing a mysterious artifact and that's about it with storytelling.<br/><br/>Yeah, everybody is acting good especially Javier Bardem, but all characters are kind of one dimensional. I hated the character of Kaya Scodelario, even though she is very likable and beautiful. It's not her fault. The writers gave her exactly two characteristics: She is smart and she has boobs. The First one is mentioned and used as a joke way to often and for the latter, there are a way too much scenes focusing on her cleavage. Even the male me, was annoyed by that and kind of sad for Kaya Scodelario. This woman is capable of much more than they gave her.<br/><br/>To be fair, all of the action sequences where great looking and creativity went into them. If you liked the other movies of this franchise, you'll probably love this. If you don't watch it for pure dumb enjoyment or skip it."

","Pirates Of The Caribbean is my favorite franchise, and seeing this movie made me realize that Disney has to stop making Pirate movies, the last two movies felt like a side story, it just doesn't feel important.<br/><br/>Story: 7/10<br/><br/>The story begins with captain Salazar chasing Jack Sparrow, but he fails, and his crew, and his ship gets destroyed, and their cursed, the movie doesn't explain why their cursed which is confusing. Salazar then chases Jack for some odd reason, and Will Turner's son is looking for Poseidon's Trident that removes all curses. Then theirs Carina who is just there to fill in some plot holes, and she has an unnecessary sub plot. The biggest issue with the story is that there is too many sub plots.<br/><br/>Characters: 6/10<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow: Jack doesn't feel important, he's just there because it's a pirates movie, and because he sets up the bad guy.<br/><br/>Salazar: Salazar is a good bad guy, he has an unexplained stupid reason why he hates Jack Sparrow, but he is a believable bad guy.<br/><br/>Barbossa: Barbossa is in the story not for the trident, but for Carina's sub plot, he is just so unnecessary.<br/><br/>Henry Turner: Henry I would say is the most important character, he's the reason why everyone is going for the Trident besides Jack's reason.<br/><br/>Carina: Carina is the navigator, she has a stupid sub plot, and as I said before she's just there for the plot holes.<br/><br/>Action: 5/10<br/><br/>Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't have that Pirates action, it doesn't have any crazy sword fights like in the first three pirates movies, most of the action is either ships fighting, and running away from things.<br/><br/>Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't feel right, Jack isn't the same, there's no epic sword fights, and the characters feel like replacements for the old crew. Now Pirates movies is slowly losing it's magic, Disney should stop making Pirates movies, and focus on other things."

"chilichilipepper","6","0","2","15 June 2017"," An Honest Review.
","Really, there's enough reviews out there for people to get the general idea of the film. It has a very clichÃ©d plot, the action scenes are non stop (and feature some AMAZING CGI), the overlying story is basically just like someone took #1-3 and put them in a blender, while using #4 as the ""wacky adventures of Jack Sparrow"" due to the lost cast of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly (which both get extremely short cameos rather than roles)<br/><br/>However, the one thing I want to add, is that this movie is a HARD PG-13. My sister had to take my 12 year old nephew home because of the violence (sure, no blood, but ""water droplets instead"" and a flopping arm on the ground is pretty gruesome.)<br/><br/>So if you have kids that are scared of violence, be careful when taking them. Just because the ""blood"" is replaced with ""water"" doesn't mean that a 10-14 year old won't realize that someone lost an arm, got decapitated, or got eaten by a ghost shark.<br/><br/>All in all, the worst of the Pirates movies, but still extremely entertaining. I have to give this one a 6 due to them just rehashing a mix of the first 3, with Johnny Depp doing his Sparrow bit the whole movie, and especially because there were violent acts that substituted sparkles (for ghosts) and water for blood. With Adobe, I could color all of those ""water splashes"" red and this would be an R rated movie. So again, probably the worst POTC movie, but still an entertaining movie. Just make sure your children are ready for some extreme violence hidden under ""WE NEED TO GET PG-13!!!!"" mentality."

","It is not often that a blockbuster movie is shorter than the title of it, but this is one of those cases. I did appreciate that the run time of this movie is only around two hours, but at some points it still felt a little too long. There are moments in Hollywood, although I would describe them more like seasons or phases, where they decided to franchise absolutely everything and reboot the failures and bring old TV shows back as movies and cater to this nostalgia that everyone is currently feeling because they hate the current world they live in. This can be seen in movies like Baywatch, the upcoming Scarface, Smurfs, etc. To be honest, almost every movie that has come out so far this year has been a remake, reboot, sequel or adaption from a TV show or book. Don't believe me?<br/><br/>Guardians 2, Logan, John Wick 2, King Arthur, King Kong, Lego Batman, Alien: Covenant, Beauty and the Beast, Power Rangers, Ghost in the Shell, Fate of the Furious, Fifty Shades Darker, XXX: Return of Xander Cage (who the hell is Xander Cage), Smurfs, Underworld, Resident Evil, Chips, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Trainspotting, and probably more. I got all of those off of Box Office Mojo and honestly, there are more of those than original movies released so far this year and it isn't going to end, almost every week until August has at least one more remake or sequel being released. Oh also Pirates.<br/><br/>Pirates, much like many of the above movies (except for the first four), was decent, but didn't need to happen. I think soon (dear God please) people will just be fed up and stop going to these movies. It is starting to happen as many of those listed above did not do well at the box office or review wise. I remember when I first saw the first pirates movie and I fell in love. I had the DVD, I had the book, I didn't have anything else because I wasn't that crazy about it, but you get my point. It was a fresh movie and an outstanding performance by John Depp. The second movie was just as good and the third I can even say I really liked. Then the fourth came out and I thought to myself, that's enough. Now we are here on the fifth movie and after it was over I was no better than when I entered the theater. I actually was worse off because I had three fillings, not cavity related, just an hour before so my mouth was numb but by the end of the movie that sensation went away and a new one arose which was the numbness in my brain. <br/><br/>How many times do I have to see Jack Sparrrrrrrrrow (that's my Javier Bardem impression) get drunk and do his classic fast wake up from sleep? How many times do the pirates of the I don't care a bean about them have to tell really bad jokes? Why couldn't the movie just focus on the new characters instead of relying on the nostalgia of Sparrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrow. I'll tell you why, because John Depp is in massive amounts of debt and needed some cash money to buy more wine. <br/><br/>Look, it wasn't a terrible movie. If you like the other pirate movies then go see this one! I didn't not enjoy it, I just didn't exactly love it as much as I wanted to. It was a nice two hour vacation to the beach with some cool special effects and great performances, except for Johnny who at most parts just seemed like he was phoning in his past performances and literally is nothing more than the catalyst to bring all the other characters together. Take your scurvy mate to see this movie, take your crew, take your captain, but I might walk the plank before I see it again. OK I wouldn't walk the plank, I'd rather live with a repeat viewing than be dead at the bottom of the ocean, but you get what I mean."

"jaredpahl","5","0","2","5 June 2017"," Dead Men Tell No Tales Botches the Attempt to Recapture Pirates Magic
","I walked out of the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Dead Men Tell No Tales, deflated. I did not expect the movie to stand toe-to-toe with Gore Verbinski's trilogy, but my hopes were high for something of a return to what made the series such a big hit in the 2000s. Dead Men Tell No Tales does try to rekindle some impression of the classic trilogy, but it trips up areas that every other chapter thrived in. The new directors, Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg, bring daffy energy to the film, but fumble the action set-pieces the series is known for. The new villains are inspired, but the old hero is botched. The script revives lingering plot threads, but doesn't understand why droves of people fell in love with the series to begin with. I'm such a big fan of this series' brand of swashbuckling adventure that I was willing to forgive plenty of the film's many clunky creative decisions, but by the end of Pirates 5, I left feeling that maybe dead men are better off telling no tales at all.<br/><br/>Unlike On Stranger Tides, which took pains to separate itself from Verbinski Trilogy, Dead Men Tell No Tales tries to plug back into the history of the first three films. The driving force of the plot is Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites) who must locate The Trident of Poseidon to free his father from the Flying Dutchman. Suffice to say, each camp, including Captain Jack's gang and Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar and his frightening ghost crew, want the trident for their own reasons. Salazar is after Jack Sparrow (AKA ""Jas-berrrrow"") for revenge after Sparrow killed his entire crew in a battle at sea. That battle is recalled in a neat flashback scene starring a convincingly de-aged Johnny Depp. For what it's worth, the new curses and myths within the story seem like they come from the same DNA as Pirates 1-3.<br/><br/>Some characters also return from At World's End, but let's not pretend that means anything. It's just nice to see familiar faces. The new faces, as was the case in On Stranger Tides, are dull. Henry serves his purpose and connects the film to the earlier Pirates films, and Bardem's Salazar is a frightening villain, well designed and creepy. But on the other end of the spectrum is Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), an astronomer who holds the key to the location of this trident everyone is talking about. She is a black spot on the cast; a blatant attempt at cashing in on the ""strong, independent woman"" trend. She's a girl-power gimmick. I hated her in her first half minute on screen, and things never got better. The good news is, she gets lost among the droning staleness of the rest of the large cast. <br/><br/>And what about the man of the hour, ol' Captain Jack? How does Johnny Depp fare in this fifth go around as Jack Sparrow? Badly, I'm afraid. Here's where things get ugly. Jack Sparrow, who for four movies added an eccentric spark to the series' adventures, now comes close to actually subtracting from the story. Where Captain Jack was once a charismatic trickster, he is now a complete and utter buffoon. Johnny Depp plays Jack drunker, higher-pitched, and leagues dumber than ever before. It's like the original, Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow got kicked in the head by a horse. I can blame Depp for a lot of the problems with Jack Sparrow, but it's certainly not his fault that every situation he finds himself in is written for laughs. 'Dead Men' is the first Pirates movie without writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott, and I believe the script is worse for it. Jeff Nathanson doesn't seem to understand how to use Jack Sparrow. He worked so well in the first three movies because he was a lovable scoundrel; charismatic and unpredictable, yes, but always a step ahead of the game. Captain Jack was a clever son-of-a-gun, not a clown. In Dead Men Tell No Tales, his dial is perpetually set to ""goofball"". Yeah, he's funny, and Depp is a fine comedic actor, but Jack Sparrow is one of the most iconic characters in cinema history for reasons beyond conjuring laughs.<br/><br/>The directors Sandberg and Rønning are not in the same class as the swashbuckling maestro Gore Verbinski. They even struggle to match Rob Marshall's average work in On Stranger Tides. At least Marshall kept things clean. Sandberg and Rønning do a sloppy job with the big set-pieces. There are moments of fun on land or in the big ship vs ship battles, yet the action scenes often fall into traps that the franchise had managed to avoid for 14 years. Almost every action scene suffers from choppy editing, and there are times when the lighting gets so murky that scenes become incomprehensible. Rob Marshall's action scenes may have been tepid, but they were basically fun. The action scenes here are frustrating. A long, long way from the rousing excitement of the Verbinski movies.<br/><br/>For Pirates fans like myself, Dead Men Tell No Tales promised a welcome bit of adventuring, with a story that returns to the same threads we left in 2007. It could have worked, but this movie has major problems, some of which teeter on fatal. Its too juvenile for its own good, Johnny Depp leans way too far into goofy slapstick, and the directors struggle to find their footing in this universe. I like adventure movies, and in these cynical times, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales does provide a wholesome (In a PG-13 sort of way) bout of summer escapism. Still, even for those of us who love this franchise, Pirates 5 made me wish these dead men would have stopped telling tales at 4.<br/><br/>55/100"

","Dead Men is the fifth(!) movie based on a plot less 1960s theme park ride. Only Disney would have the cojones to get away with something so (frankly) stupid. Despite all odds, the first film was a critical and cultural behemoth, entertainingly combining fantasy lore, swashbuckling action and refreshing silliness. From there, everything became overly convoluted, & then completely pointless, until this latest seafaring adventure. Not that Dead Men will be confused for great, but it returns Jack Sparrow back to the cool set-pieces, broad laughs and series nostalgia that made it passably diverting. Dead Men opens with a high energy chase. Captain Jack and his band of bootleggers have stolen an entire bank building and are dragging it through a colorful old town. Later on, there's another center-piece escape scene, with Jack using the guillotine shackles he's stuck in to ward off the enemy. It's peppered with Buster-Keaton-Jackie-Chan-esque CG stunts, captured within a story about a cursed crew and a family reunited. It marries past characters and stories to present woes, and rarely strays off its predetermined course. The straight-forward plotting gives plenty of room for Depp to quip and waddle like we want. Unfortunately, it also gives room for the movie to slow down for another charisma-less romance between two unknown, charmless model-actors. In these moments, and the many others that scream of corn and cheese, the 129-minute length started to feel much longer and even made me almost doze off. So do I actually like this because it's ""good"", or am I just reacting to the unfairly terrible reviews and its preceding sequels? Oh well; just drink up, me 'earties and enjoy this slice of pirate life."
"srdjan_veljkovic","6","0","4","1 June 2017"," Good start, good end and so-so in between
","It's different than the other PotC movies. Action scenes are less grandiose and less engaging. Jack Sparrow is old and fat. It's not so fun or funny, except at the start and end (and some moments in between). But, that could have created something interesting. It, mostly, didn't.<br/><br/>I guess the biggest problem of this movie is that the ""there's an undead crew hunting Jack Sparrow to settle his debt"" story was already seen, a little differently, sure, but, basically, already seen. So, it's not interesting. Maybe, had that been avoided, and something else made the ""problem"" for young Henry saving his father, things would have been different.<br/><br/>While the young pair works better than in PotC4, and, thankfully, we don't have Penelope back or some replacement thereof, that's not enough and they don't mesh well with this fat&old Jack. They have a few moments, but pretty much all of them made it into the trailers.<br/><br/>Barbosa and the new villain, Salazar, are the biggest disappointment. Beside being the critics darlings, for some reason I can't fathom, they are uninteresting, and, for Barbosa, out-of-character. I mean, sure, he's older, too, but, while Jack is still the same man under all that fat and rum, Barbosa seems like some totally different character. Bardem somehow manages to make Salazar be interesting for ~30 seconds. After that, he didn't have to show up, really, just talking about him would have been enough (and actually worked better).<br/><br/>This was obviously made to be a potential end of the series. It would be bad if it were so. There is a room for one final ride that would be fun and funny like the first one, but, a different movie and this could be a good transition to it."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Entertaining but predictable, one need not jump ship on this film series...yet!<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Supernatural forces again plague Captain Jack Sparrow on his 6th voyage to misadventures.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: In the sixth installment of this profitable film franchise, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, the McGuffin of its treasure hunt, besides trying to locate a good idea in its overly busy script, is a mysterious object called The Trident of Poseidon, which can undo any curse. A fine premise, but all this movie really does is undo any logical sense in a convoluted ho-hum plot. It's a series of fun-filled mishaps (with some fun) that involve our pirate anti-hero once again, namely Captain Jack Sparrow. Played by Johnny Depp, his role is more of the same...drunken stupor and slurred diction with comic pratfalls. Mr. Depp's colorful character is losing some of the charm in a performance that once was imbued with a twinkle of wit, a major asset in previous installments. But it is still diverting enough to entertain.<br/><br/>Pursuing Capt. Jack on this voyage are a ship of ghouls, led by a vengeful walking dead Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem). Mr. Bardem's interpretation of this worthy foe saves this sinking ship. That, and the excellent CGI of a ghostly crew from the netherworld with assorted animated zombie-like sharks and birds help to make this nonsense more tolerable than it need be.<br/><br/>Also back on board is Geoffrey Rush as the crafty Barbossa, who delivers some nice moments along with Kaya Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites as the young lovers (substituting for the aging Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, and minus their star power).<br/><br/>The film retains strong production values that one has seen and expected from this big budget series. Even if the direction by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandburg is serviceable, and at times, rather inventive, the script by Jeff Nathanson (Four other screenwriters are credited with the story.) is just too formulaic and predictable. What was once an imaginative jaunt, especially on its first two adventures, is now become slightly tedious and monotonous in its execution. The action, which is non-stop, has an unfocused look, both in its plot and photography by Paul Cameron. Sometimes the film relies on too many close-ups which undercuts the action and its action sequences need some editing and better staging. (A couple of major rewrites wouldn't have hurt either.)<br/><br/>Back in 2003, the original film was the result of a popular ride at Disney World and it gave the movie-going audience a wonderful adrenaline rush. This latest reincarnation resembles a frenzied loud cinematic ride, an apparition of its former self that only tires and rarely inspires. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales may still have interesting tales to tell. But on this voyage, the story telling needed to follow a better course."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) Starring: Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem, Brenton Thwaites, Kaya Scodelario, Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, Stephen Graham, Martin Klebba, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley Directed By: Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg Review Back when I saw the first Pirates of The Caribbean movie with my family in our home I had a lot of fun watching, it was adventurous, the sword fights were plenty ( I love love love love love sword fighting) and shot really good but since then the series has gone completely downhill. Captain Jack Sparrow is pursued by an old rival, Captain Salazar, who along with his crew of ghost pirates has escaped from the Devil's Triangle, and is determined to kill every pirate at sea. Jack seeks the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact that grants its possessor total control over the seas, in order to defeat Salazar. When I saw the opening sequence which is Henry Turner going to The Flying Dutchman to see his father Will Turner played once again by Orlando Bloom I knew the ending of the movie. The main reason I think they keep making movies is not because it makes money but also because of Jack. Who in the first movie was really cool, he's lost his coolness since then. I mean he looks like a drag queen or something and is like the worst pirate in the beginning of the movie, I mean he steals nothing, isn't adventurous and not once does he go like to Salazar Oh now I remember you. Everyone else I liked in the movie like Barbossa is a lot more interesting when you find something out later in the movie. Henry Turner he has cool like quest to get his father back, Carina is known as witch because of how smart she is all of these characters where way more cooler than Jack. The action wasn't all that great either I mean it was just lame. There were barley next no sword fights. Which was very disappointing. Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Pirates movie since the original but that doesn't make it entirely good movie. It is fun on times and the acting is pretty good with interesting characters but hopefully the next Pirates is the last Pirates, I'm giving Dead Men Tell No Tales a three out of five."

","This is by far not the best movie ever, but it is still very enjoyable. There is a lot of humor and fun seafaring adventures. The mythology is interesting, but not as awesome as the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". You can tell that Johnny Depp is getting older and has done the same gimmick several times, but (SPOILER ALERT) seeing the backstory of a rivalry between two characters and the return of beloved actors from the original franchise makes this movie a satisfying conclusion to the series."

","Nearly 15 years since the first pirates movie back in 2003, jack sparrow is back with a. New adventure. After the mixed reception that was on stranger tides, Jack is looking for the trident of Poseidon which allows the one who wields it the control of the seas.it could prove to be rather helpful towards Jack especially when his old enemy captain Salazar who he trapped in the Devil's Triangle wants revenge against his old foe. I will say it was great to see will turner and Elizabeth swan again after their absence in the fourth film. It helps the plot is more straight forward and enjoyable."
"shanerittersbach","10","0","7","28 May 2017"," Good Tales Be Told By Dead Men
","After the ordeal of On Stranger Tides comes a sequel that sets sails in a truly amazing and beautiful fashion.<br/><br/>THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>First off the film is a great send up compared to the weakest link in the series, On Stranger Tides. The cast, effects, and story line are great. The film as a whole is amazing. <br/><br/>Once again we get Johnny Depp as the ever funny and intoxicated Captain Jack Sparrow. His performance is hilariously outrageous. He is very good and funny within the film. Unlike his performance in Stranger Tides his acting a characterization of the titular captain seems to have great passion and not the feeling of a called in performance. <br/><br/>Again my personal favorite character returns to the 5th film is Geoffrey Rush as the amazingly interesting Captain Hector Barbossa. Within the Hector still rides high as the captain at the helm of the Queen Ann's Revenge. When we meet up with him in the film he has become very wealthy and rich from trade and knocking off ships. He then joins a false alliance with the films hardcore villain, Captain Salazar. Rush's performance as the titular captain is great and very touching. A sad note for many including me is that this is barbossa's last appearance in the series. He dies towards the end of the film, in a very courageous and brave manor, trying to save his long lost daughter Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.<br/><br/>Next We get are new villain, Captain Salazar, played by Javier Bardem. Bardem's performance as the tortured Captain Salazar is one for the ages. His performance is gut renchingly creepy and at the same time sympathetic in a dark sort of way. His story goes like this, he was a might Spanish general who hunted and killed thousands of pirates across the sea. During one of his showdowns he was confronted by a very young (Thanks to great CGI) Jack Sparrow. He is then tricked by Jack and his ship is sent into the Devil's Triangle where he and his crew are cursed to stay forever, or at least until Jack screws up and let's them free.<br/><br/>Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan return for a very brief time span in this entry but their presence is very well known. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return as their titular characters from the previous installments. Will, now five years after 16 years after he became the captain of the Flying Dutchman is covered in barnacles and coral, still not as bad as old fish face, Davy Jones. Keira Knightley shows up towards the climax of the movie where here and will can finally reunite again after the trident of Poseidon is broken and all of the curses in the see are destroyed. Though they are in the film for a very brief time frame their presence is quite uplifting and good, a true treat would be to see them have bigger roles in up incoming installments. <br/><br/>Are new characters are Brendan thwaites and of course Kaya Scodelario as the two young leads of the film. Thwaite's plays Henry Turner, the son of Will and Elizabeth, who in the film is sixteen. Within the film, he wants to free his father from the dreaded curse of being bound to the Dutchman. In doing so he needs the trident of Poseidon. Thwaite's plays Henry in a very natural way. He seems in place in the film and does a very good job. Then we have Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smith. Smith is a women of science. She believes in the simple and factual way of life. Later in the film we learn that she is the daughter of Barbossa, who had her at a very young age along time ago. Their relationship, Geoffrey Rush's and Kaya Scodelario's is very sweet and subtle. through the film you can feel Barbossa's pain of knowing who his daughter is and her not knowing who her father is. Scodelario plays Carina superbly and is one the new standout performances. <br/><br/>On a minor charter level we have a new British antagonist, General Scarfeild played by the brilliant and underrated Australian actor David Whenham. Though in the film for a short period, Scarfeild is an interesting charter and chews the scenes he is in. Another new charter is the films new voodoo witch played by Golihifteh Farahani. In the film she is the friend of Barbossa and give him valuable information. She is creepy and interesting as her character. <br/><br/>From a film making stand point, the film looks great. The colors in the film are magnificent, the ships and sea faring parts are extraordinary, and the special effects are freaking amazing, Salazar and his crew are beautiful in a creepy dead rotted pirate way. The two new directors did a very good job, way better then Rob Marshall directing On Stranger Tides. <br/><br/>On an overall look, Pirate of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell no Tales is an amazing film. The acting is spectacular. The Visuals are splendid and the story is very impressive. I loved the film, my one complaint would be that Barbossa Dies. He was always my favorite character in the series, ever since i was three i always responded to his character. I admit it, i cried my ass off in the theater when he died. Really, i did, i was so distraught. Well, anyways, the film was a great fun-filled ride and i personally cant wait until the next one. <br/><br/>Rest in Peace Captain Barbossa, until we meet again!<br/><br/>Two-Peg legs up!"

So I will give Pirates Of The Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Pirates Of The Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge is worth seeing if you like the previous Pirates Of The Caribbean films, Hook, Pan, Peter Pan, Finding Neverland amongst others.

"bearmyne","Null","0","7","27 May 2017"," Great film.
","Loved it closed some stuff, left some stuff open. Really enjoyed the film. Some critics laughed t how Jack's compass all of a sudden gave him trouble. His first Cptain said "" Don't BETRAY the compass"". He never said don't give it too Will Turner, or Lord Cutler Beckett. In this film Jack gives it away for rum, and then Betrays the compass by saying, Oh a pirates tale. And it was what Salazar needed for his situation. The Trident released all the curses at that time. Salazar, Will Turner, Jack's misfortunes, etc. Davy Jones fell into the ocean in Worlds End, so yes he could still be alive, and the Trident reversed him back too his Dutchman ways.<br/><br/>having Will Turner back, and his son following his fathers steps in a journey too rid him of the Dutchman, was a nice touch, and a little emotional. Elizabeth Swann with Will was beautiful, bringing the original films together. Barbossa was incredible, and pulled and tugged the emotional strings with his daughter. But i loved how Jack's compass ties all the films, and whole story together."
"truongthh","7","0","6","27 May 2017"," Not bad
","To be honest, I did not want to see this movie because the last two were so boring and confusing. But Dead Man Tell No Tales was not as bad as I expected. In fact, it was better than the last two. The plot was good enough, though it did not really improve upon its predecessors . But it was not confusing. And there's a plot twist at about 2/3 of the movie. At first I thought that twist would not matter, but eventually became important to finish the film.(Not going to tell you). The visuals were stunning. I think this one has the best images of the 5 films. The ending scene was incredible. The worst part about this movie was probably character building. Jack and Salazar are supposed to be the main characters, but DMTNT focused entirely on Henry Turner and the scientist(Forgot her name).And the actor who played Henry just could not act. But who cares, the main actress(scientist) was so hot. In overall, POTC 5 was an entertaining film, and will be a suitable film to enjoy this weekend."

","I did not have much of expectation for the movie, as this is more of a teen/kids aimed movie. And i was surprised and i enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is great, Javier Bardem is amazing with very strong presence and all actors do their jobs perfectly. The movie continued to be funny in the same way as others without being ""too much"" of the same and it gets the right balance and Captain Jack Sparrow still have his charisma.<br/><br/>You have to have the right mindset for this movie, as it is about pirates, ships, battles, treasures, love, adventure, fun and effects and the movie offers plenty from everything it should have."
"stevendbeard","7","0","6","26 May 2017"," A Good Installment In The Franchise
","I saw ""Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales"", starring Johnny Depp-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Into the Woods; Javier Bardem-The Counsellor, Collateral; Geoffrey Rush-Gods of Egypt, Mystery Men; Brenton Thwaites-Gods of Egypt, Oculus and Kaya Scodelario-The Maze Runner movies, The Truth About Emanuel.<br/><br/>This is the 5th in the Pirates series and I must say, one of the better installments. It has Johnny returning as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey as Barbossa and then some newbies to the franchise. Javier is the pirate hunting villain, Brenton is the son of Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly- who both make small cameos-and Kaya is an adventurous young lady-who also has a family connection to another character but I won't spoil it for you here. In flashbacks, you get to see a young Johnny and why Javier is so obsessed with revenge on Johnny. The main plot involves everyone searching for the Trident of Poseidon, which is rumored to be able to break curses, among other things. The special effects are pretty amazing. Besides the ghosts-who look awesome-you have ghost sharks and ghost birds, too. If you remember from some of the previous movies, Keith Richards played Johnny's dad-However, he does not appear in this one. You do get to meet Johnny's uncle though, and he is played by another famous rock singer from around the same time period as Richards became famous-He is in heavy make-up but look for him in a jail scene when Johnny stops and talks to him as he is singing one of his songs. Make sure you stay until after the credits; there is a scene that could lead into the next movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for adventure violence and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I think this was a good installment in the series and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"TheJediWay9","7","0","9","25 May 2017"," The Black Pearl Sails Again, As ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" Is A Satisfying-Though Very Flawed- ""Pirates"" Sequel
","""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is the 5th movie in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise in which a crew of undead pirates led by Captain Salazar escape from the Devil's Triangle, hellbent on killing every pirate at sea. As they seek the Trident of Poseidon, they don't know that Jack Sparrow has been roped in to this adventure as well.<br/><br/>I really like the Pirates movies. The first one is no doubt the best. Everyone can say what they want about the sequels, but watching the sequels, even the fourth one, which I think is the best sequel (I know I'm in the minority there) makes me entertained. At this point in the series, I'm not expecting to ""blown out of the water"" with these movies. I just expect to kick my feet up and have a good time. For the most part, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" succeeds in this aspect. However, as of this moment, it is my least favorite of the sequels. <br/><br/>It felt like Johnny Depp was just playing Johnny Depp in this movie. It seems like the writers have run out of ideas for good ole Captain Jack. The first action scene of the movie features a bank heist involving Jack Sparrow, and watching it I couldn't help to think if the character would do this. It seemed really out of character. However, with the character of Jack, he was relegated to supporting character again, which was a relief, because I felt the sequels tried too hard to make him the main character. I also liked seeing Jack when he was past his prime. It shows too. Just count how many times in this movie the character is drunk. There was some backstory we got with him involving Salazar, and that was one of the most interesting part of the movie. <br/><br/>Javier Bardem was like spitting his lines. It was hard to understand him at times. For the most part, it's solid. But I don't know what he was going for by doing that or if he was told to do that. The character of Salazar though was a menacing villain, and the fact he was hellbent on killing every pirate at sea added more depth to his character. <br/><br/>The scene stealer in this though was definitely Barbossa. The character was given some of his best material to date, not quite matching the material from Curse Of The Black Pearl. But it was very effective. He is always the cool anti-hero of this series and this movie continues that trend. he also has some emotional scenes in there as well, which made me care about Barbossa a lot more in this one than in the past sequels.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the concept and the story. Both worked well and people are gonna say that this is too convoluted, which at times, yes it can be, but never to the point of being super complicated like much of the third one was, something this one and the fourth one did a very good job of avoiding. <br/><br/>The action scenes were fun. Nothing, I repeat, NOTHING in this series will ever top the three way sword fight on the wheel in Dead Man's Chest, but i thought the action scenes in this one were slightly more memorable than the ones in the fourth one. The only one I didn't like was the bank heist to open up the film. Just felt it was out of place for a Pirates film. No glaring issues with CGI in these scenes either. The action was fun, exciting, and a beauty to look at.<br/><br/>This movie though had quite a few missteps. For instance, Orlando Bloom is back. The is not a spoiler since he was in the trailer, but they could have done so much with Will in this movie, but he's relegated to two scenes, where he does nothing. This is the character for me that had the best story arc throughout the series, and you could have given him something even more to close out that story arc. However, the arc does come full circle in sweet, emotional scene at the end that really gave me the feels. <br/><br/>There were just other scenes in the movie that I felt were unnecessary. One example is a scene in the middle of the movie where Jack meets a pirate from his past and that pirate wants him to marry someone. Like why? Did we need that? It did nothing to advance the plot, and also felt out of place.<br/><br/>The two new leads, the hot chick from Maze Runner and Brendan Thwaites had good chemistry, but there wasn't enough interaction between the two of them to actually get me to care about them. I cared about their ultimate goals, but not so much about them as characters or their budding romance which was trying to harken back to Will and Elizabeth's romance in the first one and I really didn't buy it. Other than their personal goals there was nothing to latch onto these characters with. Their actors were fine. They weren't great, but not terrible. Serviceable. <br/><br/>The plot does get a little heavy handed at times, as it falls into the problem the fourth one had. Plot threads come out of nowhere, and everyone randomly has the same goal, which is to acquire the Trident. There were times where it just felt like it was too much.<br/><br/>""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" for me is the weakest entry in the series, but it isn't atrocious. It's a fun summer movie. Just let this be the end, no matter what that post credits scene teased.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" a 6.5/10"
