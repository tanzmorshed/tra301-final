","Competent entertainment, and a fun feuding dynamic between youngish heroes not quite ready for the limelight, but it's basically just the Marvel Origin Story Template applied once more. Jessica Alba can't act, but Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom is one of the better villain performances in this stable."
"StevePulaski","7","34","38","13 August 2015"," Captures a time when superhero films were more joyful
","Fantastic Four is one of the last superhero films, that I can recall, that wasn't insufferably bleak or incredibly serious to a point where any shred of humor was seen as obtuse to the film's narrative. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an indisputable breakthrough in superhero films, but it also made the seriousness of superhero films standard, something that would follow into the late 2000's and early 2010's as Marvel built up The Avengers. Fantastic Four reminds of the quirkiness superhero films were once predicated upon, and while it may get a bit too corny at times, and its focus can never really settle, it's also a very commercial film that satisfies on some level of entertainment when it gives every card in its deck a fair time to shine.<br/><br/>We open by looking at a physicist named Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who is convinced evolution was triggered millions of years ago by stray elements of cosmic energy in space, some of which will pass near Earth very soon. His pal, astronaut Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), works by his side on this potentially revolutionary discovery by helping him convince their old classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), the CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow both of them access to his private space station to further experiment with the effects of these cosmic energy particles. While Doom agrees, he winds up walking away with most of the profits that this experiment will bring, affirming Reed's desperation to make his project work.<br/><br/>Still, he persists on and brings his close friends Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) along for the ride. However, when a trip to outer space goes awry, exposure with the cosmic energy results in the four receiving deformities and enhanced human abilities that have never before been seen: Reed possesses the ability to stretch every limb of his body, Susan has the ability to disappear and reappear at her leisure, Johnny can have his body engulfed in flame simply by reciting the phrase ""Flame on!,"" and Ben turns into a hideous, orange rock monster.<br/><br/>Following the four's mutations, writers Michael France and Mark Frost focus a great deal of their time on the agony that these mutations bring, particularly The Thing, who experiences his wife leaving him shortly after revealing his deformity. While this agony is a solid angle (one I'd argue necessary in most superhero films), too much of the time is spent profiling The Thing and not enough on the remaining characters of the film. Reed and Ben, who are ultimately the film's main focus, wind up monopolizing too much of the picture, and any time we see Johnny is when he's right in the middle of making a smug comment or being his typical, womanizing self.<br/><br/>The action in Fantastic Four has a colorful commercial look to it, brilliantly bold and very vibrant in a way that makes many of the scenes pop with life. It manages to achieve a comic book aesthetic without resorting to picture-in-picture editing. One particularly involving scene takes place on a suspension bridge, where The Thing is seen pummeling everything in his sight and the remaining three members of the team must resort to either relaxing him or protecting drivers and innocent bystanders.<br/><br/>The goofiness in Fantastic Four, however, in an age of dark superhero films that come with slick aesthetics and brooding characters, is a delightful change of pace. Yes, there is a point when one wishes director Tim Story, France, and Frost would command a tighter grip on the seriousness of the writing, but the pulpy fun of Fantastic Four, in addition to the effects and the neatly choreographed action, keep it a moving, satisfying spectacle that is more than just colors flying around on screen, trying to find their place.<br/><br/>Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Julian McMahon. Directed by: Tim Story."

","Following a failed experiment in space, a group of astronauts gain super powers following exposure to radioactive energy. This exposure gives the astronauts different super powers and doctor Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is attempting to find a way to reverse the effects of the radiation on his team. However, Doctor Von Doom (who has also been exposed to the radiation) has his own agenda and is intent on using his super powers to try to take down the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Given its rather modest 5.7 average user rating I wasn't expecting much here and was actually fearing the worst. However, whilst watching this film I was surprised by how enjoyable I actually found it. The story has quite a lot of depth to it and most of the focus is on how the team cope with the way that the radiation has caused life-changing alterations to their DNA. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) relishes his new found gift and does everything he can to make sure he's in the limelight - this makes sense as he's painted as a rather arrogant individual right from the start. Evans puts in a good performance and despite the arrogance of his character he does still have some likability about him. On the other end of the spectrum, we've got Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) whose DNA has been permanently altered by the radiation due to the fact that he received the most exposure to it. There is a very tender scene with his character at the start of the film where he goes back to see his wife and she can't handle what has happened to him and basically has nothing further to do with him (it seems bizarre that she doesn't even ask what has happened to him and doesn't seem interested in standing by him or helping him out - what a b*tch). Chilkis is also excellent here and gives a nicely balance performance with a character that is ugly and gruff on the outside, but has a real heart of gold on the inside. Alba and Gruffudd make up the other two characters in The Fantastic Four (Sue Storm and Reed Richards respectively) and sadly their characters are not quite as interesting as Ben or Johnny and their performances for me weren't quite as strong. Despite this though, the film provides many funny moments (mostly between Ben and Johnny) and the wonderful camaderie and rather interesting story and exploration of their super powers made this a winner in my book.<br/><br/>The only weak link with this film lay with Von Doom (Julian McMahon) as the villain of the piece and his motivations; he seems to lose it and go berserk because he's jealous that something is going on between Sue and Reed. OK, that's fine, but why then decide to try and kill Ben and Johnny when his issue is with Richards and Storm. Despite a good turn from McMahon, I never really took to him as a villain as I felt that jealousy alone was a rather thin and flimsy reason to justify his barbaric behaviour.<br/><br/>Taking everything into account this is a good film. It's fun, there are some interesting characters here, the exploration of their super powers are interesting and of course the special effects are incredible. It's definitely worth a look."
"caseynicholson","8","42","49","12 August 2015"," I Don't Get the Hate for this Movie
","I recently watched the 2005 version of ""The Fantastic Four"" in preparation for the reboot that is in theaters now. This movie and its sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" are 20th Century Fox productions. The Fantastic Four and X-Men franchises were both leased out to Fox prior to Marvel getting its own film production studios, and like other Marvel properties from before the MCU, this film is often bashed by comic book fans.<br/><br/>I personally don't see what's not to like here. Indeed, I think that this film does a great job portraying the FF's origin story. Sure, The Thing looks a bit hokey in what is clearly a rubberized suit of some sort, and I think they surely could have found an actor that looked more like Reed Richards from the comics than Ioan Gruffudd (that's quite the name, by the way!). But all in all, this is a.....fantastic....film. lol<br/><br/>I give it 8/10 stars. Jessica Alba does great as Sue Storm, and Julian McMahon is a superb Dr. Doom. The plot and the acting are well done, and the pace of the storytelling is good as well. To me, there's much more to like in this movie than to dislike. <br/><br/>Language note, though: There is one ""GD"" in this movie, which I wasn't expecting (it's when Ben Grimm is in the hospital bed after returning from space). I guess it just goes to show that Marvel movies were not always kid-friendly even before the recent trend in the MCU line. So heads up for that."
"randyfromscream","8","13","14","5 August 2017"," Way better than Fant4stic (2015)
","This movie is very enjoyable like it don't need a dark tone and Dr.Doom looks better. I'd wish I watch the 90s one even though it didn't age well but still I want to. At least the characters are likable then Fant4stic because the characters in the movie are lifeless while in this film there not boring. I know the film is not the best but I have a good time with it"
"gdinelli","7","14","16","9 July 2015"," A pretty good film
","As a reader of the comics, I was really excited to finally see a movie about my favourite characters. I've learned that a FF film was in ""development hell"" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to ""let it go"", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!"
"christian123","4","68","105","6 July 2006"," So-So Superhero Film
","During a failed experiment in space, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue and Johnny Storm (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Dr. Victor Von Doom are bombarded by cosmic rays, changing their molecular systems and giving them superpowers. Four of them become the superhero team, the Fantastic Four, while Doom becomes their new enemy. <br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is far from fantastic but it does make for decent entertainment. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. This is good news and bad news. The good part is that the film doesn't take itself so seriously and the movie ends up being mildly enjoyable. On the other hand, it becomes silly and cheesy with laughable acting and events. Also, the movie is actually kind of dull. There are some fun spots (like the bridge scene) but there is really no spark to the film. The blame should go to Tim Story and his lack of imagination. He keeps the film bland and dull but he shouldn't get all the blame. He is working with a cheesy and weak script courtesy of Michael France and Mark Frost. If the writing had been a little better and the direction a little sharper then the film could have been better but it stands as a mediocre one. <br/><br/>The acting is a mix bag with some good performances and a couple of bad ones. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm. He seems to be having a blast and his performance is contagious. It's also nice to see something different. Usually in super hero movies, the superheroes are moody and they just want a normal life, which isn't a bad thing. However Johnny Storm actually wants to show off and he considers his new powers to be a blessing and not a curse. On the opposite side of Johnny Storm, you have Ben Grimm played by Michael Chiklis. He is the exact opposite and he wants to give rid of his powers. His situation is pretty sad since his fiancé leaves him and it's hard for him to really live a normal life. Chiklis gives a good performance and it was a little heartwarming. Jessica Alba gives a bad performance as Sue Storm. She is unconvincing as a scientist and her emotions feel fake. Ioan Gruffudd is actually somehow worse and he can't really act. His chemistry with Jessica Alba is almost non existent. The only other person worth mentioning is Julian McMahon and he plays Dr. Victor Von Doom. I think he makes a good bad guy and he gives a decent performance. <br/><br/>Despite the lack of quality in the film, Fantastic Four is pretty harmless. There is nothing here that should really offend anyone and it works better with kids than with adults or teenagers. The film has some things going for it though. The special effects are at least above average and the movie provides decent eye candy. As previously noted, there are some performances that stood out so the whole experience isn't a complete waste of time. However, The Fantastic Four is still a disappointment. In the end, the movie is worth a rental at the most, in my opinion. Rating 5/10"

"write_to_ellen","10","270","480","18 July 2005"," Truly enjoyable.
","This film was well put together, fun, and didn't take itself at all seriously. I am not sure where the negative hype comes from, but I find when a good film gets bad reviews, that means most people just didn't get it. In this case, perhaps from the last few comic book films that attempted to ""mean something,"" I think people forgot how to enjoy themselves. Laden with kitsch and tongue-in-cheek humor, this movie embraces that it comes from a comic book and allows itself to be big and a little silly. Yes, Jessica Alba wears an impossibly tight jumpsuit. Yes, the Human Torch is so slick and charming that, if you met him in real life, he'd get a solid smack for his arrogance. But this isn't real life, people, in case you forgot-this is the Marvel Universe, where clothes are tight and the dialog...isn't. Who cares? This movie is so fun that you wish these people did exist and would take some media focus off the jerks that are in the public eye."
"RogerBorg","2","114","196","5 October 2006"," The title is half right
","In that there are Four of them. But Fantastic? More like ""Mediocre"", or ""Barely Adequate"", or ""Contractually Sufficient"".<br/><br/>For once, the reviewers were right. This film is a big, rambling, poorly conceived, sloppily scripted, shoddily acted pile of orange rubble. Avoid it, or suffer the consequences.<br/><br/>It's hard to know where to begin, there's so much wrong with it. For a start, the acting ""talent"" is AWOL. TV performers don't inevitably get lost on the big screen, but this cadre evited it. Alba turns in the exact same performance that she always does, going through her entire range, from ""pouty and petulant"" to ""petulant and pouty"". Evans is either a strutting superannuated fratboy poseur, or for some reason is deliberately playing one so well that it's hard to tell the difference - either way, his character is thoroughly irritating and utterly unsympathetic. Chiklis is adequate, but is let down by the plain fact that he's a round little man in a big rubber muscle suit. This was a role for Ron Perlman, not Wimpy. Gruffudd is a huge disappointment; he has no screen presence, and his slightly out-of-his-depth portrayal of Hornblower is apparently the man, not the character. It would have been better if he had been invisible, as he manages to fade into the background with ease in every scene. McMahon is the only actor who appears to be enjoying himself, but as he's barely in the film, he can't rescue it.<br/><br/>The script was apparently in development for ten years. I can't see why, as it's one scene, repeated ten times. If this is the refined version, I shudder to imagine what the raw cut would have been like. I find it hard to believe that the lines were written by, or for, adults. There's no real plot to the film, or even a story beyond ""Nasty self absorbed un-credible astronauts become nasty self absorbed un-credible 'super' heroes, then argue with each other for a while, take their clothes off for no reason, then beat up some poor disfigured guy apparently because he didn't join their little gang, roll credits."" Direction and cinematography was Filmschool #101, the score was instantly forgettable, and the editing was appalling, with the pacing in particular being random and rushed.<br/><br/>The effects were only what we've come to expect from a hundred million dollar movie, which brings me to the big question: what on earth did they spend all that money on? It wasn't on the ""talent"", either on-screen or off, it certainly wasn't on the rubber suit, and the effects couldn't have cost that much - or if they did, they were seriously over-charged.<br/><br/>I have an idea where at least some of the budget went. From IMDb's Trivia section: ""Contains over 25 cameos from real life employees of Fox television affiliates."" And I strongly suspect that the IMDb records for this movie contain about 2,5000 comments and ratings and mutual approvals from about five of those real life employees. Reading the top recommended comments, most of which have 10 ratings, reveals a depressing pattern of almost identically styled raves from the likes of ""top10dude"" and ""BigTenPower"" with embarrassingly obvious track records of enthusing about, you guessed it, other shoddy Fox movies. When someone rates Elektra a 10, you have to just snort in disbelief at the audacity of it.<br/><br/>I guess it's a pretty good investment for Fox, but this kind of astroturfing drastically reduces the usefulness of IMDb as an early review source. With time, this awful, foul mess of a movie will no doubt settle to its rightful place near the bottom of the ratings pile, but it's likely that the shill reviews will stay stubbornly at the top of the recommended pile for a long time to come. Beware; consider the source.<br/><br/>[2013 update] To this day, the top 'recommended' comment is an early 10 rating from a member who signed up to IMDb just to rave about this one film using the minimum allowed size of review, and then never contributed again. What dedication!"

"TomAW","10","145","264","30 June 2005"," Somebody Finally Got it Right!!!
","Wow! Just WOW! Let me start by saying I'm not a regular Fantastic Four reader, but I am a huge superhero fan and I've been reading comic books and watching superhero movies since the mid seventies. Spider-Man's my favorite, so I'm familiar with the FF characters from team-ups, crossovers etc. A few days ago I was visiting a friend in NYC and he treated me to a special advance showing of the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Now I've been watching superhero movies since the original Superman, and year after year, film after film, they've gotten close, but there always seems to be something missing. With Spider-Man, for example, I liked it, but I thought the Goblin could have been much better and Toby M. made a great Peter Parker, but mediocre Spider-man.<br/><br/>But the Fantastic Four . . . this one seemed to finally put it all together. The good guys were good (without being goody-goody) the bad guy was bad (without being a caricature) the setting was grounded and realistic (not an altered reality like the early Batman films) allowing just enough suspension of disbelief where it was really needed. Sure there were moments that could be questioned: ""Would that really happen? Would he really say that?"", but it's just about impossible to make an ambitious film like this without a few moments like that. What I really loved is they had POWERS, and they used them. You didn't get the feeling (as you did with X-Men for example) that they were being held back. They looked like they were coming right off the comic page.<br/><br/>Here's a little breakdown: Chris Evans/Human Torch - Amazing. I think a lot of credit has to be given to whoever did the casting on this one. No offense to Mr. Evans, but I got the feeling that playing an over-the-top superstar thrill seeker wasn't much of a stretch for him - if it was I really owe him a tip of the hat, but he seemed completely natural in the role. If Sam Raimi had thought to put Chris E. in the Spider-Man suit and let Toby M. play Peter P., we might have had a very interesting film. And kudos to the special effects department on this one, when the Torch ""Flames On"" you can practically feel the heat coming off the screen.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis/Thing - Again, the casting was perfect on this. Michael C. WAS the Thing. He made you feel his pain, but he didn't wallow in it. While I thought they might do this with CGI, I'm glad they didn't. MC brought a depth and realness to the character that no computer could hope to match. There were a few moments when the suit didn't look quite right, but it was never enough to destroy the moment.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffuld/Mr. Fantastic - Ioan G. did a good job, but he didn't have as much to work with as the other characters. He was believable and likable, but not a standout with everything else that was going on. The special effects were well done, but since your brain knows people can't actually stretch, it never quite looked ""real"". Still, to the filmmakers credit, they didn't hold back, and there were scenes (such as a fight with the Thing) that had me sitting slack jawed and amazed.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba/Invisible Woman - Jessica A. is simply breathtaking to look at. Now that I've said that, I feel a little less guilty saying her acting, while not bad, was a little flat. Still, she brought a special quality to the character, and many, many men and boys will walk out of the theater in love with her. The invisibility/force field effects were generally well done, but not quite what I expected, and at times I found myself wishing they had done them a bit differently.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon/Dr. Doom - Like many fans, I had been hoping for Doctor Doom - RULER OF LATVERIA, but in the context of this film, you can see that it wouldn't really have worked. This is an origin piece. The Fantastic Four aren't really the Fantastic Four yet. They're just a bunch of confused geeks trying to figure out who and what they are. Doctor Doom - RULER OF LATVERIA would have dispatched with them before breakfast. The ending, however, perfectly sets up a sequel (and I'm almost certain there WILL be a sequel - this film is too good not to get one) in which the a mature Fantastic Four can face a mature Dr. Doom. For this film, Julian M. was subtle yet powerful. He wasn't a cartoon bad guy, but a real bad guy. The kind you've met before who will shake your hand and look you in the eye while he's sticking a knife in your back. His relationship with Sue is creepy and it really defines his character. Everyone in the audience can see that he doesn't even understand what love is. To him, love is possession. Toward the end, he becomes truly frightening, but it's not a jump like some villains. You could see the evil smoldering below the surface from his first on-screen moment.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was well balanced and a LOT of fun. It was very funny at points, it was very heart rending at other points. Dramatic, intense and exciting. Remember that moment in Star Wars when Han Solo came back to help Luke blow up the Death Star. Remember how you just cheered an celebrated with the heroes? That's how this film made me feel.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I'm not eloquent enough to describe just how much I loved this movie. While not perfect, the sum total of the parts created a great, memorable experience."
"BigHardcoreRed","Null","188","354","8 July 2005"," Better Than Daredevil, Not As Good As Either Of The X-Men.
","The Fantastic Four was a pretty good superhero movie but it lacked something. I do not think it truly lived up to it's endless hype from early this year. Aside from a few scenes that stick out, most are in the trailer, there is not much there other than some slick special effects sprinkled about. It is understandable, however, due to the fact that this film is about the origin of 5 different individuals and how they gained their super powers. I imagine the next one (of course, if there is a next one) will be more action packed.<br/><br/>As for a quick rundown of the story, 5 people are sent into a space ship to gather information that would be helpful in curing diseases and other good stuff. The crew consists of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed Richards, (Ioan Gruffudd), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). While in the space station, the super cosmic storm hits hours earlier than expected and all 5 are caught in the storm, forever altering their DNA (or something like that). The one that got it the worst was Grimm.<br/><br/>The standouts from this movie are The Thing/Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm/Human Torch & Sue Storm/Invisible Girl. The Thing & Torch stand out because of both their characters and personalities & Jessica Alba stands out pretty much just because she is Jessica Alba.<br/><br/>I feel that Reed Richards was more of an annoyance in the movie and not as likable a character as, say, the Human Torch. Also, I fear that Dr. Doom will probably forever be compared to the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, due to the hokey masks and all. Also, the voice for Doom did not quite fit for me. I am not sure if his voice is supposed to be that docile or not, but I always pictured a deeper, more menacing voice for him.<br/><br/>I do hope this movie is not as criticized as movies such as Hulk or Daredevil. This movie was not that bad, probably not even as bad as I have made it seem. I would rate it somewhere in between X-Men and Daredevil. 7.5/10"

","I don't know why some people wanted more action. That has been the bane of many movies lately - focusing too much on action and special effects and forgetting how to tell a good story.<br/><br/>This movie remembered to use the special effects to help tell the story and not focus on them. The effects were really good and many of them were used for humour instead of action. The only effect that looked a bit computerish or fake was the flame effect on Johnny Storm.<br/><br/>The acting is decent and all the characters seem to fit the roles. They have the right attitudes and lines.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes that were a bit contrived and we weren't sure why/how the character ended up there - for example, Johnny Storm is suddenly in a bike jumping show - but maybe he knows someone on the inside - so we will just let it go. Besides, it's a comic book.<br/><br/>It seemed very true to the feel of the comic books. I really enjoyed this show and would recommend it."
"drendoynk","10","47","84","25 July 2005"," Great for people that have never read the comic
","I'm your average guy, I don't read comic books, and I usually don't comment about movies. Here is some thing a lot of people who gave this movie a bad review might not understand. The Fantastic 4 is a great movie!!! Especially for people who are too young to remember the comic books or the show!!! I remember when I was 9 years old, The Fantastic 4 used to be on late night on Cartoon Network. That was the only time I remember hearing about them or seeing them on a main stage. <br/><br/>Ten years later, a smile comes to my face when I hear about a movie being made about the superheroes I vaguely remember loving as a child. I don't read comic books. I could care less about the comic book accuracy. I just wanna see some guy burst into flames, fly, and say smart** comments. <br/><br/>Spiderman didn't do it for me, X-Men didn't, the only Batman movie I truly enjoyed was Batman Forever (Robin was cool, and Christian Bale didn't even act in Batman Begins.) I've never enjoyed a superhero movie more than the Fantastic 4. It's got such a simple formula: What would you do if you woke up one morning with superpowers? Each character was real. Johnny was an adventurous guy before the accident, of course he's not going to stay cooped up in Reeds lab all day. Reed was a geek, he stayed a geek the whole movie. Sue was like... the ""dude, I totally wanna do your mom"" type. She was responsible and everything... and she looked so hot in that cat suit. Ben was great as the family man who goes through the trauma of losing his wife and being out-casted.<br/><br/>I loved the Fantastic 4 because each character goes through their own issues, but the dramatic bull**** doesn't eclipse all the awesome action. I hated Spiderman because Peter still looked like a dopey, love sick, puppy even when he was kicking some bad guy buttocks. This movie had the right balance of emotion and butt-kicking. <br/><br/>The actors had such great chemistry! The scene after Johnny goes to the motocross contest was priceless. It was basically: This is how you bicker with superpowers. <br/><br/>The scenes with the Thing adapting to life with big fingers was great. You can't just wake up one morning bigger than life and expect to be able to do everything normal. The scenes with Sue stripping down in the middle of the street were so true. Is there a better way to get away from a crowd than turning invisible and stripping off all your clothes? The little things like all of Johnny's clothes burning, the tabloids, the action figures, the way the Thing squeezed a huge bundle of oranges for his juice in the morning, all those things make this movie great.<br/><br/>When you see the Fantastic 4, it's like you're watching 4 people's lives change through a hidden camera. They're doing their normal, everyday stuff... except with wicked cool powers."

Reed Richards becomes Mr. Fantastic, and can make his body stretch like rubber, Susan Storm becomes the invisible woman, who can turn invisible and can create shields, Ben Grimm becomes The Thing, a superhuman of enormous size with incredible strength, and Johnny Storm becomes The Human Shield who can ""flame on"" at any time and fly! Also on board is the evil Victor Von Doom who eventually becomes one of the greatest villains in Marvel history, Doctor Doom who can generate massive amounts of energy and whose body becomes the hardest metal on Earth. He's definitely my favorite character in the film! Of course with this being an origin story, it takes time for things to get moving, but once the chips are firmly in place, the film takes adventure to new heights.<br/><br/>Sure, it's not the best film of the summer, but I did enjoy it throughly. If you go in with reasonable expectations, you'll pleasantly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Ignore the critics, Fantastic Four is fantastic!<br/><br/>A 7 on a scale of 1-10!"

","The studio have obviously looked at Spiderman, Hulk, X-men and Daredevil, and despite the varying degrees of popularity there, I think it was wise of them to make this a much lighter jaunt.<br/><br/>This film is pure undemanding entertainment, it has nothing more on its mind than ""lets have some fun"", and dark superhero movies are getting to be a bit of a pill. I can appreciate how a big fan of the comic, would take issue with the changes that have been made, bottom line folks, your a film studio, your spending $100 million dollars making a piece of ""entertainment"", it has to play to 10 yr olds, it has to play to 30 year olds, or even 60 year olds, so what do you do? Well you can ensure your film has got some jokes, some action, some romance, some eye popping special effects, and mix in the main staples of the comic book, hey presto ! Or you can slavishly stick to every plot twist , every nuance, and every back story ever printed in the comics to please the percentage of your audience who are hard core fans of the comics. I love films ,all films, all types, but this is a business, look at Batman Begins, what a great film, but its taken it 1 month to make over $180 million in the U.S, thats not amazing business, this doesn't mean its a bad film, I thought it was amazing, but obviously a large portion of the films potential audience have shied away from it, why?, well I didn't feel it was suitable for a kid under 12 and cant imagine a large number of the fairer sex found much to their taste in there. The studios just wont pump mega bucks into something which only appeals to a limited number of punters. ""Jaws"" the book ,changes substantially, as ""jaws"" the film,there's a lot missing, didn't effect it much,in fact if you have read the book and seen the film, I think most would agree the changes were right for the film. I do hate changes to source material, one film in the pipeline (for a long time now) is ""The A Team"", words cannot express the love i have for that show, but the movie will be barely recognisable, and you've just got to swallow it. I think what you can really say is, if your adapting a book, comic, TV show, whatever, its not how close you stick to the source material that will win you the biggest audience, but how well you identify what type of film the material dictates it to be, and then make the best film you can of the type you decided on , then cross your fingers !"
"limejockey","7","79","151","12 July 2005"," Solid effort
","What we really have here is a solidly put together superhero movie of the popcorn variety which will more than likely get the sequel it deserves, which unfortunately suffers from timing issues, having come out a whole three weeks after a movie named Batman Begins, which seems to be considered as one of if not the best superhero movie ever made. Since this is a different movie you can't really compare the two in my opinion. Performances are fair to excellent but this being the first movie of a possible series the various relationships have to be set up, and characters have to make sense within whatever story is presented. Origins of the heroes and villains need to be explained, which when you have 5 major characters plus the supporting people takes a whole load of time and you don't want your movie running much more than two hours. Writing seemed to make sense for what was there, but I'd be interested to see what happens in the next one now that the major relationships have been established. What was there was well presented it's just too bad that Batman Begins came out first to deservedly steal whatever thunder this was likely to generate. Again a decent way to fill two hours, just don't expect to be blown away."

","I truly think this is the best comic book movie ever made and I'm not exaggerating. Everything in this movie gets exceedingly better as the film plays out. These are not only the most complex characters I've ever seen in a major super hero movie, they're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they transcend their four-color origins and become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures. You really feel that they are a family and, by the end of the film, you feel like a part of that family. This is a remarkable feat for an origin film. It beats the first installment of any hero flick I can think of including Superman and Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Huge Thumbs Up!"

","This movie is a true rarity this year. It's a summer movie that doesn't try and depress you in to loving it or becoming emotionally involved. Parents don't die; Jedi's aren't slaughtered nor is the earth is decimated by aliens. FF takes itself seriously but it still manages to be fun. Even minus the dark tragedy, it's bigger, badder, smarter, and definitely more fun then anything I've seen so far this summer.<br/><br/>For those going into this flick expecting a lot of fun, prepare to enjoy-- although fun's not the only piece of this pie.

","First off, I'm new to this site but I want to avoid the name calling I've seen on these comment pages. I'm NO Fox employee but I loved this movie. Fox, more often then not produces poor quality films. Just look at their awful other movies that are accompanying Fantastic Four. Mr. & Mrs. Smith is stupidity personified and Rebound could be the worst movie produced this century. So, it's clear that I have NO loyalty to Fox. Next, I saw Fantastic Four a few days ago at the AMC Empire in NY and loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>It appears that the director must have done his homework because this movie captures the books I remember reading about the FF as a kid in every way. The plot has structure, the characters are well written as they are brought to life as a true family, the special effects are realistic and extremely fun. The action is engrossing, as it pulls you into the movie from the very beginning and never lets go. This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on just about all of your emotions. I don't remember when I enjoyed a movie this much! Just thought you should know. Don't believe the naysayers."
"silvers-1","5","104","206","4 July 2005"," My review - it's not bad, not great... and the other 10 star reviews on here are studio plants for sure!
","Well, you weren't expecting greatness, were you? Regardless of what the wider public might be expecting from Fantastic Four, in internet circles it's been earmarked as the potential stinker amidst a promising summer since the first details leaked online. Unlike successful superhero franchises like X-Men and Spider-man, there's no respected director and no attempt to give the film a thematic depth or real world resonance. Where they had acting heavyweights, Fantastic Four has a couple of notable talents from successful TV series and a couple of almost-stars, with broad appeal but little charisma to bring to the mix. So the first question you might want answered is, ""Is it awful?"" Thankfully, no. Fantastic Four is simple, rather hollow, occasionally boring and then it's over. But it's hard to deny that, in places, it's also fairly entertaining.<br/><br/>The story, changed from the source, sees five ludicrously-named scientists venturing into space to investigate a large cloud of special effects that has something to do with DNA. The team manage to get all their character back-stories, exposition-based conversations and marriage proposals out of the way in good time, before turning their attention to some rather vital defence shields. Too late, guys. Now you've been hit by the marauding cloud and you're back on earth (there wasn't much budget, it seems, for showing the there-and-back trips... space is but a quick cut away).<br/><br/>The characters quickly discover their powers - team leader Reed Richards can stretch his limbs at will, Sue Storm can disappear and fire force fields, Johnny Storm can burn himself alive and whizz about the skies, and Ben Grimm turns to stone and breaks stuff. Cool? Nearly. There's an rather archaic nature to these superpowers - childhood dreams from a long gone era - but the film neatly modernises them by distracting us with some extreme sports. The kids might love it, but they're really only notable as the one place director Tim Story uses slow motion in the entire film. Rather proud, were we, of what looks like the only real stunt in the film not juiced up with CGI? And then there's the bad guy. Victor Von Doom was probably never born to do good, but now he's lost his money and his wife and turned into metal. So he's mightily annoyed, and while the world welcomes the Fantastic Four with open arms, he sets about doing some violence to people and eventually tries to take down the Four.<br/><br/>Pretty slim on plot there, and the only gaps are taken up by scenes of the guys coming to terms with their new powers. Strangely, their initial response to them makes you wonder if they've seen the trailer - there's no sense of surprise. They barely seem to care until they leave the lab and return to New York.<br/><br/>Johnny, with the flashiest abilities, is the only one to really embrace them, showing off and being rather endearing with it. The others are oh so desperate to get back to normal, which in the case of Reed and Sue seems rather stupid - they can do some cool stuff, but otherwise, pretty much live as normal Lucky them (although Reed, as the stretchy Mr Fantastic, could really do with the power to look convincingly attached to the rest of his body whenever he's stretching). The only character with real issues is Michael Chiklis' Grimm, clad in stone and called The Thing. Daily life becomes a problem for this rocky beast, but the film clamps him with a ludicrous subplot where his wife turns up at the scene of the gang's first act of heroism, and having seen her hubby save the lives of a fire engine full of FDNY guys, decides to hand back her wedding ring before even asking what's happened to the man she promised to love for ever. It's ludicrous, and makes The Thing's constant grump hard to connect with - sure, it might not be great to look like that, but met with her reaction, you'd expect him to develop a screw you attitude to the world and embrace his power for kicking holes in walls. A shame, really, because Chiklis' is the best performance in the movie by far, even as the film occasionally demeans the man who played Vic Mackey with bird crap jokes and suchlike.<br/><br/>The proceedings have a rather slapped together feel (characters appear in the right places by coincidence and fill in plot holes for themselves) until the action kicks in, and almost all of it is crammed into the closing ten minutes. Between the FDNY-saving bridge set-piece (in glorious daytime, showing the limitations of some rather dreadful FX work) and the nighttime city-streets showdown, there's little to get you particularly excited - just super-heroic shoe-gazing. That said, the finale is rather satisfying, with Johnny's flaming acrobatics delivering some of the highs of Spider-man's web-slinging antics across Manhattan. The team join forces to defeat the bad guy and it's home time.<br/><br/>Like X-Men, Fantastic Four feels rather like the setup for a sequel, now that the characters are in place. Sadly, where X-Men had a heart and a brain, Fantastic Four has some good-looking young actors showing plenty of flesh (although my highlight was Chiklis' wild forest of a bare chest, not Chris Evans' constantly-on-display gym-toned torso) and a bit of product placement where the emotional attachment should have been (Whopper, anyone?). At least X-Men's build up of characters made me want to know what happened to the mutants next. As for the Fantastic Four, pleasantly though they passed the time, I couldn't give care less about what the future holds for them."

"DesertDogMedia","7","5","6","11 July 2014"," Fantastic Four
","Title: Fantastic Four <br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm and Victor Von Doom go up into space to measure comic rays when their ship is struck by them. This leads to them all developing their own individual superpowers. But this leads Reed to work to try and transform them back to normal, but he isn't able to and Dr Doom is able to turn Ben back to normal, but then starts taking them out one by one, mainly because they cost him his company. So the Fantastic Four have to stop him and save the day. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: Just putting this out there first, Chris Evans plays Captain America better than he plays Johnny Storm. Ioan Gruffudd plays Mr Fantastic, and feels like that nerd who has to do the science project for his group while trying to stop them from fighting all the time. Michael Chiklis plays a great Ben Grimm as you can get the feeling that his is trying to come to terms with the way he looks I loved Julian McMahon as Dr Doom, he has that suave sense of evil to him which makes him perfect for a villain, but still a believable villain at that. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. I felt like she really captured the helplessness and general uselessness of Sue Storm perfectly, while acting as the mother type character stopping Johnny and Ben from fighting. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: What the movie lacks in creative angles, it makes up in creative frame up jobs for the camera, that is always a good sign to see in a cinematographer and movie. We are given a nice birds eye shot once we are introduced to Johnny on his way to the rocket. When Victor shows Sue the Earth from space station we get what looks to be a panning, tilting 130º crane shot, which was beautifully pull off. We get a POV shot so we see things from the view of Ben, but this is a little trick to the audience as they would think that Ben has transformed, but this is a little joke played by Johnny. Establishing shot of the alps when Johnny goes skiing. The shot the follows to him throwing Reed out of a window has him see his reflection which is mutilated so just as he brakes the glass on the floor, the helmet's class case in his office breaks. That is a nice translation shot.<br/><br/>Graphics: The CGI for Johnny's fire was impressive and nicely done at the very least. His fire seemed constant and realistic. Sue's CGI was OK, not really all too impressive as most of that can be done easily with green screen and such. Reed's stretch-armstrong type limbs are decent at worst. Victor's lighting is interesting as it borders on being good and bad at the same time with me. <br/><br/>Costume: The costumes looked quite nice and worked better than other renditions of the suits I've seen, they remind me of the comics as they are that similar. Quite a lot of people have said they disliked how Ben looked as the Thing, most of those other people said it should have been done with CGI. The Hulk in the 2008 movie was done with CGI and people didn't like that, this movie was done in 2005. So chances are the CGI wouldn't have been that good for making Ben look like a pile of walking rocks, even for the budget they had for the movie. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: Radiation doesn't give you superpowers. When Reed is testing Johnny's fire in a test chamber constructed of titanium, the temperature shown on screen reaches 4000 Kelvin. Titanium melts at 1941 Kelvin, and boils at 3560 Kelvin. This would incinerate the building where they are working. Along with the added fact of no human being able to set them self on fire and stay like that, mainly because the fire would need a fuel source to stay alight. The sun does this by fusion. A human body isn't hot enough for fusion and doesn't have a fuel source. Sue's invisibility is pointless, mainly because she is bending light around her. This would mean that no light is hitting her eyes so this makes her blind. Don't get me started on how Ben's skin turns to rocks or how Reed's limbs can stretch. If Victor used magic to get his powers in the movie I would not question it, but seeing how he didn't, the question is how is he able to harness electricity? And why is his skin slowly turning into metal? Victor's space station must have developed artificial gravity, because they are casually walking around and not floating, we are at least 10 years off physics wise of creating artificial gravity. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: As far as adaptions go, this movie isn't as bad a people are saying it is. Yes, Dr Doom isn't a business man. Yes he got his powers from his mother's witch stuff. Yes his face is suppose to be badly burnt and not metal. Yes Johnny is suppose to have blonde hair and Ben is suppose to have hair in general. Remember the 1994 version? You shouldn't because that was only created so the company could keep the rights to the franchise. That is an example of people not caring or not putting any effort into a movie. This movie is much better than that, sure it messes with the source material, but so did the 2002 movie of Spiderman. That had Mary Jane as the love interest and organic web shooters. But we still love that movie. This movie has its faults and quite a few of them at that, but it is still a great and enjoyable superhero movie which is nicely paced and well written."

","Let me start with this, I got a chance to see this movie at a sort of free screening, for that is all i will say on that. Now for the movie, To me this is what A superhero comic should be like. True to its source. Now while Spider-man, Xmen, punisher and Batman Begins are truly great, this movie was just as good if not Fantastic. IOts just like the comic books, and the way it deals with the emotional drama that The Thing goes through is inspiring. The characters are all here and do a great job. Story wise , well like X-men and Spiderman The first movies that they had made really didn't have the best story but not bad either. Just the first movie gitter's. I love super hero movies, i mean who wouldn't, everyone wants to be a hero if not super. Acting was good, special effects are great, story is pretty good overall for being a movie based on the first comic book that i ever received I loved this movie. Say what you will a bout this movie. It is indeed A great superhero flick. Even if you don't like it, you gotta admit its way better, than Elektra or The Hulk."
"ozoneliar1","7","76","148","8 July 2005"," Not Horrible
","First let me say that I love the Fantastic Four comic books. I know exactly what works and what doesn't. So I feel well qualified to evaluate this film.<br/><br/>Secondly we need to address the issue of: Should a movie be 100% faithful to source material? Well, even if it were possible would you want the movie to be a carbon copy of the source material? Some things don't translate well to the screen. And sometimes (Harry Potter 1 *cough*) trying to be just like the original material is a bad idea! But when a character is fundamentally changed that's usually a bad idea. Fantastic Four takes many liberties with the characters some are worse than others. But a director and writer need to find the right medium that is a balance between the source and making a good movie. In this movie they changed the story around to try to make a better movie and failed! Perhaps they should have hired Goyer (Blade films, Batman Begins) to write the script, somebody who appreciates the original material.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a film about a group of four people who are changed in a cosmic ""accident"" and form a Super-Hero team. The film tries to make it a movie about coping with change and family strife, which is in theory a good idea but fails here. We are presented with a film that tries many things and all of them feel half-done. The only things that saved the film and made me give it a 7/10 are the Ben Grimm parts of the story. We have somebody who is transformed into a monster and hates it. Also the movie tries to rush into the transformation, which is a good idea, but slows down right afterwards and just meanders forward.<br/><br/>Overall: Not horrible. But if the people at FOX are reading this: You had a chance to make a great movie and blew it with a mediocre script, crappy director and over mediocrity!"

There are some aspects of the film that I still cal into question (Jessica Alba has neither the age or the depth for the sue storm Character) but I understand certain concessions of making a large budget studio project.

","Not a fantastic 4 fan so never read the books. But me and my GF caught a closed screening of it and I thought it was a solid movie. Better than I expected. Its a lot like the spiderman movies because of humor but serious at the same time. A lot of laughs and some sad parts also.<br/><br/>The movie begin with Reed, Sue, Johnny Storm, Ben and Doom going up into space to look for medical cures in a space cloud called the cosmic storm. The storm hits them and it gives them these strange powers. We seem them getting used to the new powers and using them to help regular people. They become celebrities in the public eye but there are many problems inside the team. Never seen superheroes fight like this but the Fantastic 4 bicker a lot. Ben and Johnny act like 5 yr olds and get into it bad at the x-games. Sue and Reed really love each other but reed is too distracted to pay her attention. And doctor doom turns them against each other and breaks the group up.<br/><br/>A lot of romance in this movie more than the hulk or x-men. Ben looks like a monster and the public doesn't identify to him as much as the other 4. But a beautiful blind woman named alicia does and she helps him cope because she knows what its like to be outcast too. The actors who played these two characters were very good because of the touching scenes showing how terrible he felt because he was now a hideous monster while the rest of the 4 still look human. I felt sorry for his rejection and pain like wolverine said when his claws come out every time. The big love story is about Reed and Sue. They cant get on the same page for most of the movie and Doom thinks he owns Sue. But she rejects him for Reed and I wont spoil it all but the end is a very beautiful scene that was almost better than when MJ came back for Peter at the end of Spider-man 2. <br/><br/>The actors all do a convincing job. My favourite was the wicked Julian Macmahon. Doom is one scary strange one who reminded me of the emperor in Sith but better looking. Some of his lines were weak but it did not come off cheesy because of the way he said them and acted. He's the villain but you admire him since he is suave and intimidating. Was also impressed with Alba. She has come a long way since dark angel. I liked her in Sin City but this movie showed she is more than a sex symbol. Some don't think shes a good actress but she did a very great job here. She and Iaon Gruffud are really good together.<br/><br/>I thought it was good. Story could have been a bit more complex but the actors, direction and effects make up for it, and the Human Torch is impressive to see on the big screen. 9/10."
"januszweetklier","9","37","68","21 July 2005"," Can't wait for the sequel
","I was very keen on seeing this movie, especially after seeing the 1994 version, which was let's say .. bad. Leaving enough room for a sequel I was not disappointed at all at the amount of screen time of each of the characters. They are introduced quickly and sufficiently leaving enough room for some spectacular action scenes(e.g. the Brooklyn bridge will never be the same). Although computer technology is not entirely capable in showing the powers of the fantastic four (e.g.Reed Richards arm and hand under the door when trying to get to Ben ),the special effects and character of Johnny and Susan Storm rules. The plot isn't too thick so there needs to be more to it than just one adventure. I hope a plan for Fantastic Four 2 is in the making. For now: Go see this movie!"
"Damian_","1","71","140","5 December 2005"," Probably the Worst Comic Book Movie I've Ever Seen
","Because of the overwhelming barrage of unfavorable reviews, I went into ""Fantastic Four"" with very low expectations. <br/><br/>I was still utterly disappointed with what I saw. <br/><br/>It is probably the worst movie based on a comic book that I've ever seen (having not yet had the pleasure of sitting through ""Elektra"" or ""Catwoman""). Prior to ""Fantastic Four"" I would've awarded this ""honor"" to ""Daredevil,"" but alas (Yes, I'm sorry to say) ""Fantastic Four"" is even worse.<br/><br/>First off, it moves far too quickly. I don't mean that the movie is just a collection of action sequences strung together (although there is little or no plot to connect one scene to the next). In fact, there is very little action in the movie. What I mean is that the pace of the film is too rushed. The line readings, for example, are delivered much too fast. The director should've varied the pace a bit more, particularly in the so-called ""dramatic"" scenes.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie was very well cast either. The performances are embarrassingly bad. They go from flat and dull one second to over-the-top and obnoxious the next (the worst offender being the amazingly stiff and lifeless Jessica Alba). The only actor who seems to bring any degree (no matter how small) of subtlety or depth to his character is Michael Chiklis. Perhaps the actors simply did the best they could with what they had to work with, because the characters are uninteresting, unsympathetic and, at times, flat-out annoying (especially Chris Evans' hotshot thrill-seeking ""Human Torch"").<br/><br/>The only thing worse than the pace, the characterizations and the performances was the writing. The dialogue is incredibly shallow and obvious. Practically every line is a clichÃ©. Here's a small sample:<br/><br/>""You're such a dork, Reed."" ""Which of you is the leader?"" ""Johnny, say you're sorry."" ""You two need a time-out."" ""He started it."" ""You need to control yourself. Think before you act."" ""Nothing personal."" ""Being different isn't always bad."" ""We're all in this together."" ""I can't hold it!"" ""Ya done good, kid.""<br/><br/>The special effects aren't really that special. At times they work just fine. At other times they look very cartoonish and unbelievable. The score, by the usually reliable John Ottman, is uninspired and, quite frankly, very corny. The choice of songs for the movie were also pretty bad. The direction is sadly lacking in any artistic vision or style. Having previously done comedies like ""Taxi"" and ""Barbershop,"" Tim Story just doesn't seem to demonstrate the natural grasp for the material that Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer does.<br/><br/>Speaking in very broad, generalizing terms, those are just some of the problems I had with the movie. To get more specific, however, I would have to give away a few spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the film, and still plan to, you may want to skip over this next section. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Despite the fact that throughout the film they continue to search for an explanation, it is never revealed how or why the space storm arrives early.<br/><br/>After his transformation, Ben calls his girlfriend from a payphone outside his home. He asks her to come outside, which she does... in her negligee (despite the fact that it's nighttime).<br/><br/>When Ben inadvertently causes a pile-up on a bridge, his three friends just happen to arrive on that same bridge at the very moment the accidents begin to occur. <br/><br/>On the bridge, Reed Richards tells Sue Storm he and Chris can't get past the police to help Ben, but (because of her invisibility) she can. She immediately turns invisible, removes her undergarments and gets by the police, but then so do Reed and her brother. What was the point then of her turning invisible and stripping (besides the obvious reason of providing the audience with a brief glimpse at Jessica Alba's body)? <br/><br/>Ben's girlfriend also goes to the trouble of coming to the bridge and pushing her way through the crowd simply to return a ring to Ben. She takes it off, places it on the street and walks away without saying a word. In the scene that immediately follows, Chris sardonically asks Ben, ""Where are your ears?"" Considering the man just lost his love, he couldn't show just a bit more understanding?<br/><br/>The films establishes that Ben weighs close to 700 pounds (he can stall an elevator and leave footprints in the pavement). Yet, in the climatic fight scene, he slides off the hood of a car without even leaving a scratch, let alone a dent.<br/><br/>*END OF SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say the movie was very sloppily and carelessly put together. Things are set up but never paid off. Significant questions are posed but never answered. The movie had potential but never even came close to realizing it. My advice to improve ""Fantastic Four"" would've been a complete overhaul of the script (probably by some different writers), a different director and, aside from Michael Chiklis, a different cast."
"terrilmedved","1","69","136","9 July 2005"," I'm just going to make this short
","Most of the other REAL reviews have said everything I want to. I'll just say this.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie a 3-4 out of 10 because while you can tell from other reviews how the script was God-Awful and the direction was poor, the Human Torch and the Thing were alright in my opinion. Sure, they were cheesy, but they made me laugh and I could almost get into the scenes where they were without the presence of the other two.<br/><br/>HOWEVER This gets a 1/10 to help even out the rating that FOX HAS CORRUPTED BY USING STUDIO-PLANTED 10/10s. This truly disappoints me. I know that studios pay off small time hack critics all the time, but this is really low and pathetic. Try hiring talent and managing your projects better. This movie was completely sub-par on everything except the cgi (and most people who are more picky than I on special effects generally agree that it could have been much better too.)"
"hsjones2112","7","41","77","13 July 2005"," Absolutely Excellent - Did NOT Disappoint!
","My expectations were high but cautious. I prayed that this would be closer to X-Men or Spider-Man quality, as opposed to Daredevil or Hulk quality. And man, they nailed it! I was more completely absorbed by this than by any movie I've seen in years. That may have a lot to do with the fact that Fantastic Four was my very first Marvel and even my first superhero comic book, way back in about 1973. So I have a strong attachment with these characters. But that also meant it would be easy to disappoint me, which this movie did NOT do. Like with Spider-Man, they did a completely mind blowing job of capturing the spirit and feel of the comics. This is very genuinely the Fantastic Four!"

","When I bought my ticket to see this movie I had no idea what to expect. I seen previews, previews that drove me to buy this ticket. My friend and I walked into the theater, took a seat and watched the red screen. After the previews had pasted the movie finally started.<br/><br/>I have never read any of the comics on this story, so I payed close attention to the screen. We were slowly introduced to the characters. Reed Richards (Gruffund), Susan Storm (Alba), Johnny Storm (Evans), Ben Grimm (Chicklis) and Victor Von Doom (McMahon) are five scientists that go into outer-space to study DNA.<br/><br/>After a cosmic radiation exposure hits them they wake up in Von Doom's 'care center' where they are studied for injuries. Slowly they all learn their powers. Johnny being set on fire, Susan turning invisible, Reed being able to stretch his arm to an amazing length(catching a falling champagne bottle), Ben turning into a 'stone monster' and Victor's hand/forearm turning to metal.<br/><br/>Reed, Susan, Johnny and Ben are forced to not go out in public after revealing their powers and being chased by screaming fans (Susan). Johnny seems to be the only one who's happy with his powers, while the other three wish to turn themselves back.<br/><br/>Reed swears to create a machine to turn them back, but not before testing everyone's powers. Victor's company quits on him and that causes him to kill a few people, well many people. Then he vows to steal everything Reed has, again. First eliminating his 'body guard' Ben ""The Thing"". This breaks them up Johnny and Ben going their separate ways while Susan and Reed stayed together. <br/><br/>Once Reed tried it on himself and it failed; Doom learns it needed more power. So Doom talked ""The Thing"" into using the machine. Success caused Ben to turn back into himself and Doom to become more powerful than ever. Becoming all metal, except his face. This brings them back together to take him on. They finally decide to keep their powers and use their powers to take him down.<br/><br/>Speacil effects are awesome, lines were funny, and the entire movie was fantastic! I loved it and would even go to see it again in the near future. This is definitely going to be in my DVD/VHS collection once it comes out. I give it a 10/10 and recommend it to everyone!"

It was a major disappointment to see that there was barely any action/violence whatsoever it was mostly the 4 trying to figure out their powers and them arguing! The plot of this movie states ""Five friends get special powers after being exposed to harmful space ray things, then they have to save the from Dr. Doom"", but really they are barely any fight scenes at all with Dr. Doom and when there is it's not that spectacular! And, they don't even use their powers that much like I said it's basically them just arguing with each other! Anyways, this movie was a great disopointmeant i give it 3 out of 10."

","FANTASTIC FOUR <br/><br/>Now honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much when I rented this movie, but all I wanted was stupid entertainment. But this movie was so terrible and simple that it was confusing.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the most god-awful screenplays that Hollywood has ever produced. Being completely honest... I could have written a better screenplay and directed a better film.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four as a comic-book has enormous cinematic potential because it takes a group of super-heroes who are reluctantly thrust into their roles as super-humans... however, their stories are even stronger b/c of the honest and deep family dynamic they hold as a team.<br/><br/>Every piece of that is lost in this translation to film. In order to set up a good franchise, they should have taken the time to explore who these people are before and during their mission to space. Reed's mission isn't described to the audience as anything deeper than ""if we head into space and get a testing from a space cloud, we can help people live longer"". That's honestly the most detailed description of his mission.<br/><br/>And the dynamic between Reed and Sue Storm is never actually apparent between the actors... there are only random moments of dialogue that spoon feed the audience the most elementary tension between them.<br/><br/>Basicall the film is a giant waste of a source material that could have made a great film. It's filled with implausibilities and unexplained errors... for example: - Why could Reed's every-day, cotton shirts stretch to unbelievable lengths along with his body? However, in order for Jessica Alba to become invisible she must strip off her clothes... yeah, very subtle... hot chick gets naked...<br/><br/><ul><li>What was the point of The Thing (Michael Chiklis) saving the one suicidal man on the bridge? B/C in the process of doing so he destroys about 10 cars and probably kills numerous people on the highway.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How did The Thing manage to change himself back into his deformed self without anyone to push the button? - What was with all the BLATANT, BLATANT, BLATANT product placements? Pathetic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If they were in quarantine, how did Chris Evans managed to take that awful actress from ACCESS Hollywood not only out of the building... but in a ****ing helicopter on a huge mountain? Aside from all of this, the performances are awful. The only actor who comes out slightly unscathed is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/""Human Torch""... he obviously got to ad-lib some lines which gave him the best dialogue in the film. Jessica Alba is not only completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm (with a good screenplay this is the kind of role that should be played by Naomi Watts or Charlize Theron... she's supposed to be maternal and wise). Whoever played Mr. Fantastic should never work again. Micheal Chikless as The Thing offers one of the worst performances ever given while wearing such a ridiculous costume (The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were played better). And Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom wasn't scary for a single frame.</li></ul><br/><br/>I can't tell if it's all to blame on Tim Story, the director *cough cough. I can tell you this is about one of the least talented young directors working today... TAXI and FANTASTIC FOUR, greeeeat resume buddy.<br/><br/>Honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much... but the universal awfulness of this movie was just ridiculous. Not once was it exciting, funny, or tense. It just wasted two hours of life. And it's extra disappointing b/c I can picture in my head how great of a film could have been made from the source material.<br/><br/>Awww well... Hollywood blew a good opportunity and everyone involved made a fool of themselves doing so. Too bad.<br/><br/>... F ..."
"warlok1","10","47","91","8 July 2005"," Better than I expected. And a great film to enjoy in the theater
","WEll, after years of being stillborn, the Fantastic Four has hit the big screen. I was a fan of the comic book, and felt if the film at least captured a bit of the essence of the F4 from the Original Marvel comic, while giving believable FX, I'd be happy.<br/><br/>Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four I always knew and loved, and the Dr. Doom I always loved to root against, have been brought to life. And more over, updated for the 21st century.<br/><br/>Of all the characters the 2 best in contrast are Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) who always has a smart alecky comment or one liner ready when he isn't showing off like an X-Games wannabe, and Ben Grimm (The Thing) Who is gruff and iconoclastic, tragic but also unwitting comic relief. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) can also give a bit of comedic relief when unwitting side effects of his 'stretching' (like falling asleep at the keyboard) show up via CGI. Sue Storm (The Invisible Girl) is both fragile, yet also burning with intelligence and a desire to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>This film, while opening up the F4 for the 21st century (things like Johnny's running off to perform stunts on TV, or Ben getting a doll made for him from 'marketing' ) are balanced with classic silver age symbols -- the Baxter Building with its funky top 5 floors, Ben Grimm's trademark Fedora and trenchcoat (thanks to a big and tall store), and Doom's 'old country' roots in Latveria -- all these give the F4 a great grounding in classic marvel comics.<br/><br/>The Character changed the most is Dr. Doom -- Victor Von Doom -- a Donald Trump like Mogul at the top of his own multi-billion dollar corporation -- Doom was always the self made scientist blaming reed for his 'scar' -- well the 'scar' is there, but this time, Doom is 'caught' in the same Cosmic Storm which empowers reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben -- Doom's 'power' becoming the ability to channel electricity, side effected by a body turning to metal. Soon, using Reeds ' research' to try and reverse the storm, Doom hatches his own plan to neutralize the members of the F4 while augmenting his own power -- in short, classic Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>The film presents other supporting characters -- a forgettable group of trolls as Dooms 'board of directors' all of whom are eliminated when Doom stages his own 'hostile takeover' -- and Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters -- she perfectly pulls of a smart, urban Willamsburg artist who reaches out to Ben's soul past his stone exterior. Those folk who were 'upset' at a black woman being cast needed to understand -- its wasn't her race. Its the fact she is a NEW YORKER -- and she pulls off her Williamburg open hearted, open minded girl with class.<br/><br/>The film remains evenly paced -- it can get a bit slow, especially in the stint from the recovery from the space station to the 'bridge reunion' of the characters, but after that,it is fast paced and exciting, right to the end, and a final scene that promises and exciting sequel.<br/><br/>I'm happy. I waited all year to see this, the wait was worth it."
"marinostheodore","5","11","17","7 October 2005"," Definitely not Fantastic...
","It could've been fantastic but unfortunately this movie manages only to pass off as average... <br/><br/>As far as comic book licensed movies go, Fantastic Four did get a lot of things right. First of all they got most of the characters' personalities and relationships right. The Thing and Human Torch's exchanges were very faithful to the source material and did provide the most fun parts of the movie... The costumes were also spot-on as well as the Thing's make up. The special effects guys deserve special praise because the Thing didn't look fake at all. The Human Torch looked cool too... <br/><br/>But unfortunately, the good elements stop here. The movie has huge problems. Its biggest problem is its story. Its far too simple and devoid of any depth. The only thing that provides some substance in the story are the scenes exploring the Thng's situation since he's the one who was hit the worst by the mutation. The problem with the story is that for a Super-Hero based movie, there's pretty much nothing heroic going on. The only times that the F.F. get to act as heroes are when they help people get out of an accident on a bridge, and when they fight Dr. Doom. Other than that they just have fun with their powers or try to find a way to get rid of them... Dr. Doom, the villain, is one of the most under-developed villains of all time and he only appears as his evil masked persona for about 5 minutes towards the end of the movie... The ending too is really disappointing and anti-climactic to say the least. Another problem was the casting. The actors playing the Thing and the Human Torch were both excellent choices for their parts, unfortunately though pretty much everyone else is a bad choice. The guy playing Mr. Fantastic is way too young to play the part of the genius and the team's voice of reason. Mr. Fantastic in the comics is like in his early 50s and this man wasn't even in his early 30s... The same goes for Jessica Alba, although i can't complaint about seeing her for 120 minutes or so in a skin tight outfit but there's no chance in hell she'd pass for a genius in biology. She doesn't even look old enough to have finished college for Pete's Sake. Finally we have Dr. Doom. The problem with the guy playing him is that he doesn't look evil at all... He has to be the most unconvincing villain i have ever seen.<br/><br/>Now i can't say that i wasted two hours of my life watching Fantastic Four. It was quite faun, it was filled with funny scenes and it definitely did have its very good moments and one can't say that it was boring. But after all those excellent comic book movies out there like X-2, Spider-Man and Batman: Begins the bar has been raised high and Fantastic Four certainly didn't have what it takes to go over it. Just your average Super-Hero movie then and to paraphrase Blur's On Your Own: It's not that good but it's not that bad... 5/10"

I just wish that those idiots that made Batman Begins the dull waste of film that it is would've had a chance to study a movie like this before churning out their absurd effort at a sequel/prequel/relaunch.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is near perfect on every level. It is tight and lean and superbly done. The action is second to none and some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed- What the Human Torch does as that missle draws down on him is remarkable! Ioan Gruffudd could be the next Mel Gibson. Jessica Alba has a huge role and brings a level of emotion to the movie (not to mention sexuality) that summer blockbusters rarely have. You knew Michael Chiklis would be excellent and hearing those classic words. ""IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME"" never sounded so good. The cast certainly didn't disappoint. A nod must go out to the director as well. He juggles all these characters and plot points just beautifully but keeps the pace quick. Better then any summer film I've seen this year."

","I was sad that the critical reviews made this series such a difficult one to carry through. The cast is immensely likeable and the sequel was even better than the opener, which basically explained how it all started.

","It was not as good has Batman Begins, but it was good in its own right. Taking from the Marvel comic book pages. There was a 1993 film version, which I heard was so bad it was nowhere to be found. This film was quite enjoyable, not cheap at all, and I believe it will be everywhere on DVD, unlike the 1993 version. The film starts out when Reed Richards(Ioan Grufford) and his nice but quick tempered friend Ben Grimm(Michael Chiklis) make a plan to go up in space, with his billionaire old friend Victor Von Doom(Juilan McMahon), and scientist, and Reeds ex-girlfriend Sue Richards(Jessica Alba) and her hotheaded younger brother Johnny(Chris Evans) come along for the ride. But they soon have an accident in space when they all get hit with cosmic rays. And they come back to earth with different super-powers. Reed: can flex farther then normal. Sue: can turn invisible and make force fields. Ben: turns into a rock like creature with incredible strength, and can not be hurt. Johnny: can turn into flames, and fly. And that is all I'm gonna tell you about the movie. To all readers, you will not be disappointed."

It had great action and great special effects. I thought it was better than both X- Men films. I don't think this summer has that many great movies other than Batman Begins. I thought the cast was perfect and there wasn't a minute of the film where I was bored by them. The effects were amazing including The Thing played by Michael Chiklis who filmed the whole film in the actual costume. Jessica Alba was hot as always. Chris Evans was really funny. Ioan Gruffudd did a great job and should be well known for this role and Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck was so awesome as Dr. Doom. He was one of the best parts about the film. This movie was one of the best I have seen recently along with Batman Begins and Sin City.

"David_Frames","4","14","23","2 December 2005"," Banter, Alba and expensive special effects paid for by cynical advertisers
","...but wasn't it fun! Well..a bit. I liked Alba's jumpsuit! For the most part though Fantastic Four (note the irritating loss of the group's personal pronoun)is a photo-chemical womb incubating a stillborn celluloid-foetus. It just might be the most cynically commercial movie you've seen in years. In fact, if your one of the gazillion companies(including Fox of course who made it in the first place) who paid up front to get the human torch on ESPN or the Thing to wear Nikes, then you must be delighted to watch a flick in which the only real characters are the corporate sponsors and the only reason to keep watching is the (vain) hope that Jessica will take off her clothes prematurely before she becomes translucent. Sure, its colourful, inoffensive stuff - cine-ice cream you might say (and even if you wouldn't, I have) but these comic book flicks don't have to be so light do they? X-men, which began this noughties marvel onslaught, had vague pretencions of substance, Batman Begins wasn't entirely mindless - it doesn't have to be this way y'know. In fact watching the Four, you're reminded of why the film snobs hate Hollywood. Its Crude, over blown commercial candy floss with admittedly likable stars who get to do very little but joke around in the kind of self-satisfied tongue in cheek style we all despise. Fox should remember that the kind of limp and fluffy Eighties comic-flicks this often resembles lead to a death of these movies toward of the end of that decade. No more of this please."

It was a fun movie, especially for someone who has never really had interest in comic books. I guess all those comic junkies just have high expectations. Ah well.<br/><br/>The action sequences were fun and despite the PG-13 rating, they didn't seem to ""traumatize"" my 4 year old daughter. (Which is good, because I received a lot of flak for taking her to a PG-13 movie LOL).<br/><br/>In short, I'm really glad she begged me to see it, because I was a little skeptical at first, but I completely felt for the characters. Especially Ben. Not every movie has that one guy/gal you just feel so bad for. Well, some of them try, but sometimes they just come off as annoying.

"pooh-24","2","15","25","13 June 2007"," Four On The Floor
","After making movies for their other comic book titles like Spiderman, The X-Men, the Hulk, Daredevil, among others, Marvel Comics goes about and makes a film about the characters that started it all for the Marvel Universe, The Fantastic Four. Yes Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm , and Ben Grimm are brought to life in a feature film that will give them the respect and studio money that the marvel title that was billed ""The World's Greatest Comic Book Magazine"" deserves. Well it was planned that way anyway.<br/><br/>But something happened along the way that is quite apparent that the new Fantastic Four film didn't quite meet expectations. The story is about four people, Reed,Sue,Johnny and Ben going in a private rocket ship ,funded by Reed's own money, to reach the moon. The ship doesn't reach its' destination and goes through a massive storm of cosmic rays that transform Reed, Sue,Johnny, and Ben into people with fantastic powers. This does not happen in the film however:<br/><br/>The space flight is done for different reasons. The flight is funded by the very successful Victor Von Doom , who in the picture, is the finance of Sue. Von Doom goes with the four on the fateful flight and receives a dose of cosmic rays as well. A tremendous change from the origin of the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe that one sees in the comics.<br/><br/>The four find out about their powers in a very different fashion than they did in the comics. Quite naturally, their portrayals don't even come close to bringing out the Fantastic Four and fleshing them out as deep well rounded characters.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffred looks lost as Mister Fantastic. Reed in the comics was a highly successful confident man(Tim Robbins would have been great as Reed). Gruffred ,no matter how one looks at it, isn't Reed Richards.His chemistry with everyone in the movie is readily not apparent.<br/><br/>I know many studio executives may have thought that making Jessica Alba as Sue Storm would bring in a lot of publicity for the film and it may have. But to say a studio can't find a blond white woman to play Sue (Say Naomi Watts) is incredible. I am not a hater or anything but Sue in the comics wasn't Hispanic like Alba is. Alba and her acting skills left a lot to be desired too. Having Jessica Alba playing a scientist is a bit of a stretch that not even Reed Richards with his powers could reach.<br/><br/>Johnny Storm in the comics was a teenager so it is hard to believe Chris Evans was to play Sue's younger brother. Huh? Evans and Alba don't even look like brother and sister(The danger of the stunt casting just mentioned above.) and Evans looks older than Alba. He does do a decent job playing a hard edged Johnny Storm. He seems to be the only member of the four who enjoys his new found powers.<br/><br/>That can't be said for Ben, who now has become a large body of orange rock thanks to the accident. Michael Chilkis does a fine job playing the unfortunate Thing. But he like Alba seem to have no great chemistry with Gruffred. Alba and Gruffred have absolutely no chemistry with each other at all. Gruffred is old enough to be Alba's older brother but not really suited to be her love interest.<br/><br/>Why they had to make the blind Alicia Masters into a black woman (Kerry Washington) for the movie is not easily understandable. Her comment about not being accepted by society when she meets Ben in the bar late in the film is smacks of political correctness not real human frustration.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon makes for a serviceable Doctor Doom. But changing his story, changing how he met Reed and how he became Dr. Doom hurt the film the most. The Reed/Doom rivalry of great masterminds, one for good one for evil, is totally lost in the shuffle. As with everything else Gruffred seems to have no chemistry in his dealings with McMahon. The Richards/Von Doom rivalry is ruined even more.<br/><br/>There is not enough action in Fantastic Four to make it an exciting movie. At the very best it is just serviceable. The final showdown between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom is one quick let down. The showdown is over and done with before you know it.<br/><br/>Director Tim Story(Barbershop) seems as if he didn't really put his best foot forward into this movie.The acting, at times, is stilted and awkward. Marvel Comics could have found a better producer for this film than Story.<br/><br/>Whereas Marvel hit two home runs with Spiderman and the X-Men, with the Fantastic Four, Marvel gets a single but gets thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. As with the creators of The Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle not having Jay Ward around to help that movie out,the creators of this Fantastic Four movie didn't have the mentoring of its' real creator, the late Jack Kirby. Stan Lee may have had his little cameo in the film. But the spirit, the flair, and the imagination of Jack Kirby was truly missing with this film. It only goes to show how much studio executives and their focus groups do to ruin feature films through their lack of imagination, their lack of experience in film making, and their own greed.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is one of those types of films. We all thought that with this film, we could forget the small budget Roger Corman FF film of 1994. But it seems like we shall have to wait somewhere in the future for giving The Fantstic Four the type of film they and their fans and movie fans everywhere really deserve."
"KeyserSoyousay","9","57","115","23 June 2005"," Fantastic Four is truly fantastic!
","The Fantastic Four is an excellent movie. It contains heartfelt pathos, and stunning action. Believe me, you have not seen action like this, before. The people in special effects need to be applauded. Caught it at an early screening, and Man! This one of the best comic-book movies of the year behind Batman and Sin City. And the ""Dr. Doom"" twist at the end was pure genius! The actors(and actresses) fit well into their parts. This is about as good Spider-Man and X-men rolled into one. But enough praise. Like all comic-book movies, it contains a high level of camp. Maybe a bit too much. I was also worried about the motorcycle scene. It is good special effects, but unneeded in a film such as this. Overall, it's a great movie and I am happy to give this 8 out of 10."
"dngilp","10","36","69","18 July 2005"," Finally, a human sci-fi movie that delivers on the comic books' tone and feel.
","When this movie ended, the full house actually broke into spontaneous applause, which I hadn't witnessed at a movie since E.T. The Fantastic Four is just pure, unadulterated fun, with a simple story, an interesting human conflict, four interesting characters, and delightful actors strutting their fine stuff. There are jokes that make you laugh without straining, underdogs you WANT to root for, and a very well-acted bad guy (Julian Mahon). All the characters are interesting, believable, fun, witty, and not too dark. There is NO embarrassingly trite and out-of-context sub-plot, such as the RIDICULOUS ninja characters in Batman Begins. Fantastic Four is just a simple, witty tale of 4 ordinary people who are trying to deal with the curse or gift of superpowers. It's a true beginning to what I hope is several more episodes.<br/><br/>Director Tim Story really succeeded in delivering a fresh, witty tale of a family that is both ordinary and super-ordinary, that we can all identify with, yet which represents the best in all of us. It's the kind of tale that Steven Spielberg would have produced.<br/><br/>The audience contained viewers of all ages: Kids from 8 to 80. There were comic book freaks wearing Fantastic Four T-shirts and beards, moms with their kids, teen-agers, and a smattering of adults for this afternoon movie on opening day. People loved the movie, and I guess they responded like me: I feel jaded by watching the overblown 'special effects' of computer-generated armies of millions (a la the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, where it's obvious that nothing is real). I'm equally tired of movies like Batman, where the tone and atmosphere is so dark or distorted that you can't tell what is happening or where it takes place.<br/><br/>I think the reason most people are staying away from movies this summer is because they are tired of un-believable characters and of movies that hide their lack of a good plot line with increasingly silly and extravagant special effects, gratuitous violence and sex. What we want is a good story, good acting, and believable people told in a fresh and witty way. Fantastic Four shows what a great movie should be about. It's not a Game Boy extravaganza. It's a diverting, interesting tale with five really interesting actors having a lot of fun. Everyone and their kids can see it and enjoy it."
"sfoston","9","36","69","14 July 2005"," The best movie of the summer!
","The Fantastic Four was definitely a movie worthy of the summer slam jam. Yeah, it may have been missing such things as a ""meaningful plot"" but who cares? Was this story intended for such a thing? No! This movie was all about fun; Action-packed and full of super-heroes with awesome powers saving the day. What more could one want in a movie? This film gave the viewer the thrill of an amusement park ride from start to finish. At the end, all I could think was, ""it's over already?"" I think this movie could have easily been three hours long and still not have been long enough.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd of King Arthur fame performed Reed Richards(Mr. Fantastic) as I envisioned. The only problem I had with his portrayal was his age. Jessica Alba (Sin City, Dark Angel) played Sue Storm, also known as the ""Invisible Woman"", to the best of her ability. Not exactly who I would have seen play this role, but all in all, gave her best performance. I must say Michael Chicklas (The Shield, The Commish) was the best choice to play the lovable, tough guy, Ben Grimm better known as ""The Thing."" When it came to ""clobbering time"" his performance was notably off the hook! Finally, Chris Evans (Cellular) gave a great performance as Johnny Storm, also known as ""the human torch."" <br/><br/>It seems the films of this summer have been critiqued before they have been given a chance to run. Do not be fooled! The Fantastic Four is an awesome film and offers a great time to be had by all. My hat off to Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Tim Story. Thank you for the fun and.. ""Flame on!!!"""
"Zarniwoop42","10","34","65","8 July 2005"," Just what the Fantastic 4 should be.
","This was an excellent adaptation of the comic book. It is the story of real people that undergo huge changes and then learn to cope with those changes. This is the movie I hoped would be made. I recommend it not only to comic book fans, but also to anyone who wants to see a good movie. Don't be swayed by the critics and naysayers. This is an excellent film that can be enjoyed by all. I listened to the crowd as I left the theater and heard only positive comments. Both young and old appeared to enjoy the movie. The crowd reaction during the movie was appropriate. Many people were laughing out loud during the comic bits. And they gave a nice round of applause at the end."

","Just got back from seeing this movie..... WOW! I was blown away.... I feel sorry for the younger kids who never had the pleasure of claymation special effects like us old folks did. Today, it's hard to tell the real from the effects, and this ability is played to the hilt in Fantastic 4.<br/><br/>Johnny Storm playing with fire... I got a kick out of that. And when Reed Richards slipped his hand under the door. Oh Man... Of couse anyone that looks like Susan Storm is easy to watch.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies I've seen this year that I'd be willing to pay to see again. Truly a Don't Miss."

","Greetings again from the darkness. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the Saturday morning cartoon series and was very saddened when it was taken off the air due to parental concerns over violent images. Humorous when one compares to the video games that so pre-occupy the days of today's kids. The appeal of the Fantastic Four was always the isolation and camaraderie of this team. Most super heroes were isolated by their superpowers, but these four could depend on each other and were much stronger as a team than individually.<br/><br/>Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were co-writers on Spider-man, Hulk and many others. My feelings were always that they had something special with this group. Director Tim Story is handicapped with a pretty weak cast, although Julian McMahon (""Charmed"", ""Nip/Tuck"") does a decent job as Victor Von Doom and Michael Chiklis (""The Shield"" and a memorable ""Seinfeld"") is very good as Ben Grimm/The Thing. On the other hand, Jessica Alba and Ion Gruffodd (TV's ""Hornblower"" series) recite their lines as if threatened by electric shock if they blow one. Chris Evans seems to have fun with the most energetic role of Johnny Storm but there is just not enough for him to do.<br/><br/>Special Effects in this one are pretty decent, but the movie watches as if we are reading a comic book. I realize we are, but most of the comic-to-film projects have at least made an effort to provide a script that flows and has passable dialogue between characters. Fantastic Four makes no such attempts. This is a cartoon in every sense and that really causes it to pale in comparison to especially Spider-man, but even Hulk."
"tanto87","4","31","59","10 July 2005"," 60 years of material for 90 min. of this?!
","Even when I walked into F4 today I didn't have many high hopes - i.e. I was not impressed with the uninspired choice of Tim Story to direct (what happened to all of Marvel's great choices for directors: Ang Lee, Bryan Singer), I was on the CGI Thing bandwagon, Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom; what? - but there was still that little hope inside of me that this film was going to completely turn the tables on me and be much better than expected. I even went as far as to avoid any and all reviews for the film; as well as keeping myself from the F4 page on IMDb. I wanted to give this movie every chance in the world because, honestly, Marvel and Fox have 60 some years of absolutely wonderful material here. The problem is that they dumbed it down incredibly. I would be happy with the changes they made worked, but they didn't. The first ten minutes -something I consider CRUCIAL in a film - were absolutely dead of any real challenge and felt bland; as though the production just wanted to skip ahead of all of the science and characters and jump straight ahead to the powers. Each character was given little to no set-up; especially Ben Grimm, what was the point in following Reed Richards around everywhere? The choice to make Victor Von Doom the CEO of some big shot corporation was also very uninspired as well; it seems that these superhero adaptations are doing it too much nowadays. And the fact that his subplot is SO similar to Norman Osborne's in SPIDER-MAN makes me frown. I felt that if they kept Doom in Latveria the film still could have been pulled off without a hitch, even if the real big shots in Hollywod think that a megalomaniac ruler of a country is so not scary; yet the CEO is terrifying? This still bothers me to this moment because Dr. Doom is already perfectly set up. If Richard's ran into the problem of NASA not funding his little space experiment, what would he be able to do with an entire countries resources and money? The experiment also bothered me as to why it wasn't set up enough. You never got a full and clear reason why the experiment was necessary to study the evolution of genes, but then again, it could be me. I also abhorred the fact that McMahon's Doom was not a frightening or imposing character at all. In all honesty, I get scared just looking at my Marvel Legends Dr. Doom action figure and what he would be like in all of his evil fury upon the big screen. Shall I suggest someone with a more sinister voice: Ralph Fiennes. Not only is he a superb actor, but he can embody Doom perfectly. I refer you to RED DRAGON. It appears as though I will have to wait for his characterization of Voldemort in the upcoming Harry Potter to get my perfect Doom. As far as the actors go, none of their performances particularly rang convincing in my head; not even Michael Chiklis as the Thing, and I am a great fan of THE Shield. While Ioan Gruffold is a great casting choice, he just wasn't that believable; I would have liked to see more Chris Reeve as Clark Kent moments for the nerdy scientist. I have nothing against the choice of Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, but give her something else to do instead of an excuse to catch her with her clothes off or look cute. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm was believable as a hothead, but he got to be a bit to extreme. And I mean that in the fact that if I saw another extreme sporting moment, my head would have burst with that awful soundtrack they set each one to. What happened to the good old days of a score, dubbing, and sound effects-only soundtrack? Speaking of scores, John Ottman's original score felt like a contrived mess of rejected X2 themes and I will keep that opinion until I get my copy of the score in the mail in the next few weeks. Oliver Wood's cinematography felt like a blatant copy of Don Burgess' lighting from SPIDER-MAN. The fact that Tim Story lacks any particular vision is also a huge setback, considering that comics are such a visual medium with great artists who personify their characters. I would give the example of Ang Lee's HULK, but many don't like the film. I am perfectly fine with the Hulk that I was given and felt every inch was done with expert craftsmanship and understanding of the dual nature of the character. I didn't feel that way in F4. It felt like a rushed studio attempt at a great thing. The lack of a true plot was also a great setback, considering that it could have been a great one. Very little seems to happen in the course of the 90-minute film (and it's only 90-minutes, that should tell you something), and the final and only confrontation with Doom is a cheap gimmick and feels so small as opposed to the epic it could have been with a better director, more inspired casting choices, characters that mattered, and a really sinister villain that you want to hate. <br/><br/>All in all, Fox and Marvel failed. They failed to bring Marvel's first beloved characters to the big screen; they failed to deliver a satisfying thrill for the fans and the average moviegoer; they failed to make a good thing great. I would go as far as to say that they failed to make a popcorn movie roller-coaster fun. Seeing as that I got my tickets free with the new DVD releases of MAN ON FIRE and I, ROBOT, it was the only way that I would have seen this movie had I known it would be this disappointing."
"nickatcsu","10","31","59","8 July 2005"," Great movie! Give it a chance! Go see it ignoring the biased reviewers.
","First of all there are apparently people here who are determined to make this movie look bad without even seeing it and then there are those who are saying it is the best film of the year. Look at the star rating statistics (as of now 120 people said Fantastic Four only gets one star and then there are hundreds of people saying it got ten stars)! To me that shows no one has even seen this movie as it's star rating lies near the middle.<br/><br/>I took the risk and saw it today and I had an open mind about it. I myself would give it 7 stars out of 10. I think many people think this movie is garbage simply because of the Thing's and Doctor Doom's costumes from the trailers. However the Thing and many of his comments made this movie very enjoyable. In fact I would rank the Thing character as being in second place with having a cool, entertaining attitude next to Hugh Jacksman's portrayal of Wolverine.<br/><br/>This movie was not predictable and it had lots of humor. This movie is very fun just like the first Spider-man. In fact if this came out before Spider-man it would have been just as successful as the first Spider-man.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect for families to take their kids to during this summer of dark movies. I think it will be the families who will make this movie a success. Closed minded teenagers however won't be seeing this, but as a comic fan, I am very happy with this movie and I hope they make more sequels! Like I said, it's just as fun as Spider-man so why aren't people cutting that up? Give it a chance!"

The characters had heart and the story was well written. I hope that they do a sequel it would be worth it. Me as a woman in my opinion the guys were hot. I like the Marvel comic genre of movies and this one did not disappoint me at all. I hope that you agree with me but this is my opinion on the movie and I hope it helps yo to want to see this movie. But believe me there is plenty of action as there are in marvel movies and heart it won't disappoint its good for all to see it may also prove a good date movie."
"spywannabe86","10","29","55","14 July 2005"," Fun-tastic!
","This adaptation of the comic is really refreshing, especially this summer. With remakes filling the big screen, it's fun to see something that takes a classic and makes it new again while not alienating its roots. True, you can't take it too seriously, but it was never meant to be serious. It's escapist fantasy and it's just what Hollywood needed to get out of its recent slump. I'd definitely recommend seeing this one. Ioan Gruffudd (a fabulous Welsh actor) does a great job portraying the scientifically minded Reed Richards, Jessica Alba shines as Sue Storm, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans are hilarious as brotherly rivals while Julian McMahon does a great job as the evil Dr. Von Doom. I've seen it once and I'm definitely going back. <br/><br/>Have a fantastic summer!"
"DICK STEEL","10","29","55","6 July 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Four
","OK, I admit I've always been a closet Fantastic Four fan. Before Stan Lee created the better known Spider-man, Hulk, X-Men, he created Fantastic Four, touted as the World's Greatest Comics Magazine, back in the 60s. Reed Richards is Mr Fantastic, Sue Storm/Richards is The Invisible Girl, her brother Johnny Storm is The Human Torch, and Richard's best friend / one time Sue's ex is Ben Grimm, aka The Thing.<br/><br/>This is not the first time that the origin has been recreated in film (the first one being a desperate attempt to secure movie rights, and is a tacky B-production), but this is the version that's done so right.<br/><br/>And I dare say this is the BEST Marvel comic book adaptation ever, staying very true to its characterization just as Stan Lee envisioned it to be. Classic touches include the bickering amongst the characters and of course the very cliché (perhaps FF popularized it?) basic plot of cooperation and teaming is stronger than the individual. The spot-on rivalry between Johnny and Ben, the use of their powers on one another (always liked it when Richards overpower Ben), and the costumes themselves serve a purpose, highlighting the Invisible Girl's curves... oops, I mean the suits being exposed to the same radiation and adapting the same properties as its wearer, and Ben's fedora and brown trench-coat looked so in place.<br/><br/>I could go on, like Richard's vow to Ben to help his tragic friend (and themselves) reverse the effects on their DNA, his overworking in their penthouse headquarters of the Baxter Building, the rejection of The Thing's appearance by the public, Johnny's impulsiveness and crave for popularity, and Sue's peacemaker role amongst the boys. What I also liked is that this film takes its time to develop their arch-nemesis Victor Von Doom, as his transformation takes place throughout the movie until the finale.<br/><br/>Compared to Spider-man, there isn't a sappy romance to slow things down (and Mary J Watson was never Peter Parker's first!), nor are there too many heroes and villains like X-Men such that each character has limited screen time because of the focus on its most popular character Wolverine. In this film, each character has their own adequate share of the limelight, though I must mention that the Human Torch outshone the rest in set action pieces, while The Thing stole the show with humour. The film doesn't seem too long (about the same duration as the original X-Men), but it manages to pack all the action, emotion, backstory nicely as one summer flick.<br/><br/>Kudos to the casting team in bringing together actors who look the role too. Although 3 out of 5 stars are more goggle box actors (Alba, McMahon, Chilklis), they sure looked comfortable in their outing on the big screen.<br/><br/>If two's a company, and three's a crowd, then Four's just FANtastic! Looking at box office numbers, I don't think it'll outdo Spider-man, but I'm still game for a sequel - they can bring on Galactus for all I care! Look out for the cameo appearance of Stan Lee, whom you always expect in a Marvel adaptation that meets expectations!"
"zatornator11","10","34","66","8 July 2005"," The Best Movie Of The Year!!!! 4 Fantastic Stars!
","This movie was the best movie that I've seen this year. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I loved the way they incorporated the humor and action. The acting was great, the special effects were beyond belief. I don't know what people are thinking when they say this movie is boring. I can name boring movies, and this was not one. DO YOU EVEN WATCH THE MOVIE? The directing was superb and they picked the perfect actors to portray the roles.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba was fantastic playing The Invisible Women. And I really liked the Human Torch, wow what a funny guy. Michael Chickless did a superb job, and I've got to hand it to them for not using a lot of CGI to do the Thing. It was perfect. The person who played Doom was great. When I hate a villain so much that I want to get rid of him, the actor did a great job. And last buy not least Mr. Fantastic. He was great too. Like I said, perfect actors for the perfect roles.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the battle between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic 4. Doom sure thought a lot of himself. Do you think you can get rid of the Fantastic 4 that easy? Boring is not the word to describe this movie, the word is FANTASTIC! This movie goes right beside Spiderman and X-Men. I am definitely buying this movie the day it comes out on DVD. Heck I may watch it again in theaters.<br/><br/>PS: Critics are dumb, I don't think they know a good movie when they see it. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed. Trust me"

","In my humble opinion this is one of the best Marvel movies I have seen. It just seems to capture the Fantastic Four exactly how I remember them from the comics.<br/><br/>All the main characters Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm are pretty much perfect. Jessica Alba as Sue Storm is brilliant and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm stands out as just about the perfect 'Thing'.<br/><br/>The only downside for me was Victor Von Doom who just wasn't evil enough and missed what the comics showed him to be.<br/><br/>However I thought the movie was great with some pretty impressive special effects."
"imajestr","1","7","10","28 December 2006"," Horrible, Horrible Movie.
","This is one of the worst comic book adaptations I have ever seen. Yes, it's even worse than Daredevil. If you like quality film making and coherent movies with believable characters and an interesting plot, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>The dialogue and the characters are so cheesy I literally had a hard time trying to stay in the room while this movie played. There is essentially no character development. The plot is not captivating, and there's quite a lack of anything like a climax. The effects are mediocre, but the character interactions and dialogue really take away from any possible impressiveness of those effects that are well done.<br/><br/>I never read any of the comic books, but I don't think it's fair saying that you have to be a fan of the comics to enjoy the movie. If I wanted to read a comic book I wouldn't be seeing the movie, I'd be reading the comic book. I don't know if the tone and uh, cheesiness that's found in the movie is the same as in the comics, but I hope not. Either way, this movie has failed as entertainment. I don't know why people like it at all, unless of course they are younger than the average moviegoer.<br/><br/>As a summary, if you're looking for a good action/super hero movie, watch the second Spider-Man movie or the first two X-men movies, those are at least entertaining and well done."
"galahad58","1","28","53","6 December 2005"," Fantastic flop
","Fantastic Four was a joke. FF was a complete mess from the first frame until the last frame. The acting was sub par, the script was absolutely ridiculous and the direction was juvenile. Only one thing was remotely decent in this movie: the special effects. I did not think that a superhero film could be worse than ""The Hulk"", but I was wrong. FF makes ""The Hulk"" look like a great piece of film making. It is too bad that Spiderman and Batman have resurrected the comic book movie industry. Since Hollywood is swamped with terrible screenwriters, we have only to look forward to pitiful interpretations of comic heroes. The Spiderman and Batman Begins will be the rare treat we can hope for among this mess of garbage (Hulk, Daredevil, Electra, and Fantastic Four)."

With the sadness of The Things story with his fiancé breaking up with him. The movie was superb and I cannot wait for the two sequels. Where are the Things ears? Was Stan Lee the right man to play Willie Lumpkin? Would it have been better if Chris Evans would have dyed his hair blond? Was it right to have Doom come with the four into space? Why did Dooms armor come from his skin? Why didn't Doom set off more then two heat seaking missiles at Johnny? These questions we may never find out. They will always riddle our heads.

"Rooster99","4","17","30","8 May 2006"," Very disappointing.
","FF was slow, clichéd, and dull. The special effects were fine, but you had to wait until the final fight scene to see them. The first 80 minutes were all very typical, very obvious, and very boring character development. All of the ""emotional"" moments were telegraphed from a mile away, and used dialog repeated a thousand times in other films. There was absolutely no deviation from the standard action-movie formula, this movie was as boring as Elektra. I did not go and see FF expecting ""Gone with the Wind"", but nor did I go to see the incredibly lame and dumbed-down script. I urge you to click on the ""Memorable Quotes"" link in IMDb for this movie, and you will see that none of them are at all memorable. Most are groaners. This movie was one giant cliché from start to finish.<br/><br/>As superhero movies go, it had no originality. The bridge scene was well done, but completely ridiculous at the same time. At one point they convince Jessica Alba to take off her clothes (no nudity) and turn herself invisible because they can't get past the police line on the bridge. She does so, with the obvious moment when she flashes back to visibility in her underwear, but then moments later, all 4 of the FF are standing on the part of the bridge they couldn't' get to earlier, along with a huge crowd including Ben Grimm's ex-fiancé. It was terribly obvious that the Alba scene was added just to titillate Alba fans as it had nothing to do with the plot (and was not that titillating either). There really were only 2 actions sequences in the entire film; the bridge scene and the final fight. Both were well done (in terms of graphics) but the rest of the movie was a boring mishmash of dull dialog and Soap-opera plot development.<br/><br/>One further note. I urge you to sort these comments in IMDb by ""Loved It"" and just have a look at the comments from people who rated it a 10. Almost all of them have only ever rated one movie, and they use language telling you how well the director developed the characters, how well the script worked, that it was the best summer movie of 2005, etc. It is so incredibly obvious that all of these comments are plants by the studio to boost the IMDb ratings. Is nothing sacred any longer? One ""person"" who actually did rate more than one movie conveniently gave 10's to all of 20th Century Fox's offerings in 2005 (FF, Elektra), and very poor ratings to every one of their competitors (War of the Worlds, Sin City, both of which were far better than this incredibly formulaic film).<br/><br/>4/10"
"MinorityReporter","5","17","30","15 January 2006"," A new day is dawning! The day of the Fantastic Four!
","This film is hilarious! It is also highly entertaining and light hearted and more importantly it has the spirit of the comics and opposed to many other comic book features it doesn't have any pretensions to be something its not. I don't know why people are so negative towards this film. Obviously its not as good as Batman Begins the other super hero extravaganza of the summer but it is definitely entertaining and most actors are very well cast.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd who was extraordinarily bad in King Arthur proves that he does have talent and is worthy of being a leading actor in Hollywood. His performance as Reed Richards is unique. Not exactly like in the comics where Reed is a much older man. Instead Gruffudd makes Reed a nerdy science rat and that worked too. Rising superstar Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm and she is smoking hot. Seeing her in the blue Fantastic Four outfit really had my heart pumping but there is more to her than her pretty face and her body she actually does a somewhat decent job in bringing Sue to life. Unfortunately the chemistry between her and Gruffudd is somewhat lacking and this makes their scenes together seem a bit forced. Chris Evans is just plain funny and provides some of the best laughs in the film and his persona fits the character of Johnny Storm very well. I could not imagine anyone else in that character. He is hot-headed, brash childish and 100% lovable. Michael Chiklis has the best performance in the film and really brings out all the characteristics of Ben Grimm. He works great both as a comedic actor but also in the dramatic scenes. In short, he is excellent. The only part where I feel the casting falls short is in Julian McMahon as Doctor Doom. He spends too much time being suave and sophisticated so when the time comes for him to start being menacing it doesn't work. He is decent enough, however, but I guess the fact that in the comics Doctor Doom is pretty much the ultimate bad guy and with that kind of expectations you're bound to be a little disappointed. Stan Lee has his trademark cameo. Unfortunately this time around they gave him dialog and he is not much of an actor and his scene comes off a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>In terms of writing the film is not as sharp and well written as other films in the genre, most notably X-Men, but the dialog is light hearted and entertaining and some of the exchanges between Chiklis and Evans are genuinely funny. As previously stated the scenes between Alba and Gruffudd are somewhat forced. This comes, in large part, down to the writing. Their scenes are painfully American and clichéed and can be strainfull to watch. When critizising the script Dr. Doom much be mentioned as he is by no means the bad guy you could have hoped for. Much of McMahon's dialog is pretty dodgy and not as good as it could have been. The origins of the characters are almost exactly what they were in the comics and this was good. Also I found it good that not too much time was spent on the origin as this could have slowed the film down considerably. Another slight point of critique is that the movie is too short. I would have liked it to be just 10 - 15 minutes longer just to get more out of the characters.<br/><br/>The effects were generally very well done and had a comic book feel to them which is of course appropriate. Chiklis' costume was very well done and it was probably better having it this way rather than have The Thing done in a computer as it would probably have lessened the humanity of the character. Besides the only computer generated character to date that have worked fully as it was intended was Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. Speaking of computer generated images The Human Torch is undoubtedly the best eye candy of the movie and he does indeed look absolutely amazing. Not completely believable but then again it is a comic book movie. Two thumbs way up! Doctor Doom and The Invicible Woman work as well and Doom's mask is pretty menacing and contrary to popular belief he is not inspired by Darth Vader it is the other way around. Mr. Fantastic work the first time you see the film but after having seen the film a few times you get to see that he is obviously computer generated.<br/><br/>Overall Fantastic Four is not the best film of the year but it is very entertaining and definitely worth a look. The market is flooded with superhero movies these days and Fantastic Four doesn't really bring anything new to the screen which is probably why it scores so low on IMDb.<br/><br/>6/10"

Susan's powers look great sometimes, particularly at the end when she conjures up a massive shield.<br/><br/>the script is funny at times (in a campy way), & sloppy at others. i found myself rolling my eyes at some scenes, particularly the ones between reed and Susan (especially when they talk about their failed relationship, & argue about their love life) & those with Ben Grimm dealing with his physical appearance. i wish they had just removed the Alicia character altogether. i wish they would have also edited out the scenes with his wife (or fiancée, i don't really know). the scene with the engagement/wedding ring was just unforgivably laughable. while Tim story was obviously trying to go for some emotional depth, i'd prefer having a paper-thin thing than having to bear those excruciatingly painful moments.<br/><br/>Chris Evan's was funny. he played the egotistical airhead & lady killer pretty well. but his character was overdone sometimes & bordered on being ridiculously stupid. he's totally one-dimensional (always arrogant & stubborn, & always excited & impulsive).i wish they would have added more depth to the character. all we get is him and Susan fighting all the time about his behavior, which, not surprisingly, changes nothing.<br/><br/>the guy who played Victor Von Doom (forgot his name) was also fairly menacing. he's a natural villain, until he puts his mask on. i was expecting him to put on a Darth Vader-esquire voice. that didn't happen. they could have changed his voice to make him seem more threatening, but they didn't. we get his natural voice, and instead of being scared by him, one can only laugh at how ridiculous he sounds with that mask on.<br/><br/>the final showdown was breathtaking at times, but again the poor quality of the CGI was magnified with Mr. fantastic's display of the wide range of his powers. it was also pretty short, leaving one wanting.<br/><br/>it's a happy ending for the F4, with the final scenes obviously setting us up for another round. i'm pretty certain 20th century fox will be reasonable enough by then to dump Tim story for a director with actual talent.<br/><br/>i give it a 6/10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","1","24","45","28 August 2005"," Horrid writing, deplorable casting and acting that would make B-movie actors look away in shame
","Seldom do you see a movie that looks so bad from the beginning, that no matter how many fanatics tell you it's great, no matter how often the thought that it might actually not be that bad hits you, it doesn't even in the least affect that deep down, in your core, you know it will be just as bad as you knew from the start. This is one such movie. I've spent the last twenty or so minutes searching for something, anything in the film that should, nay, must raise the rating above the absolute lowest score I could give it... with no luck. The plot makes little to no sense. It's clearly just put together in order to bring the comic book characters to the big screen. It also seems like the writer(s?) didn't have more than one idea for the script, so he just reused it over and over. One of the members are unhappy... start a fight, get angry, leave. That takes place two or three times during the film, with little to nothing separating them. Just as they get back together, someone new is discontent. That's not a film, that's a bunch of different takes on the same short stitched together to reach minimum length for a feature film. The pacing seems non-existent. Scenes go on and on, and there's no telling how far you are from the end. The acting is mostly bad. The casting is completely off, for pretty much(did I say pretty much? Scratch that) every character. Susan Storm as a mulatto? Reed Richards as a thirty-something? What is wrong with you people? Also, let me just make it clear, I'm not a fan of the comics whatsoever. I loathe their powers, I hate Johnny Storm and I despise how much everyone else(other superheroes included) look up to them. So I'm not one to criticize inaccuracies. But come on! The writing is incredibly poor. There are lines that make no sense, lines that have no humor to them whatsoever, and lines that make you cringe... guess the writer knew it was poor and decided to just throw in everything he could. To give a quick example, one character says, in full seriousness, to describe another person: ""You're such a dork!"" Yes, honestly. Character motivations and development just isn't there. Look for it as hard as you will, it ain't there. The humor rarely ever works, and is completely juvenile in tone and nature. The writers come up with one or two scenes that have attractive actors of both genders undressing, for no other reason than eye-candy. Just for anyone who cares, no, there's no nudity, and the two actors are Jessica Alba and Chris Evans. Sure, she's hot(and I'm certain most females would think that description is fitting for Evans), but when there's no point to it whatsoever, it just leaves you feeling offended as a viewer. For a comic book movie, there's nearly no super-villain action whatsoever... there's one fight, and it's very short, at the very end. That's all, folks. Now, since there should be some positive stuff in any review, no matter how negative it is... Julian McMahon is great as Dr. Victor Von Doom, and he may actually even be well-cast. I *love* him as a villain, from seeing him on Charmed for several years, and he repeats the success here. Problem is, he has way too little to do, and far too little screen-time. Then there's the special effects... I can't deny that most of them look great. Still, those two things aren't enough to bring this above bottom rating. Less offensive to the fans than Spiderman, but more poorly produced. Just bad in pretty much every way. Keeps some of the comic book tone, but not one to make a point of seeing. I recommend this to special effects junkies and people who care just enough about the comics to see the movie, but still little enough to accept the many inaccuracies. No real fan should be subjected to it, unless he or she can accept how much they screw up. Again, it's not as bad as Spiderman on that front, but it's still pretty bad. 1/10"
"royale_w_cheez44","2","15","26","28 October 2005"," Dreadful
","Stan Lee couldn't have asked for a more lame and useless adaptation of his beloved comic ""The Fantastic Four"". I had high hopes for this film. After seeing a kickass preview with a rockin' Perfect Circle song playing in the background, I thought the action would be intensely amazing (The Thing smashing a semi! Sweet!) and that the characters would be...well...FANTASTIC (Julian McMahon! Awesome!). However, this movie was a letdown. A HUGE letdown.<br/><br/>First of all, this film lacked a decent director or a proper script. Jesus Christopher, could you think of better dialog than having Sue Storm say that ""she wanted to be seen,"" or have Johnny Storm be called a ""hothead""? Wow. Just wow. The script was clunky and it certainly wasn't funny (save for a great scene with Ben and Johnny, but that's all). By the way, if I ever hear that stupid... -Oh you're hot! -Why thank you, so are you. ...line again, I am personally going to kill Tim Story!<br/><br/>The look of the film was god awful. Most of the New York scenery was, like Harry from AICN said, straight out of Seinfeld episode. The special effects were some of the worst I have ever seen from a major motion picture. Not to mention, although it looks good from a distance, The Thing's suit looks HORRIBLY FAKE up close. Why the heck can you see the wrinkles when he's made of STONE?! Unbelievable.<br/><br/>The action. What action? There literally isn't any major fight scenes until the very end of the film. And save for the Human Torch and heat seeking missle scene, the action is slow and predictable and has a been-there-done-that feel to it.<br/><br/>The cast wasn't as bad as I heard at first. Reed should have been played by Clive Owen, and Jessica Alba can't convince me that she's a genius, no matter how smokin' hot she is. Chris Evans and Mike Chiklis do well enough; probably turning out the film's best characters. Julian McMahon let me down. His character in Nip/Tuck is so cool and well developed, while his character as Dr. Doom is really unimpressive. I can hardly blame him, though, since he didn;t make a full transformation until the last 20 minutes. Even then it wasn't as devilish or villainous as he could have been.<br/><br/>The ending...gimme a break. ""How long will he be like this?"" ""Oh...about two summers...(wink at the camera)""<br/><br/>Honestly, this is the worst superhero film I have ever seen. I might even go as far as to say that Daredevil was better. At least it had some cool fight scenes! When F4II comes out, I won't even bother to see it until they replace Tim Story and the screenwriter. Don't waste your time."
"Artslover88","9","28","54","11 July 2005"," Wonderful Movie
","I have never really been interested in comic books and such, so when I saw the movie I was pleasantly surprised by the plot line. Its always nice to see how different people can work together in a difficult situation. I came first and foremost to see Ioan Gruffudd, star of the Horatio Hornblower series, who plays the brilliant leader Dr. Reed Richards. However, after watching the movie, I came to appreciate all of the actors for their superb acting skills. The biggest challenge was the ""Human Torch"" who annoyed me to no end at the beginning, but by the end, I could see that each of the Fantastic Four, including him, had something wonderful to offer. I would definitely see this movie again. If nothing else, it showed that even the ""nerd"" can have a happy ending without it being too sappy."
"charchuk","3","14","24","17 July 2006"," Corny, unrealistic and boring
","The worst of the recent comic book adaptations, that I've seen. Attempting to combine the best parts of X-Men and Spider-Man produces none of the same result, and the film ends up flat and boring. None of the characters are that interesting or even believable; they all seem like some accelerated stereotypes. The story could be a bit more intriguing if more realism and less product placement was injected into it, but, alas, that is not the case. There are a few intentional laughs, courtesy mostly the banter between the Human Torch and the Thing, but many more unintentional laughs, courtesy mostly the relationship between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman - which occupies too much of the screen time, and reeks of a half-hearted attempt to put romance into the story. And Dr. Doom is laughably bad. All in all, not so fantastic.<br/><br/>The acting is simply dreadful, with only Chris Evans really standing out through pure charisma. Chiklis does well considering his get-up, but you never feel for the character at all. Alba is predictably wooden, but nice to look at, Gruffudd has no leading man sensibilities at all, and McMahon is about as cheesy as it gets. The dialogue is pretty bad most of the time, topped only by the amateur direction and complete lack of realism. I know most comic book stories have to suspend your belief a bit, but this is too much. Nothing about this film seems anything close to realistic - it seems to take place in a media-controlled, brand named bubble. Not compelling stuff.<br/><br/>The special effects are terrible, also. You'd think that since all the other comic book films have great effects that this one would, as well, but it doesn't. The Thing's costume looks painfully like a costume, and the other three's powers look painfully like digital effects. The music ranges from mediocre to just plain bad, especially attempting to incorporate the soundtrack songs in. The action picks up at the end, and the finale is relatively exciting, but then it's over - just like that. The climax is never built up and ends too abruptly. Overall, a poor effort."
"jmille42","1","14","24","7 July 2005"," Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers
","The summer was off to such a promising start of superhero movies with the release of the unbelievably good Batman Begins, so of course I was stoked to take in a sneak preview of Fantastic Four. Unfortunately, I was let down by the Stan Lee and Marvel Comic creation. Five scientists venture to deep space in order to study DNA patterns of the human body. All suffer severe changes from a space storm.4 for good, 1 for evil.<br/><br/>Never in my life have I seen so many people complain about having super powers. I was glad to see at least the villain Dr. Doom, played by Julian McMahon, was having a little fun with his newly found powers. Most of the film is useless ""family feud"" banter between the four ""heroes."" The only real highlight of the film is Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm played by Michael Chiklis (from televisions The Shield). Excellent make-up and voice work of this rock creature, who is the only one who can't morph back to human form, steal the show.<br/><br/>I don't think the creators were going for a comedy with this film, but that's what they got (Half the time you laugh at the poor acting). Through my disappointment overall of this film, I did find myself smiling at one crucial part of the filmJessica Alba in her bra and panties. Hey, the Invisible Woman has to disappear somehow, right? WOO-HOO!!!"
"TerryMcC","4","40","81","8 July 2005"," The first all prologue film.
","I get the impression this would have turned out better if they had just skipped the first film and made the sequel first.<br/><br/>In these sorts of films the 'origin' section is a necessary part that can be the best part or as in this one just tedious.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four it seemed to me was 95% prologue leading to nothing at all.<br/><br/>Over and over I kept thinking. ""ah, now the films going to start!"" But all that happened was more mediocre dialog from basic cable actors, keeping the pot boiling with a little not very impressive F/X, and even less impressive drama, in a film that I suspect was made by people who were uncomfortable to be making a comic book movie in the first place.<br/><br/>A fantastic four minutes at the end, the rest, in my opinion just dull."
"mparantha","10","27","52","9 July 2005"," What's with the negative reviews?
","You know, I am getting pretty repulsed by all of the negative feedback from this movie. I have seen it and thought that all of the actors excelled in their performances. Granted Julian McMahon is a television actor and rarely makes it to the big screen, he still gave a great effort, and, in my opinion, truly brought forth the true Dr. Doom from the comics: a friend to Reed Richards, a lover to Ms. Storm, and an untrusted foe by the two other characters. Even though in the comics Dr. Doom never gained true superpowers and was the filthy rich ruler of some foreign nation, the film adaption successfully created an amazing back story for an excellent movie. I think we should applaud the actors/actresses and the crew on a job-well-done."
"TheQuietStorm","1","21","39","10 September 2006"," Are you kidding me?
","I don't usually take too much time on a film that I had rated with one star. So, this should be quick.<br/><br/>I read a few reviews and see that some of the film's fans feel that it shouldn't be taken seriously because it's a comic book film that don't take itself serious. Granted, that is the case. I realized that after seeing the Brooklyn Bridge scene. Doesn't mean such a bail out disguised as a lame excuse such as this should be given to a Hollywood production. They have more than enough necessary resources to make better films. That excuse doesn't have any validity with a true film goer like myself. This is probably the worse film of 2005, definitely the worst comic book film of all time.<br/><br/>Some people compliment the acting. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Alba along with the rest of the Fantastic Four should have been called the ""OVER THE TOP POP TARTS"" instead. I think it could have been better with a stronger script and a better director. The bad acting, executing awful dialogue, prevented me from believing in the world of the story. Maybe it is suppose to be a fun comic book film, but that would never work if the individual viewer can't look past the campy acting.<br/><br/>Some people make an excuse for the writing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? With all the writers, all they can deliver is this steaming pile? I'm surprised the studio actually thought that this script worked. It would have been slung over my shoulder, hitting the trash with the quickness. BULLSEYE! The dialogue was so on the nose. Their efforts to be funny failed every time. I hated seeing how immature the characters were behaving when they were discovering their powers, which slowed the pace of the film for me. They were bickering like the siblings of ""The Incredibles (a vastly superior super hero film than this turd)."" Weren't these grown, educated people? I'm sorry fans. Get over it. This script doesn't work... at all.<br/><br/>Some complimented the directing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I mentioned the acting before. Oops... (chuckling)His bad. Not as bad as the amateurish camera work along with the poor staging of actors and extras he worked so hard to execute (Story). I didn't believe the swarm of bystanders standing around looking googly-eyed at the extraordinary things that was happening around them by the Four. The media covering the great feats played as false to me. It all felt so... fraudulent and hokey. Tim Story? Your last name doesn't compliment your abilities as a storyteller. Go back to film school.<br/><br/>The art production sucked eggs as well. The colors were too solid. Could have benefited from the film's colors being desaturated a little. This isn't really relevant but it was just one of all the things that troubled me about this film. The whole look didn't work.<br/><br/>Lastly, some of these novice film-goers loved the special effects. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! The special effects took the film down from a two to a one for me. I hated the scene where they first were given their powers. That looked like some cheesy video game with sub-par CGIs. The best effects I had seen in this film was when the fire truck came crashing through the side of the Brooklyn Bridge. That little moment made me appreciate what I was watching for that one minute out of the film's one hundred minutes.<br/><br/>Also, that whole thing between THING and Kerry Washington was so stupid, clichéd and predictable that I couldn't stop throwing up.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I'm not giving this film an excuse just because it wasn't taking itself seriously. That's a cop-out. They could've made a better film. They were just lazy. I am too through..."

The Thing just to have that strength i wish i had. Mr. Fantastic to able stretch to any length. Dr. Doom just his power and his unbreakable metal skin and electricity. What else can you ask for to have just one of these powers. What i liked a lot is all the effects of the results of each power is movie rules.

"mikey_sean25","10","26","50","8 July 2005"," ""Fantastic!""
","I cannot begin to explore every single detail I loved about this movie. First off, it includes my favourite Marvel character of all time, the Human Torch, and, aside from X-Men, my favourite Marvel family, the Fantastic Four of course. Anyway, I read Eberts review, then I was skeptical about watching the movie, I finally did, and wow, was he waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off. He said that in the movie all they do is repeat what their powers are. Excuse me? I didn't find that at all. The special effects in this movie were phenomenal. The plot was simple, and driven straight to the point, and boy was it fabulous. This movie is a great thing to see with the entire family, since it explores more the comedic side of super heroes, it seems more comical then the other Marvel movies, and thats what I loved about it. Whats a good joke in between battles of good and evil? It isn't as dark at ""Batman Begins"" or as dramatic as ""Spider Man 2"". But more of a fun, action pact super hero movie, that includes a lot of things blowing up, and a lot of comedic proportions!"
"jtmcmill","10","26","50","8 July 2005"," This is one to see
","Great movie. Gets the plot across and the movie rolls without to much downtime. Has humor, action, and great special effects. Intelligent as well, compared to some other Blockbuster movies out this summer (WoW). Walked out of WoW one week ago and felt like I had been cheated out of 2 hours of my life. Had no big expectations for this one, and was happy I decided to go. <br/><br/>Length of the movie is perfect. At the end, I was thinking that Dr. Doom was somehow going to attack them on the boat. Cheap extension to a good movie. Nope, not going to artificially add 15 more minutes to the flick. Leave that for the eventual sequel, which I would certainly go see.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this movie for everyone. You don't have to be a fan of the comic book to enjoy it. Not going to win an Oscar (maybe special effects), but good fun."
"HCOI","10","26","50","3 July 2005"," Fantastic 4 is the second best comic book movie from marvel.
","Yes, what you read is absolutely right. I saw this one at a local theater with my friend. There was an advanced screening of the movie here in Toronto, Canada. Earlier, me and my friend was expecting this movie to be like Hulk-awesome special effects but too boring. But after watching the entire movie which was around 117(actual movie running time)we both were proved absolutely wrong. The movie turned out to be Fantastic. The story of the movie was fine with proper introduction to all characters, the duologue's spoken by each character suited well. ex: Dr. Doom having manipulative and cunning lines, Human torch having cool, funny lines, Mr. fantastic having scientific and sometimes leadership like lines, the Thing having serious emotional lines as well as few funny lines and finally Invisible woman having motherly and emotional lines. The special effects are the best ever seen and I have no doubt this movie will be nominated for the best visual effects at Oscars. The end battle scene between the Fantastic 4 and Dr. Doom is the best thing I have ever seen, Unlike spider-man 2 that had a lame battle scene at the end of the movie between Dr. octopus and spider-man. Overall, the movie was so awesome that the 30-40 people watching along with us at the theater said WOW, cool, amazing all kind of words to cheer the movie when the movie was over. On top of that most of them said they will watch it again on opening weekend. I am absolutely amazed by this movie. This will make tons of money up to $500 million worldwide. I give it a 10/10."
"insane_colonel_virus","10","25","48","11 July 2005"," The clue to this films in the name.... Fantastic
","I'm not really a major marvel fan, i've read a few comics, had a few toys, still got some in-fact. Yet i never really looked at comic's coming to the big screen in a way that they have. Normally in cheesy films were everything is over done (like the old batman films). Yet when Spiderman was released, i was amazed. I was shocked at how something that was on paper could be brought to life in such a way that people could almost associate themselves with the characters.<br/><br/>Just before the release of this film, i decided to read some previews on it. I like to do this for most films, because if critic's say its ""crap"" then most the time the film is actually really good (not to say u have bad judgement.... but u do). So after hearing that this film was supposed to be one of the biggest flops of the year. I thought, thats a really bad preview, a really bad one considering no one's actually seen it yet. So i thought, seeing as my philosophy about preview's has never let me down (pluss the trailers looked really amazing) this film is probably going to be really amazing. And i was right.<br/><br/>Even if you don't no the story plot of the comic series, don't worry, the film's plot (although slightly different) will intrigue and amaze you so much, you'll need a hole bunch of medic's on standby, just in-case u have a heart attack..<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards), normally referred to as Lancelot or if you ever watch the series, Horn-blower. This role as head of the fantastic four, required a more, adult type role of the 4. Always thinking before acting, and by god does he pull this off. <br/><br/>Jessica Alba (Sue Storm... invisible girl), normally seen wearing nothing but tight pants and a bra....no not clicked yet? She played Nancy in sin city. This woman is stunning, funny and smart (add cooking and cleaning, and she'd be perfect... only kidding). Equally on par with everyone else in the film, her role as the invisible girl is not for the feint of heart. Specially when she cant control her powers and is standing in her underwear.... bet your all looking forward to that shot.<br/><br/>Chris Evans...(torch, human flame, human torch) Don't recognise him? Come on, normally on a phone saving peoples lives? Celluar star Chris Evans produces one of the most amazing performances i've seen. Not only funny but also witty and sarcastic... He presents himself as every teenagers dream, living the life of stardom, as well as being able to incinerate to a whooping 4000 degrees. Yet, its not the character that make the torch they way he is, its Chris. Adding his own fun personality into this role, makes him shine as probably the ""coolest"" one out of the four.<br/><br/>Micheal Chiklis...(Ben Grimm, ""The thing"") who? I've never heard of this guy, or seen him in any well known movie. A risky choice maybe, a bad one? I don't think so. Micheal's performance is magical. He manages to pull of the huge brute fantastically. Not only with the physical side (punch people half way across the world) but also with his own mental battle. Micheal actually makes you feel for the guy, which in an action packed movie like this, is a very rare and hard thing to do.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon....(Dr Victor Van Doom) Well, i don't really think you'll see a better actor play the hardest bad guy anywhere, ever. Julians was unbelievable... portrayed as the doctor that cuts people insides up, is now going to be seen as probably the best villain (other than Dath Vader) of all time. He was evil, cruel, menacing, and damn right out of this world. He brought to the screen a feeling of wanting, people will sit there thinking, i really want to be that guy. Not just because of his huge unbelievable powers, but because he's a normal, money and power hungry man (like most of us). He embraces his power, and by god does it show.<br/><br/>Now for the part I'm sure you've all been waiting for, visual effects. Most of you will think nothing can be different, it will be the same as every other visual effect film. How wrong you are. You will walk out that cinema with your hair on fire it looks that real. Every visual effect is brilliantly carried out, turning invisible in a split second is really cool stuff. The visual effects make is seem like an normal random person and just do it. Same with everything else. Yet by far the best above all has to be the human torch. Covering his whole body in fire (i don't see that being a suit... do you?). He looks unreal, the flames so life like, as if someone could actually burst into the flames in the chair next to you. Its just, well, indescribable... you've got to see it to be believe it. There is only one problem with one of the characters CGI. Thats good old Reed Richards. Although most of the time, basically perfect animation texture and colouring. At one point in the film, his arm did look complete fake.... but hey, graphic's aren't that good yet, so you cant have everything.<br/><br/>Overall, this film easily stands out amongst the masses of films. I personally think its one of the best films i've seen since Lord of the Rings. Inviting, not particularly taxing to watch, funny and the bad guy is just amazing. Once you've seen this film, you'll be wanting more, you'll want those toys, them models, t-shirts and mugs. Some of you may even take it as far as a Dr Doom costume.... It is that surreal."
"Lando_Hass","10","25","48","10 July 2005"," Go see Los Quattros Fantastico!!
","I've heard a lot of crap being given to this movie. I've heard people say the following: ""Oh, dude, in the spectrum of the most recent philosophical comic books films, this movie strives to be a contender against Batman Begins or the brilliantly crafted Spider-Man."" I exaggerated a bit there, but you know this is what a bunch of people say in order to act like they don't enjoy relentless bad-ass action. Since when did a comic book movie HAVE to be about people who get powers and then get negatively affect by them? Is it such a stretch of the imagination that maybe if someone did get bad-ass super powers they wouldn't act like it's such a bad thing? Suddenly, every comic book movie has to be a deep drama about the human emotions. It's good sometimes when a comic book movie is deep, but come on, lets just blow s*** up. That's what Fantastic Four does. They blow s*** up, and it's damn entertaining.<br/><br/>Everyone already knows the story of the Fantastic Four, so who needs an explanation? The story is that while in space, five people get exposed to radiation or something, and they get cool superpowers. Ben Grimm turns into this weird, bulky rock-man. Johnny Storm can make fire, his sister Sue Storm can go invisible, Reed Richards can stretch any part of his body, and Victor Von Doom (a pretty bad-ass name right there) turns into metal and can control electricity. Von Doom wants to kill a lot of people, it's up to them to stop them, and you know the rest.<br/><br/>The movie is loaded with action. Cool, CGI filled action that'll make you crap your pants because of how cool it is. The movie starts off slow because they don't have any powers, but after the first 20 or so minutes, they get their powers, and that's when the movie gets bad-ass. There's one cool scene where Ben Grimm, The Thing, jumps in front of a semi and it crashed right into him. He stands there, completely still, while the semi truck is smashed up like a weak piece of paper! I thought to myself, very intensely I should add, ""My Godhow can this get any cooler?"" Then, stopping that semi triggers off a massive car pileup. A fire truck comes storming through, but loses control and comes close to falling off the bridge. The rest of the Fantastic Four appear, and each one of them saves someone. There's explosions everywhere, The Thing grabs the fire truck and pulls it back on the bridge, cars are flying everywhere, and my God. When I was watching this, it felt like I got roundhouse kicked in the face by a foot that had an orgasm on it. It was bad-ass.<br/><br/>You think it stops there? Hell no! After taking a needed break from the bad-ass action for a little bit, we get some character development and some comedy. The comedy was good, but when I saw this, the theater was packed with little kids who would watch the joke, laugh, and then verbally express the joke to themselves, so that kind of killed some of the comedy for me.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really have what you would call ""Good acting"" from everybody. Jessica Alba can't act very good in here, but she's probably one of the hottest women on the planet, so who cares about acting? Michael Chiklis is cool as The Thing, Iaon Gruffudd's character isn't really cool, Chris Evans is cool as the Human Torch, and Julian McMahon is bad-ass as Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>The movie is loaded with CG. I've heard people complain, ""The CG is cartoonist, at best, and it doesn't look very good."" Forget what those people say, these special effects are cool. Cartoonish? It's a movie based off of a comic book, who gives a rat's ass if it's cartoonish looking? If it looks good in the movie, don't complain.<br/><br/>The movie comes to an end with a long, kick-ass climactic battle between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom. This battle is so bad-ass, I don't even want to describe it. Spoiling it would be a shame. All you need to know is that after watching the final battle, you'll feel like you need a cigarette.<br/><br/>This movie's cool. Batman Begins was one of the most bad-ass movies of this year, but if you want something that's not very serious and just cool and entertaining, watch this. The only thing it needed was, yes, you guessed it, GWAR tunes. Either way, though, it's bad-ass. The action is unrelenting, and the characters are cool. Who gives a damn about serious emotions anyway? Score: 10"
"lowflier","4","19","35","8 November 2005"," Terrible - for under 12's and die-hard F4 fans only
","Not much actually happens in this movie, so if you're looking forward to seeing the F4 doing lots of heroic stuff, think again. In fact there are only two significant action sequences: the one where the F4 are first seen by the public, and the obligatory big fight with the bad guy at the end, neither of which are particularly impressive. All in all, it feels like a TV show episode stretched out to movie length, and not a great episode at that. The writing seems like a poor TV show as well, in fact if you told me it had been written by the people who wrote Mutant X, I'd say they were having a bad day.<br/><br/>On the positive side, there are some pretty decent effects, and there's Jessica Alba, but even she can't save this one.<br/><br/>I see some other reviews saying this is better than Daredevil, personally I think this makes the likes of Daredevil, and even Judge Dredd, look pretty good by comparison. I feel generous giving this movie a 4/10."

","For this longtime comic book reader, it worked.<br/><br/>I didn't go into this theatre expecting Million Dollar Baby, the Aviator, Traffic, Gladiator, Titanic, As Good As It Gets, Goodwill Hunting, Forrest Gump, Godfather, Fargo, Toy Story, the Incredibles, On The Waterfront, Gone With the Wind or any other critically acclaimed or Oscar winning movie.<br/><br/>I WANTED to see the Fantastic Four. Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny.<br/><br/>Did Doctor Doom's connection to their origin interfere? Not really.<br/><br/>Did the alteration to Doom's comic book origin alter the characterization? Arrogance, self-destruction in defeat, blame Reed. It was all there.<br/><br/>Doom's romance with Sue? No harm done there. Sue didn't care for Victor.<br/><br/>Once the characters' relationships to one another and their rivalries, were established and I understood what was done (as I had to do with the Xmen movie when it came out, Rogue being a teen ager, etc., as well as Spiderman, the webs coming out of his hands instead of a mechanized device), the FF was all in place.<br/><br/>Could it have been better? Only if this one was completely unbearable, which it wasn't to me.<br/><br/>Instead of Peter Parker learning about his powers on his own, this time there were four people doing the sorting out, which was what the FF has always been.<br/><br/>The movie is called ""The Fantastic Four"", not ""Doctor Doom and the Four"" nor is it ""Alicia Masters and the Four"".<br/><br/>Doom could become a woman, Alicia could become Black, it's not going to drastically alter anything.<br/><br/>After the cartoon Hulk movie with Eric Banal, I appreciated the costume Chiklis wore. If you want to see an animated Thing, there are three Fantastic Four cartoons, as well as ""Thing Ring! Do your thing!"" to be checked out.<br/><br/>If you don't want to watch this movie, then don't. But it is hardly a stinker, 'got the comic book all wrong' and so on.<br/><br/>CGI would be perfect if the sequel had the IMpossible Man in it. Now there is someone made for computer animation!"
"calgarian3432","10","23","44","8 July 2005"," Fantastic Four perfect at being what it advertises
","I strongly recommend this film. The entire movie, from start to finish looks great. There are no glitches on the way. Nothing is too boring.<br/><br/>This is better than X-Men. X-Men drones on with annoying personalities. Plus, who wants to look at a guy with side-burns, really.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba looks fantastic as always. She's worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The special effects seamlessly blend the humans with the CGI. There's none of the ""blue-screen-look"" you see in other movies. I'm sure they used it, but the special effects look natural.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of super-hero movies, these actors actually look respectable in their outfits. They give semi-believable excuse for requiring the outfits. Of course, much of the movie is unbelievable. But, that's the point. If you make a movie a about invisibility, stretching, and flames, you do'not want to be believable. You want it be unbelievable and incredible. That's a good thing."

","I have to say that when I went to see this movie I didn't have very high expectations but when I saw it I was blown away by how great the movie was. I have not read the comics so I have no idea if the movie is true to the comic or not.<br/><br/>I loved everything about it. Loved how the characters interacted with each other.<br/><br/>Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards was played superbly by Ioan Gruffudd. He really surprised me because I didn't really think I was going to like his character at all, but I ended up loving the guy.<br/><br/>The Invisible Woman/Susan Storm played by Jessica Alba was a joy to watch. I think she played the part to a T and I don't understand all the negativity towards her. <br/><br/>The Human Torch/Johnny Storm was a great character and Chris Evans played it just like he should. He was my favorite character in the movie. Loved his interactions with The Thing.<br/><br/>The Thing/Ben Grimm was the heart of the story and the way Michael Chiklis played it was perfect. You could see exactly what he felt and what he was going through. Quite simply perfect.<br/><br/>Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom was a really great villain and Julian McMahon gave the character the evilness it needed. You can actually feel sympathy for this villain and that's a rare thing. Good job McMahon!<br/><br/>I have nothing but positive things to say about this wonderful movie. The special effects was truly amazing and didn't feel like it was created just for show.<br/><br/>The way the movie didn't jump from one action scene to another and took time developing the characters and made us care for them was great. It reminded me of the first X-Men (wich is a good thing).<br/><br/>SPOILER: My favorite scene in the movie was the final showdown between the 4 and Dr. Doom. The way they all had to use their powers and work together to defeat him was a great touch.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the sequel to this extraordinary movie:)"
"lgm157","10","17","31","10 July 2005"," You're right it's not X Men or Spider Man (possible spoilers)
","I've read a lot of people saying the Fantastic Four is not as good as the X-Men, Spider Man, or Batman. You have to realize that is because they are trying to compare apples to apples. The idea behind the FF is that they are not the Justice League, they are not perfect, they are normal people that have fallen into the incredible. Mr. Fantastic is not SuperMan, he's boring, he has the weakest power of the team. He was not born a leader, he had to become one. <br/><br/>The Invisible Woman is not WonderWoman. Sure she is very powerful, but she acts more as the glue of the team, keeping the family together. <br/><br/>The Human Torch is young, arrogant, and doesn't seem to take his new role serious. Actually he hides a great deal of responsibility behind it all. His power is the most dangerous, in a single slip he could cause a lot of damage. <br/><br/>Finally you have The Thing, a good man given great power and a curse at the same time. The movie did a good job of showing the drama of Ben Grimm without having the entire movie revolve around it and him. <br/><br/>By themselves they okay characters, but as a team they are fantastic. You see it's not just that they all have powers and work together, it's that they are a family. The part where they first stick around the Baxter Building shows this well. The movie also brings to life the relationship between the Thing and Human Torch in great form. <br/><br/>If you still don't understand what makes this title and the movie so great then it is not for you. If want to see a super dramatic superhero like Batman then go see Batman. Just don't expect this to be like that because the characters and the title's are not even close."

","Hmm... what should i say about it? It was actually really good, in my opinion, despite what all the critics say =]. It was fun, exciting, and just well... fantastic, i guess. The effects were okay, i guess, and i think the plot and cast did pretty good...<br/><br/>Mr.Fantastic/Ioan Gruffud--> He was.. OK.

It was pretty good overall. But yeah, they do have a point when they say she's not convincing as a scientist, and that she's only there as eye candy , like the part where she had to strip to become invisible... not that i'm complaining or anything.. (though i think yeah, she IS eye candy, but that's not the only reason why she's there)<br/><br/>Human Torch/ Chris Evans--> He did a good job of portraying johnny, in my opinion. His comments were always funny, and i liked the thing/torch combo in the movie. <br/><br/>Thing/ Chiklis--> Chicklis made a good Ben Grimm. It was believable and not boring.

"Nightscream","1","22","42","11 July 2005"," The worst Marvel Comics movie since Daredevil. Unevenly paced, too campy, one-dimensional, filled with plot holes, and just flat-out mediocre.
","The movie fails to establish the setting as a futuristic one populated by the fantastic inventions of Reed Richards. Instead, the setting looks contemporary, with the few sci-fi elements, like holograms and artificial gravity, appearing to be anachronisms. Even worse, they're not Richards'. In the film, Richards is a milquetoast loser and wimp, whose inventions/devices in the comic (the station/ shuttle, the shielding, the unstable molecules) are all Victor's, as is his love interest. Reed is fascinated to see a uniform made of self-regulating molecules, commenting that he's been working on a formula for the stuff. Looks like someone beat you to it, Reed.<br/><br/>Sure, the comics have always portrayed Reed as a bit of a long-winded egghead, but not such a shortsighted dunce. The film Reed is utterly oblivious to any goings-on around him not pertaining to his calculations, be it the fact that Susan still wants him, or the fact that Victor is trying to give her an engagement ring. The Reed I read was always a decisive *leader*. Gruffudd's Reed is an obsequious cipher, and when the notion of his being the leader of the team was voiced during the bridge scene, I didn't buy it. Indeed, the characters in general are handled poorly. Their reaction to their transformation, for example, is dumb. Reed and Sue are desperate to reverse their condition. WHY? You've just got cool superhuman abilities, and all you can think about is how to get rid of them? There is no sense of sci-fi ponderousness or intellectual curiosity about this incredible transformation. They just conclude that their DNA has been altered, and decide that they have to reverse it. The only one for whom this makes sense is Ben Grimm, whose desire to revert to normal is understandable. But even this ruined by his eventual decision, following his successful reversion to normal, to recreate his rocky appearance in order to.well I don't know why he does this. Can't the others handle Doom? After spending the film depressed because his fiancée and others are frightened of him, this made no sense. Even Johnny, whose desire to parlay his new gift into celebrity was fairly believable, was portrayed as far more of an insensitive jerk than he was in the comics. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is one-dimensional. Doom is not the scary megalomaniacal villain, but a disgraced businessman who kills a few people for revenge. Nothing that makes him an interesting or fearful villain in the comics the shrewd planning, the leadership of a country, armor and weapons, magical powersare present. The climax is merely adequate, with Reed's defeat of him coming not from a particularly brilliant plan, but by his own admission, basic elemental chemistry. Dialogue is campy (""MarcoPolo?""), secondary characters like Alicia are cardboard, the science and plot logic is unnecessarily lousy, and much of the movie just makes no sense. Why does it appear that the team going up to the space station suits up in Doom's executive building, rather than at the launch site? Are Sue, Doom, and Richards qualified astronauts? Why does Ben's fiancée go outside on a New York City street in her negligee? Why, when testing Johnny's powers, does Sue refer to ""supernova"" as a temperature, rather than an event? Why does Reed tell the others that their costumes were exposed to the same cosmic rays that they were, so they can change like us. EXCUSE me? What? What the hell kind of nonsense is this? They're UNIFORMS. They don't have any DNA to mutate. They should change because they're made of unstable molecules. Not because they should exhibit the same reaction to cosmic rays as a human body. How can electricity incinerate a hole through a human body, when everyone who's even been hit by lightning knows that even though it burns, it passes THROUGH the body? And why, after Victor has killed that board member thus, did Johnny not suffer a similar fate later when Doom blasted him with the same energy? Why is it that twice, characters get punched hard enough to be sent flying several yards (first Johnny by Ben, and then a cured Ben by Victor), without being instantly killed? Why did Reed show no permanent effects after testing the machine intended to cure Ben on himself, which resulted in him melting? And the sequence in which Doom fires a missile at the Baxter Building is confusing. Presumably it's a heat seeker, which is why Johnny decides to lure it away from the building, and set a small island on fire (hope no one was on that island) to detonate it. But how did Johnny know it was a heat seeker? For that matter, how could it have been? Victor had to lock onto Johnny and Sue's location on that balcony to fire it, which should not have presented a signature any hotter than anything else in the vicinity.<br/><br/>In watching this film, I kept wondering about how its basic approach and motif would work if upheld for a sequel featuring Galactus. Can you imagine these losers going up against the Planet Devourer? Instead of the ponderous awe and wonder of an immense extraterrestrial life form who consumes the energy of planets, the depth needed to make interacting with his herald seem interesting, the fear and hopelessness evoked by the impossible nature of stopping such a foe, and the moral and ethical discussions raised by Reed's desire to spare Galactus' life, we'd instead get stuff like ""Cool, an alien!"" ""Okay, let's stop him by just doing this"" or ""Wow, why does that guy look like an Oscar statuette on a surfboard?"" <br/><br/>Pass."

","A a fan of pure action movies - this one rates right at the top of the list - this is far better than War of the Worlds, by leaps and bounds! While this is not quite a children's movie - due to some bad language - you can still take anyone over 14 to this movie and they will be entertained for the length of the film - and that is the main objective.<br/><br/>As with all movies that will have a sequel (or two or three) the plot line does not have to be absolutely tight! The villains must be setup well, transitions from human to superhuman must be a choice of life style change that helps set character plot for the next movies...and this movie does not fall short.<br/><br/>The dialog can be a bit cheesy, but I can forgive that and say that this movie is the best comic-adaptation this year, and it could easily rival the X-men series in the depth that they can go with the characters! Overall - watch the movie for the pure enjoyment of it - don't rip it apart, just sit back and know that you have spent good money on a good movie for once this summer."

But that is great....EVERYTHING is great with this movie. Jessica Alba is wonderful and beautiful, Ioan Gruffudd is great, Michael Chiklis is very down to earth as The Thing, and Chris Evans is extremely entertaining as The Human Torch.

","Fantastic Four (2005) is a charming movie that has a lot of that early 2000's flair to it, and unlike its 2015 counterpart, the characters actually seemed real and you could believe that giant rock man was walking around. As for plot, it could be a little bit more straightfoward, but it doesn't throw me off. It's more of just an annoyance, and I'd say that all of the characters costume design looks a lot better than 2015 Fantastic Four as well. Also, Doctor Doom is more fitting to the comic book representation. Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Don't see why people have such a problem with it."

","The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. Chris Evans gives the best performance as Johnny Storm, but Chiklis gives a good performance that is a little heartwarming. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the heroes. A true gem."
"Prichards12345","7","4","5","30 May 2010"," Why All The Hate?
","I've watched this film a few times now, and I'm reviewing it on the basis of the extended edition, which to me is a notch or two up from the cinema version. There's more character moments, and a re-instated sub-plot for The Thing and Alicia; in truth the longer version feels more like the Fantastic Four movie that should have been released first time around.<br/><br/>If you want a dark, portentous take on the superhero myth, then go somewhere else. This is a movie aimed at a younger audience than say, The Dark Knight, and it dares to try to be fun and light-hearted - shock horror!!! It's not perfect but it's good entertainment.<br/><br/>The plot is a revamp of the original Stan Lee/Jack Kirby comic that founded the Marvel Universe. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud,) Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) are involved in an experiment aboard a space station with Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon)to measure cosmic radiation. The cosmic storm arrives unexpectedly early, exposing the occupants to its DNA altering properties. They each gain superpowers (I'm sure you know what they are by now!) and Doom turns into an arch-enemy, hating Richards for ruining his business empire and taking Sue away from him.<br/><br/>In truth, Gruffud and Alba are not very interesting but Chiklis and Evans are great fun, and the Thing's fractious relationship with The Human Torch is well-handled. The final battle with Doom is rather good, too, with a few nods at other superhero movies such as Superman II.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for an easy-going 2 hours I'd recommend this. These characters were always my favourites as a kid, and I had no problems at all with the changes made to the comics. Why all the hate?"
"silentcheesedude","7","4","5","11 May 2009"," Fantastic Decision
","Like most super hero movies that are peeled from the pages of comic books, enjoying a movie of this genre totally depends on what your expectations are regarding them. Are you the die hard comic book fan, or the passive movie goer that enjoys action/adventure films? Did you bring the kids because you heard that it's safe for your 8 year old, and now viewing it as a family film? I read the comics as a kid. Though Fantastic Four was on the lower end of my reading schedule, there's little doubt that a legion of fans existed, and exist, that have been waiting for the full, theatrical release of them. Super heroes are a hot topic, and CG has finally caught up enough so it doesn't look like the previous release, or shall I say, non-release of the 1994 Fantastic Four that was never intended to be released to theaters. Gosh that was a bad movie.<br/><br/>But this movie... I came with the kids, I had lower expectations & wound up being entertained. I liked Ben, Mr Fantastic, Johnny was a blast and the Invisible girl was way different the the comic, but still very sexy. But I can understand why the fans didn't enjoy it much. It lacked the impact of the comic, & it did indeed feel like it was made for the kiddys in mind. A few bits of cliché and hammy dialog didn't really make me enjoy it less, because, well, most comic book stories have them.<br/><br/>FF felt like it was a set up for the sequel, getting character origins out of the way. And yes, it is a rated PG-13 family oriented action adventure, but barely so. It could have made a fine PG rated movie. Looking over the comments, I noticed that the fans, comic book lovers were expecting a lot more, and sometimes, that's not fair. Regular non-comic readers seemed to like it more, so I guess I was right. There's no way that a comic book with decades of stories can compact the same feeling in a movie. Just don't pull up your expectations too high, and enjoy."
"kosmasp","7","4","5","3 July 2007"," 2 reasons why this ain't so bad!
","And no I'm not talking about Jessica Alba here (I wonder why someone would think that? ;o) ... but seriously though, the two reasons why this movie worked for me and wasn't as bad as the critics made it sound are: <br/><br/>Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans! Their ""relationship"" is the core or anchor of the movie. Before I go on, I also have to admit, that I don't know the FF comics that well, so any inaccuracy that might be in the movie, I can't point them out to you. One thing is for sure, if someone goes invisible, without clothes, that means you can't see them! (wouldn't have been PG-13 then also, right?) ;o) <br/><br/>So while the movie has it's flaws (storyline/some action/characters/and so forth), it is still a nice/good enough movie to watch and it all comes down to two people! (there's also an unrated longer version out now on DVD, but I haven't seen that yet)"
"elfflame","7","4","5","23 June 2007"," Not as bad as some would have you believe
","I was actually rather surprised how much they did keep to the original idea. Sure, Victor wasn't in the ship with them in the original, and yes, it didn't take place on a space-station, but the original was written before space stations, and, well...they did have to have a villain right from the beginning, so why not Victor? It's like the Burton Batman starting out with Joker. It makes sense.<br/><br/>Johnny was actually very true to the character I recall from the books, and while the actor who played him is only like a month younger than Jessica Alba, it worked, because she was so straight-laced, and he was such an immature show-off. Ben was exceedingly well-played by Michael Chiklis, who managed to hit just about every note of sympathy we needed to have for him.<br/><br/>And I was quite pleasantly surprised by Kerry Washington, who played Alicia, and picked up the pieces of Ben's broken heart after his wife couldn't handle his new form and left him. It didn't bug me at all that she was black, even as a token character, because I know how important her character truly is, and if they do make a sequel, she'll almost definitely be in it (can we say Ben-Alicia-Johnny triangle? :D And, no for those of you who don't know, I'm not making that up in my head. It really happened in the comics.) Interactions: Victor was perfectly heavy-handed, both in his business dealings, and with Susan. The rivalry between him and Reed was well-done, both hating when the other gets the better of him, but Reed coming out on top because he always tries to do what's ""for the best"" rather than for himself. The Susan-Johnny relationship really shows itself for what it is after the change, with her constantly berating him for being so impetuous all the time. Ben and Reed's friendship is wonderful, particularly Ben's constant attempts to get Reed and Susan back together. But the real delight is the Ben-Johnny arguments. They hate each other from the beginning, with a bit of a backstory that I don't recall from the original, and therefore probably wasn't there, that Ben had been his commander at NASA before Johnny had been tossed out on his ear. After the change, their animosity grows, and every shot they're in together when there's no action going on is great fun to watch.<br/><br/>Stan Lee's cameo in this is impossible to miss, unless you actually leave the theatre the entire time he's on the screen. He has a little conversation with Reed in the elevator lobby of the Baxter Building, and they went so far as to give him an actual name.<br/><br/>Other bits: the evolution of the costumes was nice. The evolution of Johnny's power was better. The skiing sequence is not to be missed. Victor's downfall is swift, and his reaction, which gets darker with each blow, is utterly perfect. Oh, and the entrance to Reed's ""office"" in the Baxter Building just made me grin.<br/><br/>The sequences during the storm imbuing them with their powers was a bit much for me. I could have done with seeing the cloud surround the station and left it at that. What did annoy me was Reed's insistence on ""curing"" them all. Reed is painted as an uber-geek from the get-go. And if it's about science, he's all over it. Which to me says that he'd want to figure out what had happened to them first, not how to ""cure"" them. The only thing that keeps that from totally destroying the movie for me is the fact that he does promise Ben he will cure him, which makes sense to me, as far as things went. But the continued need to ""cure"" just seemed a bit much."

","The Movie: 2 scientists, 2 pilots, and their financial backer hop in a space shuttle to go to an orbital space station to study a spacial storm that they believe is similar to the storm that hit Earth a millenia ago and sparked life on our planet. They miscalculate the direction and speed of said storm and are hit full on by it. Only the financial backer, Victor Von Doom, is behind any kind of advanced shielding. The co-pilot is out on a spacewalk, and the other 3 are just behind the outer wall. When the storm hits them, they make pretty comical poses in slow motion and appear to start floating(there was artificial gravity before the storm hit). So then we find our team back on Earth at some mountain medical resort. Although they never tell us, you can tell it's Vancouver. That's where our pilots(Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm), and our scientists(Sue Storm and Reed Richards) realize that their DNA has been ""fundamentally changed"". Since Grimm was on spacewalk, he had the most marked change. And unlike the other 3, he can't turn it off and on at will. The rest of the film is about them adjusting and manipulating their new powers and stopping the newly dubbed ""Dr. Doom""(formerly Victor Von) from using his new powers(seems his shield didn't work so well after all) for the purposes of evil. <br/><br/>My take: I can't help but compare this to the Spiderman's, the X-Men, and Batman Begins, all of which were better movies with deeper characters. And it's funny to me that in a cast with such actors as Ioan Gruffud, Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, and Julian McMahon, that it's Chris Evans' electric portrayal of The Human Torch/Johnny Storm that saves this movie. That kid brings life and energy to every scene he's in, and his comic timing is fantastic(no pun intended). Gruffud was excellent as well, but his character was so understated that you might not have noticed. I don't blame Chiklis, a fine actor himself, for the cheesy lines he had to deliver, but my goodness couldn't they hire better writers? And believing Jessica Alba is a world class scientist is a bit of stretch. If she'd been able to deliver her lines a little less stiffly, maybe it would've been more believable. For FF2, I hope they bring in an entirely new writing team and give Alba and Chiklis lines they can handle with a lot less cheese. That being said, there were some fun scenes, almost all involving Torch/Johnny, whether he's needling Thing, or hitting on women, it's always fun to watch. And the bar scene with Thing and the blind girl was very good.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Excellent. They gave it top of the line effects throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The DVD: There is a commentary track with Alba, Gruffud, and Chiklis which was more entertaining than the movie itself. You can tell they're all friends and comfortable razzing each other. You find out such things as the fact Jessica didn't like having to dress up in the skin tight space suit, although Chiklis didn't think that opinion would be shared by male viewers. We find out that the actress that Johnny goes skiing with at the beginning of the movie is actually one of Chiklis's wife's best friends. We learn that Chiklis and McMahon have always wanted to be on each other's series on F/X, and were happy to finally be able to work together on this. We also learn that Evans ad-libbed a lot of the best dialogue...he had a scene where he was staring at Thing and said ""Where's your ears?""...very funny and very ad-libbed. Same thing with the ""That's gross"" line when Mr. Fantastic unlocked the door at the beginning of the movie. The fact that the funniest lines were ad-libbed by a 24 year old actor is another topic entirely. Gruffud would've liked to try to ad-lib, but because he had to speak in an American accent, he didn't feel comfortable doing so. There's also some sort of video diary that Alba shot while they were traveling around and promoting the film. Some of it was insightful, but it was mostly stuff I could've done without.<br/><br/>FF2 is going to happen, so I hope they take a long look at the critiques of this initial installment and make some changes in the writing staff, and possibly the director. Could you imagine Tony Scott directing one of these movies???"

"suzicue","9","21","40","10 July 2005"," Great summer movie!
","Ioan Gruffudd is perfect as the geeky and unwilling superhero Reed Richards! What a great choice in casting! Ioan has the looks to be a superhero yet portrayed Reed Richards with just the right amount of nerdiness to come across as believable. Michael Chiklis was also a great choice in casting as Ben Grimm, something that surprised me at first; Jessica Alba, that Scarlett Johansson wannabe, was adequate but the movie didn't give her much to do. Maybe in the sequel?? Chris Evans as Johnny Storm was a hoot...he has more talent than the part required. Julian McMahon runs the risk of being typecast as the bad guy..give it a break, altho Nip/Tuck gives him a stretch...(sorry for the pun). Having grown up with the FF comics, the writing and directing kept true to the basic premise, thank heaven for Stan Lee's input, I am sure. As a 47 year old mother of 3 and grandmother, it was great to have parents, a teenager and pre-teen all like the same movie! The only problem with ALL of these superhero movies is that the bad guy, in this case Victor Doom, are all so predictable. Even my 11 year old could practically recite the lines Doom was going to say before he said them. Hopes are high for a sequel that gives the actors more of a stretch and shows some more ""fantastic"" special effects!! Thanks again, Stan! Make sure you still have a creative input clause in your contract! And make sure Ioan Gruffudd comes back as Reed Richards!"
"craxxcraxx","10","21","40","10 July 2005"," Excellent
","An excellently casted movie, although Jessica Alba is a little young to play the invisible woman, I can forgive this, as her raw sex appeal and warm smile more than make up for it. Past that, Chiklis owns as the thing, bringing the passion we know hes got in him. Doom was slightly weak as a bad-guy (I like more intense bad-guys with better sarcasm *think Alan Rickman sheriff of Nottingham* - sarcasm is the root of the true villain) but hey the rest of them are just as fabulous as they were in comics, finally some real life breathes into the comic movie scene after quite a few losers. Seeing Ioan Gruffudd after he got the gray sideburns gave me flashbacks of childhood cartoons and comic books. No spoilers here, all you Fantastic 4 fans go see this right now.<br/><br/>Flame On!<br/><br/>Craxx"
"kirsten-t","6","20","38","11 July 2005"," Good but not Great
","I enjoyed this movie, just not as much as I expected to. All of the hype about Jessica Alba wearing blue contacts so that she resembled the comic book character she portrayed, only for said contact to be visible in only one scene. Another comment frequently spoken in numerous interview was that Sue Storm was very maternal. Didn't see that at all. Bossy and controlling yes, maternal no.<br/><br/>Now to the good stuff: Michael Chiklis was outstanding as the Thing. You got emotional depth despite an incredible make up job and the muscle you'd expect.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon always plays the bad guys so that you feel a little bit sorry for them, as he has done this time. Such a shame to mess up his handsome face with metal makeup though.<br/><br/>Chris Evans extremely annoying as selfish Johnny Storm, but that's true to the character so well done. Outstanding special effects helped though.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffurd with an American accent. The accent doesn't suit him, but the determination of his character to help his friend Ben did. Geniuses often don't see what's right in front of them, complecating everything subconsciously instead and he played that well.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie focused to much on three out four of the characters feeling sorry for themselves instead of helping people."
"shakawtwf","9","20","38","9 July 2005"," Well done!
","Most of the major critics gave this movie a bad review so from now on I might have to pay them less attention. I thought the movie was really good. I thought inner struggles of each of the characters were well-portrayed (especially Ben/The Thing who has the most to struggle with). I didn't think the special effects were cheesy at all. The story did what it had to: introduce the characters, fill in some information on their respective pasts, give them a situation to deal with (and I thought the way that Dr. Doom was dealt with was very clever) and keep the action moving along. I thought the scene on the Brooklyn Bridge was a little forced but not overly so. All in all a very good movie."

","Fantastic Four was amazing. I'm not only saying that because i am head over heels in love with Julian Mcmahon/Victor Von Doom, but because it was just what was needed to bring the Box Office out of the slumps. And no surprise that the movie did it. The effects with The Thing where utterly amazing. Not only did the movie get right to the point, but it was also extermely funny. Producers/Directors knew when to be funny in the movie and knew when to be serious. Excellent casting as well, you couldn't have picked better actors to play these superheroes. And villain Victor Von Doom, who looked great despite the scars and cuts on his face. LOVES IT!"
"mike1956will","10","19","36","10 July 2005"," Comic Book movie true to book.....
","This movie was extremely entertaining and one of the few movies that when I left the theater, I didn't mind paying the $10 Dollar admission fee. The special effect were great, the plot adequate, and the acting was better than expected. I read and heard much negativity about the movie in both the radio and newspaper reviews and was expecting to see a poorly done movie with no plot and story. The persons that reviewed could not have possibly read the comic book in their youths. The movie stayed relatively close to the comic book with both the nature of and the characteristics of the FF. Comparing the movie to other comic book movies is fair to neither the Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Hulk, etc... Enjoy each for what it is. That's why they make different comic books too! Very satisfying movie!!! * * * * *"
"lt_colonelmagee","10","19","36","11 July 2005"," Fantastic Four beyond all expectations.
","On Friday the 7 I went to see the movie at the first showing at the theater I usually go to. I arrived 20 minutes before the show and the place was empty but in the next 15 minutes the place filled up. Before the show I got the largest drink they had from the concession stand as well as a monster bucket of Popcorn, I sat down and waited for the show to begin. the beginning was typical of the recent Marvel comic book openings. The show started us outside of Dooms business but he at that time was known as Victor Von Doom. The acting was superb, and the best was done by Michael Chiklis whose performance pulled me into the movie. Michael Chiklis brought his character into a new depth as he slowly gets use to what he has become, even more it was the acting of Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters that brought out the real depth of the character as she show Ben to accept who he is. Later on in the movie Chiklis' character becomes Ben again, but it is his decision to become the Thing again that shows a depth to the character that may never be able to be matched by another actor.<br/><br/>The movies romantic relationship between Reed Richards(Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm(Jessica Alba) bring a whole new dynamic to the story. I t is there struggle to understand that sometimes you have to act on the part of the character Reed Richards. As the story unfolds we see that there is more to their relationship then they are willing to let on in the beginning. It is this romance that shows people that action movies can have depth to them. <br/><br/>The brother/sister relationship of Sue and Johnny is played in such a way that you believe that they are siblings. But there is more in true following of the comic book the relationship of Johnny and Ben, that of their continual fighting and the true comic source of the movie. <br/><br/>Now to the character of the Villain. Victor Von Doom AKA the infamous Dr. Doom the Fantastic Four's archenemies, the performance of Julian McMahon brought a whole new depth to the character as we see how he becomes the Dr. Doom we all know and despises. As we see the slow change of Doom compared to the rapid change of the Fantastic Four, we gain a much deeper understanding of story. <br/><br/>This was a great movie so great I plan on seeing it again, so to all reading this go and enjoy the movie for I promise it is like no movie you have ever seen before."

","Directed by: Tim Story Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon <br/><br/>The Fantastic Four have been a lot of things over the years, since their comic debut in 1961.<br/><br/><ul><li>A dysfunctional family.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A group of scientific explorers challenging the unknown.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A reluctant team of ""superheroes"" thrust into the spotlight.</li></ul><br/><br/>Without a doubt, it can be said that this film succeeds in satisfying all three incarnations presented above which should make fans of the comic quite happy.<br/><br/>Tim Story, a relative newcomer in Hollywood, has delivered a film that is very faithful to the characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics. Gone are the memories of the Roger Corman direct-to-film adaptation, and in its place is a very impressive blockbuster debut from a relatively unknown cast and crew.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of scientists who go into space to examine the effects of cosmic radiation upon plants, in order to further understand our own DNA. As expected, the experiment goes horribly wrong, and the 5 return to Earth with their lives forever altered.<br/><br/>Alas, with fame, comes tragedy, juxtaposed in the forms of Victor Von Doom and Ben Grimm. With the Fantastic Four's meteoric rise to fame, so comes Doom's fall from grace and transformation into vengeful, iron-clad misanthrope. The rest of the film largely centers around the five coming to terms with their new status quo and the conflicts that arise as a result.<br/><br/>The pacing is fairly brisk, and avoids the pitfall of many comic adaptations of taking themselves too seriously. Story remembers what made the comics fun to read, and lets the cast revel in this rich universe populated by very human characters. In doing so, the audience really comes to empathize with the cast. The story is more about the characters, than some convoluted plot involving an artificial threat to the city which typifies most summer superhero flicks.<br/><br/>The acting is believable, and never goes over the top into melodrama or overacting. In particular, Chiklis does an amazing job of emoting through his bulky costume. The humor is very believable and isn't forced, especially the interaction between Ben and Johnny throughout the film. Each character is given equal time to shine, although Chiklis and Evans steal every scene in which they appear.<br/><br/>The special effects team did an admirable job at bringing the Fantastic Four to life, from Johnny's living flame to Ben's rocky hide. The foley and camera work brings Ben Grimm to life, giving his form weight and plausibility. All in all, from Sue's force shields to Reed's body alteration, everything blends well into the environment and doesn't stray into absurdity.<br/><br/>In the end, this film is one that should appeal to both new and older fans. In a summer packed with darkness, it's refreshing to be surprised by what was previously thought impossible to make -- a funny, action-packed superhero film with heart."

","I can't imagine that I'm the only person, who thought that this movie was a terrible disappointment? First of all the script was incredibly stupid even for a superhero movie. The dialogue was appalling and every time someone of the characters opened their mouth I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The actors were as believable as the lame special effects, there was NO chemistry between Alba and whatshisface, the Torch dude seemed mostly retarded and the Thing did not even look or sound like anything as massive as he should be (Christ, Tom Waits alone has a more rough tone to his voice than this guy).<br/><br/>I have never posted a review on IMDb before but this movie made me so mad that I just had to. I've never been a fan of the fantastic four but still i think this film goes to show that you can't write movie characters as thin as comic book characters. Movies and comics are different form of art. My summary: an Awful, awful film."
"Mr. Bennett","3","13","23","25 September 2005"," Fantastic? I wouldn't go with that...
","I am a huge fan of comic books based films, even though I haven't read the books. I enjoyed spiderman (not #2) and I loved both xmen. Based on the comments of other users in here, I decided to watch F4, because they were all saying it is fun. And that is all that matters in such films.<br/><br/>Well, it wasn't. First of all, I left with the impression that I watched a 50 minutes movie. It doesn't show that much. The first part actually shows nothing of interest. What you might have seen in trailers, well...that's pretty much it. There are no more action scenes, no fights between F4 and Doom. Actually, the only have one scene together, where they fight each other and then it's the end.<br/><br/>The CGI's are at least ridiculous.. The Thing came out nice, Jessica had the easiest part, I guess..but Mr. fantastic was, not even funny.. ridiculous. The first time I saw his hand stretching, I thought, OK, there is something wrong here. Not only it looks unreal, but if feels kind of silly, watching a grown up man stretching up the way he does. There is a scene where he has his palms in Thing's head. If you notice, you can see its pure cgi. And its pure slash bad cgi.<br/><br/>The acting is... and this is where this sentence could stop. Or rephrase, there is no acting. Mr. Fantastic is a bit annoying, he doesn't know what to do with his hands, his normal ones! Jessica is.. Jessica, and she does that pretty well, period. Johny came out nice, funny..but after a while he enters the 12 year old boy mode with his sister: ""you know what, you're not mom"". The Von Doom character was played quit decent by Julian McMahon... Overall, the casting was a big failure.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film features some nice shots of new york, building lights at night, some aerial shots. The music sounds cheap, the crashing cars elements are pretty nice, I especially liked the ones used in the bridge sequence.<br/><br/>I was very much disappointed by this movie. I wouldn't mind all of the above if it was fun, but it wasn't. I just hope for a much much better sequel, but if you have this as a first film, well.. you actually start from scratch."
"xadrezus","10","18","34","26 July 2005"," An honest opinion
","Let me begin by saying I've been a fan of FF since my childhood, and actually I've collected nearly all their issues, specials, crossovers, whatever, that have appeared in print, since #1 to Ultimate, Reborn, Imaginauts, Unstable Molecules, Galactus Trial, Unthinkable, you name it. <br/><br/>Obviously, I've been anxiously waiting for this movie to be released, and was absolutely eager to get to watch it. I did get a copy of the infamous, never-released Roger Corman's FF movie, and had high expectations about what could be done with 20+ times the budget. <br/><br/>Finally, I did read a lot of postings here in IMDb, and a lot of reviews at Rottentomatoes and other sites, including Ebert's, Berardinelli's, etc. <br/><br/>Well, last Saturday I got tickets for my wife, daughter, and myself, to finally see this movie at the theater. I must say I was pleasantly surprised to discover that indeed I liked the movie, a lot, and best of all, my wife, who's always been reluctant to go see superhero movies, found her exception in this one: she really appreciated the family-oriented interaction, the attempts at gentle, well-natured humor, and the characters' attitude in general. In her own words, at the end of the movie: <br/><br/>""Gee, I was fearing I wouldn't like this at all, I usually don't understand superheroes movies, they're so complicated with so much techno-babble and so much angst and pathos and such. But this one is actually funny ! I didn't get it at first with that accident in space and all such, but Johnny and Ben were really marvelous, so fun and lively, they were actually believable, real."" <br/><br/>Indeed. I do agree. Johnny and Ben were absolutely nailed, and they heavily reminded me of the very first issues, say #1 to #20, what with Johnny always playing silly tricks on Ben (like the scene in the movie when Ben's asleep and Johnny is tricking him into splashing some cream on his face), like Ben's aspect, which is not the enormous, forehead-ridged colossus of the later incarnations, but the much smaller, blob-like original Ben. Also, in the earliest issues, Johnny was a fan of car racing, always taking risks and having a number of accidents, including burning out his 'civilian' clothes. That happens in the movie almost exactly, and I found it in close agreement with both the spirit and the actual events in the earliest comics. <br/><br/>As many of you know, Ben started as a regular-sized, muddy-looking blob of a thing, then his skin gained 'definition' with the passing years, getting bigger and more brick-like, then he finally muted to an even bigger, stronger, spiky-looking self. If you're accustomed to Ben v2.0 or Ben v.3.0, you may find the movie's Ben disappointing. But certainly, he looks very much like Ben v1.0, and this movie is centered in FF's origin, i.e., earliest issues. <br/><br/>Same for Johnny. Some people complained about the extreme sports takes, but it certainly goes pretty well with Johnny's attitude and hobbies in the earliest issues. Also, you can't realistically expect a young person to throw himself from a skyscraper without a flinch unless you've previously made it clear that he loves extreme sports and is unafraid of such activities. After we've seen he's fond of risky things, we can believe he would do such a thing. Were he depicted as a run-of-the-mill young man, perhaps liking baseball or basketball or something, making him jump from that height without hesitations would seem unnatural in the extreme. <br/><br/>But I don't want to try and explain my point of view on everything. Yes I noticed a lot of small flaws, inconsistencies, some bits of bad acting, some not-so-nailed events and attitudes, not to mention Dr. Doom's contrived origin, probably forced because you can't really explain both FF's origin AND Dr. Doom's origin at any worthwhile length, yet still have time in the movie for anything else to happen. <br/><br/>But in the end, when all's said and done, I found myself enjoying this movie very much, I actually laughed with many of the jokes and good-natured, simple humor, and I think they really have succeeded in faithfully portraying the family spirit of the very first, earliest issues of the FF. They were pretty much naive and simple back then, and this movie is in close agreement to that. By the end of the movie, I could easily accept that Ben, Johnny, and Sue were the real FF I've come to love, and though Reed and Viktor could do with some tuning, they do not detract excessively from the enjoyment. <br/><br/>In conclusion: a worthy experience, can be improved of course, but it's great family fun just as it is. I did laugh, my family was pleasantly surprised, it made for a wonderful round of comments while dining, and it reminded me of how much I liked those simple 60's antics. Seems a lot of people liked it too, the theater was full (2nd week here), and everyone was happy and cheering at the end. <br/><br/>A thumbs up, and definitely recommended."

","Despite the recent glut of superhero comic book adaptations, many films have actually been good enough to warrant a viewing, with some even bordering on greatness (Spider-Man 2, X2, Hellboy). Sadly, it also becomes inevitable that once in a while, we get uninspired films such as Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>It enrages me whenever people defend crapfests like F4 calling it ""escapist entertainment"", therefore making it critic-proof because no matter how banal the dialogue or how atrocious the performances, it is just meant to be ""mindless"" entertainment right? I don't hate F4 because it's fun-spirited and candy-coated. So is Spider-Man, Singin' in the Rain, or the upcoming Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. But the reason why I despise F4 is that it never strives to be more than a heady string of superhero clichés bound together by a lame script. The whole thing reeks like stale cheese. The sorry attempts at injecting some character development (such as Thing feeling like he doesn't belong) has been done before, and done much better. F4 just wallows in its own mediocrity, perfectly self-content that it's not meant to be taken seriously anyways. And we, as the movie-watching public, have to compromise by saying ""It's good for what it was!"" But why should we compromise, when there are other, better movies out there? I believe there is no such thing as perfection in cinema, but there are films that come dangerously close to achieving it. We have the veritable pick of the litter -- why we continue to patronize trash such as F4 is beyond me."

Most movie critics just don't seem to get it anymore, in that some movies are supposed to be fun. As with any movie with an ensemble cast, it is hard to build characters quickly and in depth. Luckily, for long time fans of the comic, we already have some insights. Reed is so brainy that he is constantly distracted and almost inept at personal relationships. Susan Storm is ambitious, brilliant, and still in love with the hapless Reed. Johnny Storm is as expected, a young brash adrenaline junkie, who seldom thinks before acting or saying anything. Ben Grimm is the lonely, irritable, misshapen Thing. While the others can turn their abilities on and off, Ben is forced to face the loss of his former life and friends as some are repulsed by what he has become. Ben, also becomes the foil for Johnny's immature pranks and comments. Pretty much as was written in the comic's over the years, and they do it well. I do applaud Michael Chiklis's performance. It is hard to convey emotion under all those prosthetics and he makes it work. Also, Ioann Griffudd's slightly bewildered Reed works well. It is fun to watch this super genius struggle with everyday normal occurrences. Ioann plays Reed as distracted and befuddled very well, without making him a parody character.<br/><br/>The special effects were of good quality. I have read some complaints because they weren't more ground breaking. I disagree in that, not every film has to break new FX ground, but effects as in this film must be quality. This movie does use them when needed and as needed for the story, and the movie does not get lost in trying to be an FX film. Lets face it, the Torch on fire is just plain cool.<br/><br/>The story is basic, and with and ensemble cast, unable to create the depth that one would like, but that is what the sequels will be for. With an expected 56+ million dollar opening weekend I am sure there will be more. This movie was a good start and I recommend it to any fan of the genre. Lets face it, everyone waited for Johnny to finally shout ""Flame on!"" and take to the sky.<br/><br/>Victor Doom is much less regal than in the comics, he comes off as just another corporate exec wanting power in the beginning. But his character slowly takes the downward path to total self serving evil through the movie.<br/><br/>Take the kids, re-read some of those old classic copies of the FF, and have a good time. I enjoyed the film, and as usual, was pleased to see Stan Lee's cameo appearance."

","this film did a fairly good job of describing the origins of the fantastic four. but i say that without ever having read any of the comics. there was some pathos with the Thing when his fiancée rejected him. he's the same guy as he always was, he claims. so what if he only has four fingers and looks like he's plastered in cookie dough? the flaming guy, the Human Torch, was fun to watch. good thing he had no nerve endings. good skier though. Elastic Man was benign enough and fairly non-descript. the big surprise here for me was Invisible Girl. i didn't know that Jessica Alba could put in such a horrible performance. she acted more like a junior exec trying to plan an office party than someone undergoing an amazing transformation. she's very pretty, but in this film it's too bad she wasn't invisible the entire time. i watched this film twice trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. if the producers and Tim Story were merely trying to lay the ground work for a sequel, fine. but if the ground work has a shaky foundation i'm not sure a lot of people would go rushing in to the building. i'm sure people of all ages enjoyed this movie but if i were pressed i'd say the biggest demographic are 10-14yr old boys. nothing wrong with that i guess."

","Never has a title been so fantastically misleading. This movie gave the promise of more action than it gave, disappointing audiences. The comedy was forced and awkward making it seem like more of a sitcom than a movie. The cast seemed more like the cast of ""Friends"" mutated into superheroes. The only remotely entertaining actor was Michael Chiklis as the Thing. Chris Evans also made an effort to bring life into this dying story. McMahon played Doom like Donald trump having a mood swing. He added nothing to the character and basically walked through the movie, only trying to get his paycheck. As for Alba and Gruffudd(sry if i spelled that wrong) had boring chemistry and were wet blankets throughout the movie. So much that i basically tuned out whenever they had a scene.<br/><br/>The story was slow and unsatisfying. The acting was flat and the plot twists cliché. Instead of a thrilling action movie, this turned out to be another version of ""The Real World: Mutated"" Boring."

","For all of you who were fearful of going to this movie because of bad reviews from ""professional critics"", take heart. It is worth seeing. I had the same fears but decided to go anyway. I am glad I did. Though ""Batman Begins"" is of a higher caliber, the Fantastic 4 does not disappoint in any way. The special effects are spectacular, the acting is fine (particularly The Thing) and the story is good for an introductory movie (I hope they do more). I suppose the ""professional critics"" make their comparisons to Academy Award winners when they pan movies like this. Or maybe they don't like movies with heroes if the heroes are not actors with famous Hollywood pedigrees. I have seen War of the Worlds, Batmen Begins, and the Revenge of the Sith this summer and Fantastic 4 ranks right up there with them in terms of enjoyment and entertainment. So ignore the critics, go have a good time and see if you can figure out how they did the trash truck scene."
"thefoxtrot-1","9","17","32","10 July 2005"," This movie was great, no, Fantastic!!
","Fist let me state that you cannot go into this movie with the same expectations as batman. They are two different stories and approaches, they are incomparable. The fantastic four is meant to be light hearted, not at all dramatic. Some of you batman fan boys should actually read a fantastic four comic. They are four people who just happened to get super powers, that's it. No parents or uncle died. No sacrifices had to be made. They were just four people who were thrown together by and unfortunate incident, which made them heroes. That's it. If you are expecting some sort of devious physiological movie with tragedy and sadness, this isn't really for you. It was funny and just a feel good movie. If you're into movies that are good and make you feel good, then go see it. If you're not into that then don't, but please don't criticize the characters for the way they were written. And don't attack the basis by which the actually comic was written. ""The comic has typically emphasized that the Fantastic Four, unlike most superhero teams, are truly a family. Three of the four members are directly related (with the Thing being the exception), and additionally, the children of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, Franklin Richards and Valeria Richards, are regulars on the series. Additionally, while the Thing is not actually related to the other members, his relationship with Mister Fantastic and the Human Torch is nonetheless quite sibling-like."" In conclusion, it rockedÂ…hard. Go see it. The critics got this one wrong."

","I have to say I was skeptical about this film like everyone else, but I found myself enjoying the movie through and through when I was at the theater. Sure, it's no masterpiece like Spider-man 2 or Batman Begins, but it's definitely good. I give it an 8, and I have high hopes for the sequel. I may be a bit biased seeing as I am a long time comic book fan, but let me tell you that everyone I saw the movie with (7 of my friends) thought it was a kick ass film. Sure it has it's cheesy and corny moments, but most of them are for humor. I suggest you see this and decide for yourself. Bottom Line: Don't go in expecting the next Godfather, go in expecting a fun, family, summer popcorn film and you will most likely enjoy it."

","FANTASTIC FOUR Fox 2005 Color 91 minutes Action-Fantasy Jessica Alba, Iaon Gruffurd, Michael Chicklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon star. Directed by Tim Story Rated PG-13 for adult themes and violence So how fantastic is the new comic book flick Fantastic Four. Well I'm happy to say that it's pretty fantastic. Now don't get me wrong this film is by no means intelligent, ground breaking, creative or even semi original. But it doesn't pretend to be. it's nothing more than dumb fun and it's slightly refreshing to a see a film of such caliber. Director Tim Story of the highly enjoyable and under appreciated Taxi takes a hot cast of 5 and turns four of them into a superhero squad and one of them into a villain. thats basically the premise it's not much more except that they fight. And yes they actually really do fight. The spfx are pretty good and well used and the acting is acceptable for the film. Surprisingly Jessica Alba looks gorgeous and doesn't suck too bad. Ioan Gruffurd of King Arthur fame does a nice job of filling out his hunky suit. Making him the film's more mature looking and minded sexy guy. Michael Chicklis looks very cool and plays the part well as the Thing. Julian McMahon of Nip/Tuck turns in a sexy performance as Doom and the standout performance here is really mega sexy Chris Evans. whose undeniable comic appeal and likability makes him the films real star. Plus the fact if it was just him waling around near naked or in aform fitting suit the entire film that would along be the price of a movie ticket. God look at those abs and that ass. Whew! alright let me stop. Anyways the film is dumb fun. The first real summer flick to come out this year in my opinion. Check it out! you won't be disappointed if you know what to expect. B+"
"Vince_In_Milan","1","16","30","26 April 2006"," A Cookie Cutter Superhero Flick.
","This must be one of the worst films to come out of 2005.<br/><br/>It's a bog standard superhero flick, but with characters that are impossible to really feel for or even care about, action that peters out fairly quickly, and a plot that you've seen a thousand times before. It seems pretty obvious that the Studio was convinced that all you really need to make a superhero flick is wafer thin characters a lot of garish colours.<br/><br/>What I find incredible is that the Studio had hundreds of ppl looking at this film as they made it, and nobody seems to have realized that it was rubbish. And it isn't as if there weren't some decent superhero films to cop ideas off. Spiderman, for example, was a much better film.<br/><br/>Even if you have nothing better to watch, don't bother with this film. Paint the kitchen, go for a walk. Telephone your grandmother, maybe. You'll be doing yourself a favour."

","This was one of the best movies based on comics to come out. As a matter of fact it is one of the best period. If someone has never read a Fantastic Four comic, you could still love this movie. It was fun to watch, had some of the best special effects I have ever seen, and the characters were right on the money like their comic counterparts. I have been a huge fan of comics for the last 20 years, and this is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. I have loved the other comic movies that have come out in recent years(Spidey,xmen,batman begins,blade,etc.), but the FF has been most like the comics and with the effects and acting is the best. I would encourage anyone to go see it and have a great time doing so."
"moviemanMA","7","10","17","8 July 2005"," Comic Book Fans...UNITE!!!
","Marvel Comics have been shelling out the comic book based movies for a while now. Spiderman, The Hulk, The Punisher, all have been transformed from paper to film. Their latest selection is the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Director Tim Story (Taxi, Barber Shop) has taken on this project of making Marvel's classic comic book, Fantastic Four. The story starts with Prof. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) go to talk with Reed's old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) about his Doom's helping Reed's project. His idea is to study the affects of cosmic radiation on DNA in space. Sue Storm and her brother Johnny (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) are also on the mission into space.<br/><br/>Due to a freak occurrence, radiation mutates the five's DNA while in space. Each now possessing their own unique power. Reed can bend his body like rubber with little effort. He is Mr. Fantastic. Johnny's body temperature is incredibly high and he can create fire and even light himself on fire. Johnny also can fly. He is the Human Torch. His sister Sue can become invisible and also create force fields for keeping things in or out around her. Sue is the Inivisible Woman. Ben is now The Thing. He is totally covered in solid rock...inside and outside. He also has incredible strength. He cannot turn his power off like the others. Lastly, Doom, like Ben, is totally covered with an element. This time it is a super hard metal. He also can absorb and use electricity. Doom goes the way of the villain while the other four join forces to figure out what happened.<br/><br/>The movie is very much like a comic book. The dialogue between characters is written to sound like a comic book. Johnny, the hot headed character (literally), brings comedy with his quick witty remarks. Ben brings drama with his depression of losing his wife due to his mutation. The contrast between these two characters is fun to watch. Johnny is always trying to get under his skin. Even though he is solid rock, it's not hard to do. He has the hardest time adapting. With a relationship in the past for Reed and Sue, they have their own little story as well, just like a comic book. Doom, being the rich bad guy, wants nothing more than more power.<br/><br/>Although the script gets cheesy at times, it works. There isn't as much action as I had anticipated, but when there is, there is a lot of it. Great effects make Fantastic Four an enjoyable movie for fans of the comic book, children, and adults as well. Fantastic Four is a good movie for the genre. Ben says to Sue, ""You have no idea what I'd give to be invisible..."", but I'm sure that is not the case for the movie. I'm sure a lot of people will see this one."

","Another unjustly bashed movie. Of course it is not masterpiece of cinematography, but it doesn't try to be. Solid adaptation of comic-book in manner typical for Marvel - expensive, huge, light and very entertaining. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in tight costume.

"connmoore","4","5","7","20 May 2007"," Disappointing all around.
","They took the first family of comic books, and made a mediocre movie about them. The biggest issue is the lackluster script, with changes made in the basic characters that just did not need to be made. Dr. Doom, the comic worlds ultimate villain is worst served by this, making him into a smarmy businessman whose big threat is he wants to make more money. (The comic book Doctor Doom is a vicious dictator of a country who is a legitimate threat to take over the world. Now Dooms powers are all part of being part of the same accident that gave the Fantastic Four theirs, rather then him being a super genius inventor. The plot, what there is of it, is thin...the Four get their powers, don't know if they want them, and Doom attacks them. Thats it.<br/><br/>The casting also suffers from Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, who, in this version of the FF, is not only a hot babe, but supposedly a genius on par with Reed Richards himself. Pointless since her supposed genius is never used in this movie, and Alba is not capable of creating an intelligent character like that.<br/><br/>The other ""Four"" are good physically, with Michael Chiklis being an inspired choice for Ben Grimm, the Thing. The special effects for the group are also passable, again with the make up for the Thing being quite good.<br/><br/>All in all its just a bad film. With WAY too many ""X Games"" scenes involving Johnny Storm, scene after scene of the Invisible Girl turning invisible for no good reason, and Reed Richards, Mr Fantastic shown having the common sense of a 13 year old boy.<br/><br/>One of the worst of the wave of comic book movies to come down in the last dozen years or so. The WORST part being that essentially the same cast and crew is coming back for the sequel. I do not hold out much hope that this group can do any better the second time around."

","All I've seen is negative comments about this movie, and I just don't get it, or at least, I didn't at first. This movie has humor, and yet it is still similar to the comics it is based on. Is it exact? NO! WHAT movie in the world is always the exact as the original thing it is based on? Very few of them, and frankly, I have nothing bad to say about this movie.<br/><br/>They've already made their money on the comics and the story in the comics, now their making money off the movies, which although have the same general idea, is completely different. Change isn't always bad, and in this case, I think this movie was done well. The characters were all different, just like before. The important parts are the same, and by that I of course mean the characters names as well as their powers.<br/><br/>Say what you want about this movie, but all I have to say is this. Don't judge it by what I say, don't judge it by what others say. Judge it by what you think... rent it, watch it, and if you like it, great, and if you don't, well I guess you don't. People can say whatever they want about this movie or any movie for that matter, but go by what you think. Personally, I believe that this movie was great. Having never read the actual comics that it is based on, however, means that I am of course vulnerable to like it. If I were to read the comic now, I may not like it as much.<br/><br/>Personally, I give it a 10/10, forgetting entirely that its based on a comic, and just judging the movie on whole."
"Scarlet-22","7","5","7","20 July 2005"," ""Come on! Am I the only one who thinks this is cool?""
","Truer words will never come out of a movie character's mouth this year than the sentiments expressed by Johnny Storm about his newfound abilities. This flick got a bum rap from critics, whom I can only guess have plain forgotten how to have fun at the movies. As a longtime FF fan and Marvel fan in general, I was beginning to despair that Marvel only knew how to make good superhero movies when their subjects contained some variation of the word ""Man"" in their names (Spider-Man, X-Men), and the internet buzz wasn't promising any relief from that worry. Thankfully, I was proved wrong. FANTASTIC FOUR isn't a great film by any stretch (pun intended) of the imagination, but it isn't bad, either. It's a fun popcorn romp, but don't check your brain at the door; you'll need it a few times to get some of the more subtle moments in this surprisingly nuanced picture.<br/><br/>You've read the synopsis a hundred times in a hundred reviews, so I won't repeat it here. Suffice it to say the movie works best when it focuses on what makes the FF comics work best: The interaction between the main characters, particularly our ""Fantastic Four"", as the press dubs them (the movie makes the interesting point that superheroes in today's world would be the rock stars, reality TV personalities, sports superstars, etc., crystalizing in a scene where Sue runs away pursued by fans when she stops at a newsstand and stares at her likeness on every magazine and newspaper). Reed and Sue's dysfunctional romance, Sue and Johnny's sibling spats, Reed and Victor's ongoing scientific (and personal) oneupmanship battle, Johnny and Ben's chest-puffery, Reed and Ben's longtime loyal friendship strained by guilt and frustration--it's all here, and more. Tim Story showed in BARBERSHOP that he could do personal interaction with the best of them, and while his ability to stage action shots is a little haphazard in this movie, the personal scenes shine brighter than Johnny Storm's supernova-capable inner torch.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good, with Jessica Alba as Sue Storm being the only weak link (and she's not bad, just not as good as the others). Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is the film's comic relief, a role he plays with relish; by the end of the movie, you're laughing every time he's on-screen. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm manages to gather the perfect blend of anger, humor, gentleness, and pathos; you really feel for Ben's situation by the end of the movie, particularly when he has to make a hard choice near the end whether to save his friends or reclaim his humanity. Ioan Gruffudd has taken a lot of flack in some reviews for his less-showy portrayal of Reed Richards, but Reed as a character is less showy than his counterparts, and Gruffudd perfectly captures the intensity of Reed's exacting, almost paralyzing intellect that blends with a genuine sense of distress about his miscalculation of the cosmic storm's intensity that got them all into this mess. The interaction between Reed and Ben is especially well-done; in many ways, Reed and Ben are both in similar situations--their bodies have turned into something they don't quite understand and can't always control (Sue awakens Reed after he falls asleep at his desk and discovers his face has molded into the shape of his computer keyboard), and the scene where the two of them get into a fight over a not-yet-complete reverse mutation machine (Ben: ""Look at me!"" Reed: ""I AM looking at you! That's why I can't make a mistake with this!"") is right up there with some of the great character interactions in the SPIDER-MAN and X-MEN movies.<br/><br/>As for Victor Von Doom, well, Julian McMahon isn't bad, but he isn't good either. I'd have preferred Doom to be a little more menacing, but when he finally takes the turn and embraces his own destiny, it's fun to watch. McMahon's sly, silky evil turn as Doom doesn't quite measure up to the better Marvel villains of recent movies (Bryan Cox in X2, Alfred Molina in SPIDER-MAN 2), but there are moments where he's genuinely scary, and that's just enough to keep the audience interested as the tension builds toward a really good (if a bit short) final showdown between the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom worthy of the comics.<br/><br/>The ending strongly suggests a sequel is coming, and the movie certainly deserves it. It's not perfect, but it's a darn good start to what will likely one day join the ranks of Marvel's great superhero movies."
"GOWBTW","10","5","7","16 July 2005"," My favorite quotes are FLAME ON! & IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!
","This movie was not all hoopla! The Fantastic Four has come, and they are fighting evil! The entire cast for this movie was excellent! Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic Jessica Alba as Susan Storm aka The Invisible Girl Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm aka The Thing And Chris Evans as Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch. What do you get? The Fantastic Four! These heroes were seemingly reluctant to accept this gift, except for Johnny of course. He seems to handle the situation very well. He is cocky, but cool in many ways, just like in the comics. Michael Chiklis known for roles and shows like ""The Commish"" and ""The Shield"" is perfect for playing The Thing. He may look like a freak show, but he has the strength, and the attitude to back it up. Jessica Alba was very hot in ""Dark Angel"" , in FF she's even hotter as Susan Storm. I remember in one issue when The Invisible Woman wore a very revealing costume, in the movie everyone knows she's even hotter, visible or invisible! HAHAHAHA!!! Ioan Gruffudd done excellent as Reed. Not much to say about his other works, but it's a 10 for me. Julian McMahon know for the role as a plastic surgeon in ""Nip/Tuck"" matched his role as the dreaded Dr. Victor Von Doom. Depite the few changes in the movie, I liked it very well. Wasn't like the other Marvel Comics based movies I've seen. It was very worth my while, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. The one power I would have is The Thing's super strength. I would charge through any barricade saying: IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!! Rating 5 stars!"
"DarthBill","1","15","28","26 February 2006"," Not very fantastic at all
","Not all comic books translate well to the big screen, whether because the material is too complex or too offbeat or because the people handling it just don't know what to do with it or because the powers that be want something that isn't what the source material is at all. And sometimes a comic book movie franchise can start off well but end terribly - see the Superman and Batman films made circa 1978-1987 and 1989-1997 respectively. Meanwhile, ""Spawn"", ""Steel"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" h ave not done too well.<br/><br/>So far the X-Men and Spider-Man films, while not without their flaws and weak points, have been very successful and popular with both fans and critics, but other Marvel properties such as Captain America, Daredevil, Elektra, the Incredible Hulk and the Punisher, have only run the gamut from noble failure to complete steaming pile of dog crap. But surely the Fantastic Four should have been one of the more dud proof Marvel properties in the hit or miss summer business, and in a way, they were, for this 2005 film did well enough to be considered a hit and garner a sequel despite poor acting, poor plot, and poor direction from Tim Story. Exactly how this extremely bad adaptation of the superhero quartet that not only single handedly saved Marvel in the 1960s but pave the way for a string of heroes who, for better or worse, would go on to outshine and overshadow them in terms of sales and popularity became a hit is a mystery to me. While not as bad as ""Elektra"" or ""Catwoman"" (oh it hurts to even mention that one), the 2005 Fantastic Four is a failure on most levels (I can only imagine how bad the 1994 version was).<br/><br/>Things that are wrong with the film? Well, first of all, the film's biggest weak link is Jessica Alba as Susan 'Sue' Storm, AKA: The Invisible Girl/Woman. Sue Storm is not an ugly, pasty looking Hispanic girl, she is a nice looking Caucasian woman who is at least 30 years old. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Alba is a very bad actress; she couldn't emote to save her life. Whenever she tries to sound tough or passionate or authoritative, she comes across as bland, hollow, dispassionate, and uninspired (it's like watching Natalie Portman in the Star Wars prequel trilogy). When Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) is told he could have any woman in the world but indicates that Sue is very special, it's hard to understand exactly what it is about Sue that he finds so compelling or intriguing or worthy of his evil, twisted lust, since there isn't really much at the core of Sue in this uninspired film translation. And if you think I'm being mean, the British press described Alba's miscasting and poor characterization of Sue as a cross between a whiny, pushy bitch and a hollow lust object - but who in their right mind would find Alba even remotely attractive is beyond me. If they had to go under 30 to cast the Invisible Woman, with the intention of having the Invisible Woman be caught repeatedly with her clothes off, they could have at least hired an actress who was actually good looking, like Amy Smart, Ali Larter or Julia Stiles - Julia Stiles at least projects an Earthiness not seen in most actresses her age. One of the great leading ladies of comic books (alongside Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, Jean Grey and Storm), Sue Storm-Richards deserved better, and so did Ioan Gruffud's Mr. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Alba's male co-stars, the aforementioned Ioan Gruffud as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Chris Evans as her younger brother Johnny Storm/Human Torch and Michael Chikilis as Ben Grimm/the Thing, fair much better than she does. Gruffud is an affable, absent minded Reed, but as with Dr. Doom, it's hard to imagine exactly what it is Reed sees in Alba's Sue. Evans does the cocky yet likable young guy thing as well as any other actor his age can. Michael Chikilis is easily the strongest of the four as the cranky, crotchety Thing. If only he'd have clobbered Tim Story...<br/><br/>Julian McMahon, meanwhile, is a very poor Dr. Doom. McMahon's Doom is very hollow and empty, lacking the powerful presence, malice, charm and evil incarnate necessary to make Doom register as a threat. And this is Dr. Doom for crying out loud, one of the most famous Marvel villains out there! This guy is to the Fantastic Four what Magneto is to the X-Men, and also a rumored inspiration for Darth Vader of the Star Wars films! <br/><br/>A few decent action sequences and a few genuinely funny moments aren't enough to elevate this thing above the garbage that it is. Tim Story, chosen with only the urban comedy ""Barbershop"" as his standout credit, because the Marvel folk wanted to take a change of pace from the gritty, brooding superhero films that dominate so much of today's market, which I can appreciate, but it failed miserably because Story has no knack for subtlety or action sequences. The violence is mildly engaging but hardly exciting, especially since Story failed to properly flesh out the characters enough to make you care as to whether or not they'll survive and save humanity.<br/><br/>Just skip it and stick with the comic books. Or even the 1994-1996 animated version."

","I know the current trend in comic book adaptations today is to clad the protagonist/s head-to-toe in black and pull out the thesaurus to see just how many ways they can be described as ""serious."" ""Grim."" ""Gritty."" ""Dark."" ""Hard-edged."" Blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>Well, thank goodness someone had the sense to buck that trend where this film and these characters were concerned. It's The Fantastic Four for crying out loud! Hats off to the filmmakers for remembering that!<br/><br/>All the actors turned in stellar performances, but special mention must go to Michael Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as The Human Torch. Both of them did an outstanding job portraying these comic book character legends and their back-and-forth banter was delivered with such precision timing that you actually believed you were watching two friends bicker as opposed to two actors doing their jobs.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba could have easily been sidelined as the obligatory pretty face, but The Invisible Girl was well-written and she handed in a performance that was neither aggravatingly passive nor overwhelmingly shrewish - she played the role of exasperated sister and pining lover with subtle perfection.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffud and Julian MacMahon must likewise be credited for turning in performances that didn't scream melodrama. If anything, it looked like they got in front of the camera and enjoyed themselves. And fortunately for all of us, they remembered to include us in the fun.<br/><br/>The script did take some liberties with the comic book origin - but these liberties were taken well. Too often a screenplay tries to be faithful to the source material and the writer forgets just one key factor: that comic books are comic books and movies are movies. Their dramatic structure is different and the written word is not the same as the spoken word.<br/><br/>The changes, such as they were, were perhaps not the most inspired, creatively-speaking, but neither did they insult the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>Fan of the comics or not, The Fantastic Four will be a thoroughly enjoyable film to all viewers. The acting, as I said, was A+. The special effects? Superb. The action sequences? Lacked the MTV-type editing that makes my head hurt and were expertly choreographed and well-paced.<br/><br/>All in all, see this movie for what it is - a good excuse to sit down and enjoy yourself. That's all it promises and it certainly delivers!"

","Comic book movies are notoriously hit-or-miss, if you want proof look at some of the Batman movies. This movie is without a doubt a miss.

This movie is a classic case of ""crap in, crap out.""<br/><br/>With lines like ""'You're hot!' 'Thanks so are you.'"" in the trailer, we all could predict this to be a horrendously stupid movie.

Now one might say ""Ed, at least the special effects were cool,"" which they were, but a turd is still a turd polished or not.<br/><br/>With a climax so anti-climactic and acting that wouldn't convince a toddler, I deem this movie unfit for human consumption.

"ProphetTenebrae","5","24","49","16 July 2005"," Disappointing adaption of the classic superhero comic
","It's hardly a new or original observation to say that comic book conversions are very much a hit or miss affair. Films like Batman Begins show the better side, Elektra the worse. This film is somewhere between those two extremes.<br/><br/>The start of these franchises are always a bit tricky, characters that have been around (in this case for more than half a century) have to quickly be conveyed to an audience that most likely know nothing about them.<br/><br/>There is nothing fatally wrong about the film, the acting is a bit subpar for everyone except The Thing. The Doctor Doom character is rather laughable as a villain and doesn't really resemble the comic villain at all - and despite being a rich billionaire with plenty to lose, he goes totally crazy.<br/><br/>The effects are of the level you'd expect from a summer blockbuster - the Thing makeup is actually pretty impressive. The forcefields, flaming and stretching are all pretty good - although clearly CGI.<br/><br/>The humour is actually surprisingly not awful. It won't have you rolling in the aisles but it generally illicits a smile and doesn't usually fall flat on its face.<br/><br/>So overall, it's not too horrible but it just falls short of the mark. Probably too much empty talking and not quite enough super powered action and shabby acting. Anyway, it's not too bad and if you like comics, it's worth watching."

","Wow... bad bad bad... I went into this movie wanting to like it, but skeptical as well. I didn't want to over-hype it. I couldn't have imagined it being any worse. The entire screenplay has to be one of the MOST contrived pieces of writing ever written. Why was EVERYONE on the same bridge? The Thing saves a guy, but causes a massive accident, and it just so happens that the other three, having not seen Ben Grimm since he transformed, are in the taxi on the bridge and just assume that it was their good friend Ben that caused it??? And then Mr. Fantastic says to the Invisible Woman, ""You're the only one that can get past."" But the second she arrives on the other side of the police blockade, Mr. Fantastic and The Human Torch are there with her! After the quick and boring action on the bridge, they are instantly portrayed as heroes, and are accepted as such. Except by the Thing's wife, who's also on the bridge and then takes off her wedding ring and walks off crying.<br/><br/>The plot holes are bigger than Ben Grimm's pants!! Most of the movie just deals with them trying to find out how to fix themselves and get back to normal, and it's pretty boring while they do it. There is no character development and no action... and they say that the special effects could not have been made before this year, well.. they sure didn't look that good to me. If you want a special effects bonanza, go watch War of the Worlds. If you want a good story focusing on the characters rather than plot points, go watch Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this movie... and send a message to Hollywood that comic book movies must be done properly, that they can't just throw one together and make a ton of cash off it."
"orionquest13","8","8","13","24 January 2006"," A fun and vibrant film well worth watching!
","What I liked about this film is the colorful and bright approach. If you have seen it then you know what I mean, especially as compared to the comic book films that have been recently released by D.C. comics among others. Though there are those that like the dark and dreary approach I found the vibrant look and attitude of the film to be most refreshing and think that this is a trend that I have seen with Marvel Comics films. In my opinion this makes them superior, especially in the wake of such tragedies that have been experienced in the real world. This films light hearted approach offers hope in a fictional world that left a smile on my face when I left the theater. So for those that may be looking for a break from the bleak look and feel of superhero movies like Batman Returns then it would be worth your time to check out The Fantastic Four. Not only is it a fun filled thrill ride but the movie even pokes fun of itself at times. Bottom line, good times! Besides, Maria Menounous as a nurse!"
"dee.reid","8","8","13","8 July 2005"," It's ""Fantastic"" in a way I didn't think possible
","If you're reading this, then there's a high possibility that you've already taken a chance or are at least interested in seeing ""Fantastic Four."" The film is big, loud, and totally captured my interest in a way that a number of movies already out this summer haven't, except for ""Batman Begins,"" which is another adaptation of a popular comic book superhero.<br/><br/>Where other superhero flicks have probably failed or have not lived up to their full camp potential (save Sam Raimi's marvelous ""Spider-Man"" movies), ""Fantastic Four,"" surprisingly, succeeds, especially in its joy and role as a summer crowd-pleaser and I make those judgments out of amusement, not criticism. Though I'm not big on Marvel Comics' cosmic foursome, the Fantastic Four certainly do rank as their most popular team of heroic mutants outside the X-Men.<br/><br/>Even more surprisingly, some may realize that this is not the first time Fantastic Four has gotten the green light as a motion picture; some may remember a straight-to-video version from 1994 that a lot of people merely laugh at. But this big-budget screen adaptation, directed by Tim Story (of ""Barbershop"" fame), is ""fantastic"" and fun and may be one of the better special effects bonanzas we'll see this summer.<br/><br/>Beginning with a trip into outer space, a team of five scientists - Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and the mission's sponsor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) - have journeyed to Doom's space station to monitor a radioactive energy cloud that's set to pass by Earth.<br/><br/>This energy cloud, we learn, may have been responsible for the beginning of life on Earth. A mishap in the mission occurs when they learn that the energy cloud is approaching the station hours before it was scheduled to pass by. The team members are exposed and the next thing the audience realizes, they're back on planet Earth recovering from their ordeal.<br/><br/>They all seem fine, except that Reed's feeling a little more ""loose"" than usual, Susan's having trouble seeing her reflection, Johnny's ""hot,"" and Ben's skin is hardening. Before long, we've got four mutants on our hands:<br/><br/><ul><li>Reed becomes ""Mr. Fantastic,"" in that he can stretch, bend, and otherwise reconfigure his body and give Plastic Man a run for his money; shame about the grays though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Susan becomes the ""Invisible Woman"" - 'nuff said. Well, not exactly. She can't turn completely invisible but she can bend light, which of course doesn't amount to the same thing. But, it becomes harder to see her, which may be a disappointment to those who expected to see a naked Ms. Alba (even though she does strip a few times but sadly, we can't see her when that happens).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Johnny becomes the ""Human Torch"" and with those famous words ""Flame On!"" - he's on fire - literally, and the girls are melting over him. I can still picture that famous scene where the nurse shoves a thermometer in his mouth and she reads a computer monitor and exclaims, ""You're hot!"" to which Johnny coolly replies, ""Why, thank you. So are you.""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And lastly, there's poor Ben, who's my personal favorite FF member, who becomes ""The Thing,"" and he's less +Rocky+ than Stallone but more heartfelt than The Rock himself.</li></ul><br/><br/>The characters bicker amongst themselves like a close family as they try to figure out what's happening to them. After a daring rescue on the Brooklyn Bridge, the four become instant media heroes and are dubbed ""The Fantastic Four."" Johnny gets the most exposure of course, Reed and Susan try to sort out their tentative romance, and poor Ben struggles with his unsightly figure.<br/><br/>This will all have to be brushed to the side, however, when Victor notices he's feeling a little ""steely,"" and he becomes ""Dr. Doom"" and wishes to challenge our four heroes. As it would turn out, he was affected as well by exposure to the energy cloud and he now has control over electricity and (surprise, surprise) he has plans on world domination.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four"" raises the bar on superhero flicks in a way not quite seen since the modern genre was kicked off with ""Superman"" (1978). I say that it is extremely enjoyable, doesn't take itself seriously, and is forever charming. This film embraces its camp elements and just goes to town with the humor, which, from my experience in the theater today, was met with a wildly positive response.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, though I'm no FF geek, I can honestly say that this instantly ranks as one of the more fun, less serious of the lighter superhero movies. We have four excellent leads who come together on-screen and realize their lives' mission in saving the world from imminent destruction at the hands of a madman.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four"" is fun and flawed but likable in a way that those flaws can be brushed under a carpet and left there for good. I just hope the DVD is as fantastic as a I anticipate it should be.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Remember the Four from comic books, and the cool powers they had? The only power exerted by this cast is as a tranquilizer to the audience.<br/><br/>Quite bad. A few scenes from other superhero movies are recycled, and poorly. No tension, drama, or even comedy, just some exaggerated CGI images. The group respond to their developing abilities like spoiled children throwing temper tantrums. They resent each other, then suddenly adapt to teamwork; who could have possibly seen that original plot device coming? <br/><br/>Apparently, the radiation that mutated their genes, not only gave them super powers, but also the acting talents of card board cut-outs. The guy playing Doom belongs in a ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" commercial. If he had more mousse in his hair, he'd catch on fire from spontaneous combustion. Speaking of which, the Human Torch guy is just plain irritating, and never shuts up. I kept hoping he'd fry his own mouth, but no such luck. Jessice Alba does no acting at all, just the inevitable ""Invisible Girl re-materializing at an embarrassing moment"" bit. The guy playing Mr. Fantastic tries, but the idiotic things they do with his character make him look more like a used wad of ""Mr. Chewing Gum Stick."" The only actor that succeeds is Michael Chiklis portraying Ben/ Thing's struggles with his freakish mutation. The sub plot with Ben and his wife is as close to a story as you'll get, but even that is thinly scripted.<br/><br/>The finale is so poorly executed you'd swear it must be intended as a parody, but even on that level, it fails. Pretty much like the whole movie."

I have to say though I was pleasantly surprised. The movie is a bit tongue-in-cheek and it doesn't have the serious nature of other superhero flicks such as this summers' Batman Begins. I found this style to be refreshing and extremely perfect for America's first comic book team. Things that I thought would bother me didn't. For example, the make up effects on The Thing were well done and actually cool - I didn't miss the CGI like I thought I would. Jessica Alba, not a talented actress in my opinion (although she's gorgeous), actually does a good job of playing up Sue Storm's sweetness. Chris Evans, who I thought would be ridiculously over-the-top, was funny and cocky, just like I would picture Johnny Storm.<br/><br/>If you like comic book films I'd say this is worth taking a look at.

"Quinoa1984","3","7","11","17 May 2007"," a disappointment as far as comic-book adaptations go in this day and age
","What makes Fantastic Four such a grave misstep of a summer blockbuster is that potential for a better movie is squandered. This potential lies mostly in what was likely a better screenplay- co-written by Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost (which was, in truth, the reason I decided to check out this movie two years after its initial release)- before the producers and other 'committee' members that usually go over and make up their own 'bits' to put into the movie took over. There are kernels of a more entertaining flick here, even as just a goofy B-movie (certain lines of dialog, like ""the clouds are accelerating"" or Thing's line to kids ""don't do drugs). But there's just basic problems that end up becoming all the more apparent and actually annoying as it rolls along.<br/><br/>For one thing the characters have been dumbed down, either by aforementioned producers or whomever (maybe it was even Frost for all I know), for a mainstream audience; they're like the fantastic four for the pre-teen mall crowd (i.e. the scene where Johnny Storm goes snowboarding with the nurse seems like it should be on one of those monitors that plays in the food court). There could still be some interesting things to have with stock characters, with one of them at least, Ben Grimm/Thing (played in maybe the only half-way decent job by Michael Chiklis), being compelling in the traditional conflicted superhero fashion of person vs individual powers. But the actors chosen are really all but second-rate, as the characters ask to be played by stars, not so much TV people (yes, even Jessica Alba, as sexy as she can be stripping off to go invisible, ho-ho); Chris Evans also makes it in my un-official book as one of the most annoying performances in any movie in the past few years.<br/><br/>And finally, there's the actual craftsmanship being Fantastic Four, which feels the most lax. At a time period when the comic-book adaptation brings out from filmmakers their strongest gifts at making exciting action sequences, spectacular special effects, and fun comedy amid the high momentum of thrilling moments, Tim Story just doesn't cut it with the rest of them (i.e. Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, Chris Nolan). Maybe this should've been expected, as it is his first huge summer action movie, but nevertheless his skills at making action seem dynamic- chiefly with what should be a harrowing rescue scene on the Brooklyn bridge- is close to nil, and seems to not have much input into making the intentionally comedic moments, or just slight moments of wit, worth even a chuckle. And unfortunately Story isn't even outrageous enough to make Fantastic Four an awesomely bad movie, where there can be some guilty-pleasure to be had in over-the-top performances. Timing seems to be off in several scenes with the fantastic four dealing with their conflicts of newly found powers, and doesn't even have a kooky enough villain in Doom.<br/><br/>All around, it's a let-down, mostly as one looking at the writing, which I almost feel a little sorry for (the writers, I mean, not necessarily the script as it appears in the final product), and the filmmakers don't seem to know that it lacks the dimension in character or the punch in action and visual splendor to even sit in the same crowd as a Spiderman or Batman movie."

The group dynamic and tension is spot on throughout the whole thing, and the relationship between Sue and Reed is *perfect*. Kudos to whoever chose the cast, as they also did a perfect job, Chris Evans as Johnny plays to the 'playboy' ideal perfectly, and Jessica Alba pulls up the sisterly and motherly side of her character. What's best is the interactions between the characters, and they deal with the whole 'I have superpowers now' with distrust and fear instead of 'cool! Let's go so something!' which makes it so much more realistic. If the sequel's anything like this, it'll be a fantastic film! Let's just hope they don't destroy it as Hollywood has a penchant for doing."
"vanhalen1","10","13","24","21 July 2005"," Awesome, fun, fantastic movie!!!!!
","I LOVED IT!!!!!!! I have been waiting for a big budget FF movie since I was 10 years old, and I wasn't disappointed! The special effects were amazing! They also picked the perfect cast for it, the dialog that they wrote for it was great too, the Thing and the Torch were hilarious, especially when they argue, just like in the comics.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest comic book movies ever made! I say it is tied with X-Men as my second favorite superhero movie, only X-2 is better, and not by much! I think if they make an FF 2, it will have more action and be as good or better than X-Men 2.<br/><br/>I wish the movie didn't end so soon, I could have watched it for another few hours. I was hoping that the fight with Doom lasted longer at the end, it was still very cool though.<br/><br/>The Thing was AWESOME!!!! He looked great, and his personality was dead on like the comics, the voice was great too. My favorite scene in the whole movie was when the truck ran into him and was destroyed, that looked incredible! The Human Torch/Johnny was just like he was in the comics especially in the early days. The scene with him flying through New York City escaping the rocket was my favorite scene with him.<br/><br/>Mr. Fantastic was casted really well, I like the guy, he looked like Reed, and he acted like the leader of the group. Him tying up the Thing in their fight was great! The Invisible Girl was casted perfectly, I actually think Jessica Alba is sexier than the comic book version. It isn't hard at all to imagine Reed and Victor falling for her. Especially in that scene when she was stripping to turn invisible and she appeared in her bra and panties for a few seconds.<br/><br/>Dr. Doom looked like Doom without his mask and I liked the actor that played him. I have to admit, it bothered me a bit that they changed his origin for the movie. The comic book origin is much better. It seemed a bit strange that he wore a mask when his body was metal already. They got his mask dead on though, it looked wicked. I also wished they gave him a mechanical voice, I always imagined Doom with a voice more like Darth Vaders. My favorite scene with Doom was when he blew a hole through that guy, that was awesome! The Stan Lee cameo was great, it is too bad Jack Kirby wasn't alive to see this too. He would have loved it for sure.<br/><br/>I can't wait for FF 2!"

","A lot of people say that ""its not as good as X-Men but its not as bad as Daredevil"" well I saw neither so I have nothing to base this movie off of. It was really cool to see for the first time my favorite comic book on screen and I thought they did it really good. I liked how they really portrayed the characters with their powers. Reed is stretched by love and science, Ben has this hard persona, Sue's not seen as a person, and Johnny is this hothead. It was really good to see them more of people than as superheroes. It was also cool to see the egotistical Victor VonDoom. To see more of a successful... for lack of a better word, jerk, turn into more or less a sore looser plus he was really creepy which was a good thing! It is a lot more humorous than Spiderman (though I saw Spiderman in French so I don't know how funny it is)so for those of you who want more of a thrill I would see War of the Worlds. For those who like action and comedy, go see Fantastic Four. It should have a sequel too!"
"Ken7i","10","13","24","13 July 2005"," Fantastic 4 me =)
","Watching trailers and judging from the cast (Jessica Alba: attractive female actress - meaning testosterone filled audiences), I knew the movie to be corny, shallow and uninteresting. Don't get me wrong though! I liked this movie. I thought it was good.<br/><br/>And why well, I'll tell you why. It is not necessary to beat deep meaning into a comic-book adaptation (they tried that in both the Spidey and Batty movies--- I guess they succeeded to an extent but that's besides the point); and the director/ script-writer/ whoever's-responsible clearly advocates this fact. He blatantly guides the movie in the style of a comic; one particularly interesting part is that when the four are blasted by the solar flare (or whatever it is) and the actors partially freeze in mid-motion, while displaying little bits of their powers. Immediately, we are reminded of a comic book. Not only because of the freezing aspect; everything: for example, the way that the characters are then defined clearly: we know who the heroes are and what they can do etc.<br/><br/>Also, straight from the beginning, in the scene where Reed and Ben faces corporate big-timer Victor- even a person who has never heard of the fantastic four will not hesitate in pointing out who the good guys and the villain are. Just like a comic book. The director establishes a distance between the characters; both physically, through distance on set, and through the dialogue. Through Reed and Viktor's conversation for example, the two characters are shown to be old friends but separated due to diverging ambition. Reed, in his proposal to study space phenomena- is clearly one who stretches for knowledge, and Viktor, the corporate giant- who listens and accepts the proposal- is one who absorbs power. There are neither any dark, elusive histories behind the characters nor profound character psychology. Instinctively, we fall in with the one who stretches; the worker; not the greedy businessman. Add that to the manners that the actors assume - Gruffudd maintains an almost diffident manner, while McMahon is all airs - and there is no doubt as to who the hero and villain are. It's all there in black and white - comic-book style. (I mean you can't get any more obvious in portraying character than having Chris Evans enter the scene on a motorcycle).<br/><br/>The movie is also very action-packed. Not exciting in the way War of the Worlds is, or mentally exhausting like in the plot-flaming Batman Begins. No, it's just plain action, and because of that, one can almost watch the movie like it is a comic book. Notice how when you read a comic book, you often skip the boxes with too many words and go directly to the action? In this movie, it's the same. It is clear how the director deliberately reduces the padding upon the movie; there is no explanation for example, as to how the characters manage their trip back to earth after their station was blasted, and how Ben manages to turn back into the thing when there was supposedly not enough power to run the machine. Not much time is even spent upon the romance of Reed and Sue.<br/><br/>And all that action allows the special effects- directing - guy to do a little bit of showing off. I personally thought the special effects were great. I know lame comment - 'great' - but I really don't know what else I can say. How real can you make a stretching guy look? Or a person bursting into flames and still alive and talking it's all relative. But I feel that in this day and age, a movie with anything but the best effects will not make it to the big screen.<br/><br/>The movie, in summary, has been engineered with a strong comic-book accent; simple, black and white, intellectually relaxing, everything cool: it's basically a great movie for chillin'. And to enforce that comic-book accent, there is a simple message associated with the movie: the hero is portrayed as a person as well; the problems that the Fantastic 4 deal with are human; Reed and Sue have their love issues; Ben, his inability to fit in, and John, his attitude. They are human and because of that, we all too can be heroes. How's that for a nice message. Furthermore, it is the people who define who the heroes are; not only the person's abilities; we can see this in the emphasis that is placed upon the way the characters attain their hero-dubs - 'the fantastic four'; 'the thing'; 'Mr. fantastic' and so on  the names are all given BY the people. And hence, Viktor is wrong in his argument that power makes a 'God'. And another point conveyed is moderation. Too much greed makes you a villain; too much thought gives you problems with your love life; too much feeling and you make mistakes (Reed's test of the turn-you-back-to-normal machine).<br/><br/>I think that the movie delivers what it promises. I feel that much is certain. I personally enjoyed it, but that's only because I paid 7 bucks for the movie, and will lie to myself if necessary to make myself think it was great =). No but really, I thought it was a great movie."
"Silver-xo","1","13","24","8 July 2005"," Pretty Bad...
","In my opinion, the movie was pretty bad. All they did was have a pretty actress(who didn't even look the part)dance around on stage with a tight suit on(SPOILER!Who also stood around with only her bra and underwear on) and added some special effects.<br/><br/>Basically, it wasn't all what it was cracked up to be. It might be a hit with the kids who love Superman and batman but for the rest of us, it wasn't all that enjoyable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I suggest you wait until it's released of DVD/VHS/PSP(thing) and not spend the $25 or so dollars on seeing it in theater. But if you must see it in the theater, that popcorn and watered-down pop they got there, better be pretty damn good."
"limbic69","2","22","45","7 July 2005"," Fantastic Four is Forget it Four, very disappointed with effort, Hollywood disappoints yet again, no wonder movie viewing is down 15%
","Here in Melbourne Australia, just finished seeing FFOUR and man was I disappointed. I now realise why they have been spending so much money on advertising as as this movie is truly a disappointment. Managed to watch the whole thing but only because I was boxed in at the 1/3 filled cinema and didn't have anything else to do.<br/><br/>Firstly the movie spent too much time concentrating on the boring no body actors being there boring nobody pre-power characters instead of their considerably more interesting super heroes. Very few big scenes where all the powers where being used 'against the bad guy'. Instead many little and (failed) attempts of humor to demonstrate the various powers in short scenes. Only one or two scenes where all where using their powers to help each other fight the one very lame bad guy.<br/><br/>On that note the 'bad guy' in this movie is shocking, his acting weak and the 'evil factor' borderline a joke. Where is the likes of John Malkovich (in the line of fire) and Gary Oldman (airforce one). Arr them were the good days.<br/><br/>Anyway plot was weak very much building up for Fantastic Four 234 etc This movie was nothing like X-men it didn't carry for the the full 2 hours spending 1 hour and 45 minutes on fluff and only becoming slightly exciting during the other 15 minutes worth of major action scenes. I would be surprised if another came out but knowing Hollywood undoubtedly there will be. I for one will not be seeing it if these guys are still in it.<br/><br/>I say save your money for Christmas as looking at the very poor line up over the next few weeks that will be the next time something will be really worth seeing i.e. KING KONG"
"darklordmurph","6","19","38","8 July 2005"," Matinée at best...
","I went to see it last night. What a severe disappointment. I mean, sure it was funny. In parts, and sure Jessica Alba is hot as a sun.. But here's my problem with it all. First of all, the movie lacked insight for more than maybe 5 minutes at a time. The banter got monotonous and the acting was a bit plastic.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?!?! Come on, anyone that know ANYTHING about the F4 knows that Sue Storm was an older women. Not some hot 20 something. And Sue NEVER went to MIT, she was an aspiring actress. The same goes for Ioan Gruffudd, playing Mr Fantastic. Mr Fantastic was in his late 40s - early 50s not some, once again early 30s cat. They did however get his dorkiness right but not his arrogance.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis as Thing was a perfect casting in my opinion. He showed range and emotion. He carried Thing's burden on his shoulder as if it were his own.<br/><br/>Chris Evans as Johnny Storm was also perfect... he was the ultimate cocky bastard. A real Hothead.<br/><br/>Dr Doom was absolutely NOTHING like he is in the comic book. I repeat NOTHING. He was a complete disappointment. The actor that played him, Julian McMahon, had the perfect attitude to be him though.<br/><br/>The special effects were plentiful but sometimes amateurish. Close-ups of Mr Fantastic stretching almost showed you the pixels in the CGI. The Thing's skin was much more realistic in the finished movie than in the commercials; even close up, it was dope. The Human Torch was great. Invisible girl was a bit amateurish only because they've done nothing new with invisibility.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't enjoy it. The score wasn't even inspiring.<br/><br/>If you never knew anything about the F4, you might like it, but I warn you, please go during a matinée so you don't feel too raped."
"robbyvil","4","19","38","6 July 2005"," Feels like a TV movie
","It's not as bad as Daredevil, but not much better either. This will likely disappoint a good number of fans whose expectations have long been raised by recent very good comic book-based movies like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Normally in a bad movie you can say ""At least the effects were good"", but you can't even say that with this one. It looked and felt relatively low-budget, especially when it came to Mr. Fantastic stretching.<br/><br/>The only positive I can say about this movie is that it's faithful to the comic book characterizations -- but that's not nearly enough to make a good film."
"wtbe7560","7","12","22","24 July 2005"," Better than War of the Worlds!
","I went to Fantastic Four with low expectations. People on here have been complaining about it and the draw is not what was expected at the box office, but I went to a matinée anyway, just to see what all the grousing was about.<br/><br/>The movie was better than expected. Although I dislike Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, the rest of the cast was well put together and acted about as you would expect. Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom was a good call - he seems to delight in being a murderous sociopath. The movie opens with Reed Richards asking Victor Von Doom for money and time on his space station to study a cosmic storm that they believe may have spawned life on Earth. Alba mails in a hey-look-at-my-boobs performance as Von Doom's pseudo love interest and science adviser.<br/><br/>Obviously, they get up to space and get microwaved by the strange radiation that transforms them all. They wake up after a few days in Von Doom's medical building, showing no ill effects. Within a few days their powers begin to manifest. Last to change is Grimm, who spazzes out and attempts to go home to his wife, who of course refuses him. Cast out, he inadvertently creates a huge traffic mess that exposes them all to the media. What follows is your typical comic book movie story.<br/><br/>The plot is not exactly difficult to follow, but that's OK. If you came to this movie expecting an Oscar-winning masterpiece, then you're gonna be disappointed. If you're looking for a fun way to kill a couple hours, then this movie will keep you entertained."

","This is the first time in a long time that I've seen a movie that I didn't want to end. The action was awesome, and the special effects were amazing! The bridge scene was exciting. With the huge bumper to bumper crash, it was great that no one got hurt! The comic relief provided by Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm was funny and I found myself laughing out loud. Julian McMahon makes a very cool Dr. Doom. He has such a style about him; very sexy and sophisticated. I will definitely buy this one when it comes out on DVD. I want to watch it over and over again. Watching this movie made me feel like a kid again... The Fantastic Four were my all time favorite comic book heroes (along with Wonder Woman.)"

"albsantos","2","21","43","7 July 2005"," ""Fantastic Four"" forgot the ""Fantastic""
","Let's get one thing straight. No matter how much the source material tells of a story about characters surviving with superpowers in the wide open public, society (especially the police) hate vigilante antes. If it was up to them, they'd let these show stoppers of the crime fighting type to go around a few times, solely to figure out what it is that makes them tick. They'd then capture them (already knowing their weaknesses, of course), get a bunch of scientists to study them, then finally charge them with whatever damages they've caused, regardless of what good they did.<br/><br/>It's this aspect of post-modern society that has been incorporated to most superhero films of late. Most superheroes must quickly leave after there job is done to ensure the feds don't come knocking (Spiderman, X-men), most are concealed too well in the darkness to ever be known as nothing more than a myth (Batman), others start off with the problems mentioned in paragraph one to begin with (The Incredibles), and others work their way up to be recognized as something of good (Batman, Superman).<br/><br/>It's this factor that is completely thrown out the window in ""Fantastic Four."" Here we have a bunch of researchers-cum-superheroes wanting to save the world, keep the world happy, show themselves off, and resolve personal problems all at the same time. In short, it's attempting to conquer what every other superhero film has in less than two hours.<br/><br/>The comic book could do this mix into perfection, making it the longest running of all Marvel creations. But the movie, headed by rather incapable director Tim ""Babershop"" Story, misses every aspect of the comic that inspired Stan Lee to keep on truckin' at Marvel.<br/><br/>The acting is reduced to nothing. At first, you'd think it's the fault of the actors, regarding the already bland performances given by Ioan Gruffand and Jessica Alba. Yet, when we begin to see Chris Evans and Julian McMahon trying hard to bring something in other than dry humor and clichéd action phrases, you see that the problem lies with the screenwriter, Micheal France.You can bet that instead of actually writing something, he took references from his past work on films such as ""Goldeneye"" and ""Hulk,"" as well as from all the past Marvel movies.<br/><br/>The special effects are great and all, but it's all been done before. Every great achievement ""Fantastic Four"" has in CGI technology can be derived from Spiderman, Lord of the Rings, or any Disney/Pixar Film. What is worse is that in the middle of three complete CGI characters, The Thing is supposed to pass off as a piece of walking desert in a suit that less believable than most at Comic-Con. Take the only good page from ""Batman and Robin,"" and do a mix of CGI and a prosthetic suit for your bulky characters.<br/><br/>Purists will probably be fuming from the head by now, yet there's bad new for you as well; comic to movie continuity is non-existent. As explained before, the original story that brought out a great family with fantastic powers (no pun intended), is made into another episode of the ""Power Rangers."" One big difference is Dr. Doom, now funding the four's project, is going out with Sue Storm, and instead of going ugly after a while with his powers, stays the same way (obviously for some more beauty shots of McMahon) and wears a metal mask for no reason.<br/><br/>I had the same feeling watching this film as I did watching ""Rocky III."" That is, the feeling of being only being slightly entertained, and noticing a formula wearing thin. The only upside is that it's a much lighter superhero flick than what has been offered in recent times. In theory, this should have been the film to take your kids to if you didn't want them to see the darkness of ""Batman Begins."" Yet, if you are wanting to see less violence after a rather large amount of ""dark"" summer blockbusters, rent ""Superman"" or Tim Burton's ""Batman."""
"KaosBlender","1","18","36","8 July 2005"," Fantastic FAILURE
","Being a comic book fan, I truly wanted to give this movie a chance to be good. It failed...in several ways. The casting was bad, as only Chris Evans (Human Torch) and Michael Chiklis (The Thing) actually seemed the least bit believable as their characters. The poor acting, I tried hard to blame on the actors not knowing the characters well. But by the middle of the movie, it was obvious that the screenwriter was completely to blame. I saw this movie less than an hour ago, I can not for the life of me think of ONE good line of dialogue, ONE memorable scene, aside from Ben Grimm's famous ""It's Clobberin' Time!"" catch phrase. The writing is not just bad, it's VERY bad. So bad, that they even had to resort to using foul language just for shock value. I'm not saying ""Oh, mercy, they cussed, that's bad."" What I'm saying is the foul language used seemed to have just been thrown in, with no real thought on WHY the character would say such a word in that scene, yet use far more tame language in a scene you would think DESERVED foul language. The flow of the movie is lobsided, and has the most uneven flow of humor and drama I can recall ever seeing in a movie. Johnny/The Human Torch is about the only realistic character in this whole film. He behaves pretty much as one would expect an egotistical dude who now has superpowers would behave. Yet they even screw THAT up by making him suddenly mature and a team player, OUT OF THE BLUE. If they had put in just ONE 20-30 scene showing the ramifications of his behavior, that would have at least been SOMETHING for me to accept as the reason for his sudden behavior change. But, they didn't, so now they give me NOTHING I can compliment. <br/><br/>It makes attempts to portray what life would be like for these heroes, if they really existed. Which is fine. But it's like they touch on it briefly, and apparently the problem never seems to arise again! Like how the public might react if they saw one of them in regular clothes out in public. There's ONE 30 second scene of such an incident, then it seems like the public never even notices who they are in street clothes again!<br/><br/>But by far, the biggest complaint that I have, is the ENTIRE character of Victor Von Doom. Not one single aspect of that character in this movie was believable. And it's not Julian McMahon's fault one bit. He did a great job of trying to turn crap into gold in his performance. The writing, again, failed him, as it failed the entire movie.<br/><br/>For the love of sanity, and your hard earned money, see another movie instead of this one. You'll thank me, trust me."
"ebiros2","1","15","29","4 October 2005"," Awful
","I don't give such bad reviews often. After all it's only a movie and why should one take it so seriously ? But sometimes it might send a message to people who trounce on something good and make it bad.<br/><br/>If the movie was an original plot created by the producers, the director, and the screenwriter, then they can do anything they want with it. But when you take a material someone else have worked hard to make good and establish it's worth over the years, it's like walking into an established culture, and you need to take respect for the work that's already been laid down. Suppose you walked into another culture and just superficially swiped the exterior and presented it through your opinion, have you desecrated the value of that culture ? Most likely.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is the hub of Marvel Comics. Without it, it's questionable if other Marvel comics would have had the success that they've had. It had the quality that defined Marvel. As a matter of fact, Spiderman had his debut supported by the Fantastic Four in Spiderman #1, and from there Daredevil, X Men and other silver age Marvel superheros flourished. Fantstic Four's plot, the universe, the characters were always setting the trend to be mined by other Marvel superheros later.<br/><br/>In this movie, there was no respect payed to the original plot of the Fantastic Four or the characters which made the story work. Compared to works done by Bryan Singer in the X Men series where the story line was original but didn't conflict with the original ways characters were presented in the comic book, and plot and subplots were laid out carefully to maximize their characters, this movie just took a broad brush and painted over everything. Casting wasn't good and the actors didn't reflect the qualities of the characters of the Fantastic Four. When they made Doom an industrialist, they made the same mistake of making Talbot an industrialist in the Hulk. Then the only angle becomes about money and power. Doom is an interesting character. He's from a country that's a kin to Transilvania and his mother is a sorcerer, they could have presented him as he is and the story would have been interesting. Instead they just turned him into an one dimensional angry character.<br/><br/>This was a movie that could have been better than the Spiderman. Instead they've turned it into an amusement park ride.<br/><br/>1/10"
"mattmr","3","2","2","16 January 2007"," Awful for those with an interest in the comics.
","Marvel spent 30 years developing these characters, but the movie makers clearly felt no sense of responsibility to that history. The recent X-Men, Spiderman, Batman and Superman films demonstrate what can be achieved in this genre. Unfortunately, The Fantastic Four reminds me most closely of the Captain America TV movie of the early 1980's. It shares that film's shoddy production standards (despite an evident mega-budget) and complete lack of respect for the characters. The script, dialogue and acting are all weak. Setting aside my prejudice as a fan of the comic books, three stars due to the cheesy entertainment offered to non-fans."

","I just saw Fantastic Four (January 2nd, 2007), and actually I did it 'cause of the trailer from Rise of the Silver Surfer. I was waiting for the film to open in 2005 at cinemas, but when EVERYONE I know told me that the movie sucked, I just had to resign the hope that I had to see another incredible comic adaptation, the hope to see the Fantastic Four in action.<br/><br/>I don't think I can recall a movie where the director had so little (not to say ANY) knowledge of the script that he was about to work on. The key scenes lacked from ANY interest, the characters are poorly developed. I'd like to take a little while in this subject, 'cause many of my friends told me that was a really bad casting, but I have to say... Its not the best casting, but could've been worked out correctly. Sadly for us, the TRUE BELIEVERS, this movie is not the case.<br/><br/>It lacked the thing that I will always be looking' on a comic book adaptation (Besides to be a flashy display of effects with a killer photography i.e. Hulk, Superman Returns, Batman Begins), and that is for EVERY character, it doesn't matter to be villain or hero, to be HUMAN! as Eric Bana on Hulk, as Peter (Mostly on Spider-Man 2, not so much on the first one) and lately perfectly molded by Bryan Singer, a Clark Kent who is an Alien more human than any character on any comic book adaptation I've ever saw. I really hope that Mr. Story has taken a few classes about comic book appreciation (and film making wouldn't hurt him either) and don't become another Brett Ratner killing for good a series that STILL can be saved... Mr. Story, you had ruined this first movie and still got a second chance, don't blew it the next time...<br/><br/>To every future director from a comic book adaptation, please: Take your time, read the characters, fell in love with'em and then ONLY then, sign your contract... Don't do it for money... do it for us... the True Believers!<br/><br/>Just for the record, you've offended me higher than Brett Ratner and that AWFUL X3 that actually was like another Triple-X movie, instead of Vin Diesel we had Vinnie Jones."

Normally I would understand different opinions, but this piece of crap can and will not satisfy anyone who is over 10 years of age and whose brain functions even a little.<br/><br/>The plot. I wouldn't care about the plot in this kind of movie so much, but it just stinks. The characters? Well, they suck. Every one of them, the writing and the acting is not B-class, it's F-class. You don't believe the characters. That would be OK, cause this film isn't a serious one, but when the characters make you want to shoot the guys who did this piece of crap, that's another thing.<br/><br/>The comics were OK, I used to like them when I was a kid. Now I like them even more, because the fantasy value of the original stories just skyrocketed after seeing this turd. I could list all the illogical holes in the movie, but I got no time for it. There are so many absolutely stupid things and scenes, that it seems impossible. It's just....I can't believe they made this. I didn't expect anything, and still I was angry.<br/><br/>The fire effect seemed cool at first. And the thing threw a car.

If you're watching this during a bad movie - weekend with friends, it will make you laugh.<br/><br/>Then again, this movie deserves not even laughter. Just hate. I hate this. Glad X-men and Spiderman did the job right. This one surely didn't.<br/><br/>Granted, this rant is more about my disappointment and childish anger than about the movie itself. If I could be totally neutral, I'd probably give this a couple more points."
"Carycomic","8","11","20","8 July 2005"," How much did I like this? Let me count the ways!
","1) The updating of how they get their super-powers. In the comics, it was a side-effect of the Cold War's ""race into space."" But, the Cold War ended fifteen years ago! So, instead, the audience witnesses the fateful cosmic storm hitting a corporate version of the International Space Station. 2) The updating of Sue Storm's personality. Instead of being Reed Richard's blindly loyal piece of arm candy (as she seemed to be in the 1960's), she is a modern woman who has just as many smarts as him. But, far more capable of showing her emotions, when the situation calls for more than intellect. 3) The faithful rendering of Johnny and Ben's clashing personalities. The former is almost incessantly insensitive and ""show-offy,"" especially after becoming the Human Torch. And, the latter's heartbreak at being rejected by his fiancé'--while everyone else is applauding him for saving that firetruck--was so convincing, everyone in the audience who saw this with me gave a collective ""Awww!"" *If Michael Chiklis isn't one of the nominees for Best Supporting Actor, at next year's Oscars, I'm changing channels.* 4) Last, but not least? Julian McMahon outdoes the great job he did as ""Cole"" on CHARMED. Where that character could arouse sympathy in 49% of the show's viewership, as Victor Von Doom, he arouses _none_! You love to hate him, and don't feel guilty about doing so. I think this is partially due to portraying him as a ruthless techno-businessman. Something that was done, quite successfully, to the post-1985 Lex Luthor at Marvel Comics' Distinguished Competition. *A direct lift-cum-homage, perhaps?* My only complaint is the way Dr. Doom was given his armored look. Instead of it being a robotic exo-skeleton, it's depicted as more of a mutation. One that makes him resemble a sort of Colossus/Magneto hybrid! So, that's why I only award this movie eight-out-of-ten points. It's not perfect. But, it's definitely FAN-DIRTY-WORD-TASTIC!"

"CIMC","1","19","39","10 July 2005"," For the love of basketball see something else!
","Basic necessities in adapting any story like the F4 to the screen would be writers, directors, actors, an effects team and a healthy budget. With a cost hovering around $100 million dollars, Fantastic Four has only the budget of a successful adaptation. Enron stock would have been a better investment. With no sense of pacing, lame attempts at humor, bad effects, poor dialog, hackwork photography and some truly terrible acting F4 is a strong candidate for worst film of the year in any year, except perhaps 2000, the year of Battlefield Earth. <br/><br/>What's wrong with this film could be related in real time by simply describing what is on the screen at any given moment. The single moment of joy in the entire ordeal was a cameo by Stan Lee. His face time was not anything spectacular but it reminded me, however briefly, of other Marvel adaptations that I 'd seen, each superior to this one. But soon it was back to Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic. His performance alone would be enough to pan the film. It's so terrible it should be called something other than acting. Frankly given how terrible all the cast (except the extras, all of whom do competent extra work) do at ""acting"" it's surprising he can stick out. <br/><br/>123 minutes of a shiny thing without a soul would be the most appropriate title for this debacle. After last year's Taxi, perhaps it was unreasonable to expect Tim Story to put a remotely competent film on screen. True to that there is no craft here, not even a polished sheen to gloss over the omnipresent flaws. Any film with a Human Torch or a fellow made out of rocks requires the suspension of disbelief, Fantastic Four requires the suspension of taste."

","Being somewhat of a Jessica Alba fan from her 'Dark Angel' days, I was willing to see what sounded like a pretty lame comic book adaptation. However, my original suspicions proved to be correct, as this movie was possibly the lamest, stupid, plot-hole ridden crap fest that has ever been forced upon unsuspecting audiences by money-hungry soul-less Hollywood studios.<br/><br/>After the formal recognition of both 'Daredevil' and 'Catwoman' as incredibly crap movies, you would think that the corporations would finally get the idea and start introducing QUALITY to their movies rather than continuing with this kind of C-class vomit provocation.<br/><br/>What little story that was offered between the endless low-quality special effects was both boring and unbelievable (although I realise reality wasn't exactly the objective here). The acting was generic, wooden, special mention given to Chris Evans or 'Johnny Storm', for his incredibly bad acting. You have to give him credit for making the others all seem like potential Oscar winners as he stumbled his way through this 'film'.<br/><br/>No doubt, as it will make a profit from bored teenage boys and 40 year old virgins still living with their moms, a sequel will be released.

"Dwight_McArthy","9","9","16","8 July 2005"," One word can describe this movie: Fantastic.
","Where to start...<br/><br/>I guess I'll start by saying that Fantastic Four is a fun, enjoyable movie. By no means is it a masterpiece film, but I love it, though being a big fan of the comics, and looking forward to the film for a while may influence that).<br/><br/>STORY The story in the Fantastic Four is nearly the same as in the comics, with the addition of Doom on the space-ship, and his reactions to the cosmic storm hitting the ship. The story is obviously not realistic, which isn't the point of the movie, because having someone turn into a rock or go invisible isn't realistic. For a comic book movie, I really like the story. It's not really cheesy or corny, but but kind of campy, which is the Fantastic Four I know and love. 8/10<br/><br/>CASTING In my opinion, the casting is nearly perfect. No cast will ever be perfect, because everyone has their opinions, but I feel this cast was excellent. Some I wouldn't have chosen, but they played their part like they were supposed to. 10/10 <br/><br/>ACTING The acting was not superb, but it was good. Evans and Chiklis do the best jobs in the movie in my opinion. I also think Gruffudd and Alba did good jobs as well, not to mention McMahon's Doom, who was pretty solid as well. 8/10 SFX These effects were believable, stunning, just fantastic. 10/10 for the effects.<br/><br/>EVERYTHING ELSE There were only a few things I didn't like about the movie, which was some of the dialogue. (What happens when you super-heat rubber?) Outside of that, I found the movie enjoyable, fun, and very true to the comics, outside of Doom, who surprisingly was superior in the film. I like all the little references and similarities to things in the comics.<br/><br/>OVERALL I give this movie a solid 9/10. My 2nd favorite movie of 2005, behind Batman Begins, and just ahead of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the critics, go see the movie for yourself. You'll hate it or love it, but you should still have a fun time. I recommend this movie to people all of ages, as I think all ages will enjoy it if you're not expecting a masterpiece. Oh, and before I forget, I'm not a studio plant, as many people on the boards suggest."

","What a fantastic mess of a film. I was holding out hope for a well crafted story, but unless you're blinded by die-hard comic fanaticism, or you're under the age of six, prepare to be under whelmed. Not since Looney Tunes Back in Action have I seen a more horrible Hollywood hokey flick. The set ups are trite, predictable, and laughably sophomoric. The material given to the actors, and the direction (apparently by committee) given reminded me of junior high acting class 101 day two. This franchise has been successfully ruined for the next ten years. The storytelling structure of this film was either absent from the get go, or has ended up in a trash heap collected from the cutting room floor. Dr. Reed's character arc is more limp than is body. The following are just a few of the holes I noticed in the film.<br/><br/>1. No tension and little setup for Richard Reed's business failures, and why VonDoom is his only hope.<br/><br/>2. No romantic setup or lead into Doom's proposal to Sue and the subsequent romantic triangle conflict between Doom, Sue, and Reed.<br/><br/>3. Since when does NYC have a mountain suitable for snowboarding a mere fifteen minutes away from a convenient hospital placed in Doom's high rise? <br/><br/>4. How does Doom find the Thing in the diner? And why do they seem to stay there for hours and hours, giving us time to cut back to Reed's headquarters, then cut to the shore overlooking the Statue of Liberty, then cutting back to the diner, just as the Things food order of pancakes arrives? Yes I realize he had just eaten a previous course of something, but three or four hours worth??? <br/><br/>5. I'm pleased the ""marking department"" which the human torch refers to has had time to create a ""Thing"" prototype doll, but whose marketing department? Reed's corp. or Doom's corp. has a TOY MARKETING DEPARTMENT? <br/><br/>Please, if anyone ever attempts to pull this franchise out of the fire, the way that Warner's successfully did with Batman Begins, spend more time chiseling out a well crafted script, and stick to it. Its great to have many counselors when making a movie, but if each one of them is wearing a T-shirt that reads ""What I really want to do is direct"" then your project is probably VonDoomed!"

","For starters I must say, I had a lot of expectation concerning the Fantastic Four movie. I am a huge fan of super heroes and I was looking forward to seeing this foursome kick ass.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the opening shots were pretty good. Considering we're dealing with a very complicated plot concerning space shuttles and electromagnetic storms, the opening sequences were surprisingly well handled.<br/><br/>OK, the good ends right there. Bad stuff coming in.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are completely shallow. I was really looking forward to seeing Dr. Doom in action, but I was very disappointed with the character's dialogues and handling. The script makes him look like a rich maniac (and that's good), but when he comes back from space, all altered, that's when it goes down.<br/><br/>Von Doom goes from being a very concerned and jealous man to a murdering maniac in a few moments (and, for the record, he's not a great murdering maniac, in fact he sucks at it).<br/><br/>The Fantastic 4: -The Thing: On the comic book, this is a funny and cool character. They tried to make it the same in the movie, but they didn't succeed. The material from which the suit is built is completely fake. It's supposed to be stone and it looks as if it is rubber or something.<br/><br/>-The Invisible Girl: Jessica Alba looks pretty hot in this movie and her acting wasn't that bad. She was among the very few good things you could say about this movie.<br/><br/>-The Human Torch: This is a cool character and it was pretty well written and the situations in which he was involved were pretty good. But when he starts to burn, that sucks, it's really fake. And the scriptwriters made him pretty secondary and made the main characters Mr Fantastic and The Thing.<br/><br/>-Mr. Fantastic: SUCKS. The acting was lousy, that guy is too young to play that character, the special effects that tried to make him stretch were at times worse than the movie itself, and his dialogues were never good.<br/><br/>All in all, I think audiences will be disappointed with this movie because it lacks everything that made other comic book adaptations (Spider-Man, Batman Begins, X-Men) good."
"Squeele","2","6","10","14 June 2007"," Boring and stupid.
","Fantastic Four is probably the worst comic book movie to date. This sub-genre contains a lot of great films (Superman, Burton's and Nolan's Batman, Hellboy...) but this one is a true disgrace, and really gives comic books a bad name. The basic story could be turned into a great sci-fi movie for kids and adults. Think of high-concept movies like Back To The Future, or Lost in Space: whether you like them or not they're great family films, with both great effects, a good cast, and some science fiction themes tailored for the whole family. Fantastic Four got nothing: the cast is mediocre (except maybe Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis), the direction is atrocious, the script is stupid and the practical SFX worthy of a B-grade movie (the Thing costume is truly laughable, which is quite annoying since the character carries most of the dramatic moments...)<br/><br/>If you really want to feed your kids with the dumbest mass-produced Hollywood trash, give it a try. But don't expect your kids to develop good tastes after that. <br/><br/>BUT if you don't wanna dumb down your children with the worst kind of entertainment you could possibly find, AVOID AT ALL COSTS. <br/><br/>My advice: rent Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" instead. It's smarter, faster and funnier."

I loved the story line and how they made it happy, sad, full of love and funny.<br/><br/>The story is about five people, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm and Victor Von Doom, who are accidentally hit by a cosmic storm while in space. The cosmic storm changes their entire biophysical structure which gives them super powers and makes them into Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Thing and The Human Torch, these four people make up the Fantastic Four who battle Victor Von Doom, who uses his powers for greater evil.<br/><br/>Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic hooks you in with his smarts and charming and loving attitude. He rarely thinks about himself and always puts his friends first. Ben Grimm/ The Thing goes through a very hard time when he gains his powers. He becomes a hideous monster and many people forgot about the sweet Ben Grimm inside and judged him for his looks. Self-doubting or rejected females can relate to Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, she feels like she is only seen for her beauty and not for who she is inside. Sometimes she does feel invisible, but all she wants to feel is loved and to be treated with respect. And Johnny Storm/The Human Torch immediately falls in love with his powers, and you will immediately fall in love with his good looks and his humorous personality, I know I did. Johnny embraces his powers and shows the team that the powers were given to them for a reason.<br/><br/>So when it comes time to battle Dr.Doom Sue, Reed and Ben listen to Johnny's advice and work together as one to defeat their enemy, accepting that they are now... The Fantastic Four, they are now heroes! But in the end Dr.Doom still seems to be alive leaving the movie open forFantastic Four 2 and 3.<br/><br/>This wonderful family movie is filled with love, heartbreak, pain and lots of laughs. I suggest everyone go see this movie, and as they say...""Prepare for the fantastic!"""

","On of the first super hero teams to exist, the Fantastic Four had reached stardom throughout the years, so naturally a movie adaptation is inevitable.

So let's flame on and take a look at this, dare I say it, ""fantastic"" film.<br/><br/>We all know the plot: Four scientists get exposed to cosmic radiation and wind up getting super powers, thus becoming Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing. While trying to get use to their newfound powers and fame, they must content with the tyrannical Doctor Doom, who wants to destroy them all one by one. It's clobberin' time! <br/><br/>This movie is pretty darn good. It has good action, good character development, good science (for all the nerds out there), and a decent story. All the characters are portrayed accurately and it's pretty funny sometimes when they interact with each other while other times their emotions are conveyed quite well. Doctor Doom is a great villain, absolutely powerful and deceitful, a deadly combination. The big fight in the end is worth the wait.<br/><br/>I only wish that they add more action in this movie, like have the Thing beat down a few criminals, but what can I do? Overall, nicely done.

"radiodome13","1","5","8","14 August 2006"," Ah, the Fantastic Four
","I was told that this movie (if you can even call it that) is a ""good kids flick"" at best. I am a big fan of comic book films, and even if they are terrible (i.e. Daredevil, the second and third sequels of Superman and Batman), I still find some fun in their camp or reverence to comic book themes. I did not find any of these while watching the ""Fantastic Four"". Tim Story, a funny little man who impressed me with ""Barbershop"" and depressed me with the oh so not funny remake ""Taxi"" seemed to continue his downward spiral in this lost little adaptation of our beloved foursome. I couldn't help but notice the continuity errors, the mixed up science facts, the blue screen still left in shots, the terribly written dialogue which sometimes didn't make sense; it made me think, Tim Story and his puppet strings so tightly bound to the suits running this little operation , care more about the product placement in the film more than the movie itself. Now granted, every film has it's flaws, but directors with talented editors usually make this part of the fun of seeing the film, like when the color leaks outside of the frame on a comic book. But this wasn't fun; this wasn't even dealt with. Tim Story got his check, as did the rest of the half talented cast and laughed all the way to the sequel which they now have decided to destroy the myths of Silver Surfer along with the Fantastic Four. Tim Story, congratulations. You just don't care about your work, you don't care about the movies you make, and you're basically doing what every dumb American kid raised on bad Saturday morning cartoons, pop rocks and Jolt cola would do if they never grew up. Good luck ruining Silver Surfer for everyone who ever liked him. And after this franchise ends and no one shows up to see Barbershop 3; take a little advice....GROW THE HELL UP AND DIRECT A MOVIE LIKE A BIG BOY!!!"
"icDEADppl","9","5","8","8 August 2005"," It never stops!
","From the get-go, Fantastic Four never lets up on the gas. Whether you're laughing at The Human Torch's antics and punchlines, or zooming along through the sky, or floating in space, this movie never gives you a chance to breathe. It's funny and suspenseful and packed with loads of action, as is to be expected from the Marvel franchise. Jessica Alba was beautiful as always and shows she can provide a serious intelligent character, while still maintaining her stunning looks. Chris Evans is very funny and great as the cocky fly-boy/wise-cracking Human Torch. He's a hoot to watch and he gives the movie a lot of comic relief. Michael Chiklis as always is lovable and full of wit. There seems to be no difference between him and his computer-generated alter-ego; other than appearance alone. Chiklis the human seems to be just waiting to become The Thing. Ion Gruffud was good as the serious and consumed with his work scientist Reed Richards. You wonder if he'll ever do what he wants or just suffer from lost love, Susan. He fits the part perfectly.<br/><br/>Hold to your sit and sit back, because you're in for a real ride. It's fun and funny, not to mention that it has real heart to it's story. I never really got into the Fantastic Four comics (like I did with the others, Spiderman and Xmen). But thanks to this movie, I like this group almost as much; if not just as much. Great funny, fun film!"
"wuffxiii","9","5","8","7 August 2005"," A modern fairy-tale.
","This may contain spoilers, read at your own risk! The people today don't want a light-hearted storyline where everyone comes out alive and a winner, they don't want to see the proverbial ""Black Knight"" thwarted by a bunch of do-gooders with noble intent and good hearts. Well, too bad. Bugger them because that's exactly what I want to see! I feel that this movie was misunderstood by the majority simply because it was based upon the Golden Era of comics and one has to be a real comics aficionado. These tales one remembers from days when comics were but pittance in cost and when Ben Grimm could wear a tri-corner hat and pass himself off convincingly in the middle-ages by ordering milk in a dirty glass. It's not supposed to be gritty.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>I feel that sentence deserved a pargraph all of its own because fun is ten parts self-discovery and very little else. When people are having fun they're basically growing as individuals and discovering the World around them and that's what this is a tale of. It's a bunch of people (admittedly with super-powers) finding their place in the World. It's a more candy-coated World than most that could accept them but again, that's why it's so fairy-tale. They're just out there and most of the time, they're having a blast and when they're not doing that, they're trying to overcome adversity - together.<br/><br/>And when they win, well who cares what they surpassed? What the hell? It was an adventure! That's why I like this movie. There're a lot of special effects, there isn't too much action (which I'm glad about) but that's counterbalanced with the characters really being themselves and building on what they are. The story had to be changed to be believable for the silver screen as they couldn't exactly fit the rich background of the deliciously evil Dr. Victor von Doom within the confines thereof. Aside from that however, everything else seems to have fallen into place. Johnny is quite satisfyingly cocky and unlike the not-so-daring X-Men movies where Wolverine barely gets off a ""bub"" and the Spider-Man movies where even my next-door neighbour could outwit the poor misanthropic, poorly realized duplicate ... the Fantastic Four are what they are.<br/><br/>Susan is quite vulnerable and this leads her to social insecurity and co-dependency that she's displayed frequently in the comics. Ben Grimm feels uncomfortable with what he is but there's always a guiding light and thankfully, he isn't quite as emo as the later comics depicted him to be. In fact I'd say his emotional responses are dead on. Stretch is portrayed wonderfully, I'd say the actor is a bit young but he did a damned good job in showing the dedication of Mr. Fantastic, how he's always level headed and logical and they've even managed to work in the usual lines. Ben get's a satisfying ""It's clobberin' time!"", accompanied by Doom flying across the space of a penthouse room and the film ends with Johnny's ""Flame on!"".<br/><br/>In other words, it's not afraid to be like the Golden Era and I respect that. A lot of people won't understand that but I can see that someone in the production cycle was a fan of the early era of Fantastic Four comics. Those who just don't get it probably never will, either that or they might just pick up a stack of Golden Era comics somewhere (or on the internet) and then ... then they just might get it.<br/><br/>It's a modern fairytale. A lot of people don't like fairy tales. Heck, even you, dear reader, might not. Frankly, I don't care. I do and I had a blast! What a great film."

","See the problem is that in the past year to year and a half we have seen for the most part dark movies. War of the Worlds, Batman Begins, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to name a few recent ones. I found Fantastic Four to have a couple of cheesy parts but i loved the characters and the lightness of the movie. I was sick of seeing a lot of dark dreary movies, i wanted to see something more light hearted action and that is exactly what I received. The Fantastic Four characters all worked very well with each other as well. It was a good cast and The Human Torch helped make the movie even better. So I give Fantastic Four a 9 because yes it did have some kinks but all in all it was an excellent light hearted action/comedy that the whole family can watch without worrying about a big sex scene or a ton of cussing. But it wasn't child like so that only kids would enjoy, teenagers and adults alike would love this film. Just good old comic book superheroes saving the day."

It is rare for me to see a film more than once on release, in fact I can't remember when I last did, but I am going to see this one again.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was great for Jack Kirby's name to be up on the big screen, shame he is not around to see it."

","Reading the previous reviews, I wonder who the hell can actually be giving this film the maximum rating. It's clearly people from the company. 'Fantastic Four' is just a terrible film.<br/><br/>As a kid, I didn't read the 'Fantastic Four' comics, but was aware of the origins/backdrop for the group. Unfortunately, the film your average Hollywood crap. I wanted the characters to die a horrible death to get them off the screen. The special effects were average, the action scenes were outright boring, uninspiring, rehashed scenes. The average special effects could not make up for these scenes.<br/><br/>Like the title says, skip this movie at all costs, especially if it's a $10 ticket. If you haven't seen them already, go watch 'Batman Begins' or 'War of the Worlds' instead. 'Fantastic Four' is a complete waste of time and money.

"zardoz-13","9","3","4","20 June 2007"," Fantastic Fun!
","Watching the new Marvel Comics movie ""The Fantastic Four"" (***1/2 out of ****) was a lot of fun. Don't expect anything as high-brow as either of the ""X-Men"" or the ""Spider-man"" epics. Meantime, this classic Marvel superheroes saga surpasses both the lackluster ""Electra"" and the horrible ""Hulk."" Principally, ""The Fantastic Four"" suffers from showing up too late to exploit its groundbreaking elements, since most of this family-friendly fare recycles material that ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-man"" have already converted into clichés. Ironically, ""The Fantastic Four"" comic debuted in 1961, long before either ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-man"" appeared. Indeed, ""The Fantastic Four"" paved the way for ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-man,"" but the formative franchise is paying the price for reaching the screen later than its spin-offs. Unlike early Marvel Comics movies, ""The Fantastic Four"" resorts to refreshing comic relief bordering on slapstick. The heroes spend a fair share of their time goofing off. Check out how Reed Richards wraps himself like a rubber band around an enraged Ben Grimm. Moreover, unlike most Marvel comic superheroes, this quartet doesn't shrink from attention and has no need to shield their identity. This sets ""The Fantastic Four"" apart from the usual summer superhero saga, because the narrative exposure that they receive from cosmic rays cannot compare with the exposure that the media accords them. Consequently, if you're ""The Fantastic Four"" bound because you believe it clones ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-man,"" prepare to be let down! ""The Fantastic Four"" unfolds with down-on-his-luck whiz kid scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd of ""King Arthur"") and his best bud, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis of TV's ""The Shield""), appealing to their old collegiate chum, billionaire industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of TV's ""Nip/Tuck""), to fund their weird science project. Reed needs Victor's space station to analyze the consequences of cosmic rays on living matter. Victor rubs Reed's nose in Reed's own highly publicized bankruptcy case. Reedit seemsis flat broke. Later, Victor stuns Reed when he reveals that he knows why NASA gave Reed the boot over the project. Nevertheless, the greedy tycoon provides the funding for Reed's experiment. Not surprisingly, everything goes wrong once they are in space. All Reed's calculations are wholly off, and the cosmic rays arrive early and irradiate everybody on board Victor's space station. Not until later do they learn that exposure to those cosmic rays has a lasting effect on their DNA. The next thing we know the story is back on Earth with our heroes under medical observation. Johnny discovers that he can conjure up fire from his finger tips. Sue learns that she can turn invisible and lay down a force field. Reed's flexibility enables him to run his hand and arm under a locked door and unlock the door from the other side! By far the worst effected is Ben Grimm. He changes into a giant, orange-colored, stone-textured, Michelin man type brute that Johnny ridicules as 'the Thing.' Not to be left out, Victor acquires a metallic complexion and can wield electricity like a deadly weapon. Instead of joining ranks with his partners, Victor dons a Darth Vader-like helmet, christens himself Dr. Doom, and vows to destroy the Fantastic Four! Splendidly cast with some fresh faces, director Tim Story's ""The Fantastic Four"" doesn't alter the formula for superhero franchises. Conspicuously free of social issues, this superficial but entertaining summer romp refuses to furrow your brows, but it tops the unreleased Roger Corman version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's quarrelsome quartet. Corman produced his charming but cheapjack feature back in 1994 for a mere one million dollars, while 20th Century Fox has hurled a hundred million dollars into their CGI-enhanced, big-screen adaptation. The titular four are predictably charismatic, and the villain qualifies as evil incarnate. ""The Fantastic Four"" combines larger-than-life, fantasy-oriented violence with sure-fire, character-driven, fish-out-of-water comedy. Indeed, these mutated heroes differ from the ""X-Men,"" because their deformities are what fuel their popularity. Although some special effects--especially Reed's elastic armslook rather cheesy, and the plot doesn't pass the two-hour mark, ""The Fantastic Four"" delivers enough action and comedy to distract you during its brisk 105 minutes without wearing out its welcome.<br/><br/>""Barbershop"" director Tim Story and scenarists Michael (""GoldenEye"" & ""The Punisher"") France and Mark (""Twin Peaks"") Frost have confined the action to the character origins. Indeed, Story, France, and Frost have their hands full dealing not only with the heroic quartet but also with the dastardly Dr. Doom. Happily, nobody gets the short-shrift, and each character evolves in greater detail despite the lightweight treatment. Again, the difference between ""The Fantastic Four"" and other Marvel superheroes is that these guys are media celebrities with no need to conceal their identities. Typically, opening franchise films present the genesis of the protagonists then pit them in a life-or-death battle against their arch adversary. ""The Fantastic Four"" chronicles how the cosmic rays afflict each character, and then shows how each individual handles this hardship. While the villainous Dr. Doom challenges our heroes, the climactic showdown in ""The Fantastic Four"" serves more to demonstrate the moral gulf between the Four and their foe, without wasting another half-hour setting up a threat to mankind that our heroes must thwart. The biggest complaint about ""The Fantastic Four"" is that it's trite and resembles a TV show pilot episode. If such charges are accurate, then this is a super duper pilot, bigger than any that I've ever seen. However, not all superhero movies must resort to the standard threat-to-mankind plot. Essentially, what Story, France, and Frost fare best at is finding a balance between the tragic elements, such as Ben Grimm's massive metamorphosis, and the comedic antics of Johnny Storm pyromaniacal shenanigans, while incorporating the romantic byplay between Sue and Reed Richards. Finally, unlike the larger world threat superhero movies, ""The Fantastic Four"" qualifies as a more personal superhero movie. Although it isn't as memorable as either ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-man,"" ""The Fantastic Four"" with its built-in sequel ending is still pretty exhilarating stuff."
"ramificating","8","3","4","9 June 2007"," Extended Edition changed my opinion
","Originally when I saw the theatrical version of the film, I found it very cheesy, to rushed and unconvincing based off the dialog and the story telling. The editing was very poor and at times I felt bored and felt it wasn't even making sense. However keeping this short, I got myself a copy of the extended edition and found the changes incredibly remarkable, notably the fact they actually add a lengthy amount to the film, and that I believe makes the film now watchable, in my opinion, disregard the theatrical and get hooked on this extended edition, it actually builds story on all the characters, the plots are not rush anymore, the dialog being stretched made the conversations held in the film more mature and believable, not so artificial and Jessica Alba seems to be acting now, its like they removed all those scenes intentionally for the theatrical to make it look like she cant act.<br/><br/>However it still has a few moments you kind of question, ""are they doing this for fun or are they retarded?"" but on positive side rent or buy the extended edition and enjoy a re-release made well and worth every penny."
"andres_canella","2","3","4","12 February 2007"," World's Not-So Greatest Film Adaptation
","Comic book fans have been treated with some excellent film adaptations of their favourite heroes and heroines. The Spider-Man & X-Men films, as well as Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins have set a new standard by which future Marvel and DC comics franchises will be tested. As the self-proclaimed ""World's Greatest Comics Magazine"", the Fantastic Four are anything but in this adaptation directed by Tim Story (Barbershop); amidst these other hero films, the Fantastic Four should be ashamed. Where does the film go wrong? The budget was in place, the casting was not terrible and there was plenty of great source material (decades of comics) to work with. Even the director and editors seem to have done decently worked around what seems to be the film's main failure: the lack of any engaging plot. Fantastic Four is an origin story with an eighties montage and an anti-climactic ending, featuring a villain whose purpose for committing villainy is obscure.<br/><br/>The inclusion of fan-favourite Jessica Alba as Sue Storm gives way to pointless fan-service excursions. The creative discussion must have gone as such: Producer: ""We need some T&A."" Writer: ""Okay, I've added this scene where she has to become invisible, but she can only be invisible if she gets naked."" Producer: ""I like it, but how are we going to see some T&A if she's invisible?"" Writer: ""Well, you know, she's having troubles adjusting to her powers, so when she's in her undergarments she'll temporarily lose her invisibility."" Producer: ""Sweet deal."" Obviously, the writers never paid attention to the golden rule of film-making: that every scene in some way contributes to the evolving plot or character development. Perhaps the near lack of plot may be at fault here. Clocking in at a mere 100 minutes, the movie still could have used some editing.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is not all bad. Being a fan of the comic series, the characters and their personalities were not meddled with. Some of the most entertaining scenes in the film involve the ever-famous rivalry between hotshot Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and the hardheaded Ben Grimm (The Thing). Likewise, the future relationship between blind love interest Alicia Masters and Ben Grimm was introduced in the film. Unfortunately, Ms. Masters' role was minute; considering the dramatic issue that is Ben Grimm's transformation into a hideous amalgamation of man and rock, more development between the softness of Alicia and their budding relationship could have added to the film's potency. Unfortunately, Marvel Comics' producers were aiming for a more action-packed film. As such, Fantastic Four still falls behind most films in the genre, as the final showdown between the group and Viktor Von Doom (the pointless villain) never reaches the intensity of Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock or Batman vs. Ra's Al Ghul. For longtime fans of the comics, famous lines such as The Thing's ""It's clobberin' time!"" and the Human Torch's ""Flame on!"" are but brief excursions from an otherwise dismal attempt at the superhero genre. Despite the obvious borrowing of ideas, Brad Bird's The Incredibles provides a much more satisfying experience for superhero fans. (3/10 - Poor)"

"crazyrabbits","1","12","25","21 July 2005"," A flash in the pan...
","...that's all this movie is. From the creative genius of Avi Arad comes another big-budget, low-intelligence superhero flick. Following in the footsteps of such fine films as Elektra and The Punisher, we have a group of government scientists who are bombarded with cosmic rays in space and given super-powers. Why does this movie suck so bad? <br/><br/>1) Characters/Acting: I mean, how do you expect me to believe these people are a team? The comic book FF are like a family, with Sue being a mother-like figure, and Reed being the grizzled leader of the group. You don't get that feeling in this movie. While Reed is busy moping because Sue is sleeping with Victor Von Doom, Ben Grimm is busy feeling sorry for himself and Johnny has gone to join the X-Games. This is characterization? Anyway, another thing that irked me was the similarity in origin between Victor Von Doom and Norman Osborn. I mean, from the firing of the villain by his board of directors, to the concept of being in a freak accident, to the long and drawn out speeches the villain does, you could just change the two guys around and everything would still be the same. As for the acting, with the exception of Michael Chiklis, all the actors sucked horribly. Here's a suggestion: the next time Marvel casts a movie, maybe they should try to get an ACTUAL actress, instead of a woman who is only in the plot for T&A scenes.<br/><br/>2) Plot: all in all, forgettable. If you gained the ability to generate fire or have rock skin, wouldn't you be a little bit freaked out? Not if you're Johnny Storm! Instead, you go skiing and join a motocross team. Good job! Scenes like Ben's wife leaving her ring on the ground and Sue and Reed's discussions about their relationships were essentially meaningless. When you know what's going to happen at the end of the movie, there's no point in even seeing it. Reed gets Sue, FF defeats bad guy, I've seen it many times before.<br/><br/>3) Plot holes: including, but not limited to: Ben being able to turn back into the Thing in less than 5 minutes, a heat-seeking rocket trailing Johnny when he's not even generating fire (possibly not a plot hole), no one even bothering to arrest any of the FF at the bridge, even when Ben Grimm caused the whole accident in the first place, no explanation on how the travellers get back from space after being hit with the cosmic rays, and most importantly, the fact that when you superheat an object, then cool it down, IT EXPLODES. It doesn't harden. For a guy who talks about Biology 101, Reed is an idiot.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: You're better off watching Batman Begins."

There was a certain amount of ""violence"", but I put that in quotation marks because there was absolutely no blood and gore. The special effects, such as the super cool Torch igniting his thumb like a cigarette lighter and Mr Fantastic sliding his rubber arm underneath a door to open it from the other side, not to mention the emotions (happy and sad) on The Thing's stony face, were exceptional.

Ben Grimm became the tragic hero he was in print, The Human Torch was irritatingly entertaining, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl - the interest they had in each other was a more innocent youthful brand, not the sexual tension that seems to be status quo in most 'family films'.

You believed that every character could be real. I was a little surprised that Sue Storm couldn't turn her clothes invisible, although I must admit I would've missed having the results of that limitation in the movie. I was very concerned about the Thing costume, that it wouldn't look right. In fact, I didn't like how it looked in any of the previews, trailers, or early commercials. I have to admit, though, it worked perfectly, and Chiklis made an excellent Ben Grimm/Thing. (My sole complaint about the costume, though, is that it should've made him look bigger all around; it turned out making his hands huge and out of proportion.)

","Just caught Fan4 on Saturday - very good, it made me want to go and hunt down all the old Marvel comics. Ben Grimm, very well done (the Shield, uh huh, noticed eventually.) Reed a bit of a sap though, just like Sue to have to tell him what he can't see in front of his face! Torch/Johnny, oh yes, very very impressive. I wonder if anyone noticed the slight link to Ghostbusters when Johnny says to Reed ""I thought you said Supernova was bad?"" I could hear echoes of ""You said crossing the streams was bad!"" The best bit was at the very start when Reed is making his pitch to Victor, who is sitting in the dark. I didn't realise until the lights went on, it's Cole Turner, the demon!!! I had no idea that the lovely Julian McMahon was the villain of the piece! He is so great as a comic-book villain! Enjoyed all the little Stan Lee in-jokes and modern media references, very good. My only complaint is why didn't they just make the sequel immediately? I can't wait till next year!"
"yeojennifer","7","4","6","4 August 2005"," good fun
","I really enjoyed the movie but it is very much a cartoon movie. There are some really cheesy lines and some interesting special effects that make it great for kids and those who are willing to suspend belief for 2 hrs and be entertained. I watched it mostly because I like Ioan Gruffudd who plays Mr. Fantastic (and boy is he ever). Jessica Alba can't seem to find an intelligent movie to appear in, but lots of skimpy clothes. At least she was wearing more than she did for 'Sleeping Dictionary'. I loved 'The Thing', Michael Chiklis did an amazing job running around with all that makeup on and that's what I call suffering for your art. Overall, I found the movie campy and very unrealistic but as long as you're only there to be entertained and not educated it's a fun ride."
"TheMovieMark","5","10","20","21 July 2005"," It's not horrible, but it's far from fantastic
","Fantastic Four's stench is nowhere near as rancid as that of Catwoman, Elektra, or Daredevil, but it's really not all that fresh, and I don't know if back-handed compliments like that are really what the movie was shooting for. But hey, looking at the reviews it's getting I think it should take what it can get.<br/><br/>The movie is actually a little more entertaining than I thought it would be, but my expectations were lower than a Star Trek fan's on prom night, so that's not saying a lot. Yes, it provides a few laughs, and it didn't send me into the stupor that Daredevil did, but there just isn't anything at all about the movie that stands out. I can't pinpoint a specific thing about it that impressed me.<br/><br/>Shouldn't I be impressed on at least a small level? Am I supposed to be bowled over by Jessica Alba turning invisible? Yeah, Claude Rains did it in an equally convincing fashion in 1933. Oh, I know, how about The Thing? He's a big rock dude who should be able to do massive amounts of damage! Weeeeell, unfortunately his foam rubber costume looks ridiculous. I know Chiklis fought hard against using CGI because he wanted to bring the human element to the character, but he apparently forgot about the ""laugh out loud at how ridiculously fake the costume looks"" element. Chiklis does a pretty good job, but come on. The main problem with the character is that he spends most his time either lamenting his condition or being cute. Yeah, you're a big rock, wah, get over it and DO SOMETHING! And could someone please tell me who thought Ioan Gruffudd would make a good Richard Reed? This guy is supposed to be the leader of the group? I guess he was close to being a convincing leader. All he lacked was charisma, intensity, toughness, charm, emotion, and courage. Other than that... It also didn't help that most the scenes where he was using his stretching ability looked like they came straight out of Looney Tunes.<br/><br/>At least they had a really cool bad guy, right? Surely you can't go wrong with Dr. Doom! Apparently you can if Dr. Doom is in the hands of the guy who directed Taxi. Dr. Doom spends the entire movie looking like an older Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek, and then we get about 10 minutes of him in the mask? Wow, thanks. And after the transformation he really isn't all the menacing or threatening. He sounds like he's talking in a subway tunnel. Plus, his anger is understandable.<br/><br/>The guy has his entire business and livelihood stripped away from him, so naturally he's gonna be pretty ticked off. Then the Fantastic Four get all the praise and glory for their new super powers? Bitter? Yeah, I think he might be. He loses everything while they all become heroes. Let's face it, somebody with the name of Victor Von Doom is destined to be a bad guy, there's really no way around that, so it would've been nice if he'd actually had an edge to him. Where's the darkness? I'm more scared of Christian Bale as Batman, and he's a good guy! Doom comes off as a bad guy for 6-year-olds to not be too scared of.<br/><br/>Another nitpick complaint is since this is supposed to be an origin movie, why aren't we given an explanation as to why each person got the specific super powers he or she did? It's barely hinted at that the powers reflect the personalities of each person, but why exactly does Jessica Alba gain the power of invisibility? Are they trying to claim she has transparent acting ability? Speaking of which, she sure looks good in her Fantastic Four outfit, but where is the emotion? Where is the conviction? I know she wasn't given much to work with, but put a little power in your line delivery! This certainly didn't help fuel the romantic angle between her and Dr. Reed. Whew, that didn't pan out, now did it? I saw more spark in my 10-year-old brother's eye when he watched Dakota Fanning in Uptown Girls than I did between these two. You'd think two scientists would know at least a little something about chemistry. *rim shot* Thank you, thank you.<br/><br/>I do have to give Chris Evans some credit though. He actually seemed to be having fun with the role, and his character actually has a personality. While the others were whining and moaning about their new, cool super powers, he was genuinely excited about it. That's how I'd be. I'd just shrug my shoulders, ask myself how much fame and money I could make off my little DNA alteration, and run with it.<br/><br/>But let's be honest, we all have to admit that the words, ""Wow, Chris Evans really carried the movie,"" don't speak well for the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>As a superhero movie, this just isn't that good, folks. The best way for me to describe Fantastic Four is that it felt like a pilot for a TV show. As a ""Chris Evans at the Apollo"" showcase it works, but as a comic book translation? Nah. It comes off as more of a ""sitcomic book translation."" BA DA BING! Man, I'm just full of 'em today.<br/><br/>Let me leave you with a public service announcement: if you're a Fantastic Four fanboy, and you end up really enjoying this movie, then I'm truly happy for you. But please, under no circumstances ever refer to this as ""funtastic."" You deserve to be punched if you do."
"lastrocklegend","1","10","20","10 July 2005"," Worst Blockbuster of the summer
","This was the worst movie I have seen to date this summer I don't even think that better acting could have saved it. This script was lethargic and pointless, the climax was all of 10 seconds and the world was not threatened in anyway shape or form. The acting from the actor that played Mr. Fantastic couldn't have been worse or any farther away from the comic book persona. I was surprised by this movie I wanted it to be good but it let me down. There were however, some OK parts to the movie. For example, the human torch was sometimes witty and interesting, and the special effects were OK. This was just another example of a crappy movie that was made to cash in on the big bucks that superhero movies like Spider-man and X-men 1 and 2 have done. For the love of Marvel I hope X-men 3 and Ironman are better then this.<br/><br/>Please excuse any spelling errors"

","I just saw the movie last night, mostly because my wife was a fan of the comic books. I knew nothing of the comics, but we both left disappointed. The movie can't compare to Batman Begins, which I have seen twice.<br/><br/>While this movie would have probably been considered a ""good"" or even ""great"" movie several years ago, it can't compare to something like Batman Begins or even Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>I have read in other reviews that Tim Story, the director, was trying to create a film from a fan's perspective. Though not knowing the story, my wife told me he stayed pretty true to the comics, but simply made too little of a plot into too long of a movie. I didn't even fully know the plot but it just seemed that I could predict every typical good guy vs bad guy thing that was going to happen.<br/><br/>As far as the actors reviews... well Chris Evans stole the show, I think. He added the much needed humor in the movie; his scenes being the only time I laughed. Michael Chiklis also had a few slightly humorous lines but did nothing special to make you love him, either as ""The Thing"" or as ""Ben"". Jessica Alba was simply there as a distraction, basically a pretty face. She didn't seem to know anything about science, unlike what her character in the comic books would. And as for Ioan Gruffudd, well... he tried but he just did not come across as believable. He seemed boring and did not bring too much to the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>I am interested in seeing what happens after the sales come out from this weekend. The cast on FOX News, said that they were already signed on for 2 and 3... but I just don't see that happening if this one does as bad as I fear it will. Happy movie going."

","I didn't expect much when I went into the theater, and I didn't receive much from the movie. This movie was OK. It could have been a lot better, especially after seeing Batman Begins.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot in this movie jumps around too much. One minute they realize they have superpowers, the next they are celebrities for no apparent reason except for ""saving the day"" one time. The funny thing is that the F4 were the reason why the chaos was happening in the first place. In fact, all of the destruction that the F4 have to save was first caused by them. It feels as though they aren't saving the day, but rather fixing what they have messed up. Also, the plot has many irregularities. 1 / 5 Dialouge: The dialouge wasn't unbearable, but it wasn't that good. However, it did have some funny one-liners which I think probably made the movie a lot better. 2.5 / 5 Acting: Only Doom(McMahon) and Thing(Chiklis) do a good job acting. Even though they are giving crappy dialouge to work with, they at least do a good job with it. Alba did the worst job out of everyone. 2 / 5 Special effects: Don't expect some amazing special effects with this movie. While they aren't bad, the problem is that after seeing Revenge of the Sith, the FX in F4 look really out-dated. 2.5 / 5 Last comment: Skip the theater and wait a year until it comes out on HBO or something and watch it on TV. Don't waste the money going to the theater or renting it.<br/><br/>Final grade: 2 / 5"

"tmartens","1","11","23","14 July 2005"," It doesn't get much worse.
","Well, I've seen the Fantastic Four. And it is terrible. As in not fantastic at all. Allow me to explain what I'm talking about: After being persuaded to go see it with a friend of mine, we went to go see it. I was already hesitant, as I figured from the trailer, I've probably seen the best parts of the movie, and I'm wasting money. Well, the first hour or so of the movie at first I thought, was strangely OK. They get their powers, and start studying them. I found the one part of how they had to cope with living together even funny. The development of the villain, Dr. Doom, was bad. They should've just used Willem Dafoe's character from the first Spiderman. I'm not kidding. Just take the footage from Spiderman, and place it in. The same circumstances of why he becomes evil and all of that are practically identical. However, at around the hour marker, the fire alarm went off, and the two of us were forced to leave the theater. I should've taken that as a sign. A few days later, with a free ticket in hand (thanks to the false alarm), I went back to see it a second time. The first hour was OK at best again. However, with almost brutal accuracy, I predicted the ending down to the smallest detail, and I was only halfway done with the film. I began to realize the pointlessness of the conflict between our heroes and the villain, the lack of development, the lack of story, the lack of purpose. The dialogue was dry. And the ending was exactly as I expected, only far shorter and anticlimactic to the most unbearable you can imagine. You will leave this movie either disappointed, or you will be too dazed from its stupidity to realize you just witnessed something terrible. I hate this movie. It's SO bad. And if you don't believe me... well, maybe you should just this time. I wouldn't want to punish you with seeing it."
"cmdavis007","4","11","23","9 July 2005"," Not so Fantastic Four
","After reading the numerous reviews about this movie, I went expecting a complete and total disaster of a film, what I got wasn't quite that bad. Make no mistake, I am not saying that this is a good movie by any stretch, but it does measure up better than Daredevil and The Hulk. <br/><br/>The story moves far too slowly, and way too much time is given to building up the origins of the characters, but it was somewhat watchable. Still the movie could have used a bit more action, and a bit less ""worried scientist."" The special effects are weak seeming to be of the Terminator 2. I am thankful that they decided to do The Thing via makeup as opposed to CGI because, as in the case of Hulk, the bad computer animation would have made the character even more laughable. The acting was not great, but honestly was a little better than I was expecting.<br/><br/>I think the biggest culprit in the failure of this film is Tim Story. I have to question why Story was given this movie to direct, and on a deeper level why he keeps receiving projects - one would have thought that the deplorable Taxi would have ended his career. Other Superhero films have been blessed by superior directing talents like Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer, and even Richard Donner, and have all been blessed by these creative directors bringing a unique sense of vision to their film. With Batman Begins and Sin City we had films that brought comic books to life - sadly in comparison Fantastic Four belongs on the discount rack.<br/><br/>The movie does have one big plus - it is a chance to watch the unbelievable beautiful Jessica Alba for two hours - so it ain't all bad. In the end if you can only see one superhero flick this summer go see Batman Begins, if you want some light fluff - this one won't kill you, but it won't satisfy you either."

Most movie try to stay faithful to the original as possible, but this messes it up, big time! Maybe the fantastic 4 sequel, we all know ones coming people, will be like X-men and improve on the plot, the theme, the whole movie. the movie kinda upset me of how a movie that had so much potential could become such a disappointment... for shame.

Afterward we decided that there was one person on the movie that must have consistently had this dialog with the screenwriter (who obviously quit very early in the production process): ""Should we explain why this might happen now?"" ""Nah, just blow something up!"" There are several laughs - a couple of them intended and a couple of 'this is completely ridiculous.'

Top reasons this film will not have any sequels (hopefully): <br/><br/><ul><li>the villain: Or should I say ""villian""? Audiences cannot manage to cheer for the heroes if the evil is not being evil. Doctor Doom left me wondering, ""Huh?"" It could have been the acting or it could have definitely been the story or maybe the plot, but the fact remains: no conflict! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Invisible Woman: The special effects sucked and, yes, the dialog, too, but Sue Storm does not bring to mind smart, powerful women. Being the only female in the group and amazingly the middle of a cheesy love triangle, Ms. Storm represents only the nagging, bitchy trailer-trash mothers that are a part of the feminine population. Very disappointing. When is Hollywood going to get an admirable, awe-inspiring superwoman into the theaters? Here's hoping for Wonder Woman.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Special Effects: Or lack of them. I get the feeling that the producers must have been running on a tight budget because I was watching Gumby with arm hair and a rendition of the early The Invisible Man. The Human Torch and The Thing were a little better than mediocre but I felt as if they were harnessing the glories of 21st century special effects. The entire movie slowly lead up to a poorly choreographed climax filled with cheesy, scientific ways the ""fantasic"" four try to defeat a bafflingly threatening(?) enemy.</li></ul><br/><br/>There are at least ten other reasons this film fails to impress, but I must say I loved Johnny Storm and Ben Grim. I also loved the genuine puppy love Reed Richards has for Sue and there scenes together are cute and deserving of cotton candy romance stories. Chris Evans shines above all of ""Fantastic Fours""'s shortcomings. Though the film strikes out, it may lead Fox to finally learn from its mistakes.<br/><br/>-"
"paddy701","4","9","19","10 July 2005"," Not a blue chip marvel film
","I read somewhere that this film was a low budget film compared to the x men or spider-man movies.Thats seems to be the case.The director Tim Story had zero experience with action films.There is no real flow to this to build up any suspense.Our 4 heros did not really do enough for me.I could not identify a legitimate crisis.I will let you be the judge of that.Dr Doom did next to nothing to make the FF needed to save the day in this film.They seem to be more or less defending themselves.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba looks hot but that is about it.I liked Johnny sometimes and other times he is annoying.The Ben Grim character was probably the best of the bunch but even he did not do enough,almost nothing.I am talking about them flexing their superpower muscle.<br/><br/>You really have to measure it next to the other Marvel projects.This falls somewhere around Elektra and The Punisher.It is not in the same league as the spider-man or X-men films. The writing and direction was sub par at best.The casting could have been much better,Ioan Gruffudd as Mr Fantastic was a dud and Juilan McMahon as doctor doom was kind of,...eh.It is the job of the producers to recruit a good director and good writers.The execs on this project failed in both areas.<br/><br/>Defintly go see if if you were looking to see the FF on the big screen.If you don't this barely worth renting let alone the big screen"
"clumpyness","4","9","19","9 July 2005"," Subpar movie
","The standard for superhero movies has been progressively raised over the past few years, how anybody thought that it was acceptable to release Fantastic Four in its current state is unbelievable.<br/><br/>The most prominent flaw that this movie has is the extraordinary amount of time WASTED on the useless banter, discovery and exhibition of each of the characters powers (no we didn't really need to see Mr. Fantastic reaching into the other room for toilet paper). Nothing really happens until the final few minutes of the movie. That leaves us with a good hour and a half of pointless scenes with mildly amusing humor prior to the movie really ""starting"".<br/><br/>The portrayal of Dr. Doom is...well disappointing. If you're at all familiar with the comic you know that he is dark, menacing and a bane to society. Here he is reduced to somebody that is not ""badass"" enough to give the Fantastic Four and the movie a purpose.<br/><br/>McMahon and Gruffudd give forgettable performances and Alba (while nice to ogle) is whiny enough to annoy. Many of her one liners made me cringe several times throughout.<br/><br/>Johnny Storm (Evans) is this movies only saving grace. He's excellent as the Human Torch, providing flamboyance and humor that keep this movie from being a total bore.<br/><br/>While the use of CGI did not detract from the movie but it was far from perfect. Maybe I'm just nitpicking but there is a lack of lighting on some city skyscrapers when the Human Torch is flying through the city, the textures on Mr. Fantastic are at times too smooth to be believable. Thankfully the action sequences are fast enough that you don't really notice unless you are looking for faults.<br/><br/>In the end, there is really no point to Fantastic Four. An hour and half of dull filler material keep this from being an acceptable popcorn movie and a pathetic Dr. Doom keep this from being an acceptable adaptation.<br/><br/>Not worth the ticket price, not worth a rental, maybe worth a rental in the 7-day section."

The plot includes the necessary villain, who looks invulnerable for a while; the effects of a romance among principals gone badly; and the transformation of tough guys into softies and the reverse.

","Sacul's meaningless movie reviews. Today: Sacul gets Doomed by the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>The comic book geek in me wanted this movie to crawl out of the dark pit most people suspected it would be and come out clobbering.I'm sorry to report it only crawled in circles like a reanimated corpse trying to remember what it was that it was suppose to be doing.<br/><br/>On the sliding scale of comic books to film it doesn't fall into Catwoman's litter box but it sure doesn't kick your teeth in like Batman Begins or Spider-man 2 either. This film is pure middle ground and it never tries to excel for anything higher which is a sad way to treat Marvels first family.<br/><br/>There is a lesson to be learned with this movie and the lesson is simple, if you plan to give over the director's chair to a non-action/effects type director at least give it to someone who might do something interesting and possibly original with it. If you look at the comic book films that have been successful they are all helmed by directors of vision, people who not only wanted to bring the book to life but bring their style to it. What you don't do is give a potentially huge franchise to directors so far out of their element.<br/><br/>Having said that I'll climb off my comic book geek soap box and talk about the movie itself.<br/><br/>The movie begins by tripping over its own feet. Reed and Ben are groveling at Victor Von Dooms feet looking for funding, this scene holds zero resonance since you can't understand the rivalry that pre-exists with these two mental giants and how much crow Reed is chewing in the asking. Then it clumsily proceeds to spill the information after the fact to bring us up to speed. The main focus of these two men's fight for attention becomes an imagined love triangle with Sue Storm, not lust for superiority or I.Q envy.<br/><br/>The drive of the film is split into too many directions and none of them are great storytelling. Reed is obsessed with curing the team, Johnny is chasing glory, Benn is depressed, and Sue is busy trying to find more outfits to show off her cleavage. Meanwhile Victor is losing his company and turning into a hood ornament in a complete rip off of Norman Osborne's story from the first Spider-man. Not one of these stories pays off so they throw in a few miscellaneous action scenes to keep you interested, so when the battle with Dr Doom begins it's pretty dull and without much direction. Doom's threat doesn't carry any weight and when it's all said and done he doesn't seem to have had anything to gain from it in the first place.<br/><br/>The movie does have its strong points though. The interaction between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm are great fun. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are the Human Torch and The Thing and they seem to have fun with the roles once they get it down. Everyone else does their best with what they have but the movie already had one huge monkey on its back with The Incredibles having only recently shown us how good a super hero family movie could be. That's a tough film to outshine no matter how you stretch it.<br/><br/>The bottom line for fans of the Fantastic Four is that this does not feel like it should, they spend too much time bickering while the movie completely stalls out. For people who don't know the book the special effects and random action scenes might hold your interest long enough to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Sacul out Excelsior!"

","Watching a movie I semi-anticipated, Fantastic Four was one of Marvel's worst. We deal with repetitive situations, and everything was rushed faster than a McDonald's combo. It also had the same side effects; very sloppy, and not worth my money. The characters attitude's are very boring, and the Thing's strength changed consistently throughout the movie. Oh, one thing more...since when can just about anyone in a Marvel movie fall from a building, land, and just get up again? Also, if you enjoy using Photoshop, you and Stan Lee have something in common. Some of the effects were just awful.<br/><br/>Overall, save your money for War of the Worlds. I haven't viewed it yet, so I'll see you there."
"bcb28","6","8","17","8 July 2005"," Lots of hoopla and a few laughs but thats about it.
","Seeing it, I was quite disappointed. Characters weren't well written, plot was thin, and the story seemed to drag on until the end and then it was over. The film had a few bright moments of comic relief and the special effects were very good. But being a research scientist by profession, I was brought back to the old adage, never let good science get in the way of a story. The more I think about it, the less I enjoyed it. Good thing the tickets were free as I would have been upset if I had to pay to see it. This is one movie that will not get in my DVD collection. If you really are into comic book themes, might I suggest Batman Begins, as it is head and shoulders above this movie."
"flint749","1","16","41","3 July 2005"," Worse than Batman TV
","I don't know where to begin. This movie is worse than it could possibly be. Was this a college workshop production somewhere in Uzbekistan?<br/><br/>The characters are horribly written, but the tepid actors don't even do justice to them. It was like, ""Hey, I just crash landed in a spaceship and have weird new powers. That's unusual.""<br/><br/>The villain, Doctor Doom, has an evil laugh as his main weapon. Every scene is contrived and stupid. It was physically painful to watch. I retched.<br/><br/>The only good part was the end. No, not the climactic battle scene, if you want to call it that. I mean the actual end with the credits.<br/><br/>It was like a Barney episode, dumbed down."
"pwoods1","6","6","12","7 December 2005"," Disappointing, yet... it has SOMETHING.
","Way back in the 'golden years' of SF&Fantasy comics.... Well, at least I have your attention! Start again. Whom we referred to as 'trufans' (at least in the 'bad-old-days') are still, several generations later, almost the same people, albeit with new faces. Their passion is the same as ever and, one must admit, deservedly so. If anything has changed, it is the medium of film. CGI has changed everything - but sometimes not for/to the good.<br/><br/>I would argue that FF is an acceptable translation from comic to screen. Unfortunately, we must compare it with others: most notably Sin City. There cannot be a favourable comparison. However, this review is about FF.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans form an inspired triad. However (yet again), Gruffudd, as Reed Richards, doesn't get ""grey"" enough from the cosmic experience; Chiklis, as 'The Thing', is far more interesting as his underplayed Ben Grimm. Johnny Storm, as played by Evans, is exactly as he is in the Marvel comic: a complete, teenage pain-in-the-butt. They work off each other in an ensemble which has coherence and a dynamic.<br/><br/>For me, Jessica Alba is a complete disaster as Sue Storm. She looks good (since when has being eye-candy been a job description for an actor? D'oh!) but hasn't the presence which the role requires.<br/><br/>Still, the special effects are good, even if Julian McMahon (as Doom) can't quite cope with the change from human to (supposedly) insane demi-god. He's not quite 'insane' enough, and certainly not convincing.<br/><br/>I give FF a score of six both for the special effects and because there is a sincerity behind its attempt to convert a Marvel favourite to the big screen."
"Rileeff","2","6","12","30 July 2005"," Fun comedy for very little kids, abysmal super hero movie
","Imagine Mike Myers writing and directing a super hero movie and you get Fantastic Four. The jokes are constant in the first hour and fifteen minutes. There cannot possibly be any seriousness or drama because the movie is literally a comedy in the style of Airplane as far as joke frequency. Reed Richards and company head up into space for some sort of ""cosmic genome save the world and it's great for mankind"" junk that gets them into position for the cosmic storm that gives them their powers. They are in space for about five seconds (yes, almost literally) when the cosmic storm hits early. They are blasted and then are next seen back on earth in quarantine. They develop their powers soon afterwards. The Thing is trashed throughout the movie. Johnny Storm/Human Torch makes fun of him throughout but it's cute fun and they have a great little chemistry going with it. The problem is that it's constant, as is The Thing being s*****d on by a bird, breaking five or six glasses (that's not an exaggeration), etc. You see, he's a rocky guy and he'd have trouble fitting in and he'd break lots of stuff!! We get the joke right off of the bat but it continues for the entire movie so get used to it. The Thing costume is terrible as you can see the fleshy, skin like parts of the costume clearly around the neck of a guy who's supposed to be rock inside and out. The so called relationship with the blind lady that The Thing meets in a bar is about one minute in length with a wrap up at the end. Hey, that relationship could be serious so it's no go here. The only effective, moving moment is also the movie's best movie moment. The Thing's done some hero stuff on a bridge and a crowd has gathered to watch. The crowd cheers him when it's over and The Thing's wife conveniently is on the bridge and shows up in the crowd. While the crowd is cheering, she removes her wedding ring and drops it on the ground. Thus, The Thing's heart is broken while a crowd cheers him in the background. It's actually done well. There are one or two other decent movie moments and that is all. The only guy who has any life is Johnny Storm. He has way too much fun with the super hero powers and Reed Richards and Sue Storm don't have any. They hate their powers, Johnny loves his and The Thing bumbles around being made a clown of. The action is a complete ripoff, one of the biggest ripoffs in any movie I've ever seen. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen ALL of the action. The thing too is that the action was better done in the trailer then it was in this movie (for real.) The cool opera music accompanying the action in the trailer is not in the movie, plus I heard the same music in a preview before this movie so it's some kind of trailer music. For the first hour and fifteen minutes, other then the FF discovering their powers, NOTHING happens. While the FF goes about trying to make kids laugh, Victor Von Doom is S-L-O-W-L-Y changing into Doctor Doom. When he becomes Doom, he's a surprisingly good antagonist. The problem is he's in a comedy and the FF are a joke so he's in the wrong movie if he wants to make an impact. He becomes Doom completely with about ten minutes to go in the movie and there follows an incredibly short final battle which is really the only battle in the entire movie. There is some good super hero stuff here for about three minutes and it keeps this movie from getting a 1 in my rating. There is some good team stuff here from the FF, which is interesting because they have never practiced anything or trained in any capacity as a group. They just sort of show up in their cute uniforms and do stuff. They are wearing uniforms for absolutely no reason as they are not even really super heros until the final battle and are a pretty disjointed unit throughout. Only Johnny tries to make them a team and that is for popularity and marketing purposes as he loves this stuff. Reed, of course, wears his uniform indoors for most of the movie, making him look like a total chump. Jessica Alba fakes her way through it and is, of course, absolutely gorgeous. She's so pretty you don't even really care if she can act or not. You just get lost in those eyes. The script is absolutely terrible, the dialogue is empty, the performances one dimensional. Julian McMahon (if he's the next Bond, he sure looks it) is a good Doom but he's too good for this jokefest. Mike Myers would have been more fitting. The dude who plays the Torch has great potential in his role and he is good in the serious parts, all two seconds of it. The FF deserve better. To be honest, they actually deserve a MOVIE about them."
"michaelsconstable-1","1","6","12","29 July 2005"," I wasted an hour and half of my life
","After watching the trailers of FF, I thought it had everything-superheroes, bad guy, special effects and Jessica Alba. But OMG this is one the worst action films of all time. The film has no beginning, you are just thrown into a world where the characters are so stereotyped and god damn unbelievable. At least Spiderman had a decent amount of character development before the whole film fell down hill. But FF had nothing to draw me in. The acting was from a B-movie that had been pushed down to a f-movie. It had two good actors in it- the guy from the shield and and van doom from nip/tuck, but they were as bad as the rest. and as for the director- give me a hundred million quid and I'd make a true action film which actually would be worth seeing! This guy knew nothing about continuity, film flow and most of all, story telling! Anyone who finds this film thrilling/entertaining, needs to have their head examined!"
"SeminolePhenom","3","6","12","12 July 2005"," Fantastic Four is not fantastic
","I saw Fantastic Four yesterday with low expectations and left dumber than I could have expected. I literally laughed at almost every serious scene and I wanted to punch The Thing in the face every time he moaned about how ""he wanted to be normal"" and ""the others don't know how good they had it"". The movie was extremely unconvincing and made me hate myself. The movie would have been much better if it was meant to be a parody on superhero movies, but the fact of the matter is that it wasn't. It was meant to be and Action- Packed Thriller and instead it was a giant joke. I wasn't disappointed due to the fact that I didn't really want to see it in the first place after seeing The Thing say ""It's clobbering time"" in the previews. I can honestly say that the only good thing about the movie was the scene where Jessica Alba gets in her underwear when she thought she was invisible, and she still was no where near as sexy as she was in the great Sin City. Overall, Fantastic Four's acting was under par, the plot was terrible,the writing was terrible, and the special effects were only mediocre. <br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie for anyone but mindless idiots who like cheesy lines ""Flame On"" or geeks who are absolutely obsessed with Jessica Abla."
"Zoopansick","3","6","12","10 July 2005"," I give it a Fantastic 4...out of 10
","What a waste of 10 bucks. I didn't expect much from this movie and it did not disappoint. I was at least hoping for some cool fight scenes with all the powers if nothing else. Well guess what there wasn't really any fighting, except for the 5-10 minute thing at the end, which was fairly anti-climactic (in my opinion). In an age where it seems almost every other movie is based on a comic book this one is pretty weak. Especially compared to the vastly superior Batman Begins that came out this summer. In that movie there was an actual plot and the characters were much more defined. Here the characters were all 2D and there wasn't really a plot at all. I didn't buy 1)How they all became celebrity heroes after saving a few guys from a problem which was largely the Thing's doing. What was he doing on the bridge anyway? The writing wasn't really that good and while this movie wasn't painful to sit through, and was fairly short, it managed to be even more transparent then Jessica Alba. I guess the Special Effects were OK, but now adays when ever movie has special effects they don't seem as special as they did, say a decade ago when T2 and Jurrassic Park came out. If you want to see a comic book movie see Batman or rent one of the Spiderman or X-Men movies. If you want to see a boring pointless movie with almost no action go see Fantastic Four."
"douchie692000","8","6","12","9 July 2005"," Get Over It, I enjoyed it
","I liked the movie. It was fun and kept me entertained the whole time. When it was finished I didn't even notice that it took two hours. I mean come on now, what were you expecting, Memento for God's sake? If you enjoyed light-hearted movies that will make you a laugh a little and give you some drama to boot then watch it. I went and the movie theater was so full they opened an adjacent showing at the exact same time and I had to sneak in there to get a seat. And just for those out there who only care about the actors playing the Fantastic Four, I'd take Jessica Alba and Chris Evans over Seabiscuit guy and Bring it On girl anytime."
"MrTacchi","Null","21","58","28 June 2005"," It's just the same old thing
","After seeing The Fantastic Four, I felt like I was watching over the same old movie again and again. Maybe it could have been amazing ten years ago, before ""X2"",""Spiderman"" ""Hulk"", ""Batman Begins"" or ""Revenge of the Siths"". But if you saw any of the movies above, it will be very hard to be surprised by this one.<br/><br/>First of all, the cast was not that good. Jessica Alba seems too young for Susan, and Chris Evans just doesn't seems to fit his role. Mr Doom is very laughable and it's not scary at all, specially because is interpreted by that guy from ""Nip Tuck"" we're all used to see as a ""casanova"". The rest of the cast (and the two most important characters, Mr. Fantastic and The Thing) are kinda unknown, but that's not really a bad thing. I think that the major problem with comic movies is that''s really hard for fans to get used to see a real person incarnating his/her childhood hero. So, the less famous the actor, the better.<br/><br/>About the plot, all I can say it's a bit disappointing, and it has all the flares and holes that this kind of movie seems to have. It's not a bad movie, but it's not original. So to speak, you won't find anything new in ""Fantastic fours"", but you won't fall asleep either."
"bob the moo","Null","7","15","17 August 2005"," Enjoyable, effects-driven summer fare but surprisingly lazy
","Reed Richards wants to investigate the effects of a space storm that he believes could have started life on Earth, However, out of cash he is forced to turn to Victor Von Doom, a wealthy businessman, for funding. Soon the team is altogether and on Doom's space station  Richards (the scientist), Doom (the money), Grimm (the co-pilot), Johnny Storm (the pilot) and Sue Storm (a young woman with a nice body). However it all goes wrong when the storm arrives nine hours early and only Doom can get safely behind the shields. Back on Earth, the effects of the storm start to kick in, giving the four of them amazing powers. However while they try to work out what is happening, Doom's company is collapsing, driving him into anger and rejection, while other smaller changes start to kick in on him too.<br/><br/>Another summer, another comic book adaptation looking to kick off a franchise of blockbusters. In this regard it is no different than all the other ones; driven by special effects and noise rather than having a real depth or individualism to make it stick in the mind. These problems are obvious from the very start but it probably won't matter to those who have come for the effects because it is noisy and colourful but I was surprised by how little effort the film actually made at times. The plot is fairly straightforward but yet it also manages to be lazy at the same time  characters conveniently arrive when required and it is all too simple. In many other areas as well, it appears that the film already knows that it will get a sequel so it doesn't need to do anything special. The action is good despite being a little too sparse and simple; its quite fun and the effects are mostly good.<br/><br/>The cast are mixed and are a surprising mix of TV stars considering the high profile of the film. Gruffudd is OK but it is hard to get behind him as a person because he doesn't have much in the way of screen presence  he is meant to be the lead but instead he is the least of the group. Alba is cutting out a risky career path for herself here  blazing a trail as a bland, pretty blonde starlet  will the trend catch on in Hollywood I wonder? She is dull as dishwater here with a poor delivery that no amount of cleavage shots can compensate for. Thank god then for Chiklis and Evans. Chiklis gets the closest to a scarred character the script gives anyone and his tough comedy and good presence is always welcome. Evans may be pretty obvious with his surfer humour but he is at least lively next to the corpses that are Gruffudd and Alba. McMahon is a bit hammy and not as much of a super-villain as I think he needed to be.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK summer movie but it is certainly no more than that. The effects are good and the action is fun if sparse. However the performances are surprisingly poor in key roles while the writing (in regards plotting and dialogue) leaves a lot to be desired. Not a bad film and will please target audience but it has certainly not done anything to deserve the sequel it clearly sees as its birthright."
"gothic-2","2","7","15","10 August 2005"," A huge disappointment unless this is the first movie you watch. Ever.
","The reason that I just had to write my own review was all these 10 star reviews that plague the comments area, leading the unsuspected viewer to think that this is a new movies classic, able to surpass the Godfather or Ran. If you are a teen who thinks that Dumb and Dumber 2 had an interesting plot and Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon are enough to make you pay a ticket for this movie, then you might actually enjoy this. Being a FF and comic heroes/scifi fan in general, I joined the rest of the herd into the cinema to see one of the worst, if not THE worst movie with the ""Marvel Comics"" logo showing at the beginning of it. The plot has more holes than swiss cheese. The jokes are boring and are thrown to our faces way too often just in case you missed them the previous 20 times they were used. Yes Torch boy, you're hot, we get it, ha ha. The Thing carries the burden of a comic relief and you find yourself laughing at a slapstick comedy, only that the Three Stooges did it much better.<br/><br/>*********** spoilers ***********<br/><br/>I mean seriously, let's just think of the scene at the bridge. Everyone just happened to be on that bridge at the same time. Thing's mates were there just when he needed them and guess what, his wife too! How convenient. One would believe that everyone lives and works at the bridge. The firemen acted like stupid rag dolls and when the firetruck was hanging on the edge of the bridge, everyone rushed towards the wrong part, probably thinking ""the weird rock-skin fella will save us"". And the stupidity just went on. ""Become invisible and go help him."". A few moments later our heroes find themselves close to him. ""It's a good think you became invisible and we got here"". So, in a nutshell, she became invisible, pushed aside a couple of cops saying ""coming through, excuse me"", they all walked there and she became visible again. Yyyyeah. The story between Reed and Sue is cheesy, boring and half the movie revolves around it. It's like a soap opera with a really weird couple. Johnny is a silly guy who's on a quest to become famous the easy way and he's a character that no one really cares about. His ability to imitate a match is an endless source of supposedly funny lines repeated every now and than, like ""- You're on fire. - I know. - No, you're actually on fire."" Ha ha ha. But the quality humor continues. Ben's story line could be interesting but after 40 seconds of dealing with the love of his life, it's all reduced to 30 (at least) unoriginal and predictable jokes about him being too heavy and too strong. Dr.Doom is no better than the rest of the bunch. He becomes evil just because it's in the script. He loses his job, a few hair, gets a scar, superhuman strength and he decides that it's time to conquer the world using his secret weapons, ultra boredom and super whining. I was expecting to see him in a handicap match versus Ben and Reed, with Sue cheering in a bikini and Johnny holding a chair, waiting for a chance to give a sneak hit with it, but no, they just had to go for a boring 4 minute fighting scene in the end which is less exciting than watching a couple of baboons sleeping at the zoo.<br/><br/>********** no more spoilers :) *********<br/><br/>There are probably a zillion movies that you haven't seen but you need to. This is not one of them, it's a complete waste of time. It's the best example of Hollywood exploiting an idea and actors favorite to teenagers to make money. On the bright side, there's no Justin Timberlake or Jessica Simpson in it, so it could be worst. Steer away at all costs. If I saved a single soul, then I didn't type this for nothing."
"Potty-Man","2","7","15","14 July 2005"," Who in their right minds would give this pile of $#!@ a 10???
","I just saw this movie, and I am extremely disappointed. It's another one in a long list of bad decisions regarding comic book movies, the worst of which have not yet been released (X-Men 3, anyone?). What a misfire! And to think that according to the trivia page, Steven Soderbergh was interested in directing, George Clooney was considered for the role of Reed Richards, Naomi Watts for Sue Storm, and Tim Robbins for Dr. Doom. Instead, we get Tim Story, who is one of the worst directors working today, and a cast comprised of B-list actors or television stars. This was the most unattractive cast I've seen since The Dreamcatcher. In particular, I couldn't stand Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd). There was absolutely nothing in this film to hold my interest. Where is the plot? The script had the structure of a sit-com. A bunch of semi-amusing occurrences, pasted together with no real development, conflict, character arcs, etc. The effects ranged from bad to mediocre. There was even one shot where you could see the wrinkles of the latex in The Thing's suit, right after Deb rushes off to the street wearing nothing but a skimpy night-gown (!). Even Dr. Doom, which has a great costume design in the comics, managed to look terrible thanks to a corny face-shaped iron mask (instead of the menacing, expressionistic, angular, metal-plate mask of the comics) and a golden shirt which looked like it came from the dressing room of a really cheap children show. The score was also annoying, and reminded me of TV shows like Sweet Valley High or The Flinstones, where whenever somebody slipped there was this ""Wee-wee-wee-wee"" sound effect to emphasize the comedy. Whenever there was a situation in Fantastic Four that was supposed to make us laugh, the score became unbearably goofy. The look of the movie was awful. Reed's machines looked like tinker-toys, and the whole thing had this plasticized, fake feeling to it. Nothing looked real, yet the style wasn't defined enough to be campy or cartoony. The characters lacked depth, and the only one who managed to bring something other than the obvious traits to their character (i.e. Doom=evil & megalomaniac, Torch=cocky & reckless, etc.) was Michael Chiklis, whose performance I enjoyed. What we end up with is a clichéd, paper thin, hollow product , which walks, talks and smells like a pilot for a TV series, the kind that gets canceled after one season."
"DigitalPhreaker","5","7","15","12 July 2005"," ""It's already over?""
","There are two reasons why I would ever ask that question: a.) The film was so great that I did not realize that the time had already past, IE: Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>b.) The film had so many different plot holes and so much cliché writing, that when the end credits pop up, I can't help but feel that my eyes had just been raped for an hour and a half, and that my wallet got charged for it.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four,"" unfortunately, falls under the category of b. I was not surprised that would happen however. I could tell just by the trailers alone that this movie was going to be driven by three things: Action, Bad One-Liners, and Jessica Alba's incredible, INCREDIBLE sex appeal. The film delivered all three...and on a side note, I wasn't paying too much attention to the film when Alba was on screen. That woman is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the main point. ""Fantastic Four"" fell under the common curse of being made by people who just could've cared less about the characters, script, and mythology behind it all. I never read comic books as a kid, but I have an appreciation for the whole mythology of them. Spider-Man, Batman Begins, and the first X-Men delivered successfully when it came to the audience not only caring about the characters, but eagerly anticipating the sequels to come.<br/><br/>There will be sequels for the ""Fantastic Four,"" which saddens me. Not because the evil Dr. Doom makes a bad come back at the end, but because this film made money, and unfortunately, I added to that. Everyone who knows anything about Hollywood understands that in that town, if the film makes more than it cost to produce, then it was a success.<br/><br/>It's just too bad that F4 did, cause I'm sure producers would scrap the sequels.<br/><br/>I give it a 5/10. The directing from ""Taxi"" director Tim Story was just flat. It seemed no real effort was put into it. The writing was typical of a comic book based film. The acting was somewhat cheesy, but I can't blame the actors; I blame the writing.<br/><br/>See it if you want some mindless entertainment and to see some semi-great action scenes, or just wait for it to come out on DVD and spend $3.50 to rent it, rather than $10.00 to watch it in theaters."
"korinnwynternite","3","7","15","8 July 2005"," Fantastic Flop
","Well, as far as I and all of my friends are concerned, this has been the worst adaptation thus far this summer. After being impressed with Batman Begins, I couldn't help but be disappointed. The characters were shallow, the plot was non-existent, and the ever present background crowd increasingly annoying. Not to mention the special effects were a hack job. The characters seemed only interested in fighting amongst themselves and with Dr. Doom, and at the expense of the surrounding city and it's citizens (i.e. Human Torch lighting the barge on fire to attract the missile chasing him... what about the crew?). Dr. Doom, the primary antagonist, also seemed to have no agenda but to destroy the Fantastic Four. Once he was done, he didn't have any plans but to chill out with the immense power he had acquired.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot was like swiss cheese, the characters were thin as paper, and the movie as a whole was fairly uninteresting. Though some people in the theater clapped as the lights came up, I said to myself, ""they are either die-hard fans of the comic book (which I enjoyed), they weren't paying attention, or they had low standards."""

If they ever decided to make a live-action Fantastic Four TV series, this would be the pilot episode, and a pretty mediocre one at that. Seriously, I'm not fanboy or anything, but even I know that Johnny Storm's hair is supposed to be long and blonde. Why change it? And check out Alba's gratuitous cleavage on the internet ads. Nice going there, Fox guys.<br/><br/>Anyways, Fox needed a cheap director they could control who can yell ""action"" while a group of execs behind him decide how the movie will play, which is exactly what happened on this film. For more Tim Story goodness, check out (or don't) the generic ""Taxi"" with Jimmy Fallon.<br/><br/>This is an embarrassment to all those involved.

The trailer wasn't promising much and the overload of marketing was making my spider senses tingle that there was something wrong with this movie. <br/><br/>The first thing that I noticed was that the story is fast-paced, but in it's fast pace it just skips certain sub-plots that are started at the beginning. Furthermore, if you have seen any of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past years, you might as well skip this one, because it is nothing more than a summary of all clichés that you might expect from a superhero movie. It fails to surprise at any point. There is no sense of story or goal for our 'heroes' throughout the film witch leaves the only thing that is slightly entertaining (the relationship between 'the human torch' and 'the thing') to be the only story worth following.<br/><br/>The scenario seems to be nothing more than an excuse for the stunt scenes that 'Johnny Storm' (Chris Evans) gets to preform. And if the effects or stunts were good or worthwhile this wouldn't be so bad. But the effects are a real stinker. Mr Fantastic is not made of rubber but on screen he is clearly made of pixels. The other effects seem dated and not exiting at all.<br/><br/>Even worse than that, the acting is substandard: none of the actors seem to take their part seriously and I can hardly blame them with the story being as unbelievable and shaky as it is. The original material is partly to blame for this, but those 'other' superhero movies (Xmen 1 and 2) have proved that it is possible to make an unbelievable, slightly ridiculous story into one that is not only entertaining but also has some depth.<br/><br/>And that is what I missed most in this movie. Any characters with real depth and believability.<br/><br/>Miss this stinker of a movie and save your money for some the other excellent comic book adaptations that have come out this summer; Batman begins, Sin city, etc."

This is supposed to be taking place in NYC but City TV is from Toronto (where the movie was made. On top of that Ben Mulroney was on of the reporters.

The scenes that were suppose to be the most emotional turned out to be jokes, ex: When Ben Grimm's girlfriend drops her engagement ring after seeing him on the bridge, and he tired to pick it up, yet his new rock fingers were too massive to grab it. Reed did not really come off as his egg-head self, becoming some kind of comedic scientist. Dr. Doom though, was by far the most unforgivable crime in this entire tragedy. <br/><br/>The most dangerous villain in the Marvel universe, and some consider him the greatest villain in comicdom. First offense: He's a CEO? Right at the beginning of the film, he's seen ripping off Norman Osbourne from the Spider-Man comics and movies. Though I can understand the idea, they could have easily changed it. He begins to lose his company and begins to go crazy? Sound familiar? Second offense: He gains powers. Unlike most villains, who are usually more powerful than their hero opponents, Doom posses no superhuman strength or powers aside from his own intelligence, which is even second to Richards'. In the movie, he somehow gains the power over electricity and grows metal skin. WTF? In one scene, Doom becomes a second-rate Magneto. Third offense: no armor? Later in the film, Doom is seen gaining access to his own personal armory, so why couldn't he just as easily grab a experimental super-armor? At least that'd make for less of the trashy Force-Lightning he used. All in all, while a fairly good movie for someone ignorant to the comics, anyone who knows even the slightest bit of the great comicbook, beware. For shame Mr. Story. For shame."

","I have to say that Fanasic four is the first time a comic-book film that is targeted the whole family to enjoy besides The Incredibles.<br/><br/>It's so unfortunate to see that people like to see Dark superheroes, It's becoming exhausting. Batman Begins is dark, X-Men is dark, Hulk is dark, Elektra is dark, even the first Spider-Man is somewhat dark. Fantastic Four is a returning fresh film that doesn't follow the trend of the Dark Superhero comic formula. Darkness is illuminating yes I agree, but don't you think we should tame the slumping box office game with a flame?<br/><br/>I hope this film makes more money domestic and worldwide it deserves it a lot. I think the reason why the box office game is deteriorating is because there are no films targeted for younger audiences. Despite the film is PG-13 Fantastic Four is for everyone.

","This could have been a lot better, but it isn't butt ugly. I think that one aspect of the film that was overdone was the CGI, and suspect that the filmmakers subordinated the writing to the visuals.<br/><br/>The story we know from the comics: people are in space and get hit by a storm of radiation. This affects them, and they become imbued with superpowers. Some of the film was them just getting used to their new powers. (Johnny storm hangs their titles on them in the film. In the comic books, each chose his or her own name.) The closest thing to an ordinary story is Ben Grimm's coping with his metamorphosis. And it was the most poignant part of the film.<br/><br/>Victor von Doom, in the film, was also caught in the storm. He got ""scarred,"" but the scar really was the manifestation of something more sinister: his own metamorphosis. As he learns of his powers, he decides to remove the competition, and develops a plot to take care of the Four, one by one.<br/><br/>Major spoiler: Reed Richards was trying to construct a chamber where he could recreate the ""cosmic storm."" However, in the film it had previously been established that the radiation in question was ""unknown,"" and the time before the storm was so short that there was no time to record all its characteristics, so how could Richards duplicate it in the chamber? The part about The Thing's ""cure"" and what he did about it was reminiscent of Superman's ""de-supering"" in Superman II, and how he got his powers back.<br/><br/>The film was more show than substance, but it is watchable."
"rosscinema","4","5","10","14 August 2005"," Lightweight Four
","With Hollywood churning out superhero films from comic books at a fast pace one has to accept that some (if not most) will be disappointing efforts that seem like rushed efforts and I think this film is exactly what I just described. Story is about Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), and her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) who go up into orbit on a space station to check on a cosmic storm but things go wrong when it suddenly changes direction and the four of them are exposed to cosmic radiation. Heading their voyage is a successful industrialist named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who is hard pressed by the companies CEO's to make their shares more profitable...or else.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** The four of them return to Earth and find out that they have all been genetically altered by the storm with Reed (Mr. Fantastic) being able to stretch like rubber and Ben (The Thing) turning into a Hulk-like figure made out of orange rock. Susan (Invisible Girl) can turn invisible and create force fields while Johnny (Human Torch) can become supernova hot and also fly but what they don't know is that Von Doom was also altered by the storm. Dr. Doom is slowly becoming metallic and electrical and when he is fired after the space catastrophe he vows revenge on all those involved including the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>For whatever reason the studio hired one Tim Story to direct this ambitious project and one has to wonder how he was given the opportunity because his previous efforts (like the wretched ""Taxi"" and the low budget ""Barbershop"") hardly makes one think that he can handle something this size. It's noticeable right from the get-go that Story is in over his head but what I think is even more clear is that this film lacks any type of star power whatsoever. I'm not trying to insult any of the actors because I think their all good performers but is there really anyone in this cast that can put butts in theater seats? The actor who does come off best is Chiklis as The Thing who's role is understandable because his appearance is so drastically changed that he loses his fiancé. But the film still wants the viewers to think that The Thing would be sitting in a coffee shop by himself without drawing any attention or crowds and that Ben's fiancé would casually walk outside in Brooklyn wearing nothing but a nightie! My biggest complaint with this film comes from the casting of McMahon as Von Doom and it's because he's so damn soft spoken! He wears what looks like a Darth Vader rental and is supposed to be trying to kill people and take over the world but all I could think of when I watched his character was ""COULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK UP"". Instead of Dr. Doom maybe his nickname should be Mr. Lowkey because I can't think of one scene where he raises his voice. While superior films like ""Batman Begins"" and ""Spider-Man 2"" take their time with character development and showing the effects of having an alter-ego this effort merely (and barely) touches on those issues. This film suffers from an inexperienced director and a weak script and doesn't possess actors in it's cast to make anyone take notice so what audiences are left with is an effort that looks like it was rushed into theaters to make it's summer release date."

","And yes I meant for all the letters to be capitalized. I went to see this supposed good action flick, with my mom and cousins, and instead got this utter piece of garbage! The only character who shows (or at least attempts to show) any real emotion is the Thing. Micheal Chiklis' was reasonable as him. The CGI fire for the Human Torch was good. But other than that everything was unexciting. Couldn't they at least come up with a better mask for Von Doom? And try to make his voice sound more menacing, something like the Green Goblin? The whole engagement ring scene was laughably stupid and unforgivable. The soundtrack is extremely annoying. And nothing in Reed's lab looked real. There is no love shown in Von Doom's proposal to Susan. I don't have time to mention every mistake/cliché or I would.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this movie is totally clichéd. The only reason I gave it a two is because as I said before I thought Micheal Chiklis was pretty decent,but that's it. Everything in it is nothing that hasn't been done or seen before.

","The very indifferent way The Fantastic Four was put together indicates to me the makers were non-fans with very little interest in the subject. The script is littered with lame jokes which along with the rest of the boring and highly expository dialogue is delivered with very little conviction by the actors. The only participant who shows any interest or enthusiasm is FF creator Stan Lee who as per apparent tradition makes a brief cameo. Despite the fact there are four, not one but four (actually five including the villain), super-power endowed characters there is precious little spectacle. The story seems to go on endlessly from one boring scene to the next until in the last 5 minutes it abruptly changes it's tone from non-stop chitter chatter into the sort of spectacle I had long since grew tired and bored of waiting for. By then I was much too disinterested to care."
"muphasta","4","5","10","12 July 2005"," no character development, poor direction, not a good movie
","I have never been a fan of comic books, but have enjoyed the movies based on comic book characters. The wife and I really enjoyed X-men, X-men II, Spiderman, and 3 of 5 of the Batman movies. Now, I had no expectations going into this movie. I did not know the story, and could not be disappointed by a lack of being true to the comic. If it was true or not, I don't know.<br/><br/>On casting: Jessica Alba is what, 24? She is supposed to be the same age as the other MIT grads who look as if they are in their late 30's if not into their 40's? I just didn't buy it. I am not a huge fan of hers anyway. Not that she did a bad job, it is just that she was not the right choice for this role.<br/><br/>Character development: It didn't exist. Sure there were some attempts to tell the audience about the characters, but not enough time was spent getting you to know them or even care about them. I think each person got one sentence about their past. For instance Johnny getting kicked out of NASA for trying to smuggle models aboard a flight simulator. That is about all there was introducing his character. Von Doom got three scenes devoted to his character, and it still wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Directing: I have no experience making movies, just a fan for a long time. Anyway, I'd say that there were too many plot holes to make this a good movie, but it is hard to find the plot. Maybe I fell asleep, but how do people walk around a space station like they are walking on earth? Did I miss the part about artificial gravity? They may have mentioned it, but I don't remember. They could have, and should have added at least another 20 minutes to this film in order to answer some obvious questions that the directing brings up, and to develop the characters.<br/><br/>Overall: I think this film was made to show of Alba's body in a tight outfit and to demonstrate special effects. I know I am in the minority, but she doesn't do anything for me. There are other types of movies out there (adult) that I'd watch if I wanted to see a woman showing off her body.<br/><br/>I left this movie wishing I had the 45 minutes and my money back. I know the movie is longer than 45 minutes, it is just short. I would wait for this to come to the rental store, or to cable/sat before I watched it. I really can't believe the box office numbers for this movie. But, I was one of the people out there on the opening weekend, so I contributed."

","This Movie was a total disappointment. From start to finish nothing was accomplished. The first action after they become the ""Fantastic Four"" is Poor, they are hailed as heroes when the whole accident wouldn't have even been caused if 'The Thing' wasn't a big dumb brute. Dr. Doom could have really been expanded a lot more but in the movie he is just looking for revenge against Reed over what better than: a woman. The Fantastic Four never 'save the city' or help anyone out except for preventing their own demise. They take down doom faster than any end battle in any movie ever made. But Doom really wasn't a threat to anyone but the Fantastic Four. I think the movie looked great but the story was just so weak that I would have rather seen them all sitting around having cocktails for 2 hours. I am normally a fan of comic book movie adaptations but this one is terrible. Hell Ben never once called Reed 'Strech-o'. I recommend seeing this movie only to understand how to waste a great story and reduce it to nothing."
"stonedonkies","4","5","10","11 July 2005"," Funny dialog mud wrestles with mind-bending stupidity
","I guess I shouldn't have expected much from the director of the aggressively forgettable Taxi. Taken as a whole, the script feels like something that--at one point--had meat on its bones but was badly mishandled and mangled by a mission to prioritize merchandising over delivering a competent film. While this mercenary cynicism isn't surprising to find in a high-concept summer blockbuster, it's a disappointing step backwards after Batman Begins and the X-Men and Spider-Man films. Tim Story and his screenwriters don't seem to get the appeal of the Fantastic 4 or grasp the dignity granted to X-Men and Spider-Man. Worse, I can't tell how much they really care about being faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>Also, some migraine-inducing plot stupidity drains whatever enjoyment you might get from some snappy dialog or from ogling Jessica Alba.<br/><br/>Let's say, hypothetically, that you save a man from getting hit by a truck, but in the process you cause a massive pileup, a chain reaction that leads to people dangling over precipices and flying into the abyss. Dozens of bystanders witness the domino fallout of events. Yet because you manage to salvage this traffic catastrophe that you created, you are hailed as a hero as soon as the dust settles. The plot of Fantastic 4 is shot through with nonsensical set pieces like this that. By the time the film wraps up its by-the-books, slam-bang action movie conclusion, you're mind will probably already be working on where you parked your car.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Alba was the most consistently engaging character, despite the script she had to work with. She managed to utter reams of inane dialog with charming dignity and made her character almost believable. She's also nice to look at, and the cinematographer new how to make her shine. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for a pretty face."
"ViveLaNeige","8","5","10","10 July 2005"," If not utterly fantastic, at least quite good and entertaining
","You've probably heard lots of movie critics say that ""Fantastic Four"" isn't all that great, but I saw it, and I disagree. Sure, it's not up to the near-perfection in plot, character development, etc. of ""Spider-man"" and ""Spider-man 2"", but from what little I know about the comic books, ""The Fantastic Four"" is supposed to be quite different. I hear that the comic books (never read them, but heard from reliable sources) were supposed to have an air of humor that is not present in most other Marvel comics. The movie fits that description quite well.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie tells the story of Reed Richards, a brilliant scientist who's not doing well financially, Sue Storm, Reed's former love interest, Ben Grimm, Reed's faithful friend and bodyguard-type, and Johnny Storm, Sue's younger brother who loves adventure and getting girls, who persuade millionaire Victor Von Doom to finance an experiment in space. The cosmic storm whose effects they go up to study causes them all to undergo changes in DNA, transforming them into stretchy Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the rock-like Thing, and the Human Torch, respectively. The storm also gives Von Doom powers, and it soon becomes evident that he means to use them with villainous intent. It is up to the Fantastic Four to stop him, while they work out their relationships with each other.<br/><br/>Now, critics have said that the acting isn't stellar, and the plot isn't realistic enough. I won't say the acting IS wonderful, but most of the actors do a fine job, especially Chris Evans as Johnny/Human Torch. However, saying an action/sci-fi/comic book movie isn't realistic enough is foolish - it isn't meant to be realistic. I came away from ""Fantastic Four"" entertained and pleased with a very good superhero movie. There are lots of laughs to be had, and many very cool scenes. My only complaint is that I wish we could have seen the Four use their powers more in the movie... but if there is a sequel, which seems quite possible, there will be plenty of time for that."

This film recreates the essence of Lee/Kirby, Byrne and Waid/'Ringo. Comics are supposed to be fun, and that's what this movie is. I was uncertain about the cast at first, but they all do great jobs.

","the effects are just fine and do the Fantastic Four justice, the rest of the film is not up to the task.<br/><br/>With the exception of Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, the characters are largely uninteresting mainly due to an inferior plot which gives the Fantastic Four little to do other than mope, engage in tepid love triangles (ok Doom's a jerk but what does Sue see in Reed?), and trust the bad guy for no reason. <br/><br/>Which bring us to the most disappointing aspect; the 'villain'. Dr Doom, though played fine enough by Julian McMahon, (who is well seasoned at playing a soul-less cad on Nip/Tuck) is given little purpose other than he is just a bad guy at heart. As played in the movie, Dr Doom presents a threat specifically and personally to the Fantastic Four and no one else, which really undermines the villain's effectiveness. What is so 'fantastic' if the superhero group is not saving the city if not the world or doing something that matters other than saving themselves? <br/><br/>Fantastic four is OK, I would not advise not seeing it but I would suggest to temper your expectations.

The story stays true to the comic yet modernises it just enough for it to work, and the film as a whole isn't bad, yet the major flaw is characters. When I first saw who would be playing the fantastic four, I cant pretend I didn't have my doubts, especially with 'The Thing' but he was the only believable character, Micheal Chiklis plays not only a perfect Ben Grim but a lovable and witty 'Thing' even my other weary resitance 'Julian Mc Mahon' performed well and showed us a side of Victor Von Doom (see the film) we had rarely ever seen even in the comics. Yet My favourite character was turned into a complete joke, where 'The Human Torch' is funny, they just ripped the ass out of him until everything he said came out as a joke, Mr.Fantastic wasn't that bad, not at all, but when faced with a love interest who is far too young or inexperienced to fully play Susan Storm, you can see where problems would arise. Jessica Alba is a wonderful actress, if given the right part, and brother, she was sold up the river for this part, she spends half the film moping over lost love with Reed and then of course strips to her underwear for comic effect, she cannot play such a smart woman, when she comes across as another dumb blonde and as for her relation with her brother, who i might add is the same age as her in real life, well when she tells him off, it is as if she is sucking up to a teacher, not setting an example, so movie wasn't as bad as I expected, but Alba sucked."

","Is this movie great, no, but it is fun, well sporadically at least.<br/><br/>I had the privilege of watching the extended cut, and I prefer that over the original theatrical release. <br/><br/>I do in particular like the cast, most of them. I do like Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic. I thought he did a suitable job showing Reed that he is indeed a very intelligent smart man, but doesn't have a clue on how to maintain a stable relationship with his girlfriend Sue Storm, as he always over-analyzes everything. <br/><br/>Speaking of Sue Storm, she's kinda mediocre. Jessica Alba is often bland in her performance overall, but there are few moment where she can deliver quite effectively, but she cannot deliver one the cheesiest lines in the film in the confrontation between Dr. Doom that was horribly delivered and just took me out of the movie. <br/><br/>Ah yes, our villain, Dr. Doom, the Marvel Universe's biggest and most baddest baddie(on Earth at least). What a waste of opportunity here. A big letdown on this horrible inaccurate portrayal of Dr. Victor Von Doom. What's really upsetting is that Julian McMahon could have been a great villain, but a paper-thin script and poor characterization here completely ruins that opportunity. I will compliment the overall physical look and his costume in the film. It was quite impressive. <br/><br/>The two highlights of this film and what makes it entertaining are Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis as Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm. They outshine the other cast member and are faithfully portrayed just like their comic-book counterparts. Compared to the theatrical cut, they are very under-utilized and the film rather focuses more on the boring romance between Reed and Sue. The extended cut goes just a little deeper on their characterization. In a way they both have the best overall emotional arc within the film, Ben learning to accept himself and Johnny learning to mature and not take advantage of his powers. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is the choppy storytelling and poor execution. The film spends most of it's time on these five people discovering their abilities and figuring out what to do with them, which is great and interesting, but that only works so well in short amount of time and in little douses. But here it's pretty much the whole movie and in doing so we're stuck with a forced climax that feels very rushed and very half-assed. <br/><br/>Being a big Fantastic 4 fan, this movie is disappointing, but it isn't without some redeeming qualities. I do hope the next reboot will do some justice even though I'm very skeptical about it. <br/><br/>Overall though this movie is harmless, yes it is with it's problems, but there are decent character moments in the film and scenes with some cool use of each one's abilities. Some of the action set pieces are fun to watch, and at least this film knows it's not taking itself too seriously for the most part. <br/><br/>Pure eye-candy. Nothing more. <br/><br/>6.2/10"
"Wuchakk","7","3","5","11 March 2014"," Good Film Depiction of the Fantastic Four
","I own FF comics from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking forward to this film version.<br/><br/>The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as ""Mr. Fantastic"" (giggle). As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.<br/><br/>What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555! Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.<br/><br/>What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heroes is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.<br/><br/>Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker ""the Invisible GIRL"" is even poked fun at.<br/><br/>Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.<br/><br/>In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and nonthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps force me to lower my rating.<br/><br/>Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy joke-fest. People must understand that the FF are a colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, the movie is a fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains essentially serious.<br/><br/>One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing the film has received. ""Fantastic Four"" is every bit as good as ""X-Men"" which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate a fine comic film? If ""Fantastic Four"" came out in 2000 before ""X-Men"" it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.<br/><br/>So many people rave about how great ""Spider-Man 2"" is, and it is a well-done superhero film, but what about the stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as ""Spider-Man 2"" is, it is not without its flaws.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film version of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy it. If not, why are you reading this?<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","it has been some time this movie has hit the screens. after the recent adaptations of Thor and Captain America, i watched this movie again and felt it deserved a 2nd sequel. With the exception of Alba who had to dye her hair and wear contact lenses, the rest of the cast was almost born to play these roles. the story is believable and has the right dose of humor, action and emotion, while the producers and technicians have done a great job with a relatively low budget. in addition, the soundtrack is well done and the costumes are amazing. the movie overall is very entertaining and it is a pity they stopped the series. i wish there could be more movies like these."

","Fantastic Four is one of the better superhero movies of all time. Everything is nearly perfect, if not perfect. This film centers around four people and one villain who's been hit by a radioactive storm. They discover that they have superpowers because of the storm. Now they have to deal with the media and the public, discover how to be normal again, and defeat the evil Victor Von Doom. I think that the acting is fantastic. Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd, and Chris Evans were awesome. I liked Evans the best because he is arrogant, funny, and snobby. The special effects were great. The script was very decent. I liked the music in this film. I recommend this to people over 8. I rate this film a 10/10."
"mets1688","1","17","50","30 June 2005"," Worst movie ever!
","I saw this movie yesterday at a free screening and I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed. This is one of, if not the worst movie of all time. From the moment it began until the second it finished I found myself in pain because of how bad it was. The dialog was much cornier than anything I've ever seen, its worse than in the love scenes between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman in star wars. Things that weren't supposed to be funny were. The only way I can envision someone actually paying to see this movie is to see Jessica Alba. Without her it would have been much worse (if thats possible). The only other positive that i can draw from this movie is the human torch. He had his moments. I would rather see Gigli, Daredevil, Electra, Artificial Intelligence and You Got Served all in the same day than to see this atrocious movie one more time. Bottom line is you couldn't pay me to sit through the fantastic four again."
"indigol","7","20","61","28 June 2005"," Someone left the Fantastic out of the Four...
","Take one of Marvel Comics best super-teams and basically throw out the basic guiding principles that made the Fantastic Four a good read over these last 40-some years and that is what you end up in this film adaptation.<br/><br/>Granted one had to change a few details to get all the players changed as quickly as possible, but fans of the comics are sure to cry foul that the origin of the classic Dr. Doom is tied with the creation of the Fantastic Four! Fans of the comics know that Dr. Doom never worked with Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) in the same organization. The well know origin of Dr. Doom starts off when Reed and Victor van Doom are together in college. Victor gets disfigured in an lab accident that he believes that Reed interrupted. Victor heads out in the world to seek more power than mere science can give him and he discovered mystical powers and takes the armored form of Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>This film throws Victor into the same accident that caused the Fantastic Four to be created.<br/><br/>But instead of getting disfigured, this Victor von Doom is merely scarred and yet he goes around wearing a metallic mask without the rest of the famous body armor of Doom. The whole presence of this Dr. Doom makes people laugh, where as the original Dr. Doom was considered by many as one of the top ten most dangerous villains in the Marvel Comics universe.<br/><br/>The strange mix of CGI and non-CGI proves a bad combo in this edition of the Fantastic Four! Mr. Fantastic, the Human Torch, the Invisible Girl/Woman are represented with CGI powers.<br/><br/>But the Thing is merely an actor in makeup and unfortunately looks more campy than someone that should scare the normal populace or be any real threat.<br/><br/>Not up to par with the kind of effort that the previous Marvel Comic films, Spider-man or the X-men received!!! Fans of the Fantastic Four may want to rent this one..."

"lepermessiah-1","10","4","8","11 December 2005"," A Great Adaptation, Characters were almost Perfect, all around Great Film!
","For everyone that has not read the comic books, I will briefly explain some things. First of all, the main complaint I have heard about this film is that it's too campy and family-friendly. The Fantastic Four have always been the ""sitcom"" of the Marvel comic book universe. The characters are supposed to be goofy, out there, and over done.<br/><br/>Johnny is an arrogant, self centered hothead. Hence, he becomes the Human Torch. Reed is constantly pulling himself in every direction, to the breaking point in most cases. Hence, he becomes super-flexible: Mr. Fantastic. Sue Storm always felt ignored. Yeah, I know. Jessica Alba is hard to ignore, but Reed pulled it off, didn't he? She felt like the one person she wanted to see her... didn't. Hence, the Invisible Woman. Finally, the big, strong, tough guy - flying ace becomes a monster. Ben was always the sweetheart of the group. He always had the softest heart. So, by becoming a gigantic stone monster, he can protect that which he loves the most: his family.<br/><br/>This movie was everything it needed to be. It was entertaining, it was fun, it was great to watch. I couldn't have asked for anything more from this movie.<br/><br/>If I had to nitpick one thing, I'd complain about this: Dr. Doom's voice is not supposed to sound like Victor VonDoom. Dr. Doom is the iconic villain of the Marvel Universe. He is supposed to have a presence of fear that can be felt as soon as you see him. Julian McMahon was perfect as Victor, but bad as the voice of Doom. That was my only problem with the movie. Other than that, it was great. 10/10."
"nemolacuna","3","4","8","8 December 2005"," A total sellout hack job...
","Everything about it was one-dimensional and campy. In fact, certain scenes seem to exist only for product placement courtesy of Pepsi and Espn. The movie lacks any realism or complexity whatsoever and is rather more like a cartoon adaptation that usually goes straight to video. I never saw Catwoman, but this is the worst adaptation of a comic I've seen.<br/><br/>I totally don't understand the positive reviews I see posted on here. They have to be from the studio, because they sound like targeted reviews meant to appeal to certain tastes. There is just no way people could have found this movie that good. <br/><br/>It's a stinker and completely unremarkable."

","When I was a kid, Marvel Comics were my faves. The names of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were almost magical to me. And yes, I read, and liked, the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>FF were different from a lot of comic book heroes for a number of reasons that were well depicted here in the film.<br/><br/>First, and maybe most obviously, there were four of them. Instead of a single powerful character, like Superman or Batman, we had a group of Four. It has been remarked again and again that the TV show Friends was distinctive in the same way: a breakthrough comedy in which an ensemble of 6 equal characters are ""the Star"". Well, FF was in many ways like Friends: a super ensemble.<br/><br/>Second, the heroes were all so very human. Lots of very human foibles and weaknesses. That comes through very well in this film.<br/><br/>Third, the experience of the heroes is more important than the heroism of the heroes. This is conveyed by the film very well. When Sue Storm steps forward in the space station to look out over the earth from high, high above, we see her face reacting like ... well, like almost any of us would react: astonished, grateful, delighted. The scene is very unoriginal, yet it's set up with flawless adherence to the spirit of the situation, and we are conducted with a true story-teller's love of story through the brief but telling scene.<br/><br/>Similarly, the *experience* of gaining their new ""powers"" is conveyed with humor and authenticity and who among us can't feel the same sense of adventure and terror and horror and fun that our heroes experienced as they grew into their new selves.<br/><br/>The *pattern* of correspondence and discordance between new powers and character is very striking. Two of the Four gain correspondent powers; two gain discordant powers.<br/><br/>Correspondent are Johnny and Ben. Johnny, fiery, rash, brash, hotheaded, becomes the Torch. Ben, strong, rough, gruff, becomes the powerful Thing.<br/><br/>Discordant are Reed and Sue. Reed, the intense and flexible scientist, becomes ""Stretch"", sending his body into extraordinary feats of relaxation and flexibility. Sue, the extraordinary beauty, finds that her most salient power is to become invisible, her beauty hidden from even the most piercing eyes.<br/><br/>All four of the Fantastic Four ""mesh"" in ways that tell us that the Four who related with balance and humor before the Great Change, will continue to relate with balance and humor after the Great Change.<br/><br/>Finally, to embed the new experiences of the Fantastic Four in the heart of New York, with tributes to the NYFD and NYPD clearly reminding us of these heroes of 9/11, is to help universalize the transformative experiences that they, and we, have undergone. No one has planned for the changes that have taken place: yet all have labored to accommodate those changes and make them part of who we are as we experience ourselves, and our life, on a daily basis.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the distinctive gifts of the Comic Book world: to help us see life in broad, bold strokes, so that we are forced to lift our eyes above the dust and grit and see the big picture, the big themes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is a two-edged sword. Comics are cool, but their broad strokes cloy and tire and ultimately bore very rapidly. The movie could have been half as long as it was, and I would have been well satisfied."

","OK, before I begin I suggest that all the people who gave good reviews to Fantastic Four (FF) to sit down, have a coke and shut the f@*k up. This film is one of the worst films I've seen in my life, its way down there with Solaris. Where to begin with this one, there was so much junk, bad story lines and unbelievable coincidences it boggles the mind. The fat lady who lives next door could have directed a better film. Like The Thing's wife, there's all the boys (FF) out on the middle of the bridge saving the fire department from certain death and bad CGI. How did she manage to be front and centre for the whole giving back the ring scene? S. Storm had to strip down to get the others up front, why? and how? If I was Doom id just surround myself with a couple of rows of news reporters to guarantee safety. Good IL' Stan Lee played the best roll and showed us his day job as the postie...Good job Stan. Between Disastrous CGI, HUGE plot holes, BRUTAL acting, SICKENING U.S. patriotism and UNBELIEVABLE Coincidences I give this film a 1 as I'm not given the option of a negative number. PS. I actually just joined this web site to warn other people (cinema victims) of this garbage :("
"mcshortfilm","1","4","8","26 July 2005"," Its Fantastic For Morons
","the Fantastic Four was one of Marvel's longest and most successful running comics. Unfortunately this movie killed it. Maybe this film was not guaranteed any success because the popularity of this comic started sagging over the years. What we get here is a desperate attempt to make an old team of heroes come across as slick, sexy and hip. Man are they hip. You get to see the Thing sport a nice pair of Nike's. Great product placement. In fact, this movie is loaded with so much product placement that I had a hard time distinguishing it from an actual commercial. The Burger King billboard so beautifully displayed behind the action. The American Express line ""catching one of your friends looking silly...priceless."" Yes, these subliminal ads should'nt matter. Its the movie that counts. Right? This movie is so desperate for attention that it needs to sell you a Whopper and some Nikes in order to make you happy. The characters are awful. They act like puppets from a reality show. Where's the depth and complexity? Hey, I know its superheroes but who says you can't have a serious superhero film? Remember Christopher Reeve as Superman? these guys are not even from the same world. They belong to an American Gladiatiors event sponsored by Mountain Dew. What does Stan Lee care anyway? He's got a couple of other comics he can destroy on the big screen. They're just hot cakes waiting to be sold. That's what this is. Money hungry, blockbuster hits with nothing underneath."

How much more money do they want before they start creating something new?<br/><br/>In Fantastic Four we see the story from the comic (and cartoons) a little modernized then filled with special effects and splashed on our screens. Cool effects, of course, but what about the story?<br/><br/>I always felt that F4 was one of the weakest comic books. The characters were phony, the dialogues silly, the story unbelievable. While the movie does more towards the acceptance of the script and fixes the dialogues a bit, it still feels silly.<br/><br/>Therefore I will conclude that it is a good movie for its intended audience (10 year old boys) but beyond that it's just a special FX extravaganza."
"dreamwrthy","6","4","8","17 July 2005"," Plot holes anyone?
","Why in the world were the makers of this film in a rush to end it at 1 hour 46 minutes? Another 20 minutes and this could have been a great flick instead of barely passable.<br/><br/>Notes to the film makers: Spend two minutes telling us what world we're dealing with here, i.e., is having a space station with a gravity well STANDARD? Do test pilots and hot corporate directors routinely go into space without training? Think GATTACA or Minority Report. We're given an idea of what reality the characters are living in, therefore we can acclimate ourselves and have our belief suspended.<br/><br/>Could they have spent five minutes showing us Victor telling ""his people"" to bug Reed's lab? There just happen to be cameras there? Huh? Could they NOT have rushed from Ben feeling oh-so-alone to ""heh, I'm okay with this after all?"" For all the moaning he did, he embraced his condition quite quickly after that. I know, I know, he wanted to help his best friend, Reed. And speaking of that.....<br/><br/>Did anyone else think it was WAY to easy for Victor to convince Ben that Reed was stalling his research to hang out with Sue? I was under the impression that Ben and Reed were best friends...you'd take the word of your ""enemy"" over what you know about your best friend? Huh? And could the filmmakers spent 60 seconds showing Victor's people trying to FIND Ben when Victor says ""bring him to me."" What, he can order him like take out and ""poof"", he's there? SUPER big issue here.....Reed is MELTING on the floor of his lab, then Victor is there? First, Reed really needs to get his spare key back from Vic since at least twice he walks in without so much as a pause. Second, I understand Reed passed out, so a) how did he get back into his bed and b) did Sue go deaf and blind? Reed may have been passed out in bed while the bad guy was in his lab, but Sue didn't notice all the lights shooting out of the room ....lights bright enough to be seen from across the city but not noticeable from within the same building? Could the filmmakers have spent a minute showing us, I don't know, a soundproof room with no windows? Just my thoughts, kids. Had some nice moments, but ultimately lost me."

I enjoyed watching it. It is certainly better than Daredevil, but that doesn't take much.<br/><br/>I will be eager to see the next Fantastic Four movie. Sure, this one could have been better. Dr. Doom could have been more impressive. I think this movie had flaws, but they are of the nitpicky variety. I think they captured the spirit of the FF pretty well. There were things that weren't explained well that you might get if you read the comics, and there are some things that might be a letdown for fans of the comics. But even Spiderman had moments where I thought they got it wrong."
"jwoehr","7","4","8","9 July 2005"," What movie did Roger Ebert see ?
","I was gonna listen to the bad reviews and not see this movie. That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just was way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disappointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like. <br/><br/>I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work. <br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does OK too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisible compared to his love for science. So she gets invisible powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literally goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off. <br/><br/>Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powers as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job crossing over from TV to film. <br/><br/>When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and use their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic! Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies. So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast."

","Going into this movie I thought it would be awful,but I was wrong.It was a great,fun movie.<br/><br/>This story starts with five scientists going into space to examine a cosmic storm.They get to their space station and begin to prepare for the storm,but the storm comes early and their shields are down and the storm hits transforming the five into:Mr. Fantastic,The Invisible Girl,The Thing,The Human Torch,and the evil Doctor Doom.<br/><br/>To start it off the story was fairly good,the only real problem I had with it was they changed a few minor details from the comic,but none of them were big enough to destroy the movie.One thing I really loved is how well they took the comedic aspect of the comics and transferred them to the movie.I also loved how quickly the story moved which made it feel like only an hour long,but one of its strongpoints is also one of its weakpoints.The movie sometimes moved so fast you missed some stuff.My only other problem with it was that I wished the final fight was longer because it was so cool.<br/><br/>But every thing else was spectacular.The directing was great,and so was the acting(especially Gruffud,Evans,and Chiklis).The sets,props,and costumes all looked spectacular,and so did the special effects.If this movie didn't have such good special effects it would have fallen flat on its face,but it didn't.The score was also really good,although it had no real memorable theme it was real good and it fit the tone and mood of the movie really well.<br/><br/>All in all it was a great,fun movie that everyone will enjoy.If you just see one movie this weekend go see the Fantastic Four,this movie rocks!<br/><br/>A great: 8/10!!!!"
"jenwrks","6","4","8","10 July 2005"," anti-climactic flamer
","The Fantastic Four<br/><br/>I will start this off by saying that I have never read a single Fantastic Four comic book. In fact, the only comic books I've ever read (Marvel, anyway - Barbie comic books don't count) are Superman and Wonder Woman. So I didn't go into this movie ready to tear it apart for not following the comic like I do with the Harry Potter franchise. Why did I see this movie? Well, I had a free ticket and there wasn't anything else that came out this week. Plus, I like Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon (from Nip/Tuck). However, Jessica Alba's character in this movie reminded me a little of Halle Berry in the X-Men films: she's pretty but she gets all the horrible lines. Too bad for her, because nobody will ever know if she's a good actress. But the script was funny - a lot more funny than I expected, and I actually enjoyed myself while watching this movie. I really liked Chris Evans (The Human Torch), but I have one comment - I know he says ""flame on"" when he activates his power, but I SWEAR he said ""FLAMER!!"" the first time. No one I have asked has agreed with me, but I don't care. The action was good, especially the first scene where they demonstrate their powers. Actually, that was the only really good action scene, thus making the film rather anti-climactic. When they finally ""defeat"" (and I use that term lightly) Dr. Doom, they heat him up and cool his body rapidly so he freezes. Now, if it were me, I'd make sure he'd never come back and would saw his head off or something. When I mentioned this to my movie-going companion, he was shocked because Dr. Doom is apparently ""the best comic book villain ever"" and they would never kill him off that easily. Of course they wouldn't - they're probably going to make a sequel... Sigh... But then again, no one in comic books dies the way they ought to. But honestly, there isn't much I can really say about this movie - it was one of the better comic movies I've seen in awhile, and it (thankfully) wasn't boring and the love story wasn't long and drawn out like the one in Spiderman or Daredevil. It was good, even though Michael Chiklis' wife was an absolute BITCH for no reason, Jessica Alba was pretty but not much else, Mr. Fantastic was more creepy than cool, The Thing was funny but smaller than I expected, and the whole movie was anti-climactic. What I liked? Johnny Storm and Dr. Doom - granted, they're good looking, but that wasn't the only reason, I promise. Good script though, even though I would have liked to see some bigger stars in it - Come on, how funny would Samuel L. Jackson have been as Dr. Doom? Matt Damon as Mr. Fantastic? Julia Roberts as The Invisible Woman? Johnny Depp as The Human Torch? The Rock as The Thing? Tell me that wouldn't have been awesome.<br/><br/>Rating: B-"
"mls-11","4","4","8","9 July 2005"," Fantastic 4 Less Than Fantastic
","My wife & I just returned from seeing this film. From the outset, we recognize two things as true: 1) we had never heard of what apparently is a comic book series of the same name, and 2) based on trailers, knew it would be a 90 minute release from brain function.<br/><br/>Beyond a relatively shallow (but expected) story, one can easily dissect the characteristics of each major character role. Victor has always been second-best; hence, his overgrown ego. Sue is a stereotypical shallow ""Barbie-type."" I suspect young males (obviously the target audience) might find her physically attractive, though we certainly find her facially unappealing. Richard is entrapped in his career, and has difficulty connecting with life outside the lab. Johnny (Sue's brother) is a perpetually 12 year old boy - totally irresponsible and shallow. This is also a most unfortunate-looking person from the neck up.<br/><br/>The only seemingly ""normal"" character was Ben. We were struck by his plainness - his simple persona - his love for a significant other. It was also great to see Michael Chiklis again, though this film and role were beneath him. We agree that he probably chose to do it as a professional lark or to do someone a favor.<br/><br/>Special effects and graphics were, overall, pretty good. Some select items (photos, for example) we're obviously contrived. Of course, one cannot be too hard on a movie that should not be taken seriously; after all, it's an electronic comic book.<br/><br/>There were some amusing parts of the film, and that's always a good thing. For spending $13.00 (tickets, popcorn and soda) for 2 adults, I believe we got our money's worth. Do see the film if you 1) follow the comic books OR 2) enjoy action-type films OR 3) just want to escape from the world for 90 minutes and not use your brain. It's kind of a fun trip."
"antibland","5","6","14","10 July 2005"," Von Doomed from the start
","Back in the 80s, when I was just a wee tot, I loved Marvel comic books. In my rotating spindle of Marvel favorites was Fantastic Four. Although the characters had stupid names (like most Marvel characters) and rather obvious personality traits, I frequently enjoyed reading about the fab foursomes' big adventures. Today, almost twenty years later, I found myself wading through the previews to see my old favorites take a stab at the silver screen.<br/><br/>The movie starts out pretty much the way it had to: scientist seeks information; scientist goes into outer space to find it; scientist gets roasted by cosmic, er, rays; scientist acquires cool new powers. The scientist is Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), and he brings along Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her brash brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), and the inimitable Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Also along for the ride are Jessica Alba's boobsbut more on them laterand then a few more times after that.<br/><br/>Once the group arrives back from their cosmic ray encounter, they all soon develop their new powers. Reed can stretch his body to pick up falling glassware, Johnny can light himself on fire and brag about it, Ben is permanently transformed into a large rock (with matching rock organs), Sue can show her boobs at super-human frame-rates, and Vic Doom can become the worst, most uninspired actor our generation has ever seen. In fact, Julian McMahon's performance alone is bad enough to significantly lower the rating of this movie. After his investors pull out on him due to the botched space mission and Reed starts giving Susie (Doom's sought-after tail) the old elastic stallion, Doom becomes angry. To show how angry he is, he begins killing anyone he comes in contact with, including his exshareholders, his doctor, and even his doorman, by siphoning the power of metal and turning it into electrical kill waves...or something. Deviating from the comic book, Doom finds himself literally turning into metal and does what anyone would do in that situation: forge a metal mask to put over his already galvanizing face? That would be like a vampire buying a pair of fake vampire teeth to wear over his real vampire teeth.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ben Grimm is depressed because his girlfriend Debbie (Laurie Holden) finds him hideous and terrifying yet battles her way (somehow) through a mob of police, fireman, and countless burning vehicles to give her exstud back his engagement ring. If she was so repulsed and terrified of the newly transformed Grimm, why wouldn't she just mail the ring back to him? And why did she look so angry when overdramatically placing the ring on the ground? It's not like Grimm turned into a big rock in order to ruffle her feathers; in your face, future! Grimm eventually finds solace in Alicia Masters, a hot blind chick (right) who falls for his craggy exterior.<br/><br/>Johnny Storm is young, brazen, and driven for fame and fortune. Evans does a good job with the character and uses his energy and chiseled physique to squeeze out a few laughs and gasps throughout the movie. More impressive than Evan's portrayal of Johnny Storm was his chemistry with Chiklis. If he wasn't playing some amusing practical joke on the big lug, he was finding some other way to harass his mammoth buddy. Unfortunately for the rest of the movie, that's where the chemistry stops.<br/><br/>Reed and Sue were one of Marvel's alltime couples, two people madly in love with each other. Sadly, Alba and Gruffudd show all the chemistry of chunky peanutbutter and rotting salmon. In her pursuit to get Reed to notice her breasts, she comes off as cloying and clingy throughout the entire movie. Gruffudd's conservative motivation to portray Reed Richards as a nerd more focused on his books than on Sue's torso comes off as far too understated and caused my attentionspan to shrivel like a tulip in a steamroom.<br/><br/>In case you haven't heardit's trueJessica Alba has nice boobs, an attribute she's been directed to shove in our collective corneas every possible second of this film. ""Sue, go invisible to get through the crowd!"" orders Reed in the first of many action sequences. Off come Alba's blouse and pants. Conveniently for those in the audience obsessed with Alba's knockers, Sue hasn't yet gotten a firm grip on her big, juicy, voluptuous powers, so she tends to fade in and out of invisibility. Yes, there are her boobs againthis time in Lingerie! I didn't mind seeing the boobs once in a while (who wouldn't), but at a certain point, I felt that the director was using her tits as anchors for our drifting attention spans. Yes Tim Story, I'm talking to you. If you had more confidence in your own directorial skills, you wouldn't feel the compulsive need to tuck everyone inside of Alba's cleavage nook every 3.4 seconds.<br/><br/>Like most of these comic-to-movie translations, I think the Fantastic Four plot line could have been much darker. For every positive point Chiklis and Evans added to the movie, the rest of the cast more than took away. Victor Von Doom, in theory, made a good villainous choice for the film. It's just a damned shame that McMahon carried the role like a leper in a juggling contest. So, is this movie worth 106 minutes of your life? Maybe it is depending on how you look at it. The matinée show will cost you around six dollars. Some simple math tells us that runtime (106 minutes) divided by cost (six dollars) gives us 17.6666667, or the number of times we need to see Alba's breasts for this movie to be worth it. Though I didn't have the foresight to record the occurrences of her extremities, I'd bet that she hit that number easily. Yet, there's another way of looking at this simple quandary: the film is average at best and should simply be avoided."
"dwhughes-1","2","5","11","31 July 2005"," Don't bother
","This movie doesn't even do a decent job of being bad. The flat script, the contrived plot, the brain-rotting ""science,"" the cardboard characters: the whole schmeer is just one great big fused cliché ground out of the Marvel/Hollywood cliché machine. And that's it. From the typography of the opening titles to the point where I walked out of the theatre, I found the film to be dull, hackneyed, laboured, predictable and inane.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis could act, given half a script; Chris Evans is good when he has his shirt off and his mouth firmly shut; The Thing has genuine pathos; and the special effects are seamless and convincing. But these few glimmers of quality are nowhere near enough to redeem the movie.<br/><br/>But hey, maybe I was just having a bad day. In the last third of the movie it picked up: there were thrilling fight scenes, realistic character development, a cathartic climax and an emotional resolution for the lead characters. Or so my companion tells me, but by then I was outside eating pizza."

This movie was painful to sit through, and the horrible jokes that you see in the previews (""Ooh,you're hot"" ""Thank you so are you"") are in the movie the entire time and get much worse than the line above. Almost everything about this movie was laughable it is such mindless humor. The special effects are also not very good and the acting (even though there are very talented actors here) is also terrible.

"tburke85","5","2","3","6 June 2009"," Fantastic Four An Okay Comic Book Movie But Flawed
","Fantastic Four is another movie based on a comic book that's okay but it's not the greatest either. Director Tim Story does an all right job of bringing this film to the big screen but it's definitely no Batman Begins or Iron Man to name a few. Ian Grufford is good as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic but unfortunately he isn't given much to do and his powers aren't that great at least to me compared to Johnny's or even Dr. Dooms. Jessica Alba is admirable and does a solid job in her role as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Chris Evans stands out amongst them playing Sue's daredevil brother Johnny Storm/The Human Torch. The same can go for Michael Chiklis as Reed's best friend Ben Grimm/The Thing. I would have given this film a much lower rating if it wasn't for them but even they can't help this movie as a whole. Julian McMahon is equally impressive as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom but his fight with the Fantastic Four at the end doesn't last long and it ends up being a major letdown. Kerry Washington does what she can in a very brief cameo appearance as Alicia a possible love interest for Ben but her role seems entirely wasted. No offense. The rest of the cast turn in average performances but none of them stood out besides Evans and Chiklis. The special effects to create their various powers were cool but it wasn't anything we haven't seen before and the movie didn't bring anything really new to the genre. The few action sequences in the movie are well executed but they failed to leave an impression even the showdown at the end between Doom and the Fantastic Four. The dialogue isn't the greatest at times either. Overall though Fantastic Four is a decent movie worth seeing once or twice with some action, character development, some humor, and a little romance that make for a somewhat enjoyable movie to watch if you can get past it's flaws first."
"leplatypus","10","2","3","8 March 2009"," Fantastic Moments (DVD)
","Before this one, I saw maybe this movie 10 times but always the space & Brooklyn bridge sequences. Indeed, the youngest son of my friend loved those scenes and kept play-back them while our Moroccan vacations. With the ""Mr. Bean"" show, ""Robin Hood"", it was the movie I put in my luggage. Now, things seem to have changed and those are sweet memories.<br/><br/>In addition, this is a adaptation of a Marvel comics (my longest hobby) and their more familial title, so I get very emotional.<br/><br/>The bonuses are stretched and hot as well, except the music videos, which are definitely Not the marvel way (tattoes guys!). It's a pity that the Fantastic can be marketed like this! The commentary of the cast is really entertaining and shows that they have built a sort of family as well! <br/><br/>As a Marvel fan, I still wonder why the writers can't ""xerox"" the comics. They always are keen to change the stories, and I am a bit disappointed by the Twin Peaks co-creator, Mark Frost, for his treatment of Dr Doom! A kind of robot, with electrical powers we are very far away for the Lavterian monarch, expert in science and magic!<br/><br/>But, the spirit of the FF are here and the cast is perfect! For me, it stands up with the Spidey movies and the first X-Men! If it's the last at the box-office, I suppose the fans were also baffled and don't push it very much! <br/><br/>The same things happen with the sequel from a personal & audience point of views!"
"RurouniTJ","3","2","3","14 September 2008"," A guilty pleasure, but only because of Chris Evans
","I thought this was one of the worst comic book movies I've seen after a long string of passable to exceptional adaptations. It gets plenty of good reviews here so maybe I'm just missing something, but for me the appeal of the comic book movie isn't just in making you believe comic book characters could really exist, but that they could really exist in the same world as the rest of us. My problem with Fantastic Four is that there's enough cheesiness to break the illusion of reality. I never followed the comics, but if you only knew the characters from the movies, you'd think every fight was a carefully orchestrated scenario to make the Four use their powers together as a team. All told, the plot was weak, the characters weren't fleshed out very well, and the acting was pretty poor.<br/><br/>All that said, I do own a copy of it on DVD I bought used for five bucks, and the only reason I own it is for Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. He's the only actor who turns in a really good performance (even Julian McMahon, who I know to be a solid actor from his other work, didn't really impress me here, but I don't think he had very much to work with), his is the only character who comes off as someone you could find in the real world, and he's just too damn fun to watch. By himself he's not enough to save the film, but you get the feeling that if he ditched his teammates and got his own movie, it'd be a lot more fun than the hundred and six minutes sunk into watching this flick.<br/><br/>I like the serious comic book movies out there because they have a solid story to tell and they show people who aren't into comics that it is possible to use the medium to tell a solid story. At the end of the day, I just don't see Fantastic Four doing either of those things."

(nothing like x-men so don't compare).<br/><br/>The story is a little average but what do you expect from a film aimed at children as well as adults? but seriously, fans of the comics should appreciate this title and kids will love it regardless and believe me its a lot better than the rubbish that they made in 94."

It is so bad, it shouldn't be allowed to be shown to anyone.<br/><br/>So, where do I start? I believe that most comic book (and fantasy) movies need a STRONG villain to really take off. This comic book has a great one, and so my hopes were high. However, they miscast Doom, and the character was nothing more than a joke. The acting all around was wooden, there was NO PLOT WHATSOEVER! I was amazed at the ridiculous editing and sound of the movie, not to mention a score that will haunt my nightmares.<br/><br/>And it isn't even that this movie is bad compared to excellent comic book movies (and great MOVIES too, in my opinion) like the two Spider-Mans and Batman Begins. No, this movie is bad on its own, even though it IS laughable that this movie could come out less than a month after Batman and try to win the same audience.<br/><br/>So, to any who have had delusions about paying for this movie (ever in the theaters, to rent, or to own on DVD) DON'T DO IT! Just spend the time (just under 2 hrs?) bashing your head into the wall, and listening to someone scratch their nails against a chalk board. .

"Artist_TRS","8","1","1","21 January 2020"," An Underrated Cosmic Gem
","As an avid fan and reader of the titular comics, 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" is an underrated gem of the superhero genre. You can get plot synopses elsewhere and don't need me, but much negativity since this movie's release has been unjustly aimed at it in my opinion, and there are two frequent criticisms I want to defend against...<br/><br/>Firstly, a lack of action scenes within the film's runtime; sitcom-like family bickering for the majority of it has been a common gripe. I don't understand this though, especially when the Stan Lee & Jack Kirby issues (unarguably the greatest and most significant run for the characters) featured the same argumentative (sometimes petty) yet loving family rapport between the quartet and I believe it was faithfully heartfelt and humorously well replicated in the movie. There's great charm throughout. Additionally, I also believe 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" in contrast to the origin featured in 1961 actually enhanced the believability and natural progression of the reluctance and panic feelings one would have when first burdened with unearthly powers. Much like many 1960's Marvel origins, characters seemed to have too quick readiness to don tights and be a superhero without hesitation. Contrarily, 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" features the quartet desiring a cure to return to a life of normality with a reluctance of becoming superheroes (the only exception of the four is the egocentric Johnny wanting fame). They only become superheroes and don their costumes collectively in the climactic third act when Doctor Doom is a threat to the city that only they have the ability and resources to thwart; the Fantastic Four earn their stripes. The lack of action is justified to build to those moments when it happens.<br/><br/>Secondly, the characterization of Doctor Doom in comparison to his comic book counterpart has been a frequently too harsh criticism also. Yes, and again as an avid fan and reader of Fantastic Four, I would've preferred the tyrannical monarch of the nation Latveria and dark sorcerer he is known to be... but it wouldn't have been suitable contextually in this movie. Aside from being a former classmate to Reed and being neurotically vain to his later scarring, all other characterization has been altered in the movie. But it's okay because it's a different yet fitting adaptation and should be regarded as such. 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" has instead a business tycoon Doctor Doom that accompanies the origin space mission and is affected by the same cosmic energy cloud as the FF are. It acts as a unifying origin for the story and Doom's powers are organic to his body equivalent to the rest. Narratively it makes it simpler and surely lessons the runtime (106 minutes) without a separate branching side-plot Doctor Doom origin to potentially muddle it up, so it's not upsetting to me. Besides, the costume for Doctor Doom is quite visually faithful yet aesthetically modernized, and Julian McMahon's performance is dastardly fun.<br/><br/>Now that my refuting to those common criticisms have been made, in conclusion I want to mention this movie's greatest strength: Michael Chiklis. His performance as the self-pitied ever lovin' blue-eyed Thing was absolutely perfect. He was the Thing incarnate. Especially when it's known of Chiklis' expressed hardships while wearing the cumbersome body suit, fitting of the role he was playing; I have great admiration. The suit though cumbersome for Chiklis, looked incredible not being CGI with design semblance of tribute to the early Kirby look prior to the large brow. Kirby surely would've been proud and teary-eyed of Chiklis' impeccable performance of his character on the big screen. Also, further boosting aspects of Thing's depiction in the movie, Chiklis' gravely Thing voice is not augmented; it's naturally spoken by the actor. And finally, the Thing's character arc is the strongest and deepest of the movie; transitioning from self-pity of appearance to culminating in a selfless act of Ben Grimm's acceptance of the decision to transform back to the Thing permanently to save the team. A trait of a true hero.<br/><br/>To end my wordy rambling, 2005's ""Fantastic Four"" is not a perfect movie, nor the greatest superhero movie ever, but it's a fantastic (pun intended) experience if you don't watch through the lenses of your movie goggles too seriously or analytical. Escapism requires only one ingredient: FUN. Try it; I feel some people tend to forget that simplistic level of enjoyment sometimes. Anyway, FLAME ON!"
"doc4725","6","7","18","8 July 2005"," No. 2 Movie in the Genre
","I have to admit that when I went to go see this movie I was expecting War of the Worlds like suckiness. Tons of hype before the film comes out usually equates to doo doo on the screen, but not the case here. And FYI, this movie is nothing like The Incredibles. Fantastic Four may not be as ""Fantastic"" as some of the reviewers- who I suspect have been paid by the studio to post here- claim it is, but it is definitely not a bad film...and it certainly is better than some other films of the superhero genre. I look forward to seeing what else they do with this series, since the book it is based on was a comic book staple (get it...staple) for so many kids. I'm sure if it does well at the box office this year, we'll be seeing another one in about 9 months or so.<br/><br/>If I had to rank this film it would probably come in 2nd behind the Spiderman series. Arguably the X-men series could also be considered 2nd, it's safe to say the two are tied for the silver medal. The Incredibles was a good movie too, but it's more of a homage to superhero's then a true superhero film. Just to give you my frame of reference here's what I think about some other superhero movies, with the exception of Batman, Batman Returns, &Batman Begins that entire series is garbage. The Blade series was very cool, but not for everyone. Daredevil was too true to the comic book and, as was the case with the book, didn't appeal to most audiences either...but I liked it. Elektra was just awful. The original Superman movies are classics and I love'em. The Hulk was bad...but not as bad as Elektra. Hope that gives you an idea of my perspective.<br/><br/>Digressing back to the subject, this movie is worth the cash. Go see it if you like Superhero movies or are a comic book fan like me. But if you just want a good action flick you might want to pass. However, There are some decent action sequences so you definitely wouldn't be bored, like I found myself being throughout WOTW. And it's not as dark as Batman Begins, so you can bring the kids if you have'em. All in all, decent summer popcorn flick. Not incredible, or stupendous, just a little fantastic (ok, so that wasn't funny either...sue me)."

I was just thinking it was another Marvel movie being made to milk the cow that was developed with Spider-Man and X-Men. It could be that, but in this instance, the movie rocked. It had a perfect blend of back story, action, and personal stuff to work out extremely well. Being a super hero movie, its obviously not Oscar quality movie, but it is perfect for what it is. Everything seems to fit, and the story is believable (to the point that comic books are believable). <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a wonderful viewing experience. If you're expecting this movie to be wonderful, you won't be disappointed. If you aren't expecting a whole lot, you will be blown out of your seat."

As usual there were the big set pieces and decent SFX but nothing ground breaking. There's no ""How did they do that?"" moment. Well, maybe except for The Thing's obviously not-CGI suit, which is a good thing. Michael Chiklis is the best thing about this movie, acting-wise or otherwise. The movie seemed rushed. Lots of continuity problems. Stretching it to 2 hours wouldn't hurt. I guess the studio had to consider viewers's short attention spans. What a shame. After many summers of comic-based movies, you'd think they'd do better every year. At least this movie is not Elektra or Catwoman or Hulk. It wasn't bad but wasn't great either."

She didn't have any theme to her. Not even seeing her undress was redeeming enough.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Mr. Fantastic was lame as ever. He probably had the least character of them all. ""Oh, look, I'm this guy who missed his move years ago and I don't go out and do what I want."" BORRRRING.<br/><br/>And then there's flame boy. Oh, excuse me. ""Torch."" He's all ""I gotta get out of here,"" leaves after watching daredevil biker stunts on the X-Games or something, and 5 minutes later he's there doing motorcycle jumps. I mean, what the hell?<br/><br/>The Thing was the only character that was halfway decent, the best done character in the movie although I still don't know how he would just give up on his wife when he returned to normal. Please. Despite this apparent lapse in good judgment, credit good acting by Michael Chiklis; however, in the end, The Thing couldn't save the movie from the miserable acting by the rest of cast.<br/><br/>The last hero movie that was like this featuring four superheroes who have to work together would be ""The Incredibles,"" and that was a million times better than this garbage. Pitiful and lackluster, this movie gets a 2 out of 10 (out of four-five stars, I'll be nice and give it one). Don't see this movie. In fact, don't see any new movies that aren't Miyazaki or documentary films."

","Without a doubt Fantastic Four is a very entertaining film for most ages. There are moments when it can be dark and intense for very young children and there are a handful of innuendos for the older children (a.k.a adults), but overall it is an enjoyable movie full of action, humor, and some emotion. Without giving too much away, the basic story is five people go into space to study a radioactive wave. Without warning the wave hits the ship and each person gains unique abilities. As the story progresses they learn to use their abilities together in mutual benefit against the forces of evil (played ever so well by Julian McMahon). Much like the X-Men movies there's an element of prejudice and a development of understanding as the film progresses. If you're a hardcore comic book fan who's been disappointed in the comic-based movies thus far, Fantastic Four is probably not for you. If you enjoyed the Spider-Man and X-Men movies you will not be disappointed by this film. It's definitely a summer film set on being a blockbuster though I'm not sure it has as much punch, so to speak, as Spider-Man or X-Men, but it's close. I'll be seeing it again."

","Well, I remember watching some episodes about the ''Fantastic Four'',but I was never a big fan of them,like I was of ''Spider Man'', ''Batman'' and even ''Superman''. That's the main reason why I cannot say many bad things about this movie: I really didn't watch many episodes of the cartoon to know many things about it. The whole reason why Reed Richards,Sue Storm,Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm become the fantastic four was not known to me, in fact.(But I don't know also how accurate this movie is from the cartoon: I am so tired of watching movies being changed from the original plot to a different thing!) I think this movie is a good thing to be watched for all people who enjoy Super heroes and movies with action."

","That right there isn't saying much though. The movie doesn't really follow closely to the comic book at all either. The movie isn't terrible though and when there is action for the most part the film is fun. Especially one scene where The Thing saves a fire truck from following off a bridge and the scene shows all of the different abilities the group has. The movie starts off very slowly with the audience having to listen to this science crap which nobody gives a **** about in the first place. The movie has quite a few of these scenes which may make some sleepy. Everybody knows when the scientists travel to space something bad happens to them only its kind of a good thing. The premise of the film is quite simple: The Fantastic Four must stop Dr. Doom who is a crazy guy who can control metal items. The acting in the film is average about what'd you expect from a superhero film. The action in the movie is the real saving point and really the only reason you should rent this film. Though there are like three action sequences they are well done enough for you to sit through all of the terrible jokes/one liners and what the hell moments which there are plenty of. One includes Jonny Storm going to an X-Games event for no reason or as he says to show off. This scene doesn't belong in the film and should have been deleted. Even with all of its shortcomings Fantastic Four is a decent enough movie that when there is action is top notch. When it relies on story though it just plain sucks. Overall: ***/*****"

","*Warning This May Contain Spoilers* The plot revolves around a group of astronauts, who go up into space but are hit by some cosmic radiation and they get super powers and they must use them against Dr.Doom and stop his evil plans.<br/><br/>This movie (can i even call it that?) is just one bad moment after another, now this is not the first time the Fantastic Four have been made. In the 1994 one (which wasn't even released!) was only made so that the studio who owned it could keep the rights to the film. Now we come to the 2005 Fantastic Four and is it any better, well maybe just a little. But that does not excuse the fact to make a film with such lame time wasters like a snowboard scene and really crap one liners. Like The Thing says to some kids 'Dont Do Drugs'. Well i think that the whole cast and crew were on drugs. Now the action scenes in this are pretty bad, like the last battle scene lasts for like 30 seconds. Even worse they spent nearly the whole movie arguing. This was almost as bad as Batman and Robin. Another thing Doctor Doom sucked, he didn't even put on his mask until the end and he didn't even really do anything, he sucked!

"TheKeeper81","9","4","9","11 July 2005"," A movie with substance...
","Entering the theater, I was rather apprehensive. The movie had been given bad reviews, and I was already rather upset by what, to me, seemed a radical change in the character of the villain, Dr. Doom. But after giving the movie the fair chance that it deserved, I discovered that it truly was excellent, and while it wasn't faithful to the source in the details, the movie was faithful to what I feel is its essence.<br/><br/>What many people need to understand, first and foremost, is that this is very clearly an origin movie, meaning that, in order to truly do justice to over forty-years worth of incredible stories, the saga of the Fantastic Four, as translated into film format, must, by necessity, encompass several movies. This first installment in the movie translation of the comic is exactly what it needs to be: the story of how the Fantastic Four came to be, how they coped with suddenly being blessedand, in certain cases, cursedwith these wondrous powers, and why the arch villain bears such a deep-seated, unquenchable grudge against the team. Because there are so many main characters involved (unlike, say, Spiderman or Batman, in which the entire focus is on one person), this means that a lot of the action experienced in movies such as Spidey and Bats is going to get cut out in favor ofgasp! dare I say it!character development. While this may make the movie seem ""slow"" and ""boring"" for some people who seem to crave constant action and glittering special effects, think how much more awful it would have been if the Fantastic Four went something like this: four people are on a space shuttle, they get ""zapped by cosmic rays,"" discover how cool they're powers are, and proceed to engage in meaningless battle for the rest of the movie against some guy who decides to call himself Dr. Doom. Sorry folks, but if I'm going to pay $16 to see a movie, I demand substance and story, not meaningless violence and eye-candy, especially when said movie is based on the legendary Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>As for the changes they made to Dr. Doom Well, while I still believe they could have handled it a little differently, I can see why they did what they did. Again, because substance and story is so important, but there's so little time to cover everything, they chose to combine Dr. Doom's ""face de-forming"" laboratory accident (which, I believe, he blames Reed for in the comic) with the accident that led to the transformation of the Fantastic Four. (I suppose they just couldn't justify Dr. Doom suffering from injury by the cosmic rays while remaining otherwise untouched.) As to other details pertaining to Dr. Doom: since the first movie is meant to focus on the team rather than the villain, we only get hints of just who Victor Von Doom really is, with the promise, at the end of the movie, of a fuller and deeper exploration into the Lord of Latveria in a later sequel. So, all-in-all, I'm okay with how Doom was handled.<br/><br/>In the end, I would recommend simply giving the movie the chance it deserves before passing judgment. As for my own judgment: it could have been a perfect ten if they had left Dr. Doom alone.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/><br/>While I've pretty much said my piece, I realized I ought to comment on the rest of the movie before I wrap this essay up. So: Personally, I was rather surprised that the movie actually bothered to give a reason for these four people to be out in space in the first place (in the comic, they were just there), and that Sue Storm managed to actually be just a touch more than just wall-paper mooning over Reed and his huge brain than she originally was in the comic (but only just a touch). I was impressed by the development of the relationship between Johnny and Ben, for it was absolutely perfect. (If you've read the comic, you'll understand, if you haven't, I recommend doing so.) I was shocked by the introduction of Alicia in the first movie (I didn't expect her to appear until the sequel), but considering how much depth they put into the development of Ben, I understood it, for Alicia, in both the comic and the movie, provides the emotional stability that Ben needs to cope with his change. Would he have been so willing to remain the Thing if he didn't know that there was someone who cared for him, and not his physical appearance?<br/><br/>Okay, now I'm done!"
"SkyLarkDragonRogue","8","4","9","10 July 2005"," Like anything, this should be viewed on its own merits
","I find that so many moviegoers today are so determined to NOT enjoy a movie specifically because of what they have heard critics saying. Fantastic Four has been lambasted as the Mediocre Four and I find that a tad unfair. For all its faults, this movie does something that very few movies now can do; entertain.<br/><br/>This is not the character study of Spider-Man, nor is it the multi-layered Batman Begins. That doesn't mean that this is a bad film. In fact because it is NOT like those films adds so much more to it. We are given yet another look at comic book heroes in their various incarnations and in interesting scenarios.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone. How often can you say that? Always there is fear that a movie might offend someone but Fantastic Four proved that there are movies worth watching these days."
"fuzzhead72","10","4","9","10 July 2005"," It's not Star Wars, but I thought it was better than X Men
","This may not be one of those movies you can watch over and over like Star Wars, but I found it to be quite enjoyable the first time around. My wife and I watched the 1994 Roger Corman version of Fantastic 4, and having seen what this might have been, I must say that this was a real improvement.<br/><br/>That having been said, I really wish they hadn't changed the origin of Dr. Doom. I subscribe to the Fantastic 4 comic, and I don't understand why they feel they have to mess around with something basic like this. It just makes fans a mite angry deep down. Not enough that I didn't thoroughly enjoy the film, mind you, but with just a bit more work, they could have made us purists really happy."
"The_Orenda","2","4","9","10 July 2005"," I wanted to get into it.
","There's a scene when you see Dr. Doom in full comic book attire that captured my interest. Here he was, one of comic's greatest villains on the movie screen, about to kick butt. That gave Doom some justice. The rest of the movie will not be so kind to you. Throughout your time, the Fantastic Four will complain and talk through most of the movie. They spend more time fighting amongst each other and themselves that it's a wonder that Doom doesn't tear them apart when they finally go mano-a-mano. So the movie totally sucks on all fours. At least it'll stay as true as it gets for fans.<br/><br/>Bankrupt scientist Richards, and his friend Grimm, seeks the help of one Victor Von Doom to finance a project on how cosmic rays affect living material. The three of them, along with Sue and Johnny Storm, take a trip to a space station for some tests, but when they accidentally become the experiment themselves, one of them becomes evil, yet the others become ""Fantastic!"" as the tag line goes.<br/><br/>I felt like the anticipation of the Fantastic Four to be on screen was a huge let-down. Like the Super Mario Bros. movie, it was a huge franchise, with the potential to become a blockbuster, completely wasted. There is no plot to the movie. You are literally forced to believe that Doom, after seeking earlier revenge, goes maniacal on his own accord, throws out common sense and takes his frustrations out on the Fantastic Four? The movie lacks much story and even more common sense, but if you are a comic book fan, by all means, enjoy the movie and draw your own conclusions."
"ChemBrad","9","4","9","9 July 2005"," Better than Spiderman
","I just saw Fantastic 4. I really enjoyed it. My basic take is that it was better than the original Spiderman (which I also gave a 9), but not quite as good as Spiderman 2 (a definite 10).<br/><br/>The humor in the movie was engaging and wasn't as campy as some of the previews made it look. The special effects enhanced the movie without taking over the movie (as they often do in modern films).<br/><br/>If you are a real stickler to the original comic book series, then you will probably take issue with how they got their superpowers.<br/><br/>Anyone who gives this movie less than a 7 is being dishonest. It is a well -made and decent acted film for the genre."
"CGMCC","9","4","9","9 July 2005"," Very well done.
","I have no great knowledge of the Fantastic 4 as they appeared in the comics as that was the time I was getting started in my career and I was too busy. So the movie has to stand on its own. I was half-expecting FX similar to the Hulk, but this was much better! Time was taken in this somewhat shorter film to flesh out the characters to some degree. I did compare Doom to Octavius, of Spiderman, and thought that Doom was slightly more believable. The cast was largely unknown to me, which ended up being a plus. Great blend of drama, comedy, and action! <br/><br/>If this film took any liberties from the comics, then the first Batman must also be zapped mightily for killing off the Joker, as should Superman for skipping Superboy altogether.<br/><br/>Not perfect, but very entertaining! 9 out of 10 for me."

","****Disclaimer---This review written by someone who reads/knows comics. Therefore it will be impossible for the writer to ignore history. It will not be written as someone who was just interested in checking out that new flick with Jessica Alba. Or whathaveyou. End disclaimer****<br/><br/>Let me begin by giving my credentials. 27 years old. Comic book collector (not casual) for 20 years. Movie buff (again not casual) for at least 10 years. My favorite Marvel comic - Spider-man. My favorite DC guy - Batman. Favorite team book - X-Men (particularly Uncanny). Yeah, I know, they were the most mainstream and most everybody's favorite (there's a good reason for that). My point is I KNOW my comics and my movies. <br/><br/>That being said, I loved most of the Batman movies. I loved the X-Men and Spidey movies. I am partial to comic book films, even though I can see the same flaws and have some of the same gripes most other people do. I'm just a little more forgiving than most. I can get past Bat-nipples and George Clooney being miscast as Batman (its better than Matt Salinger and rubber ears - trust me).<br/><br/>I was never a big fan of the FF. That doesn't mean I don't know about them. I've read many an issue of the ""Worlds Greatest Comic."" The films started more different than I was expecting. They almost (wait let me stress that a little bit), ALMOST ruined the origin within the first 15 min. Not ""retooled"" or ""rehashed"" but rather ""ruined."" Again let me stress, ALMOST. So sitting there in the theater I tried to forget what I actually KNOW about the FF. I figured I would have to to enjoy the movie. Wrong. Aside from the near miss at the begging of this movie, most everything else was right as rain. <br/><br/>Reed and Victor's relationship was translated very well. Doom was on his high horse and wanting everyone to know he's smarter than they are. Reed being the ""dumbest Guinness in the world."" Ben's inner angst. Ben's outer angst (this being Johnny). Sue, well, I don't know, she was invisible to me. Johnny's hot doggedness was perfect. <br/><br/>The things (no pun intended) that I really enjoyed the most:<br/><br/>Ben & Johnny - they nailed their chemistry so good I don't think Reed could have figured out the formula. Michael Chiklis was extremely exceptional as the Thing. They couldn't get much more into his inner turmoil in this film. It would take a spin-off to let Aunt Petunia's favorite nephew vent properly. But for this movie, just enough. But their back and forth bantering was great. Flawless translation. Good job guys.<br/><br/>Now for the biggest surprise of the film to me<br/><br/>****spoiler warning (no not really)*****<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd. I was very skeptical of this guy. Of the entire casting selection, this one had me scratching my head the most. I never in a million years would have cast this guy to play Mr. Fantastic. It's a good damn thing I'm not in charge of casting. He started off a little shaky and I think I might have heard his accent slip through a little bit. But I guess about the time they got bombarded with cosmic rays he really turned it around. I mean this guy WAS Reed Richards. Hats off to you Ioan. You've made a believer out of me. Taking nothing away from the rest of the cast, they all did great. The ONLY problem I had with the film was Julian McMahon. Not so much him, but his voice. His voice had no presence. Especially when in full costume for the first time. They should have gone in the Darth Vader direction and let a strong voice do a voice over after he was suited. My recommendation, Frank Welker, who did the voice of Dr. Claw on the old Inspector Gadget Cartoon.<br/><br/>Overall, very very pleasantly surprised. Kudos to the cast and especially Ioan & Chiklis. And to the greatest extra in the history of movies, Stan Lee, Excelsior!!"

","I've got to learn to not get so excited when I see trailers for movies because it seems that one of two things happens: either they show too much of the movie and spoil too much, or, what they show is all of the good stuff. In this case, it's both. For some reason, I was blinded by the bright lights of the teaser, which lead to the trailer(s). With an up and coming cast, Gruffudd, Chiklis, Evans, Alba, and McMahon, I was stoked that the special effects would be the highlight of the film, as there were no high salaried actors in the bunch. With the exception of best known Alba, the rest haven't really established movie resumes.<br/><br/>Gruffudd just played Lancelot in 'King Arthur', Chiklis has done TV and received 2 Emmys for Best Actor in a Drama for 'The Shield' on F/X (a Fox network), Evans did an awesome job in 'Cellular' last summer, and McMahon is another awesome actor from the F/X network, as a plastic surgeon on 'Nip/Tuck'. It was funny to keep hearing him refer to plastic surgery after ""the accident"" in the movie. Chiklis, who likes comic books anyway, was a good cast for the gruff role of Ben Grimm. <br/><br/>All in all, I think the cast selection was excellent, as all fit their roles well, and were cookie cutter personalities from the comic books. Johnny was the cool guy everyone wants to be, Ben was the gruff sidekick that looked out for Reed and was constantly antagonized by Johnny, Reed was more concerned with his work than his relationship with Sue, and Sue was just there to look good. Victor/Dr. Doom was a good bad guy. I didn't like the ending with him, though. <br/><br/>Where the film went wrong, in my opinion, was the writing. The story was just weak. Yeah, it had to have a background, which was fine, but it never really climaxed. It had a few cool sequences, but again, it's all stuff we've seen in the trailers and commercials. Here's where Michael France and Mark Frost are to blame. <br/><br/>To make it simple, I'll spell it out for you: The Punisher and Hulk. And don't forget, Twin Peaks (what a weird series). In addition, if Tim Story is trying to make a directing name out of himself, stepping up to a movie with this high of a caliber potential won't work with writers like this. By the way, Tim Story was the 4th director assigned to this movie. The F/X were O.K., but no ILM. I would have hoped that Fox would have spent more there, than on salaries; I hope they didn't spend most of the budget on salaries. It had to have been the sets, in Canada. C'mon, what was Fox thinking? Story is BEST known for Barbershop, and Taxi? Sad, sad, sad.<br/><br/>I was unfortunately distracted because I was so NOT enjoying this movie, and was looking for continuity errors and ways to make fun of the film. I got a chuckle every time someone said, ""Victor"", referring to Dr. Doom's alter ego. I kept thinking to myself, ""What's your Vector, Victor?"" <br/><br/>Uh anyway, the costumes were cool. I liked The Thing's body makeup. (Why was his fiancé out in the street in a negligee?) Before the movie, you can enjoy the trailer for Transporter 2!<br/><br/>All in all, I'd strongly recommend NOT going to an evening show, and instead, hit a matinée and save SOME of your money. Better yet, wait until about September, and the $1.50 theater should have it.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert!!! (In my opinion, not really, because IMDb already has this noted in the credits, anyway.) Oh yeah, look for Stan Lee, as the mailman. He actually has a speaking role and a real character name in the credits, this time. <br/><br/>Flame off."

","FANTASTIC FOUR is yet another attempt for Hollywood to capitalize on the resurgence of the superhero genre which began with the first SPIDERMAN. This resurgence has been uneven at best with some truly great films and some that are not even worth mentioning. The true greats distance themselves from the not so greats through their desire to treat the superheros as people with emotions and real life concerns that exist outside of their special abilities. Being a superhero is not all that ""super."" It is all responsibility with little or no reward. The great ones exploit this, and the bad ones ignore it. It is here where FANTASTIC FOUR mostly fails. The film seems more concerned with explosions and bad action sequences than real emotion. The human side is explored superficially with Ben Grimm's ""The Thing"" as he tries to gain an understanding of his new and frightening outward appearance, but it does not reach deep enough into his soul to make it memorable. Their are some entertaining moments so the film is not a total wash, but it definitely lacks the depth, complexity, and superior character study of really great superhero films like BATMAN BEGINS and SPIDERMAN 2.<br/><br/>Marc Richardson"

","Just saw this last night at an advanced screening. It's kind of a cheesy movie but does have some nice special effects and really funny moments. If you seen the barrage of comic-book movies lately you won't find much of anything that's original or particularly different in this one. Chris Evans and Jessica Alba really shine in this movie. Chris because he's got great comedic timing and you can tell is really having fun with his. Jessica because she's hot (her acting at times left much to be desired). Michael Chiklis also is exceptional as Ben Grims/THE THING. However Ioan Gruffudd was I think miscast, as Mr. Fantastic, he's acting is way to stiff and boring for this exciting of a movie and I don't think anyone will believe his romance with Jessica Alba in a million years.<br/><br/>All in all Fantastic Four was entertaining and if for nothing else it's worth going to see Jessica Alba.

The film suffers from a villain that isn't developed enough and Jessica Alba as ""Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman"" is very badly cast: by choosing such an attractive woman, the movie constantly looks for excuses for her to strip down and take off her clothes so that she can become truly invisible (since her clothes cannot become transparent like her) and it feels like a pointless reminder that she is in fact, a beautiful actress. It gets tiresome very quickly and feels like eye candy thrown in for teenage boys, when no other elements of the plot seem to be aiming for an older audience.

After saving people in a huge pile up on a bridge the media dub them the Fantastic Four, meanwhile von Doom also undergoes changes as he slowly starts to turn into metal & has the ability to control electricity which he intends to use for his own sinister ends...<br/><br/>This American German co-production was directed by Tim Story & is a film which has jumped on the recent bandwagon for popular Marvel comic book superhero films following the huge success of the likes of Blade (1998), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002), Daredevil (2003), Hulk (2003), The Punisher (2004), the dire Elektra (2005), Ghost Rider (2007) & the upcoming Iron Man (2008) to name but some. While not the best comic book superhero adaptation Fantastic Four isn't the worst in my opinion, I mean a film has it's work cut out to be as bad as Elektra. The script by Mark Frost & Michael France follows the recent trend of comic book superhero films by trying to give the 2-D character's some personality & there's a fair amount of exposition here, a lot of the film is devoted to how each of the Fantastic Four deal with their powers & in particular how Ben copes with turning into a orange rock. This is all well & good but the von Doom angle is put on the back burner for the majority of the film & he makes for a somewhat neglected villain, I never really understood his motivation for anything. The film gives von Doom no more motive than he just wants to be powerful, wow big deal. At about 100 minutes in length it doesn't outstay it's welcome, it moves along at a reasonable pace although there aren't many big action scenes. The human character's are none existent, the clichéd relationship between Reed & Sue is just corny & overall I'd imagine Fantastic Four will appeal to fans of the comic book more than the casual viewer, I mean I don't think Fantastic Four could be enjoyed on the same level of a say Blade or Spider-Man by the average film-goer.<br/><br/>Director Story does alright, although apart from a spectacular sequence set on a bridge & the final confrontation between the Fantastic Four & von Doom there's surprisingly little action here. Packed with CGI computer effects they vary, some are brilliant like when the Thing stands in front of an oncoming truck & it wraps itself around Thing but some are pretty poor like just about anytime Reed uses his stretch limbs. Was I the only one who found the scene when Reed literally slides down the side of the building funny? This wasn't the first time the Fantastic Four had been adapted for our screens, The Fantastic Four (1994) film was made but never intended to be released as if the company who owned the rights didn't make a film by a certain date they would lose them while there have been several cartoon show's featuring the character's. The violence is minimal & is mostly fantasy fighting between the superhero character's.<br/><br/>According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $100,000,000 which is a lot of money so you expect a well made film & it is, although set in New York it was largely filmed in Canada. The acting varies, I though Ioan Gruffud was really bland & forgettable while the idea of Jessica Alba as a genetic scientist is more far fetched than anything else in this entire film! For those who live here in the UK Johnny Storm played by Chris Evans isn't the same Chris Evans who married Billie Piper, has ginger hair & is widely known as a DJ!<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a good solid comic book superhero film, there's plenty of special effects & it's looks nice enough & I suppose it passes 100 odd minutes painlessly enough as well but I thought the main story was a bit lacking & a bit too simplistic while I could have done without all the clichéd sub-plots going on. Good & certainly worth a watch particularly if you like these comic book superhero films."

","This movie was a great disappointment. After the wonderful translations of Spiderman and X-Men to the big screen, I was hopeful that the Fantastic Four would get similar treatment. Alas, it was not to be. Poor casting choices (Jessica Alba was simply not the right choice for the role of Susan Storm and who was that actor playing Von Doom??), a lack of continuity (things happened in the second half which simply made no sense), and a villain whose motives were confusing and nonsensical (was it all really just for money? revenge? if so, for what?).<br/><br/>The special effects were pretty darn good, but they simply sat there because there was no plot to back them up."

","As of late, comic book movies have been really good. ""Batman Begins"" was spectacular. ""Spider-man 1 & 2"" were really good. Even ""The Punisher"" was pretty decent and it's not even one of my favorites. Marvel's comic book franchises have all turned out pretty well on the big screen. ""Fantasic Four"" on the other hand was pretty damn disappointing. Everything about this movie was wrong. The actors were all miss-cast (with the exception Michal Chiklis as The Thing). Jessica Alba is as hot as ever, but this part was not for her. The story was lame, uninspiring and unfaithful to the original source material. The plot is so terribly B-movie and the cheesy love triangle....what the hell were they thinking? The directorial effort here is amateurish at best. The action...what action? Throughout its entire 100 minutes, I counted 2 lame action scenes: the one on the bridge and the mediocre finale. The special effects were terrible. I could have done better on my home computer. The Fantastic Four were Marvel's first team of superheroes (debuting over 40 years ago). Sadly, they also star in Marvel's first big screen disappointment."

","I bought the DVD for Fantastic Four and it was spectacular. Sure not many people considered to be a powerhouse film like Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, or the X-Men films, but it was fun nonetheless. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffurd, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans play the four heroes after an accident in space along with their colleague, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who becomes the movie screen villain. It's up to the four heroes to stop the bad guy from taking over the world, just like most superhero plots. I enjoyed Fantastic Four as now I have another superhero movie in my DVD collection to watch overs and overs again and still have a good time, featuring a great cast and awesome special effects."

","I have to say that the movie was good. I admit there are some flaws that many people would have noticed including the acting. Gruffold as Mr. Fantastic tries to keep steady with his role as the famous leader especially being overly analytic with Science. Alba on the other hand tried but not that well because The Invisible Woman is the one who keeps the team balanced and getting along but ends up being the woman stripping naked in order to get through the crowd. Evans, MY GOD, the Human Torch is known to be a hot head but this guy was a hot head either way, stubborn and stupid. CHiklis did a great job acting as the THing because he showed that being ugly as he is was not easy because heroes come with different looks. McMahon also did a great job being the scheming and very manipulative villain whose intentions are to gain more power. I thought it was good because of the action and the way the whole cast bonds but the way ends was bad enough."

","I would like to start out by saying, I went in to this movie with the biggest doubts I have ever had, not only because of the horrible movie released in 1994, but because lately Marvels movies have been slipping. I hated Daredevil, Electra and Hulk, I hated Hulk more than anything on Earth.<br/><br/>Any way, within the first ten minutes my doubts were destroyed. This movie was more than ""Fantastic"". The casting in this movie was very well done, most of the CGI was great, and the inside jokes that were made between the characters helped to make this more of a movie for comic book fans than just another action movie for ""the normals"". The relationship between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm was almost right out of the pages of the comic, and the interaction between Reed Richards and Sue Storm was well developed as well.<br/><br/>I felt Doom could have stood to be a little more intimidating, but Julian McMahon still did a terrific job. My other gripes are that the CGI used for Reed Richards seemed rushed and looked way to fake. Everything else in this movie looked so good that if you opened your mind to the realm of comic books it was believable, yet Reed's arm, especially in the scene where he reaches under the door, just looks dumb. My other complaint was that it was nothing more than an origin story. Both Spiderman and X-Men had character origins, but they fit in so much more, but this movie was all origin with a small fight at the end. Honestly, it seemed that they still had some fleshing out to do and may drag the origin into the second film.<br/><br/>At any rate, this film was very good and joins Spiderman X- Men and the Punisher in the plus column of Marvel films for me."

This movie was funny, execiting and just plain fun to watch.<br/><br/>But I would be lying if I didn't tell you the best part of this show was Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. He's so sexy you can't keep your eyes off of him when he's on the screen. And it doesn't matter if he's a bad guy or a good guy because you love him anyway. I was halfway rooting for him to win in the end. He is an incredible actor. I don't know if he fit the character of Dr. Doom the way it was in the comics but I don't think it matters one bit. If you can't look at this character and see the ultimate villain you weren't watching the same movie I was. I just hope that in the next movie even if he wears a mask you can see his eyes...because that's where all the action is in Julian McMahon face."

","So America enters a stage of consistently making film adaptations of comic books (Spider-Man, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra, The Punisher, Catwoman, X-Men, Batman Begins...). The question is... where are our classic four heroes that everyone knows and loves? We already took care of Spider-Man and Hulk, but where is the Fantastic Four? Well, here they are. Weren't they easy to see coming? <br/><br/>I didn't expect a very good movie. I'm not a very big Fantastic Four fan anyway. I prefer darker comics such as Batman, The Punisher, Elektra, and so on. I was very disappointed when I first saw the trailer for the movie, because it didn't look very good at all. However, I still went to see it, because I'm a big fan of comic books, and other than Hellboy (which I'm not sure whether or not is an adaptation of a comic, but I heard from someone that it is) I have seen every Marvel & DC movie that has been released since Spider-Man (which obviously is the film that started this comic madness). I was actually rather impressed. It wasn't all that, but it was much better than I expected. <br/><br/>Doctor Doom's character was played with an awesome dark and sinister quality, which I believe was the highest point of the film. All four of our lost and confused heroes are played with excellence and brilliance, especially Johhny Storm/The Human Torch. He was very funny, and that helped brighten up some of the very few moments that got too slow-paced and a bit boring. <br/><br/>I also liked that the movie both possessed innocent and illuminated qualities such that Spider-Man did and also dark and murderous qualities similar to how The Punisher did (as Doctor Doom unreasonably murdered an approximate total of five civilians). <br/><br/>A good movie if all you're looking for is a good movie to watch while mouthing down a delicious bag of buttery and salty popcorn. If you're looking for excellence and near perfection, then it is not a recommendation. It still somewhat holds my original expectations of being a disappointing movie, but since it was much better than expected, I did like it. <br/><br/>7/10"

","I never read any Fantastic Four comics, so I cannot tell if the director followed with the comics or not, but all I can tell after watching the movie is that it's better than any MARVEL comics inspired movie that I'd seen (that includes Spiderman).<br/><br/>The story has been intricately plot, and makes the characters certainly much better than the cartoon series, if not the comics(which I don't know about). The four guys plus Van Doom, their sponsor, go on a space mission to study human DNA better, but that mission goes haywire, as all of them get exposed to heavy radiation of an unknown kind.<br/><br/>Next the story follows, how each of the five come to realize their own powers. Something which gives us more insight on the characters. Special focus is given on 'The Thing' as because of his hideous looks. Also the subtle romance between invisible Girl and Mr.Fanatastic is good to watch, but the action sequences are simply superb. The sequences about dodging the rockets, and the ones between the fight between Doom and Fantastic Four is also very well shot. Torchd is well portrayed as the flamboyant playboy, much like the original story.<br/><br/>After watching the movie in the theater however, I realize that this is again a one time movie, just to give you a break from the monotonic day to day life. It doesn't stick to your heart like other movies. But no doubt it's still a great fun watching it. 8/10 from me..."

No-one considered what should be inside it - just that it seemed a great idea.

It looks so normal and regular b/c the Fantastic Four created the superhero team dynamic. A lot of the clichés of a superhero team were created by this team. Most importantly, it had a strong human dimension, and was well acted as such. If people just wanted a special effects film and not a film w/ strong character development, they should go to something else. Though the action and effects were really good, they were not the film.

","Although there are some rave reviews for this film. I would have given the film 2 ½ to 3 stars at most. In my view why the film was a disappointment is that first there was no real threatening nemesis Dr. Doom was a real wimp of a villain until the ending fight scene, and then it was over much too quickly. Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom's character borrowed a lot from the first Spiderman's villain Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. They both were scientists/entrepreneurs. Both had financial set backs, both sought violent revenge. Fan-4's only interesting characters were The Thing whom had a very strong resemblance to The Hulk, and Johnny Storm who was the latest flame to every hot chick he came in contact with. The biggest disappointment in the film was Jessica Alba's Susan Storm, her constant bickering and overbearing motherly attitude towards her brother was annoying. Reed Richards the so called brilliant scientist and her supposed lover from a far, as far as he could stretch his rubbery limbs was extremely boring. The Fan-4 characters spent more than half the film's time fighting and arguing amongst themselves, which was the film's big waste of time. The film's early bridge action rescue scene should have been what this film was all about the Fan-4 working together as a team, and using their special skills, not spending half the film trying to find a way to abort those skills.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four's scripter Michael France has written recent film hits ""The Punisher"" (great film) and The Hulk. No wonder The Thing was one of more interesting characters in Fan-4. While his older co-writer penned Twin Peaks, Hill St. Blues and one of the real oldie action TV shows circa 1973 The Six Million Dollar Man. With today's inflated film budgets they would have to re-title the film version The Sixty Million Dollar Man. I have no doubt a film version is in the works. I hope that when the sequel to Fan-4 is filmed, that the filmmakers have enough common sense to pit the Fan-4 heroes against strong opposing villains instead of each other."

However cheesy the special effects looked, I was willing to suspend disbelief enough to barely enjoy the film because of how realistic ""The Thing"" looked. Because of the wise choice to use makeup and NOT CGI effects, the result was a realistic ""unLucasy"" believability if you will. Unlike General Grievous, Jar-Jar Binks and the other legions of fake-looking characters in the newer Star Wars films, The Thing looks like he is truly in this world and not on some bluescreened soundstage.<br/><br/>Now if only there were a story. Someone else's review called this film ""The Fantastic Four with Nothing To Do."" That description is accurate. The only plot line is for our heroes to ""not die"" as Dr. Doom attempts to kill them. Even for an ""origin"" or ""setup"" story, any fan off the street who had read more than three issues of the comic as a child could have written a far more interesting story during his/her playtime break during 2nd grade recess. I enjoyed the casting choices, even if Johnny was a bit over the top.<br/><br/>As for the ""humor"" in this movie, if you like the comedian Carrot Top, then this film's right up your alley. If you enjoy ""Hogan's Heroes"" reruns, you'll guffaw outloud. If you consider the 1980s TV show ""Sledge Hammer"" classic comedy and actually used to set the timer on your VCR to record third-season ""A-Team"" episodes, then this film's for you. If you were always confused by the complexity of the mysteries in ""Murder, She Wrote"" then this film's for you. Enjoy! The bottom line: Wait and RENT the DVD. If it's on sale for $9.99 you'll be tempted to buy it and try it out, but only do so if you're prepared to pay $9.99 for a glossy coaster."
"jrat6200","3","3","6","11 July 2005"," Movie should have been more than just SFX and a rushed plot
","I enjoyed the movie as pure entertainment, but nothing more than that. I went into the theater with reasonable to high expectations, but what I ended up with was a rushed movie with no substance. It was very bland and the intelligence factor wasn't present. My perception of the FF4, based on the comics, is a team who exhibits style and aggression on an organizational level, with a little humor added in FF4 style. The comics displayed that flawlessly because that was the point of origin. When being converted into a feature film, execution of the comic idea was only half thought out. I remember somebody on the FF4 IMDb message board stating that the fault of the film's outcome was to blame on the director and crew, but that somebody forgot about the power of Hollywood's studios. You have writers hashing out rushed and mediocre scripts. That is a bore and just plain laziness. SFX don't make a movie, but Hollywood knows that.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story was off from the beginning. Dr. Doom's character was ruined. The studio took one of Marvel's most villainous characters and turned him into a mediocre antagonist. His intelligence and ideas were overshadowed by Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd). Dr. Doom was disfigured in a lab experiment not aboard the same shuttle as the FF4!! Doom is one of the smartest men in the world according to the comics, and he is not easily beaten. I know big screen adaptations don't always follow comic ideas, but if a studio doesn't have enough resources or time, use other options. The mole man villain would've been more suitable. As a matter of fact, the mole man was FF4's first villain.<br/><br/>Bland and cheesy acting performances is what the audience is receiving from this movie. The only two characters that exhibited better performances and chemistry were Chris Evans (Johnny Storm) and Michael Chiklis (Ben Grimm). Just like the comics, these two are always at each other's throats. The film interprets that very well. Jessica Alba was not convincing at all. T&A does not save this movie. The casting director made a mistake with this girl. A more suitable actress with credibility and a little more age would've been better for this film. Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic) worked with what he was given, but blame the unstructured dialog on the writers. Julian McMahon's demeanor was convincing, but again, the writers for the film made Doom's character very simple.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm a little divided with this film. On one hand, you have a very unstructured, weak plot combined with cheesy elements to make a superhero film. And, on the other hand, you have good cinematography with pretty good SFX. Fox studios needs to learn how to combine these elements to make a great film, or otherwise, they will end up with a movie like this. This film was a good idea, but was badly executed. Better luck next time Marvel!!<br/><br/>Final Judgement: *1/2/****"
"mrgrue","6","3","6","11 July 2005"," A worthwhile Comic-book movie
","I just returned from seeing the movie, and I must say, it certainly was not as bad as I've heard it was. The acting came out rather flat at times, and the end isn't as spectacular as I'd hoped given the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an origin story, and does a good job of setting up the characters' personalities and the ""family drama"" that is inherent in the Fantastic Four comics. I would have liked a little more action, I suppose, but I'm satisfied with what I've seen and am hopeful for the inevitable sequel. If you really know the characters and story, you will understand why they weren't quite as fleshed out as they are now in the comics, since this is very early on in the whole story.<br/><br/>I might have given the movie a higher score if Jessica Alba could have acted more like Sue Storm and not someone else (Susan Storm is supposed to be a little more modest. I also sometimes wondered if she put her makeup on with a spatula). The movie fell short of fantastic, but was a fun view nonetheless. I loved Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and everyone else more or less got the characters down pretty well. A Good film, but not a Great one. Worth a watch, especially if you know the story and can perceive the little details they toss into the mix."
"Rathko","5","3","6","11 July 2005"," Perfectly mediocre
","In a long year of bland movies, lackluster marketing and a series of summer duds, expectations are pretty low for The Fantastic Four. Though it's not as bad as it could have been, it's nowhere near as good as it should have been.<br/><br/>The writing is pretty run of the mill stuff. While the script avoids the cringing embarrassment of Daredevil, neither the plot nor the characterization stands out as anything beyond average. There seems to have been a struggle between Michael Francis' desire for emotion and realism, and Mark Frost's popular sense of how to get a story moving. Writing by committee rarely works and the two's strengths cancel each other out. The result is a story that lacks any surprise or tension, populated by characters with no depth or motivation.<br/><br/>A good director and great actors can sometimes save a mediocre script, but here we have neither. Tim Story seems way out of his depth dealing with a movie of this scale. Where there should be no-holds-barred, jaw-dropping spectacle, we have action scenes that play like a rerun of The Dukes of Hazard. Many scenes simply run on too long, the characters are left standing around wondering what to do next, and the whole movie has an oddly sedate pacing to it. The actors struggle to bring life to such lazily written, one-dimensional characters. Nobody is expecting King Lear in a comic-book movie, but a little depth of character and believable motivation goes a long way to make us care about what is going on. Michael Chiklis brings a humanity to The Thing that steals every scene in which he appears, but he has the advantage of having a clearly identifiable 'disability' to milk for emotional effect.<br/><br/>The CGI seems decidedly third rate, as though the project was given to the trainees to do between the priority assignments. It's rare to see something as simple as a ship floating in space look so unrealistic, and the more complex effects, particularly with Reed Richards' stretching, were terrible. Johnny Storm's motion capture was amateurish, close-ups of his face while engulfed in flame being particularly bad. The Thing never looked like anything but latex, and in many scenes you could actually see the rubber creasing at the joints. Its design gave no sense of real solidity and never for a moment do you believe that he is made of stone.<br/><br/>Overall, from the script to the performances to the visual effects, Fantastic Four reeks of a low-priority project put into the hands of individuals who aren't quite ready for the responsibility. Maybe we've finally come to the point where $100 million just isn't enough to successfully pull off this kind of movie any more."
"writergirl182003","9","3","6","11 July 2005"," simply ""fantastic""
","Absolutely amazing. I loved this movie. I""m one that's a HUGE fan of the X-men movies, and I don't think Stan Lee who was an executive producer would let his characters be ruined by poor script writing All of the characters were very believable, and while yes it did slow down slightly after they received their powers, it was showing how they each reacted and coped with getting them. Which I loved about it. It shows that while some characters may enjoy the powers, and get right into using them, others don't like them, and would much rather them be taken away just as quickly as they got them. It provides a more human aspect to the characters rather then keeping them too comic-y.<br/><br/>They way they ended the movie, you can tell there is a sequel in the making. Which I believe will be even better then the first one. It was the same way with the X-men movies. They took their time introducing the characters, the backgrounds, and the powers, and when and if the sequel does come out I believe we'll be able to see more of the amazing powers, and different abilities they are able to do with those powers.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of the Marvel comic."
"ckstrong","9","3","6","11 July 2005"," Exactly what I expected
","This movie was great. The Fantastic Four are essentially a ""family"" trying to figure out how to cope with a life-changing event. They worry about each other and they try to help each other. I found the characters engaging and the dialog humorous. The special effects were well done. Unfortunately, people seem to be expecting mindless fighting and dark, brooding characters. Not every character in every movie needs to be full of angst. This movie showed a range of reactions to the same situation. You didn't have all of the characters getting depressed and sullen. Each character had their own personality and way of dealing. It is challenging to combine action with true human reaction. I think this movie pulled it off great."

Either way, I'd take a pass on this movie and catch it on DVD when you've nothing better to do with your time. The acting is cheesy, and based on the performances it's hard to believe any of the actors have serious acting careers. The story line was spotty and the dialog was something I might have written if I was doing the screenplay. NOT a good thing! I actually found my mind drifting during the show, as the story was failing to engage me."
"oshram-3","7","3","6","11 July 2005"," Surprisingly well done
","Though they have managed to make some good Marvel movies, I'm still skeptical about a House of M film. For every X2, there's a Daredevil; for every Blade, a dopey Spiderman film (yes, I know most people think the Spiderman films are good. Most people are wrong). For years no one could do a superhero movie right, and Bryan Singer changed that. DC upped the stakes earlier this summer with the first good Batman film ever. But could the Fantastic Four  arguably some of the most comic-booky heroes ever created  be successfully translated? I doubted it.<br/><br/>One of the problems with the FF in the comics is that the characters themselves are only moderately interesting, it's just that they have an amazing villains gallery (Galactus, all that negative zone crap, and of course the greatest villain in comics history, Dr. Doom). But the writers of the film were a step ahead of me; they realized that as well, and did their damnedest to make these people a whole lot more engaging than their comic counterparts. And largely, they succeeded.<br/><br/>Having Reed (Ioan Gruffudd, perfect casting), the brainy scientist, be an ex of also somewhat brainy and impossibly sexy Sue (Jessica Alba) was a masterstroke that gives them a fun subtext right away and strips away the need for a lot of exposition. While both Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) are a little simplified, they are both handled effectively as well, from Ben's self-hatred (long a staple in the comic) to Johnny's immature handling of his powers. The four of them blend very well, and display more warmth and camaraderie than they ever do in print.<br/><br/>The film's only weakness is in its villain, Victor Von Doom (still one of the greatest names Stan Lee or anyone else ever came up with  played here by Julian McMahon). Doom is less of his Darth Vader persona in the comics and is really more like Lex Luthor here, a wealthy industrialist slowly losing it while he, like the others, mutates. Doom is never captivating or interesting the way the leads are, which is an ironic twist as its exactly the opposite in the comics.<br/><br/>The movie may be a little loud and a little dumb, but it's also fun and engaging. Johnny Storm's enjoyment of his powers and amused bewilderment at his new abilities jumps off the screen and infects the audience. Chiklis manages to give an excellent performance through a mountain of latex (even though, oddly enough, he looks like Sean Astin in that suit), portraying Ben's wounded side very well. Gruffudd plays Reed to a T  the ultimate dweeb, a science geek to end all science geeks but deep down a really good guy who just wants to help people. And Sue? Well, Sue Storm has always been the least well defined of the FF, and that's no different here. Alba is essentially eye candy, there for the fanboys to pant after, and in that regard she hits the mark perfectly. Sue is fine, there's nothing wrong, but she lacks any strong personality traits (and being sexy doesn't count). I would have liked to see her character developed a little more; she's pleasant but I felt there could have been more done.<br/><br/>Even a relatively lackluster villain can't slow the proceedings down, and FF is surprisingly good. It's fast, it's funny, and it's very likable. I was very surprised by how well it was pulled off  far more engaging (and less stupid) than the Spiderman films. It doesn't take itself as seriously as Batman Begins, but I count that as a positive thing. It probably won't win over any non-comic book fans, but it's not trying to. FF is good summer fun, certainly worth a matinée."
"Tirdun","4","3","6","11 July 2005"," F4 needs a pity point just to make 4 stars.
","I had hoped that Hulk and the last of the old Batman movies would have served as the gold standards for how NOT to make a superhero movie. So many high hopes horribly dashed. Curse Batman Begins and Spiderman for upping the ante if you will, but it seems that some directors and studios understand that a superhero movie should live up to both ""superhero"" and ""movie"". Sadly, F4 does neither.<br/><br/>The characters are as two dimensional as comic-book paper. They do things because the script writing team says they should. The script writers write these things because it sets up set pieces where things explode or the CGI machines get turned on or the *cough* plot is advanced. This all leads to big trailers and tie ins with toys and kids meals. On screen none of it feels realistic in the least.<br/><br/>Why was Spiderman good? Because we empathized with Peter. When he made decisions, we understood why. None of the characters in F4 are people you never care about any of them, so the action scenes carry no weight. There is no growth, no chemistry and groan-level humor is slathered on like whip cream in an attempt to cover it all up.<br/><br/>The villain is uninspired. You felt neither empathy nor fear, his plot to yadda-yadda was yawn and etc and who cares. The goofiest Batman TV show had better villain plots.<br/><br/>I would go on, but honestly if the writers couldn't be bothered, neither can I. If you want a good superhero team movie, I suggest you buy ""Incredibles"". The special features section of that DVD is a better superhero movie than all of F4."

"brikov","7","4","10","6 July 2005"," Decent Comic Book of a Movie
","I had the fortune of attending an advance screening of F4 and left the theater with a smile. Like many comic book movies it suffers from the pacing problem inherent in telling an origin story AND an adventure story. The origin story will be well-known (and therefore painfully dull) to a portion of the audience {even with the changes they made for the movie} but necessary for that part of the audience that is unfamiliar with the material.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best adaptations of a comic book to movie. The actors are perfectly cast, for the most part. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans were particularly great in their roles as The Thing and the Human Torch. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffud and Julian McMahon made less of an impression as there roles were not as 'flashy' as the others. {SPOILERs follow} Which leads to the main problem of the film: Dr. Doom is almost a non-entity. In most of the scenes he appears in it is not clear as to what drives him other than that he is supposed to be the villain. The implication is that he is angry at Reed Richards for damaging his business and stealing Sue but you never understand why this would drive him to murder and destruction. I guess you are supposed to think that ""he is the villain"" and is supposed to go to these extremes. Was he crazy/evil to begin with? Did the accident affect his mind? Compare and contrast with the villains in the Spider-Man and X-Men movies. Or Batman Begins. {This is also undermined by the weakness of the love triangle subplot.} <br/><br/>But, by the time he finally goes into full villain mode, the movie is almost over. Then it ends. Just when it got really interesting and revved up to full speed. {SPOILERS end} It is still a joy for any fans of the comic to see it on the big screen. Non-fans may not have as good a time. Its a comic book movie, people! If you go into it with the same expectations you would a comic (not graphic novel!)you will definitely enjoy yourself. It certainly takes a different path than Batman Begins in following comic book conventions and adapting them to film rather than using film conventions to tell a comic book story, if you can grasp the difference."
"curtis-8","10","5","14","10 July 2005"," Almost Great, but ""third act"" is totally missing!
","The makers of the ""Fantastic Four"" got the characters and spirit of the original comic just right, and the story of how they got their powers and what they do with them once they get them is perfectly in line with the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby classic (The dark-skinned Jessica Alba does look a bit too young for the part, and a bit artificial as a blonde, but I don't think anyone will complain much because she handles the part well and still looks great).<br/><br/>But despite these positives, the screenwriters completely dropped the ball on the ""third act""--what we regular people usually call the end of the flick, the slam bang climax,the part where the heroes save the world from the evil villain through thrilling daring do. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone out there, but let's just say that when the movie comes to its abrupt end, you will definitely feel as though about 20 minutes of action was left on the cutting room floor (or in the screenwriter's trash can). <br/><br/>Ultimately,however, ""Fantastic Four"" is not meant to be heavy like that pretentious, overpraised crapfest ""Batman Begins."" This is a light film, with lots of humor based on the realities of everyday life--more of a ""sitcom with action"" than ""gothic opera with action,"" just as the comic was in the early days. There's not a thing dark about it. And in a way it is refreshing to see a superhero film that focuses almost entirely on likable characters instead of a huge ear-splitting, eye-assaulting cgi end-of-the-world mindblast of an action ending.<br/><br/>Even so, I think most folks who see the movie will leave the theater asking their friends and themselves ""was that it?"""

From what I could gather the only people who liked it who were people age 15 or less and parentals who found parts too funny for their own good. This is one of those movies that you feel five mins into it that it is just going to be a big let-down. Besides combining extreme sports, subtle corporate plugs, a horrible storyline that never requires the characters to do anything cool with their super powers until the end, an all around script that goes for the easy jokes, and a sub-par cast, it just fails on so many levels.<br/><br/>I'll admit, there are some funny parts, but these don't save this Marvel vomit.

I hate to be superficial, but Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch is (at the risk of sounding hokey) incredibly hot! Not to mention the (ahem) fantastic Ioan Gruffud in all his Welsh glory. Jessica Alba is alright, but I don't think she can quite pull off the whole longing-for-Reed-to-make-his-move thing that Susan has going on. Micheal Chiklis, though, was awesome as Ben Grimm.

The sequel should be something to wait for in another 3-4 years."
"livapr99","6","3","7","9 August 2015"," A Fair Enough Adaptation
","As a comic book adaptation, Fantastic Four is average, at best. As a flick that is unrelated to Marvel Studios, it's a premise that could really work and one that could be seen as a fairly decent film. While it is nowhere near to the standard of some of the more recent Marvel movies, it is a fun piece in itself, and to some extent you can imagine that it would exist in the same universe as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.<br/><br/>This is not to say that this film isn't flawed- it is, mainly in terms of the climax (Doom just doesn't feel like a particularly threatening villain or even a real foil to the efforts of the team- more like an inconvenience, really), but it still is enjoyable in some parts.<br/><br/>The performances are actually quite good. Gruffudd is a nice choice for Richards and Alba is more than passable as Sue, but I really love Chiklis and Evans. When I picture the Thing, I can imagine that a man like Chiklis would be playing him, and the same goes for Evans with Johnny Storm. Yes, he's more remembered for Captain America, but he's still great in this role.<br/><br/>The characterisations do make some kind of sense. It's understandable why Ben would have a strong yearning to change back due to his appearance, but it also makes a kind of sense for Reed and Sue, too- they're scientists, so maybe they want to be recognised for their intellects and not their physical feats. While I normally don't like superhero movies where supers complain about having powers, I admittedly understand why they wouldn't really want them here (but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy Johnny's love of his abilities).<br/><br/>The special effects are really well done, especially the Human Torch's ""flaming on"", as it were. I particularly love to see films using prosthetics in the place of CGI, so the Thing's rocky exterior is a highlight for me.<br/><br/>The only real negative for me is the climax. I don't really mind that there isn't a lot of action because, to me, Fantastic Four is a character-driven piece, but when it does roll along, it's a tiny bit anticlimactic. One of the things that irks me about comic book movies (and movies in general) is the whole ""Remember that thing that we said (in passing, a half-hour ago) is probably a bad idea? Well you need to do it now."" It bugged me in Iron Man 2 with the repulsors and it really bugged me here with Johnny's supernova effect. The final fight happens in five minutes, then boom! Doom's frozen and he's on a ship to Latveria. If Doom had been built up a bit more as a threat and not just as a fly trying to get at the proverbial cake, this could have worked. The final fight in Avengers Assemble took about a half-hour and it was epic. When it only lasts five minutes a la Iron Man 2 (and yes, even Thor to a small extent with the Destroyer), it's such a big letdown.<br/><br/>That said, Fantastic Four is a passable flick. Watch it on a flight to entertain yourself or even when it's on the telly- it's not compulsory viewing, but it is a nice little piece that works in isolation from the Marvel mythos.<br/><br/>If you forget that it's a Marvel movie, it's a fine flick."
"The_Void","6","3","7","6 December 2005"," Entertaining comic book fare...but not much more
","I've never been a fan of comic books (never really read one, to be honest); but I do like a good comic book film. The recent ones have mostly been very good - Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins both being great examples of how well comics can translate to the big screen. Fantastic Four has a reputation for being one of the better comic books - given that it's central quartet are reminiscent of a family structure, and how you get four characters instead of the usual one; but despite all that, this movie just isn't as great as I've come to expect this sort of film to be. Probably the main reason for this is that the film puts the focus almost completely on entertainment value, and so it lacks that dark, foreboding element that has made the likes of Batman and Spider-Man such a joy. Not that comic book films need to be dark - quite the opposite, but we never get a look inside the characters either. The Thing is the one who receives the best handling, but aside from a decent expose of how his affliction affects his personal life, we don't get much of his actual character either.<br/><br/>The plot follows a crew of five astronauts who find themselves in the centre of a radiation cloud during a botched mission, and upon return to Earth, find that the radiation has altered their DNA. Four of the five decide to use their power for good, while the fifth goes the other way. The Fantastic Four comprises of The Human Torch; with fire as his power, The Invisible Girl (goes without saying), the rubbery Mr Fantastic and the unfortunate member of the gang - the monstrous 'Thing', who gains great strength to compliment his ugly form. On the whole, I would say that the cast is too young. Michael Chiklis is well cast as The Thing, but Mr Fantastic, for example, could have done with an older actor, who would have brought out his leadership qualities better. The villain, Victor Von Doom is the biggest casting mistake. Julian McMahon, the actor in said role, does look sufficiently menacing - but an older man would have made a far more convincing villain. I noticed that Tim Robbins was considered for the role - I would like to have seen that. The fact that all five of the lead roles have gone to young men and a woman just stinks of a ploy to get more teenagers into the cinema. Anyway, this film is entertaining enough; and I certainly don't dislike it - but unlike some of the better comic book films; entertainment is all Fantastic Four is."
"jqavins","4","3","7","17 July 2005"," Not too bad, but far from good
","First, let me say that I'm not sorry I went to see this movie. I've been to see all the recent crop of Marvel universe based movies and, while some are better than others, I haven't regretted one, and will continue to go see whatever Marvel and the studios give me. Yes, I am a sheep.<br/><br/>All of these movies have fallen, in my humble opinion, into two groups: the really good, and the poor to not so good. Before FF opened, I hoped it would break the monopoly on the ""really good"" group held by the X-Men (1 & 2) and Spiderman (mostly 2.)<br/><br/>Well, we can't have everything we want, now can we? FF is firmly in the middle of the ""poor to not so good"" group. Mildly entertaining. Four stars (no pun intended.)<br/><br/>I won't rehash the plot, as more than enough other commenters have done that quite adequately before me. My complaint is that the story, the script, and the acting for this film are all bland and mediocre, with only two particular exceptions.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it is all extremely straightforward; no twists, no surprises, nothing remotely thought-provoking. Ten minutes into the movie, you know exactly what is going to happen all the way through to the end. The first exception is here: there is one story point (which comes very near the end of the film) that was not altogether obvious until 20 or 30 minutes in.<br/><br/>The acting was almost universally flat. Emotionally important lines had an air of boredom, and joyful lines were merely glib. The second exception is here: there has been much made of Michale Chiklis's performance as Ben Grimm, and it is somewhat deserved. I have no doubt that Chiklis may be fine actor (I have seen none of his other work) but his performance here was second rate. All of second, mind you, no worse. It was a competent, adequate performance which shone only by comparison. (Stan Lee makes his customary cameo appearance, and is perhaps the most animated actor on the screen.)<br/><br/>The script was altogether uninteresting, without exception. Watch the trailer or read the ""Memorable Quotes"" page here on IMDb. It is likely you will ask ""Is that the best they could come up with?"" Yes, it is.<br/><br/>Still, as I said, I'm not sorry I went to see it. And, as I said, I will continue to go see whatever comes out. There has been much speculation that FF2 (or whatever the sequel will be called) will be better now that the character establishment is out of the way. I sure hope that's right."
"adamselene-1","9","3","7","14 July 2005"," Fantastic Four was extremely faithful to the feel of the comic
","I read the original FF comics as a kid in the '60s. Never my favorite, I still enjoyed the sitcom nature of this super-hero family. It sometimes reached too far with the Galacticus character but the core story was always entertaining escapism and - admittedly - fantasy wish-inspiring. I mean, who wouldn't want to be the Torch or even Mr. Fantastic? (And don't get me started on Sue...) The movie captures the parts of the mag that I enjoyed the most. The loving, dysfunctional family - the public spotlight - the fantastic gadgets (Oh, never mind; No Fantastic-Vehicles yet) and the coming-together-teamwork-at-the-last-second which showed what a tight-nit team they really were despite the practical jokes and passive-aggressive jibes at each other.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the mag, or if you're expecting Spidey or X-Men, you might give this movie a 7/10 or even a 6/10. But as a long-time fan who appreciates the source material, I give it a firm 9.5 outta 10.<br/><br/>Make Mine Marvel! and...... Excelsior!"

","This was a very entertaining movie. Sure comic geeks (like myself) will be a little miffed at some of the items that are different from the comic. However, in the grand scheme of things, the core concepts were carried over nicely.<br/><br/>For the average movie goer, this movie will be even better. The movie is no Matrix or Finding Neverland, but it has the right mix of components. The characterization in my opinion is the strongest element of this movie. All of the 4 team members are fleshed out well. Doom could have gotten some more, but for a villain, it was good enough. The action sequences and special effects were very well done.<br/><br/>Invisible Woman: Jessica Alba, though tramped on before the movie came out, did a really good job. She portrayed a strong Sue Storm and her acting skills were fine.<br/><br/>Thing: Perfect Human Torch: The comic relief and bright spot of the movie. Without him, the movie would have been somewhat average.<br/><br/>Mister Fantastic: He could have shown more confidence, but that is the angle that the writers wanted to make-up. Other than that, he was a good character, well acted. However, as mentioned, the character of MF was flawed.<br/><br/>Doom: The intellectual competition between he and MF should have played up waaaaaaaay more as opposed to revenge and being upset over a woman.<br/><br/>Overall: You get people, action, and humor. Perfect summer movie...and it is kid safe."

","Everyone: SPOILER ALERT. . . . .<br/><br/>I saw the Fantastic 4. In another Fantastic 4 forum someone gave it a 7.25 rating. This sounds about correct. I would give the Fantastic 4 a 7.5 rating. The Fantastic 4 was well let me say it fantastic.<br/><br/>Most super hero movie plots have a super hero and a villain. Most of these types of movies start with the superhero acquiring his or her powers, then the villain (who wants to conquer the world) is introduced and the movie ends with a big battle where Earth is saved.<br/><br/>Movies do not have to be this way and the Fantastic 4 happily does not follow this formula. You have the origin story, the villain is introduced who is a bad guy, then you have the battle with the Fantastic 4 saving the day.<br/><br/>Seeing the movie I felt I was reading the comic book. Growing up reading the Fantastic 4 (one of my favorite comics) I loved that the movie stayed faithful to the comic unlike Hulk, Daredevil, Howard the Duck, and The Punisher which are four of the worst movies ever made.<br/><br/>The love story between Reed and Sue was believable. The interaction between Ben and Johny was great. Doctor Doom could have sounded more menacing but if he had a Darth Vader sounding voice we would be saying, ""This was lifted from Star Wars and he sounds like Darth Vader."" The were three great scenes that are priceless. So I do not give them away let me say Ben, Johny, and Dr. Doom are involved in these three different scenes.<br/><br/>The only criticisms I have is Ben's relationship with his girlfriend. I did not buy it.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four has made 50 million dollars so it is a hit. If you want dark and moody go see Batman Returns but if you want good clean fun go see the Fantastic 4. I can hardly wait for the sequel. Since the Fantastic Four live in New York Spiderman should do a cameo.<br/><br/>In parting, ""It's clobbering time!"" <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Jose C."
"leorican","7","3","7","11 July 2005"," Flame On!!!
","I have to say I enjoyed watching this movie even though it was not the action packed, special effects laden, vehicle I thought it would be. The special effects that are present are good if not plenty. The story deals with how these four people ( actually Five if you count Dr. Doom) all come to terms with their new found powers and how they try to cope with the notoriety of it all as well. Be Grimm's struggle is dealt with in a little more detail than the others. The writing is fun and light and doesn't take itself too seriously. The Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm's scenes are some of the best. The best action sequence, which occurs on a bridge with all four characters involved, also is done all in fun. The actors, I felt, are all perfectly cast and I have to say Jessica Alba is one of the most beautiful women I have ever scene and she looks ""Fantastic"" on the big screen. Saying all this its not to say that the movie doesn't have some flaws. The biggest one for me is why the government, FBI, etc... never show up to question, study, etc....these now mutated folks. This could have been a more interesting tale. In final, To me it was like getting to watch a real good TV movie on the big screen because it was written almost as such. And thats not saying its such a bad thing. Again, I enjoyed myself. Viewers can just accept this as a fun introduction to the foursome and should expect the sequel to really deliver the goods as far as special effects and action are concerned....Now lets just hope they do a sequel...with the opening being tallied around 56 million...I think its safe to say a sequel is not far behind. FLAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Great entertainment. Well worth the ticket price. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. The characters are likable. The plot was decent. The movie does not take itself too seriously, and so was fun to watch. No actors are going to be up for Oscars, but all were competent in their roles. The villain was not as villainous as the typical nemesis in the genre, but he made a good first foe. As comic book adaptations go, this is one of the better ones. It far surpasses the Batmans (pre-Batman Begins), the Supermans, the Phantom, Daredevil, the Hulk, Catwoman, and others. I think it's on par with the Spiderman movies. But, it is not as good as the X-men movies. I'm waiting for the sequel!"

","Fantastic Four <br/><br/>Starring: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Juilan McMahon <br/><br/>Genre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/Fantasy<br/><br/>Rated PG-13<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a pretty good movie but the X-Men and Spider-Man movies are a little better but this was better than The Hulk. I did like The Hulk but I still think that movie needed improvement. This movie is based on another well known Marvel comic book about 5 astronauts who go on a space mission and later get caught in a cosmic radiation exposure and they gain superpowers. But only 4 out of the 5 people used their powers to save the world and they are Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), The Invisible Woman/Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), The Human Torch/Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who become the Fantastic Four! But for Victor Von Doom (Juilan McMahon) he uses his powers for evil and destruction when he loses his company and everything else and becomes Dr. Doom! I think this movie could have been a little longer and I think there could have been some more fight scenes and such. But the story of this movie went too fast like X-Men but all and all it was alright. I was glad to see Jessica Alba back on screen again in this movie and her movie before this one, Sin City, because I haven't seen her ever since ""Dark Angel"" got canceled off FOX. Plus I'm glad in this movie, they didn't CGI-ed The Thing because that would have been stupid if they did. Before this movie came out in theaters, Jessica Alba already said that there is going to be a sequel to this movie! Decent overall."
"guyheath","8","3","7","11 July 2005"," Good Action Film That You Can Take The Whole Family To!
","The Fantastic Four was lots of fun and I would consider it a family oriented film. The film makers were able to capture the same fun and family values that the original Marvel Comics Group achieved with the comic book (Get it through your head now; The Fantastic Four are a group that centers on Family Values. Reed Richards is the Father, Sue Richards is the Mother and Ben Grim plays older Brother to Johnny Storm's Rebel-Without-A-Cause attitude). As a person who grew up during the ""Golden Age of Marvel,"" I'm really dating myself here; I really appreciated how well the characters were depicted by the actors and the special effects that supported them. As their first real success comic book, and the team who introduced Spider-Man (See Spider-Man #1), the Fantastic Four were a foundation that Built the Marvel Empire.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis was perfect as the Thing! He'll have you laughing all the way through the film. Chris Evans was a great Johnny StormA bit over the top, but that's how the human torch was/is.<br/><br/>If I had a problem with the film that problem was with the role of Jessica Alba's Sue Storm/Richards and Ioan Gruffudd's Reed Richards. Reed Richards (the successful Fatherly-Scientist we loved in the comic book)becomes Reed Richards the Geek who relied on others for his success??? Sue Storm (the Motherly-Type and pearl of the team) becomes the successful business woman with an attitude more like that of Jennifer Garner's Elektrareally made no sense to me. I guess these characters were written this way to make them more up with the times??? Who knows?? It does not matter, the FF was lots of fun and I can't wait for another film. Maybe we'll get a team-up with The Human Torch and Spider-Man (the original best friends and the foundation of Marvel Team-up) or just bring on the In-Humans or better yet Impy! Great job!!!!"

","I've never seen so many critics so very wrong about a movie. Ignore the critical drubbing -- this movie is lots of fun. It's fast paced, it's funny, and it's well-acted by a terrific cast (kudos to Gruffudd, Chiklis, and Evans, who are pitch perfect). Here's a comic book movie that doesn't bore you with attempts to be Hamlet. It embraces its pulp origins, and goes about its business with sincerity and its tongue firmly in cheek. It's not perfect -- the Human Torch's ""rock video"" moments bring the film to a screeching halt on a couple of occasions and there's a few sequences that don't quite work -- but these are minor gripes. This is a sunny, big-hearted, good-natured movie that kids and adults alike will enjoy."

Boy, I am glad I changed my mind! <br/><br/>Fantastic 4 was great! It's fantastic family fare -- I recommended it to my daughter for her young son (and I am selective about what young children should view.) It was humorous without being campy at all.

What more can you ask of summer entertainment. Like Batman Begins the story takes time to get to the action, but that is because we are learning about each character, who they are and what is important to them.

I was draw into the emotions of the characters, and their relationships. I wouldn't compare this to Lawrence of Arabia, but it fairs well in comparison to Spiderman(1) and X-Men(1). Compared to the Hulk this movie was a Lawrence of Arabia. I thought this was faithful to the comic with only a few additions and changes. I am a fan of the comic, I read them growing up in the 60s and 70s and was impressed. <br/><br/>Only one thing kinda bothers me.

"urbanlegend23","5","3","7","10 July 2005"," Surprisingly entertaining.
","""Fantastic Four"" (2005) Dir. Tim Story Going into ""Fantastic Four"", I had absolutely no expectations, no good ones at least. I thought the trailers made the film look like a cheesy and dreadful mess and I was certain I would completely loathe this movie and it would turn out to be one of the year's worst films.<br/><br/>As can be expected, this movie is not perfect, due to the main problem in blockbusters these days - the script. While there are some witty lines, some great comedic humour and a simple yet effective overall storyline, ""Four"" suffers from some truly awful one-liners. Lines that particularly stuck out in my head after viewing were ""no, LETS!"" from Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman and ""the day...of the FANTASTIC FOUR!"" from Chris Evans' Human Torch. These one-liners will no doubt have the majority of viewers cringing in their seats, instead of on their feet cheering - which was probably the director's intent.<br/><br/>""Four"" also has some strange pacing. Though the movie remains entertaining through it's entirety, I couldn't help but feel that Victor Von Doom (played by ""Nip/Tuck""'s Julian McMahon) came into play too late into the film. He made for a nasty and cool villain, and should've been used more effectively. His sequence where he intends to destroy the Fantastic Four group at the end of the movie is one of the movie's highlights as Von Doom really gets into the meat of the story and McMahon goes all-out, and he plays his part with glee and seems to be having a lot of fun. Since his material is some of the movie's strongest, he could've perhaps been incorporated more into the film's mid-section, though this is a flaw that didn't bother me nearly that much because it was simply just great to see McMahon, one of my favourite TV actors, on the big screen.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, Ioan Gruffudd has never been much of an actor (he was very mediocre in ""102 Dalmatians"" and last year's disaster ""King Arthur"") and he doesn't do much to further his reputation in ""Four"". He seems to flounder under the pressure of his first lead male role, and just doesn't convince as the big-man leader of this group at all. His awkward American accent also gets irritating after mere minutes.<br/><br/>It is thankful that the rest of the cast give much better performances than Gruffudd, McMahon already mentioned as a fantastically evil Von Doom, Alba strutting her stuff looking damn fine and in an enjoyable role as The Invisible Girl. Evans makes an impression with enthusiasm and charisma, and I liked that his younger character saw the upside of these powers rather than showing them as a burden ALA almost everyone else in the film, but it is a shame that time is wasted on his character doing silly extreme sports. They just feel like a way to try and get the attention of teenagers and even though I've never read the comic book in my life, I severely doubt that Human Torch had anything to do with extreme sports in them which was quite annoying.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis absolutely steals the show and gives a sympathetic performance as The Thing. It is a credit to Chiklis' performance that underneath all the (amazing!) make-up, Chiklis still makes this ""monster"" a very humane and likable character, whom we can sympathise with throughout the film. I've never seen Chiklis on ""The Shield"" before but I wouldn't mind seeing him in some more feature films as he impressed me a lot with his role in ""Four"".<br/><br/>I loved the media-coverage side of the movie, which expanded on similar themes in ""Spider-Man"" (""Four"" is quite similar to ""Spider-Man"" - Von Doom is a better Green Goblin), it was a nice original touch in a not-all-that-original-really movie. With Evans' Johnny Storm truly loving the media and lapping up all the attention he can get, while his sister (Alba) truly can't stand and the group overall feels the need to stay locked up away from public, it seems to mirror different sorts of celebrities, which was clever and entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this movie are not quite phenomenal, and there may not be as many as you think. They're not BAD action sequences but ""Four"" also has a lot of comedic material and even (shock-horror!) some character development so the big action sequences come at the end of the film. This is a pretty spectacular final battle against McMahon, with each of the Four getting to use their stunning powers against him. The ideas of the superpowers are utilised to their full potential in both the action sequences and in some humorous scenes (Gruffudd's power in particular - watching him wrap himself around Chiklis and Evans reaction to him reaching under a door and undoing the lock are both very funny). The special effects are realistic while also maintaining a cool comic-book edge throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Coming out, I was extremely surprised, in fact overwhelmed, at how much I had enjoyed ""Four"". I'm still sort of shocked I actually liked it as much as I did seeing as I thought I was absolutely sure to hate it. ""Four"" was more than twice as good as I had expected, making it one of the year's biggest surprises.<br/><br/>8/10"
"sukamenonton","1","3","7","10 July 2005"," Crappy Four, indeed
","There's not much that gets me excited about the film once I stepped out of the theater. Maybe if I were a Fantastic Four comic follower then I might have more appreciation to the movie. But the thing is, I never were and this movie failed to convert me to be one.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is a bad thing that I watched Batman Begins prior to FF. Batman Begins is almost flawless in every way that it sets such a high standard on any comic-book-to-movie adaptation from then on. Granted, Batman Begins and Fantastic 4 are much different in tone. Fantastic 4 is a ""light"" movie that you don't take it seriously (and you shouldn't, BTW). Unlike Batman Begins, You can even bring your young children to see FF without worrying about them getting scared in the theater.<br/><br/>But despite their different tone, you can't help but expect the movie to be at least decent movie that makes you satisfied and excited when you talk about it with your friends on your way home. Unfortunately, it never happened. But that's about it. I never felt sympathy for any of the characters except ""The Thing"" and his inner struggles. The story is extremely campy and over-the-top. There are so many plot-holes and inconsistencies here and there. And I noticed there are even sound glitches and scene editing problems on the second-half of the movie. I know this is not ""Batman Begins"" caliber, but it certainly a below average movie with poor execution.<br/><br/>Moreover, it is a pitiful indication that the movie relies so much on jokes, one-liners, flashy special effects and MTV generation lifestyle to cover up the lack of storyline and depth. Is this an indication of movie-making in the future? The director really needs to go back to the basics: STORYLINE, SCRIPT and other movie-making ""101."" I should have seen it coming. The marketing department spent millions of dollars to hype up Fantastic Four months before its release. We see FF advertisements on TV, websites, radios, movies, posters, electronics (Samsung) pretty much everyday and everywhere. You wonder if the reason they are doing that is because they know the movie sucks so much that the only way they can gain audience is by heavy marketing. Turn out it's true.<br/><br/>So, word of advice: if you wanna watch good comic book movies, skip Fantastic Four. It's not one of them."

","Spiderman 2 remains my champ in this genre but F4 was terrific film and probably more kid-friendly then Spidey2.

Major props to Jose Fernandez and Wendy Partridge... the costume designers who breathed life into 'The Thing'. Ioan Gruffudd turns in a strong performance - the camera just loves that guy.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba isn't going to get any Oscar nods here, she seemed real weak as Sue Storm at first - fortunately her performance picks up steam as the show progresses. No complaints about Chris Evans - he was solid as the Human Torch.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon was a great selection for Dr. Doom. He does a great impression of an infinitely powerful, evil mad-man type. <br/><br/>The film seemed a little weak at the start and finish. I didn't think they really told the story of why the team was heading into space. The final fight sequence seemed a little too quid pro quo ... the Doc Doom of my childhood always seemed to give a lot better then he got. The F4 seemed to dispatch him with relative ease.<br/><br/>Overall - a very good film and I'll be in line to buy the DVD."
"MaximumMadness","6","2","4","21 February 2014"," Despite an underwhelming reputation, the fact is ""Fantastic Four"" is harmless fun that does a decent job at being entertaining, despite not being particularly good.
","Back in 2005 (wow time flies), in the aftermath of other big comic-book films like ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"", Marvel and 20th Century Fox unveiled their long-awaited (and long-time coming) feature- length ""Fantastic Four"" adaptation. (Well, technically it was the second adaption, with the first being a low-budget unreleased B-movie in the 90's, but I digress) General audiences seemed to enjoy it to an extent upon release (at least in the real world, and not the negative-Nancy world of the internet), but critics weren't thrilled at all. And since its release, the film (and it's sequel to a lesser extent) have gained a somewhat mixed (if not even slightly negative) reputation.<br/><br/>So where do I stand on this film? Somewhere in the middle. I can't objectively say that it's a good film, but at the same time... I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the heck out of it as silly entertainment, and still watch it from time to time. It's a very fun, light, simple flick that doesn't take itself seriously, and I think that does give it value. Sure, I like my deep, metaphorical dramas and thrillers... but sometimes I want to shut my brain down and watch CGI, action and silly jokes, which is what this film specializes in.<br/><br/>We follow Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), who convinces his former colleague, the self-centered Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) to allow him access to Von Doom's privately owned space station, in order to study an interstellar cosmic storm that he thinks may be linked with evolution on Earth. Together with his astronaut friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), genetic scientist and former flame Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), and Sue's brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Reed and Victor head to the space station. However, a miscalculation on Reed's part causes them to inadvertently be hit by the full force of the storm, causing bizarre mutations in each person- Reed gains the power to stretch his body like rubber, Susan can turn invisible and create short- lived forcefields, Johnny gains the power of fire and can fly, and Ben becomes a giant rock-like creature dubbed ""The Thing.""<br/><br/>After inadvertently being unveiled to the public during a heroic rescue, they become media darlings, and begin to try and work out a way to return themselves to normal. However, Victor (whose body has slowly began to turn into an organic metal-like substance in addition to gaining control over various forms of energy) slowly begins to unravel, deciding to seek vengeance on the so-called ""Fantastic Four"", before using his powers for other nefarious deeds.<br/><br/>The cast is sort-of mixed, but I do feel they have a great chemistry on- screen, even when all of the performances aren't up-to-snuff. Gruffudd and Chiklis both basically rule the film, both giving great performances that ground the film and make it work. Chiklis in particular, who is able to make ""The Thing"" both fun and tragic all at the same time. Evans (who would later go on to become Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films) does alright as Johnny, but I think he pushes the humor a bit too much and played Johnny a bit too snarky. (Though thankfully he fixed this in the second film) Alba is beautiful, but as in many of her roles, her acting is mixed. She's great in some scenes, but underwhelming in others. McMahon does make for a very decent villain, though, despite a lot of his dialog being nothing but clichés we've seen done before in other films, and he seems to be having a good time being an over-the-top comic-book bad-guy.<br/><br/>The script is where the film sort-of falls apart. It's too much of things we've seen too many times before. It's very paint-by-numbers, you could say. Even though the cast does have a chemistry, the writing just doesn't do them justice, and it definitely does not to justice to the source material. When everything spoken is cliché, and when the ""science"" presented is more laughable than believable, there's an issue. I also took issue with the pacing, and how little actual action there was for what should have been an action-packed movie. (There are really only two ""big action sequences"", whereas most action films have at least 3-4 big action sequences.)<br/><br/>Direction courtesy of ""Barbershop"" director Tim Story is also a bit underwhelming, but at the same time, I can't say it's poorly directed. Just basic. Which I don't find surprising since Story hadn't done anything like this prior. That being said, I do think he has an alright visual style, and his choice of composition, visuals, etc. are fine. Nothing to write home about but fine.<br/><br/>However, those problems just can't stop me from enjoying this film for two simple reasons- First, the cast does have a good chemistry, which is able to overcome much of the cliché-ridden issues with the writing. And second, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and constantly tries to give us fun humor as we see the Four as a family who don't always get along. Sure the jokes don't all hit, but enough do that I found myself chuckling at a reasonably consistent rate. And really, that's more than I can say for many films- this movie doesn't want to be dark and brooding, it wants to be light, fluffy and silly. So I can forgive a lot of the problems, because that is admirable in this day and age. There aren't enough light-hearted action flicks these days, so I found myself embracing this film.<br/><br/>So yeah. Sue me. I enjoy it as a piece of silly, fluffy entertainment, and I don't think it's as bad as it's reputation suggests.<br/><br/>I give ""Fantastic Four"" about an average 6 out of 10. If you want a silly, fun movie that doesn't require too much thought, and has just enough action to keep it exciting... look no further."

The film is like the immature cousin of the marvel world, never taking itself seriously, and knowing that it's tongue in cheek.<br/><br/>And this is where people get confused. It's just a fun movie, they don't waste the film on telling back story and character depth, there's four of them, and the title does class them as fantastic, so it gets straight into the action.<br/><br/>The cast are fine, and do what they have to do well. Evans is the standout, and although Macmohan can do evil, he borders on satire and at some points in the film you almost feel he will say 'quiet smithers, release the hounds' to his aides.<br/><br/>So all in all, this is marvel light for the youngsters, almost a parody, but just gives enough cheese to make it enjoyable."

I was taken by surprise at the fast pace yet very well paced plot. The characters that were so easy to click with and understand and even feel for as the movie went on. The action sequences that looked completely realistic. The witty dialog that kept this movie together! This completely surprised me and I loved every minute! This movie has a few flaws, I will admit, but it's not too violent or bloody and fits well within the PG-13 rating without pushing any boundaries. It's appealing enough to keep even someone who's never picked up a Fantastic Four comic book entertained and enthralled in the story. According to my dad, it also does a good job at keeping the consistency with the comics, with only a few deviations.<br/><br/>This movie might not be dramatic or dark or edgy as a lot of super hero movies are, but it's fun, touching, and very entertaining.

","I loved the Fantastic Four Comic Book as a kid, but I never felt that their origin story really measured up to many of Marvel's Silver Age origins. So, I was a little surprised when I started seeing trailers for this film and it became apparent that the Fantastic Four would follow the origin-story formula for the franchise's first film. I was also a little concerned, and approached the film with low expectations. The film exceeded my expectations, but just barely. It was entertaining, though surprisingly violent considering that the original comic upon which it was based was more in the line of traditional pre-teen/teen oriented fiction than, for example, the X-Men.<br/><br/>Four astronauts working with a somewhat shady ex-colleague in a private experimental venture are exposed to a radioactive cosmic storm which causes each of them to have different mutagenic reactions. Reed Richards become capable of morphing himself into virtually any shape and seemingly indestructible. Ben Grimm becomes rock-hard and incredibly strong. Johnny Blaze develops the ability to control flame and fly, and Susan Storm becomes telekinetic, and can rearrange air molecules to become invisible and to project a shield around herself and others. The storm also has an effect on Susan Storm's boss and boyfriend - the shady ex-colleague - affecting both his business credibility and his body, but to discuss this further would involve a spoiler.<br/><br/>The film depicts the origin and personalities of the Fantastic Four in a manner which is fairly consistent with the Marvel Comic. I was particularly pleased with the casting and writing for Ben Grimm, who is, in my opinion, the most sympathetic of the group. The second half of the film shows them discovering what they can do with their new powers and sets up the emotional turmoil which will characterize the relationships between the four and their adversaries throughout many of their adventures - doing a particularly nice job of depicting Ben's feelings of loss and his reasons for them. The directing is fine, and the special effects are about as good as they could be (though they literally stretch believability quite often).<br/><br/>The talented Mark Frost headed the writing team, which helps to explain why the dialog, pace and plotting were consistently above WGA's usual performance.<br/><br/>All considered, the film does a reasonably good job within the limitations of the original material, which are several. Part of the problem with this material is that it fails to develop a main plot - in the form of a major adversarial relationship - until about 3/4ths of the way through the film. And that main plot is, therefore, subordinated to origin stories and characterization. How the franchise does will, therefore, largely depend on how effectively it uses the characterization in the first film to devise stronger plot devices in the succeeding films.<br/><br/>I have greater trepidations about the second film - mainly because it involves one of Marvel's greatest story lines, and I have not, therefore, rushed to see the Silver Surfer. With the origin story out of the way and the characters built, and great material to work with, the second film ought to be an improvement."

Um.... why did he? He just said ""I'm not about to let you stand in my way"". Stand in the way of what? There was no plot at all as to how he'd thought they'd be a problem to his plan... the plan he never vocalized in any way shape or form.<br/><br/>2) Heroes for causing accidents they started? What? They caused the entire bridge accident scene. Then they were looked to as heroes for.... um...... damage control to their own actions? This movie is one of the biggest worst big budget films I've ever seen. My problem is the script, it's crap, along with the director A little investment in a decent writer would have done wonders for this film.<br/><br/>Most of these actors have a lot of talent and have appeared elsewhere.

"simonparker1990","6","2","4","13 June 2007"," The Distinctly Average Four
","The Marvel Comic Book Heroes are getting snapped up by studios as quickly as they can buy them. Ever since X-Men and Spiderman proved to be huge hits for the individual companies the comic book heroes have had movies made about them y the bucket load. To date we've had Spiderman, Blade, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra, X-Men, Ghost Rider and hundreds more are inevitably on the way. Yet it wasn't until 2005 that the original Marvel superheroes, the ones that many comic book fans hold dear to their hearts, made their baby steps onto the big screen. Of course I am speaking of the Fantastic Four, admittedly until I saw the movie I knew next to nothing about the origins and the story behind the Fantastic Four, at most I knew their names, that was all. What followed after its release was a hell of a lot of disappointed comic book fans moaning about how they didn't get certain characters right. This of course never bothered me, but still I found the Fantastic Four to be a major letdown in almost every aspect. I found it dull, cheesy, not action packed enough and too focused on everything but progressing the actual characters and story itself. The movie left me underwhelmed, yet still sort of wanting a sequel to be made due to the potential of the characters. So with the upcoming release of Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I decided to return to the original movie and see whether it has aged any better. The simple answer is that it now seems a better movie, but its still a deeply flawed one. <br/><br/>So let me first begin with the actual cast of the movie, namely the supposed ""fantastic"" four themselves. I suppose the two main cast members are what frustrated me most originally, Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba as Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Neither of them seem anything above average. Ioan Gruffud has no material to work with, which is a shame as I've seen him in some movies and he's actually a reasonably good actor. But there is no excuse for how pitiful Jessica Alba is. Despite the odd moment where she seems to be making an effort, she generally seems in a daze. Its not until later scenes that I actual began to acknowledge her character, at the start she was so bland it was unreal. Thankfully the rest of the major cast work pretty well. Chris Evans pretty much is the Human Torch, he's cocky, he's arrogant, but he's funny and he has a great personality. Chris Evans was a newcomer here and he managed to steal every sequence he was in. Michael Chiklis also is the best person to play The Thing, a shame his costume looks ludicrous at times, but the performance underneath it is pretty well done. Now is the time to mention my first change of opinion from when I original saw the movie. At first I didn't like Julian McMahon as Dr Doom, mainly because I had been lead to believe that Dr Doom is the very best super villain you will find in a comic book. So when I sat and watched the movie, and realised he'd been interpreted as this villain who was killing people, just because he lost some money and his girlfriend, left me a bit underwhelmed. However after another viewing I came to realise its not the performance that's to fault. In fact he steals pretty much the last quarter of the movie when stuff really gets going. <br/><br/>The actual story of the Fantastic Four is my biggest fault with the film. Its just the fact that after the Four get their powers, we end up standing around for forty five minutes while nothing happens, and I seriously mean nothing happens at all! We get a fun insight into using their powers in regular life, but after that all we hear is The Thing moaning about looking ugly, Reed doing all his quantum physics talk, Johnny being an idiot by trying to be a celebrity and Sue, well Sue frowning a lot. That's it. Thankfuly the movie realises its fault in the last twenty minutes and we get a pretty well executed fight with Dr Doom. It might not be the best superhero fight, but after such a huge gap of anything action packed its nice to see something happening on screen. The opening scenes are a bit rushed, and the bit in space is horribly animated, but the actual story going on is passable for a comic book movie.<br/><br/>The action of the movie is perhaps another one of the movies faults. When the action gets going its entertaining, generally its well executed and we get a good insight into the powers. We see this in the entertaining Brooklyn Bridge sequence, the well filmed scenes in the finale. But apart from those two scenes, there really isn't much else in terms of action. Now this might be seen as a good thing because origin stories are about how the heroes become and learn to be super. But the trouble is this movie tries to focus on entertainment, its lacking in a good script, it hardly relies on its stars to draw crowds in, all that its left to fall back on really is its cheesy humour, which admittedly at times works, and its action sequences. The lack of action sequences just becomes frustrating after a while.<br/><br/>Anyway Fantastic Four isn't an awful movie, and I can definitely sit and re watch it without wanting to kill myself. But the movie is definitely flawed and never lives up to its full potential. I have high hopes for the sequel, the promising trailers and the fact the origin story is out of the way is always a positive. But they desperately need to do a bit more with the storyline next time."
"suzy-60","4","2","4","9 June 2007"," Rotten, but enjoyable, if only for unintentional humour
","I hate to say this about any superhero film, but here it is: This movie's a bad movie. The plot is sedentary and has only two real action scenes, neither of which are well-handled or much fun. The characters are strictly one-note:<br/><br/>Reed Richards: Science dork, bad at flirting Sue Storm: In love with Reed, a lot (her most defining character moment comes when, still trying to cope with invisibility, she ends up standing in a crowd in nothing but her underwear) Johnny Storm: Hormone-addled teen Ben Grimm: Struggling to cope with his transformation.<br/><br/>The plot is stolen wholesale from Spider-Man 1. Johnny Storm spends the entire movie torturing the movie's most sympathetic, human character, Ben Grimm, and never gets the custard pie in the face he so richly deserves. The characters' backstories are alluded to over and over, but don't try and figure any of it out, because it just doesn't work (Reed's bankrupt...and he can still live in a skyscraper, employ devoted servants, and build fancy machines?).<br/><br/>All this said, bear in mind that if you're looking for a quick superhero fix, you could do worse than F4. The characters (with the exception of Johnny Storm) are likable, the plot is simple and satisfying, and there are a few laughs and thrills. <br/><br/>(Warning--the movie's rated PG, but there's some dirty humour and a female character undresses a lot.)"

Fantastic four does not. i think the critics were right the way they criticized this movie. it was just very annoying watching it. i just couldn't wait until it was over. its not that i didn't like the comics, they were fine, but this was just a bad interpretation of it. i guess after 20 years of great super hero movies, its hard to come close to them. still, the acting was terrible and the plot was terrible. don't go to see it. i recommend any of the spider man movies or the first batman movie with jack Nicholson as the Joker. those are quality super hero movies."
"rbverhoef","6","2","4","18 December 2006"," Entertaining enough
","There is something in 'Fantastic Four' I have been waiting for: a superhero who thinks his superpowers are really cool, even calling his new fitting suit a ""costume"". I know that Robin from 'Batman Forever' had the same thought, but he had no superpowers, just a lot of gadgets, a mask and a cape. Some x-men maybe shared the thought as well, but the negativity against mutants made it different there. So, back to 'Fantastic Four' and the reason I bring this little thing up at the start of this review. Although this may not be a flawless entry in the superhero-genre, it is one that has some new ideas. Together with entertaining characters and story, some humor and nice visual effects what can go wrong in a superhero movie?<br/><br/>Nothing really, as 'Fantastic Four' proves. As did 'Blade', 'X-Men', 'Spider-Man', 'Hellboy' and even 'Daredevil'. These films are not flawless but made in the right way, finding out not only how to work as a comic book but also as a movie. 'Blade', 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' all got sequels that were better, showing they had learned. For a first film 'Fantastic Four' brings the right stuff, for its sequel it has to improve. But that's for later.<br/><br/>The story centers around four heroes all with their own power, which they got from radiation while being in outer space. I spare you the details. The leader is Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) who is elastic. His love interest is Sue (Jessica Alba), the invisible girl with some extra powers. Her brother is Johnny (Chris Evans), who can turn into a fireball. Last but not least there is Ben (Michael Chiklis) who has turned into a man made out of rock. He is the muscles from the group. The villain is Doom, once named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMhaon), once lover of Sue, also infected with the radiation. I guess that is all you need to know.<br/><br/>The powers and villain are interesting enough to keep our attention while the human story behind the heroes makes it more interesting than it could have been. I could have done without the love story between Reed and Sua, but you simply got to have it these days. Near the end the film is rushing a little, but they took quite the time to get the story underway. To keep the movie withing the two hours it seems like a wise decision. Further than these things I have little complaints, especially considering this is the first 'Fantastic Four'-effort. If the characters develop and the humor stays the same, we might have something here when the sequel arrives."

","This is the worst Marvel-based film of the 21st century (so far at least...). Although competently made and well produced, with adequate if not good special effects, the film lacks drive and after 20 or 30 minutes of building up to what turns out to be, well... nothing much after all, the viewer is left looking for something to do. <br/><br/>The action sequences are OK but they are few and far in between. Meanwhile, character development seems pointless, as the film fails to raise the viewer's interest in the background and/or well-being of anyone being described. The viewer is left with no better idea of what Reed is all about than they had before watching the film; all the dreary, long-winded ""development"" scenes only amount to a guy that can stretch... <br/><br/>X-men and Spider-man are much better."
"messiercat","3","2","4","17 October 2006"," Fantastic Flop
","I grew up with Marvel comics. At the time, back in the sixties, they were seen as a fresh alternative to the stale old DC mags that were Superman's venue. Marvel burst on the scene with the FF, Spider Man and the X men using truly superior artwork and story lines that gathered a big following. Maybe the people responsible for this nonsensical dud thought they could capture the same sense of wonder, or maybe they thought they could just make a quick buck, but this execrable offering does very little justice to the original comic books. It was easy enough going in to see the target audience - young people who watch a boatload of TV, who expect a lot of noise and are attracted to super heroes. But I suspect even they soon got tired of a super hero saga done on the cheap. Much of what went wrong with this forgettable flick is the way it hints at things but then never delivers, and when it tried to make good on it's premise it invariably fell on it's face. Enough of these insults and I, for one, truly grew to dislike the people I was watching. Seeming like a hybrid of tawdry soap opera, Sentai cartoons and Plan Nine From Outer Space, Fantastic Four tries to distract you from what it really is - just another cheap comic book adaptation."

"yodaccm","2","2","4","25 September 2006"," This was a big disappointment
","I'll go see most superhero movies, and based on their content, I shouldn't have high expectations. But with movies like Spider-man, Batman Begins, and the X-men movies, it has been shown that superhero movies can be more than just entertaining movies, but great films. I suppose my expectations were too high, but this movie was crummy. I'm not too familiar with the Fantastic Four lore, but I know it's probably not supposed to be as dark as Batman or X-men, but neither is Spider-man. I thought there was no depth to the characters, didn't really believe they were superheroes and even the villain, Dr. Doom was reduced to something lame, though I thought that casting Julian McMahon was a good call. Everything about the Thing was a big joke and when they tried to go for something remotely sympathetic towards his character, Johnny Storm would be a complete a-hole and make some joke. Perhaps that is how the characters are in the comic, but if that's the case, then even the comic misses the mark when dealing with such a tragic figure as the Thing. The guy gets turned into a freakin orange rock, you'd figure his friend would have some kind of sympathy. And then the whole thing with them trying to undo their powers, it was like, what's the point. While I'm sure that is a plausible thing to occur, it doesn't really make a good superhero movie. We'll see how FF2 fairs, but I'm not keeping my hopes up."

","And create a retarded baby. This whole movie had generic written all over it. The characters were lame, there was no real chemistry between the characters, and the plot was predictable. When comparing this movie to the comics, the style is portrayed accurately. But honestly, is that a good thing? Daredevil, as demonic as it was, at least had a different darker edge to it. Fantastic Four was just as you'd expect it to be, another generic superhero movie.. Sin City, although the mood evoked was accurate to the comics, had creativity, and that goes a long way. Also, I don't think it was a coincidence that the three characters that did NOT turn into a monster all looked like supermodels. Again, quite predictable. This movie will only appeal to those with weak minds. Oh, and Ioan Gruffudd, I liked you in Hornblower. Thats where you belong, thats where your talent is truly expressed."

","One actually expects these comic book flicks to receive some great attention to detail, story, SFX etc given their extensive popularity but that does not apply in this movie's case. This movie seems to made just for the sake of it. It is small, limited, underdone in most areas and would probably be considered an utter failure in terms of story. Some of the CGI is really really bad and not expected from such a franchise, especially the extending hand CGI. There are too many annoying puns and the dialog is stupid. The fight scenes are pure bull. However if you don't expect anything great and just want to be entertained for over an hour, go see this movie. Prepare to be disappointed if you're a big fan of the franchise though. Having said that the movie does have a lot of positives here and there."

","This should have great. The Fantastic Four aren't the X-Men, but they still have a respectable mythology to draw from. They have the power of the four elements! Together, they can make anything! And there was a space ship! Instead, the script just didn't pop. <br/><br/>The acting was spotty, at best. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis did a fine job; both very believable as sudden superheroes. But Alba and Gruffudd were just phoning it in, and McMahon didn't seem to have a coherent idea of his character. <br/><br/>It had some moments, especially when they let the special effects people do their thing. But it should have been the story of how a villain and a team of superheroes become who they are. While the situation is fantastic, the emotional reality is utterly real. In these days of lone heroes and anti-heroes, telling the story of the creation team gives a film maker an opportunity to explore something relatively fresh. Instead, it was about five people more or less randomly walking through life. <br/><br/>Did like the Stan Lee walk on."

It was very average, which makes the rest of us a lot less optimistic that these kinds of movies can continue.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie feels like a cliché, the villain, the heroes, the situations they land in, and the ending, and that is very worrying, that after only a few years, it is all turning into a cliché.<br/><br/>But its not all bad. Chris Evans works really well as Johnny Storm, adding humour that is not unintentional, and The Thing is equally as good, probably the most developed character in the movie, and a couple of the action scenes are exciting, but the rest of the movie feels rushed, almost as if the director/screenwriter has thought ""OK, comic book movies have these kind of moments, and this should happen"" instead of taking a stab at turning Fantastic Four into something different and original.<br/><br/>Wasted opportunity."

No character was really explained. They were all really generic. Ben Grimm is an angry guy. Johnny Storm is a crazy dude. Reed Richad is shy. Sue Storm is emotional. That's some deep character meaning right there...<br/><br/>The reason the movie didn't get ""bogged down in the origin"" is because the origin was wrong. They made it up. It's easy to zoom through an origin story when you pull it out your rear. A more detailed origin might have made this movie decent.<br/><br/>The movie did NOT probe deeper into the character's personalities. The only character that showed any real progress in the movie was Reed, and his passing his emotional barrier.<br/><br/>I do agree with you on one thing, though. The battle was cool. Johnny Storm looked awesome. On the other hand, the scene where Reed opens the door by sliding his hands under it was absolutely horrid. You think they'd use SOME money to make it look decent; but they didn't.<br/><br/>Worst points of the movie: -Grimm ""changing back"" (and again). -Doom didn't have powers. Giving him powers was lame. -Incorrectly alluding to the original plot (Von Doom's island) makes for confused ""fans"" -TERRIBLE puns and word choice. Like when Grimm says he's ""feeling solid"" -Doom killing tons of people<br/><br/>Best points of the movie: -Grimm telling kids not to do drugs -Johnny getting chased by the missile<br/><br/>These 2 ""best points"" are each worth a point in my book.

They come really close, but he gets interrupted dramatically whenever they almost make him likable. Luckily Jessica carries that plot well enough for both of them."

","As an avid comic book reader and a fussy one at that, I read these and Batman comics with great fascination. This is more than just a movie but a representation of a fantasy story and the spirit it was created in. In my opinion, it is a truly well cast and executed movie, and the technical expertise demonstrated did justice to modern movie-making. From start to finish I found the movie true to the original comic story without losing the fantasy, and every step of the ""transformation to super hero"" stage was plausible and believable.<br/><br/>Movies are escapism and this one does the trick. It reaches out and grabs the viewer into that world. A gauge I use for a great movie is how long I think the movie was when I get out. If I leave a movie theater and feel that I have only been in there for 10 - 15 minutes, then I have seen a good movie. And this was one such movie.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is faultless, and the entire movie is seamless in its execution. The scenes are are stitched together well and the characters are well executed. As I mentioned before, the cast is well chosen, and the way each brings their roles to the audience is another feat well achieved. Great balance in the characters with the personalities being brought to the respective roles making for interesting heroes too.<br/><br/>And the special effects are simply fantastic. Some say too few, but this is setting the stage for other movies, and we are only being introduced to their ""powers"", so the ratio of SFX is totally fine.<br/><br/>An all in all terrific effort and great entertainment. And the question, will I see the second movie - you betcha."
"mr-heyjzol","8","2","4","17 July 2005"," Just like much other Comic-Movies: Great!
","It was about time that Fantastic Four(F4) got his own movie. After Batty, Spidey, DareDevil and some ridiculous movie's about ""heroes"" that doesn't even has his own comic-book(Elektra, Catwoman) I was really excited to hear that F4 would get a movie. Of course, it's the latest 'trend' to make comic-movies, but as F4 was always my favorite comic, I was happy to hear it.<br/><br/>F4 is just like all other comic-movies filled with gorgeous actors/actresses, great special effect and cool villains and heroes. F4 has it all. And also, just like other comic-movies each hero has his own problems with love, each other, blabber blabber. But unlike other Comic-Movies(I mean Batman/Spiderman/Superman) the F4 team doesn't wear hideous mask so no one would know who they are. Okay, little explanation about the story then: <br/><br/>After 4 Astronauts, Sue Storm - Reed Richards - Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm, had an accident in space and are exposed to cosmic energy, they find out that they have special powers. Sue Storm AKA The Invisible Woman has the power to turn invisible and create power/protection shields. Reed Richards AKA Mr. Fantastic is more like the leader of the group and he is stretchable. VERY stretchable. Then, there is Benjamin Grimm AKA The Thing. Well ... he's a ... stone hard thing. And Johnny AKA The Human Torch is the wild pig of the 4 and has the power to turn Supernova, what means he can be as hot as the sun. Throughout the movie, they try everything to get normal but in a moment they realize that these 'powers' are not bad, but they can DO things with it. What no one else actually noticed is that there was another man on the spaceship: Victor Von Doom, the most powerful man in the city (Including a 20 meters high statue with his shiny face). He was also exposed to the cosmic energy but the accident doesn't really ... heroemanize him. Because of the rampage, his company and himself are ruined and of course, he is not really fond of it. He turns into Dr. Doom and tries to Doom everyone who was involved with his ruining, and that is of course Reed Richards, who's idea it was in the first place to go to space.<br/><br/>Blabber blabber...As you see(actually, read ... ) the movie is by no mean intelligent with a great storyline and the best acting. But that's not what an comic-movie is.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is just another Comic-Movie ... and that's not bad at all!"
"Meechigan82","4","2","4","13 July 2005"," Fantastic Four gets a not so fantastic 4
","I went to the film with an open mind even though I heard many negative reviews. I was prepared for the film not to be Batman Begins or Spider-man...you can bet that was the case. This was mediocre at best. I don't feel it took that long for the plot to hit the point where the foursome get their powers but after that I could really care less about Human Torch's antics (he is really that much of a prick in the comics?) and Gruffund's portrayal of Mr. Fantastic seemed a bit dull to me. Michael Chiklis was great as Ben Grimm aka the Thing--probably the ONLY good thing about the film. Jessica Alba was smoking hot and that was about it as Susan Storm. Julian MacMahon as Von Doom seemed interesting--he fit it well but I feel he was missing something--maybe that Latverian accent was needed? Anyways, the movie starts out great in the beginning than dulls down, too many one-liners, the plot than tries to come back and than the climax is quickly taken care of! The ending was very dissatisfying because of how quick it ended. Boom, he's defeated The End. The film fills you up but it doesn't satisfy."
"scheisskopf","7","2","4","13 July 2005"," Definitely worth seeing
","To enjoy this movie, as I did, I think it helps to go in with some idea of what the movie is meant to be. Unlike DC, Marvel has not had a string of shitty movies to make up for: with movies like Spiderman 2 and X2 fresh in memories, they can afford to make the occasional light-hearted, fun money maker. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but it is pretty much intended to make money and not much else. There isn't a serious attempt at drama, only a movie meant to be entertaining. And it is entertaining. To try and make this film into something it's not is to doom it before you see it. Light on character development? By some standards, yes. But it's not meant to be a very deep movie; the only one of the four who really has to deal with a lot is Ben Grimm, and this is handled very well. It is a movie worth seeing (and there are enough comic references to make it interesting for long time fans), and there's no reason to hate it because it's not one critics would love."
"diand_","4","2","4","13 July 2005"," Hollywood 101
","From this you can perfectly observe how Hollywood works. First, we have the screen writing from Mark Frost, best known from the mystery Twin Peaks. So, we have various elements from the writers' handbook that are now familiar: References to God-like figures, a mystery (blind) character called Alicia, a fantasy character called Grimm. I guess the four characters were initially taken from the four elements. Michael France wrote GoldenEye and Hulk, which earned him a co-writer ship here. So we get the nasty boss and dictator (who turns literally into steel) and the Hulk-figure. The director Tim Story, from Taxi, comes along and adds Taxi-humor to this. Everything is mixed and we have a movie that's incoherent but slightly entertaining.<br/><br/>Comic books are usually one-dimensional. In order to translate this to the big screen movies have to add some dimension: X-Men added drama, Sin City used the comic book container to do film noir and this only tries to throw in fun. The science mentioned in Fantastic Four is completely ludicrous except for some basic facts, but that fits the angle.<br/><br/>We have Chris Evans as the new Tom Cruise, and Jessica Alba from Sin City again in a comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>Critics hate this because it is no cinema. They see hundreds of movies and know this does not stand out. The larger public only sees a few movies per month and is mostly entertained by this. So this makes money while getting panned."

I do pay more attention to some reviewers than others. We all have our favorites. Now then, about the ""Fantastic Four""...I came away with mostly a satisfaction overall. Good casting like Alba made feasting for the eyes. Story line seemed short of depth and some of the characters lacked development. FX's were top flight. This is one comic book movie that met the test of fulfilling the essence of the comic book. My wife liked it somewhat more than me. She never read the comics though which I do believe makes a big difference in one's perspective. Costumes were interesting especially ""The Thing"".

"amacmillen","5","2","4","10 July 2005"," Disappointing
","What a sad, sad waste of a fairly talented cast this is. I walked into the movie theater, expecting to see a movie with great special effects, a strong storyline and some interesting characters. Instead, I got slammed with 2 hours of jumbled nonsense. ""Fantastic Four"" is not ""fantastic"" as all the ad campaigns and media hype have made it seem. <br/><br/>You may be wondering: what made this movie so disappointing? A number of things, really. I wasn't thrilled at all when I heard that director Tim Story (Taxi, Barbershop) would be handling this project. I could pretty much tell by then: this movie is a flop. Story brings nothing interesting or valuable to the table as a director, in fact, many of his projects have come out with the flat, hollow tone of this one.<br/><br/>The story is as follows: a formerly wealthy scientist, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his business partner/bodyguard Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) approach ultra-rich old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) about funding a project in space that would examine human DNA and possibly reveal the secrets of ending many diseases. (Reed's logic to this project is just as confusing as the rest of the film.) Von Doom agrees, and he, Richards and Grimm go up into space along with Von Doom's coworker/Richards' ex-girlfriend, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and Sue's hotheaded NASA-dropout brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans). The scientists are up in space when they are hit by an enormous space storm and are exposed to copious amounts of radiation. When they get back on Earth, after recovering from their injuries, they slowly realize that their DNA has been altered, giving them superpowers. Richards' limbs have become elastic/stretchy. Sue can turn invisible and fire force fields. Johnny has become a ""human torch"" who can light fire to himself and fly. And Ben, who was exposed to the most radiation, becomes ""The Thing"", a solid rocklike creature who was superstrength. They must use their powers to go up against Victor, who has turned into Dr. Doom, with steel skin and lightning coming out of his fingers and randomly kills people.<br/><br/>Major Problem 1: continuity issues. After the five scientists are hit by radiation, the ship blows up. How the heck do they get back down to Earth? You basically get a cut from them flying through the air to them down in Victor's medical center, and they're all fine. You can't exactly breath air in space, and even if you could, the fall down to earth would kill you, or you would float around in space forever. It just doesn't make sense. Also, why is Victor so intent on killing the Fantastic Four? Obviously, the failed mission is one of the reasons why his business plummeted, but it wasn't the Fantastic Four's fault. It was a freak of nature: the storm arrived 9 hours early. <br/><br/>Major Problem 2: social issues. This is a comic book movie. We want to see action. 90% of the movie was the ""Fantastic"" Four getting their social problems sorted out. Examples: the scene with Ben and his wife after Ben has become The Thing. At best, it's laughable. Director Tim obviously included this scene to add emotional depth to the movie, but all this scene does is give us another reason to knock another star off this movie's rating. The exchanges between Johnny and Sue about Johnny's behavior are poorly scripted and, frankly, are time wasters. Reed is trying to sort out his feelings for Sue, who never exactly ""broke up"" with Victor, and a lot of their scenes are awkward and unnecessary, too. The only slightly funny and interesting arguments in this movie are the exchanges between Ben and Johnny - they act like a pair of five-year-olds, bringing some laughs. At several points, I thought, ""Yes, finally the action begins,"" but it never happened until the end. And even the end action scene wasn't all that long or impressive. What the director, script writers and editors didn't get was: we don't care about the Fantastic Four's social problems. This is a comic book movie, for crying out loud, and we want to see action...so give us action! In the movie business, the whole idea is ""give people what they want."" The trailers included basically all the action that you're going to see in the movie, so don't prepare yourself for a ""Spiderman""-esque show.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 10."
"rparham","6","2","4","11 July 2005"," Not quite Fantastic
","After several stellar comic book adaptations from Marvel Comics stock of superhero superstars (X-Men, Spider-Man), we are finally, unfortunately, treated to a mediocre entry for one of their A-List, Fantastic Four. The big-budget adaptation of Fantastic Four is lackluster at best, proving to be a slightly diverting, but not tremendously entertaining, adventure.<br/><br/>As with most other comic book adaptations, we are treated to an ""origin"" story for the Fantastic Four. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), a brilliant but bankrupt scientist, along with his friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), have approached rich industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, of Nip/Tuck fame) to fund an expedition to his private space station to perform research on a cosmic radiation cloud that might prove to reveal some information about human evolution. Von Doom agrees, although he demands that he keep most of the profit from any financial gains that the mission might hold. He brings along his assistant, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), a former love interest of Reed's, and her brother, hothead Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), who is the mission pilot. Shortly after arriving at the space station, it turns out that the calculations about the storm's trajectory are off, and it arrives earlier than planned, bathing the crew in radiation.<br/><br/>Upon returning from space everyone appears to be unaffected at first, but shortly thereafter, they begin exhibiting some strange symptoms, and each quickly discovers they have been granted a unique ability from the storm. Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band, Sue can become invisible, Johnny can immolate himself and fly and Ben transforms into a giant made of rock. Von Doom, who was protected behind his station's shields, doesn't seem to have been affected at all, but his symptoms simply take longer to manifest, and he quickly realizes that his body is transforming into an organic metal that can store electricity and then return it in the form of lightning bolts. Reed determines that he must try to reverse the storm's effect on them, but not before the world is introduced to their existence thanks to an happenstance traffic accident that they are able to help out with. Thanks to this exposure, the group become media celebrities overnight and are dubbed the Fantastic Four by reporters, although some of the group meets this newfound fame with trepidation.<br/><br/>If Fantastic Four has a key problem, it is that the members of it's group are woefully underdeveloped. Much like X-Men and X2, there are almost too many characters to adequately juggle for a two hour movie. As such, most of the group gets short-shrift. Reed comes across as a shy, socially inept geek, but we don't see much beyond that superficial exterior. Sue Storm is developed even less, she is memorable only because Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, on the other hand, make something of an impression, even though they are also not completely fleshed out. Johnny is entertaining in a juvenile, annoying sidekick kind of way, and he provides a great deal of the film's comic relief. Ben has the most interesting plight of the four, shunned by his girlfriend because of his looks and having to deal with the most difficulty with his body (elevators won't rise, chairs and silverware break when he sits). The screenplay develops Ben best of the group. Finally, Von Doom turns out to be a bland, uninteresting villain, who is evil simply because he is narcissistic. That is a good start for a bad guy, but there is not enough meat on the bones to create much dislike for him.<br/><br/>Aside from underdevelopment, Fantastic Four suffers from a rather limp script. The film just sort of meanders its way along, never developing much excitement or interest. For anyone looking for action, this is not the film to see. While hardly a requisite for a good movie, action scenes are well used in both Spider-Man and X-Men, but are rather wanting here. The visual effects are a mixed bag also, most being impressive, but some at times some come across cheesy and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, nobody embarrasses themselves in the film, but there is little that is outstanding either. Chiklis turns in the best performance as Ben Grimm, giving the character the appropriate amount of pathos. Chris Evans is also effective as Johnny Storm. Sue and Reed are about as bland as bland come, adding little to the mix. Julian McMahon is underwhelming as Victor Von Doom, proving to not be a memorable entry in Marvel's rogues gallery of villains.<br/><br/>In many ways, Fantastic Four is the antithesis of X-Men. Where the X-Men is an allegory for racial bigotry and the X-Men are viewed with fear, Fantastic Four are in the center of the spotlight because of their abilities. There are some interesting ideas that could be introduced with this concept, but the script doesn't do much with it, although it is nice to see the outside world react to the discovery of these unique individuals in a way that seems to be realistic for our current day and age.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Four is a very weak link in the Marvel film chain. We can only hope that the next entries for X-Men and Spider-Man don't follow suit."

","As most, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four comic books. I went in to this movie with a lot of baggage. That said, I did enjoy this movie, but it fell short of making me care about all of the characters. Johnny Storm was spot on, as The Torch was very funny, playing the character to the hilt. The Invisible girl was good, and I think they did a pretty good job with the Thing (although at times he looked very rubbery). Reed Richards was my major disappointment. They failed to capture a charismatic super-genius who was able to take a leadership role, no matter what superheroes were around or what situation developed. They made him fumbling, bumbling and not believable at all.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie. They just never developed the story to the point that I felt the world was at risk and in need of saving. Dr. Doom was not a result of the same radiation and some kind of metal superhuman.... he was a vain man with a tremendous intellect trying to take over the world. Where was that??? Go see it. Just leave your expectations at the door and accept it as you should, a chance to see your childhood superheroes in ""real"" life.<br/><br/>Easy."

","Fantastic Four movies are not perfect. The last attempt to bring the Fantastic Four to the big screen resulted in the film being unreleased. So, another attempt was made in 2005 (and later in 2015) and people did not really like the film. While a flawed film indeed, this film managed to do what the earlier Corman film could not. This film tells a better origins story where four people go into space and get super powers. This film does not have the campy feel that the Corman film had. While the action scenes were good, there was not enough action. Most of the time the Fantastic Four are doing anything else but saving the day. Dr. Doom is OK. He is not over the top like in the Corman film, but has a darker, more evil side to him. The special effects are mostly CG and most of them end up being too fake but not on the level of say Sharkboy and Lavagirl. The effects were good for their time but have aged terribly.

"drystyx","7","0","0","6 May 2007"," Very true to Marvel comics and lot of upside
","Whenever you see a movie which so many people hate or love so much, the truth is somewhere in between (usually). for this one, the hate mongers are pretty much in their own little world, and whatever they hate is too personal for them to describe, because this movie was extremely true to the comic book (for the most part), it was entertaining, action packed, and focused on the characters. Quite frankly, though I'm not an ardent fan, I can't find fault with this film. The comic book Fantastic Four focused on the characters even more than the powers. The genius Reed who can stretch his body as if there were no bones, but like the blob of the movies; the Invisible Woman, his wife Sue, the glue who keeps them together; and the rivalry between the superstrong grotesque Ben and the Hollywood fireball Johnny Storm. The movie doesn't deviate at all from these characters. Like the comic, it focuses on them. The comic book had several bad guys who fought them. And as in one famous comic quote, there is no law against trying to take over the world, and the Thing's famous response ""that wouldn't do much good against Galactus, though. He don't want to take over the world, he just wants to eat it."" Since Galactus was the most interesting of the villains, and Annihilus the second most, and then there were still the Frightful Four, the Mole Man, the Molecule Man, and others more powerful than Doom, a lot of people may have wanted them in the movie, but Doom was the personal enemy of Reed and his three friends. So the first movie would have to deal with Dr. Doom. And since the comic book was also famous for exposing the vast differences in character between the villains, one movie would not do justice to the comic. It will take several movies. For instance, while Doom was famous for being a psychopathic sort who mistreated those loyal to him, Annihilus would be rewarding for his yes men, and Galactus would merely place them where he thought best like an emotionless business syndicate. The Fantastic Four is about characters, and about mistakes, real live mistakes, heat of the moment decisions, and what they can cost us, and how Reed would realize his mistakes and try to learn from them. The movie covered that, and gave us the appeal of Grimm and Storm, whose antics made the comic even greater. This movie falls into place. In time, it may depend upon the sequels to give it a higher rating."

The story takes a different pace from when the characters start to deal with their new abilities, the film gains in humor and action, and finally the personality of each character start to match with what we know from the Comic books.

Obviously, you still will find some ""holes"" in the remaining scenes, most of them due to the lack of personality in the direction work and/or plot, but nothing to worry about, as the terrible ones you find in the beginning.

","This movie is a really solid first outing for a future franchise. The film spends a lot of time laying the ground work for future movies, and while it is not entirely faithful to the comic books it is a great rendition. Let's face it, in the original comics, Sue was wimpy, with very little to do, it wasn't until later incarnations when she really gained power. The heart of the story has always been the human Ben Grimm struggling to come to terms with the Thing, and trying desperately to fit in. The movie and more importantly Michael Chiklis do an incredible job portraying this angst. Chiklis work is extremely powerful, and all the more impressive when you consider the costume he's wearing and the limited range of facial expressions it permits him. The movie gets the edgy banter/rivalry, love/hate relationship of the Thing and Human Torch down perfectly. Chris Evans is surprisingly capable, if one dimensional, as the Human Torch. Jessica Alba's performance was solid if unspectacular, and her lack of emotional range seems to hold back the performance, but she manages to give Sue, far more strength then the comics ever did. This is a Sue who is competent, and knows what she wants. Ioan Gruffudd proves that he really can act with a Reed Richards who is a hesitant brainiac, again unlike the Richards of the comics who never questions either himself, or his role as a leader.<br/><br/>The effects work is good, although a little less then spectacular. Clearly no one had any idea of what to do with the space storm at the beginning of the film. The effects for the heroes, the Torch and Mr. Fantastic in particular are very good, and the suit works well for The Thing, retaining the feel of a comic book drawing.<br/><br/>I wish the director had moved things along a little quicker, and that the confrontations with Doom had been more action packed, and longer. But again, this movie was designed to set the stage for everything that will follow. As with the X-Men, I'm sure movie two will have more action, and be quicker paced then movie one was. As it is though, they have done justice to a comic book I loved as kid."

","OK, first things first. I am not a movie critic and don't play one on television. I really don't like them and, on more than one occasion, have strongly disagreed with what they have to say. I regularly read the reviews of all the movies (Thank you Entertainment Weekly), that peak my interest. However, I have NEVER gone to see a movie strictly on the opinion of a MOVIE CRITIC; friend, relative, coworker maybe, movie critic, never. OK, rant over - on to the movie. The most important thing that you the reader of this message (thank you in advance for reading this, by the way) must understand is that I am not a big Fantastic Four fan. Sure I know of them, mostly through the appearances that they made in Spiderman comics (which was one of my favorites - loved both movies also) but I never really got ""into"" them as much as some people. I do not own, nor never have owned, a Mister Fantastic Sippie Cup, or Human Torch Underwear or any other merchandise available. I had my own opinion of what each character is and how he/she should act. I went into this movie (having read/seen 3 different reviews - Entertain Weekly, People Magazine (I think), and Ebert and Roper) with very low expectations. It was a better movie than I expected, a fun filled, high energy, popcorn movie. While the movie will not win any Oscars (I seriously doubt that it will even be nominated for any), it was fun to watch. Somewhere along the way, we the movie going public have forgotten something - movies are supposed to fun and entertaining. This is that movie!! Don't let the movie critics take over the world by saying that a movie is ""too silly"" ""too unbelievable"" ""poorly scripted"" or whatever they use for the catchphrase of the week. Go see a movie to have fun and be entertained."

I must admit it's a solid movie. It's simple. It's direct. And it doesn't suck (unlike this review).<br/><br/>What do you expect? It's not a performance movie, it's not a character driven movie and it certainly doesn't hold any plot above the standard superhero comic adaptations. Take it as it is - and for the type of movie it is, it did a pretty good job. If you don't even like the genre, why are you complaining it's a bad movie?

","I really enjoyed this movie, it was fun and lighthearted, just like the comic, and it actually made me laugh, FEW movies make me laugh.<br/><br/>The acting was spot on, even the Ben and Johnny dynamic was written perfectly, the only character who really didn't shine character wise as much as the others was Jessica Alba's character: Susan Storm aka The Invisible Woman. I am in NO way saying that Jessica Alba is a bad actor, I think she is a great character but unfortunately her character was the one who ended with the least character development. I'm not really surprised however, since in my opinion the Invisible Woman only became an interesting character after she gave birth to her and Reed's children. I was also worried about having Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm, but he turned out to be made for this role.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that Doom's origin was too much like the Green Goblin's in Spiderman (Maybe they should have gone with the Unthinkable version? and that the end fight scene could have been longer.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie was A lot better than the first Spiderman movie"

","The Fantastic Four is about five people going into space to study a deadly cloud of radioactivity to discover the origin of human genes. The mission goes awry when the cloud hit the space craft and changed the people inside it. Dr. Richards became the stretchable Mr. Fantastic, Susan Storm became the Invisible Woman, Susans brother Johny became the wild Human Torch, and Ben Grimm became the powerful Thing equaling the Fantastic Four. Sadly the fifth person has became an evil mastermind, his body molding into medal for him to control electricity under the persona of the evil Dr. Doom. Can the Fantastic Four defeat Dr. Doom? Now Fantastic Four isn't a perfect film and it's not the best Marvel Comic Book movie. But it's better than the a few other failures like Hulk or Daredevil. Fantastic Four is cool with good acting, a great storyline, and really impressive graphics. First off The Thing was great! He looked amazing and the actor was born to play the role. The acting is all played wonderfully by actors like Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon, and if you can try to point out Stan Lee's cameo as the mailman. Each one of the characters has their own thought of their powers and how to control them. Richards wants to be normal and he tries to make a cure, Susan wants to be normal while running around and taking off her clothes to get away from the press, Johny though goes along with his powers to become famous, and Ben hates his power because he lost his girlfriend. The special affects are nice though sometimes you can tell when it's fake and cheesy. Though not full out fantastic, Fantastic Four succeeds in being a cool super hero comic film with lots of action, a little comedy, and some drama. Fantastic Four gets the big 7, flawed in many ways but still a great film. Recommnded for everyone. Enjoy!"

","If this is an origin movie, then we're seeing the early versions of the characters, not the ones that exist now, after thirty years of the comic book. Reed Richards was somewhat awkward, sure, but he has to grow into the confident leader's role, not simply become that way. Human Torch was played perfectly, as was the thing, and I don't see any reason to quibble about the way the suit looks, would an all-CGI Thing have been preferable? I don't think so. As far as the Invisible Girl, she was window dressing, but it didn't bug me. My only real problem was the significant changes to Doom, which make him a significantly less threatening villain. I have no issue with the change of giving him powers of his own. But he doesn't come off in the film as Reed's equal, more of a guy who is angry because Reed is superior. Julian McMahon did a fine job with limited material"

","I can't say that I'm particularly fond of comic-book-cum-movie films such as the Fantastic Four, but I can say that, for what it's supposed to be, it's fine. So let me say this right out: if you're looking for something to do on the weekend, by all means pay eight bucks and enjoy this entertaining film. If you're looking for something that will alter your life, blow your mind or inspire you with its clever banter, save your money, you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>Spoilers Galore, below.<br/><br/>To be honest, there were only a few problems that stood out to me during the movie. Firstly, it is almost entirely exposition. By the time it's established exactly what is going on (about the same time I was ready to die before hearing another allusion to their individual super powers), they're battling the main villain and poof!, it's over.<br/><br/>Secondly, the character development leaves nothing to the imagination and character progression is non-existent. Each character ends up close to or exactly the same as they started out. Johnny Storm is funny for the first seven (hundred) jokes, but after a while you start to wonder if there's anything beneath that hot-headed (an actual line from the movie) exterior (although Chris Evans is just hot, in general) (ahem). There was a lot of unsubstantiated character turn-arounds (Ben's 'I'm Going to Trust the Guy I Hate Instead of My Best Friend' speech) (Debbie's 'I can't be married to a freak' moment) and, although it does move the story along a bit quicker, if one of the characters had died, I would have been surprised, but unmoved.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movie had impressive special effects and make-up. The fight sequences were well-done, and the plot progression came off loud and clear. No one gets left behind in this movie. And although there are a few holes (if Doom was going about blowing holes in everyone, why didn't he just blow a hole in Johnny?, for instance), it was fun and pretty entertaining. If it's your thing, you'll probably enjoy it. If it's not your thing, there's probably something you'll like the next couple theaters over.<br/><br/>Verdict: Script was lacking. Movie was entertaining. The sequel will be better."

It ended without much climax. I also didn't find him menacing enough. Michael Chicklis steals the show as The Thing.

","I went in this movie with low, very low expectations and thus came out pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Is this movie good? It depends. It doesn't all click together but it is good entertainment. My theater was full when I went and a loud applause came from the audience at the end. Everyone I went with liked it, and I heard several little boys wanting to see it again. That's probably the best demographic to be to enjoy this movie, but other age groups will find a fun-popcorn flick that you won't feel you've wasted your money on.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the dynamic between the actors. They feel like what they're supposed to feel like: a bickering but loving family, and all the actors, especially Evans and Chiklis do a good job. I don't know much about the comics, but you do get a very good sense of their personalities. The only weak link would be Gruffud, which I'm sorry to say because I really liked him in Horatio Hornblower. Mr. Fantastic's just sort a boring character in this movie. <br/><br/>Another great thing about the movie is the humour. Batman was better overall, but it had a dryness that did hinder it from being truly enjoyable. This is where FF truly delivers. Most of the humour comes from Evans who is outstanding at hitting the right notes to make people laugh.<br/><br/>The weak point of the movie was the plot. There was no plot. There was the setup, and then Dr. Doom decides to kill them. That's it. No master plan, no ingenuity. Nothing. It really felt lacking. Somebody mentioned spoilers. I don't see how you could spoil the movie. It's very straightforward and rather predictable. <br/><br/>However, I always rate movies on how I enjoy them overall and I give it 7/10."

","Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her kid brother Johnny (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chikilis) and Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) are all exposed to cosmic radiation giving them superpowers. Richards can stretch any part of his body and is called Mr. Fantastic; Sue can turn invisible and project force fields--she's called Invisible Girl (it should be Woman); Johnny can turn into a living flame AND fly--he's the Human Torch; Grimm becomes a monster made of orange rocks and called The Thing. von Doom begins to go insane and turn into metal--he becomes the evil Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>Adaptation of the popular comic book actually isn't bad. They make only slight changes to the origins (unlike ""Batman Begins""), cast them well and threw in tons of excellent special effects. The story moves quickly and has plenty of action (I've never seen so many car crashes in one movie).<br/><br/>There are problems though--and it's mostly with the acting. Gruffudd (completely covering his accent) does very well as Richards--he looks and acts like the character in the books. However Alba is TERRIBLE. Yes--she is beautiful but can't act. Her face had a blank expression throughout. Evans, surprisingly, is only so-so. He's a talented guy and I thought he could pull off the role of a young, cocky, arrogant guy--but he seems to be holding back. Chikilis is excellent as The Thing. Even though he's in a costume you can see his pain and anger at being turned into a monster. Also McMahon is excellent as Doom--he downplays it--but it works well.<br/><br/>It's loud, silly but loads of fun. I really can't see why all the critics are blasting this. It's not that bad!

Among these are (in no order): The Dark Knight, Batman and Robin(as a guilty pleasure), Superman Returns, and the first 2 Spider Man movies with Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>In fact, for the same reasons as Roger Ebert, Spider Man 2 is my favorite superhero movie, and personally one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time.(See his review online.)<br/><br/>To summarize my review, SM2 is not all special effects, it tells a great story, too. Plus, it imagines quite truthfully how a regular teen with super powers and a normal life.<br/><br/>Fantastic 4 tells an interesting story to me. It follows 4 scientists who are hit by a star storm that gives them special powers: stretching, bursting into flames, turning invisible, and basically being a rock monster. They then have to learn how to live with their new powers in an ordinary world.<br/><br/>Of all the 4 heroes, my favorite is The Thing. I want to see a superhero movie that is just about him! He's the rock monster, and while the others can go back to regular human beings-he's stuck being a rock formation! Many fear him for this, and he has to prove that he's a good guy, too.<br/><br/>I gave this a 9 because of 2 things:<br/><br/>1. The first 12 minutes is slow and just the build up. It's not something to remove, but it could have sped up a little.<br/><br/>2. Much of the dialogue is muttered, so I had to see it with subtitles.

So I got myself a ticket and watched all by myself.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was impressed by the visual effects...with all their powers just popping out of nowhere (Fireball of Human Torch, Invisible woman's forcefield)..the cast, especially that wicked Julian McMahon (surely his career will sky rocket after this one) and the hottest of the hot, Jessica Alba...the adaptation of the comic book especially that moving cosmic storm scene where you think they'll all die...and of course the story...<br/><br/>Everything from the start seemed to be catchy and all but when the middle hour came, I was so disappointed that all those foul jokes crop in and you'll just say, ""Oh my God, he did not just say that.""

None of the cast can act, it is all about good looks and terrible CGI effects. The plot is non-existent and the film lurches from one poor scene to the next. The direction and dialogue are equally dreadful. The man who was Victor Von Doom has absolutely nothing to do. He just waits around for his own evil alter ego to develop. In addition, this awful film would have you believe that Von Doom's body changed at the same time as that of The Fantastic Four whilst in outer space! That was never the case nor anything remotely like it. What actually occurred as depicted in the comics, was that Von Doom was born and raised in Latvia during a time of political turmoil. He came from a family of gypsies and his father was a member of a group of Resistance fighters who tried to overthrow the ruthless tyrant who ruled the entire country. Later on, Von Doom came to America to enrol at a university in New York. He was already an exceptionally gifted scientist and someone who was interested in time travel, the mystic arts and telepathy. He became disfigured after an accident with an experiment caused an explosion. He blamed Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) for what happened. Soon after, he left America and travelled to Tibet where some monks took him in and built him his steel mask and body armour. Eventually and under the name of Dr. Doom, he conquered Latvia and became their new and thoroughly evil ruler. Now, if the above film had bothered to include any of Dr Doom's background, then maybe the viewing experience would have been better. A real stinker in all departments."

","Yeah, you heard the general consensus regarding 'The Fantastic Four's' first major big screen outing. Most people hated it. I didn't hate it, but I'm not warming to it with time. When I first saw it in the cinema I thought it was 'just about okay.' Now I've watched it again on DVD a couple of years over time I'm sticking to my original verdict.<br/><br/>In fact, one of its problems is the rest of the 'Marvel' movies. Since 2005 we've been treated to the whole 'expanded universe' where all the Marvel superheroes pop in and out of each other's films. And, it's safe to say that most people like all that (plus Avengers etc). So, basically the current way of doing superhero films is miles above what 20th Century Fox tried back in 2005.<br/><br/>The cast isn't really the problem. Even if some of them did get some stick for their portrayals of the characters, I didn't find any of them a problem. They all looked the part to me. However, the problem I had with the movie is that it never really gets going. It's not a long film (only an hour and a half) and, despite getting their superpowers early on, the four central characters don't really do that much with them until literally the final few minutes. I thought this when I first watched it in the cinema, but it wasn't until I saw it again on DVD that I was able to time exactly when the film actually 'got going' (in my opinion). It was about at 1h 20 minutes (out of an hour and a half!). That's when the superheroes finally come together like I was expecting them to and fight Dr Doom.<br/><br/>Oh yes... Dr Doom. I mentioned that the casting wasn't that bad. I was referring to the Four. Dr Doom is pretty unspectacular and not that evil. And they only gang up on him at the end, making the whole film seem like a prequel that could have been told in about twenty minutes until the story starts properly.<br/><br/>All in all, The Fantastic Four will always be classed as a 'missed opportunity.' Yes, it's already being 'rebooted' and die-hard fans are hoping that Fox will get the formula right this time. Although... rumour has it that the writers are already changing HOW the Four got their powers. Therefore I'm not holding my breath!"

But the result is a terribly cheesy almost stupid outcome. I really did like the buildup and how we will see the team at the end. But seriously, I think everybody shouldn't take this film so seriously. The director was looking for a pure fun popcorn-flick, not Spiderman. Fantastic 4 combines all elements to create a fun film, and it does it in a almost childish way. I suspected somewhat more, but the final product wasn't as bad as everybody has been saying. So the final verdict, Fantastic 4 is purely a fun movie, not going to be amazing, and is almost neared toward the kiddos. But not a problem, it was still an entertaining movie. 6/10."

"Electrified_Voltage","5","2","5","17 January 2010"," Some comic book movies are fun and adrenaline-inducing, but this one is not
","This is one of many high-budget live action comic book adaptations from the past decade or so, and unfortunately, it's not one of the stronger ones. I've never been very familiar with the famous ""Fantastic Four"" comic book series. For a while when I was a kid, I used to like to read comic books from the library, and remember taking out an issue from this series at one point, but can't remember much about it at all. This silver screen adaptation did not catch my attention when it was released in 2005, but sometime last year, I watched the 2007 sequel, ""4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", thinking it was the original 2005 release. This was obviously a little confusing for me. The original made more sense to me when I watched it afterwards, but it still wasn't very entertaining.<br/><br/>A scientist named Reed Richards believes that clouds of cosmic energy cause evolution, and he and his friend, astronaut Ben Grimm, seek funding for a space voyage to study a cosmic energy cloud which Earth will soon be passing. Von Doom Industries CEO Dr. Victor Von Doom agrees to support this mission, and takes along two other employees: his chief genetics researcher and Reed's ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; and her brother, the excitable Johnny Storm. The mission does not work out as planned, and the five of them are all exposed to cosmic radiation! They all make it back to Earth alive, but one by one, they discover that the radiation has altered their DNA! Reed can now stretch himself like elastic, Sue has the ability to become invisible, Johnny can ignite his body and fly, and Ben becomes a super-strong, rock-like being. Victor has also been affected by the radiation, and with his new powers, he becomes the enemy of the other four! <br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this movie might be Johnny Storm, played here by Chris Evans. I don't know what this character is like in the comics, but in this movie, he's such an idiot! The part where he flirts with a nurse and very quickly ends up taking her on a ski trip is stupid, even if it's mildly humorous at times (intentionally). Johnny does some stupid things, and is a very unlikable, arrogant character. This definitely helps sink the film. There are some poorly crafted physical fights between the main characters, unsurprisingly including one between Johnny and Ben, but also one between Reed and Ben. The dialogue is fairly weak at times, such as in one argument scene between Reed and Sue. Another problem (as if there aren't already enough) is the story, which takes too long to get to the main problem, and there aren't too many battle scenes. Clearly, the script could have been better, and could have made a better movie. Also, Ben Grimm/The Thing might be the only character who really stands out.<br/><br/>This comic book movie isn't terrible, and it may have some mildly exciting moments. The special effects are obviously very pleasing to the eye, which you can expect from these high-budget modern blockbusters. However, the visuals are not enough to make up for all the flaws, and for the most part, there's really not a lot of excitement at all. Even though this film spawned a sequel just two years after its release, it's certainly not one of the most highly praised films in its genre, and that's perfectly understandable. Some love this adaptation of ""Fantastic Four"" and some hate it, but if you ask me, it's mediocre. Worse comic book movies have definitely come from Hollywood in the past ten years (a time when lots of them have been made), but so have much better ones, even if most of them aren't masterpieces.

","The film does look very good, and the special effects on the whole were well done. The script is a little uneven, but the spirited performances make up for it. Michael Chiklis is very good as Ben, and Julian McMahon is enjoyably camp as Victor Von Doom. Chris Evans is spirited as Johnny Storm, though I wasn't hugely impressed with Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba. They just didn't convince and their chemistry at times felt a bit awkward. Also the story is a bit slow and predictable, though at least the characters were likable. Usually when the story fails the characters fail, though I felt there could have been a lot more development. All in all, a flawed but enjoyable film, that is not as bad as people make it out to be. 6/10 Bethany Cox."

","hi this Mikhal T; Fantastic 4 is an awesome movie; filmed in Vancouver; the storyline, and real life adaptation of the original comic book legend is professionally done. The acting, filming etc. in this movie was professional, and seeing first hand on set(I was part of the Red Porche 911 scene outside the stadium) I was impressed by the acting, and filming of the crew there. The people that I met on set there were kind, well kept; a lot of work was put into the making, and setup of the film; they even had me being a gentlemen where makeup. So I recommend this movie to anyone who is into this sort of action film; email me for questions MCstudios_Inc@Hotmail.com"

","This movie hasn't got one single good thing going for it. Not one.<br/><br/>It's bad from the start and the total lack of story in this one is amazing. Even Argmageddon is better than this one, and that says a lot! I almost stopped the film when i watched it but since it's fairly short me and my brother spent the last part, laughing through it.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie though, is that Chiklis stars in it. To have gone from a truly fantastic series like ""the Shield"" to do this...talk about bad judgment. One can just hope that this (and also Fantastic 4, number 2) was a temporary dip to get into the movie industry. Lets hope Chiklis instead goes into some serious film-making, which I think he would do excellent."

","I usually love comic book movies and haven't been disappointed by many (except for The Hulk) but i thought this movie looked quite good. The sad thing is that it was incredibly boring and it was nothing but 4 people who were in a space accident complaining and an awkward romance between Mr. Fantastic and Sue Storm. Finally, when you get a fight scene, it's over in a couple minutes and the movies over. It was quite a disappointment. The only good things I can say about this movie is that Ben Grimm was a very good character and was the most interesting and was very enjoyable to watch. Also, being a fan of Chris Evans I enjoyed his performance. But these 2 things couldn't even save this film, even putting Jessica Alba for eye candy couldn't save this film. I wouldn't waste your time seeing this, luckily I work at a theater and didn't have to pay to see it so save your money.

This film lacks a plot, has many ridiculous goofs and unsuccessful attempts at cheap laughs, and - of course - the ending is just awful, as expected. Before watching it I almost thought it would be as good as X-Men - well, I was dead wrong. Also, I saw someone here comparing it to Batman Begins. That's like comparing ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and some homemade movie you made with your friends when you were drunk. Batman Begins is the best super-hero movie ever made, or at least in the top 5 (since I haven't seen all of them).

","The characters in the movie are very well made, but the plot has a ton of holes and makes no sense once you begin to think about it. First of all, if the scientist group has to go into space to see this very special ""unique"" cosmic storm, how the hell is there a reproduction in Mr. Fantastic's apartment building? Why even bother going to space? And then, how does Dr. Doom's company go broke from them not getting the results in space?! It was an empire that went broke from what?! All the machinery they already had, so it wasn't that big an investment... Couldn't they have manufactured another ""cosmic storm"" in their backyard, like Mr. Fantastic did? Then, Dr. Doom says he needed to get rid of the Thing, implying the Thing is too powerful and Dr. Doom can't handle him. So he tricks him into becoming normal again by going into the ""reverse cosmic storm"" (ridiculous). Anyways, the Thing changes back, and then Dr. Doom is about to kill the Thing by stabbing him with a metal pole? Why go through the whole hassle of trying to make the Thing human again? ABSURD! And the Thing is able to program the machine from ""reverse"" to ""normal"" cosmic storm??????? THIS MOVIE BLOWS!"
"bastien45","4","2","5","4 August 2005"," Hello kids, that's only for you !!!
","This movie is so boring. It's a pity to take a rich subject like these with not much or less interest than the others superheros (spiderman, daredevil, etc...). But this movie was made for kids. Instead of questionning itself about their powers, the characters are making jokes under the sight of the medias. It's like they know that someone is looking at their life. The problem is that the director needs to present the characters but he forget that he has a story to tell to the public to attract them and to respect the background of the comics. Tim Story is a clip man, a yes men. I really think he didn't know the comic book before filming that. We have the impression that he discover the character during his shoot, like a child. Oh, oh ElasticMan is a really funny guy, he can takes some toilet paper when they're not. OH, the Human torch can build a jacuzzi in the middle of a mountain. Sic!! Fortunately, the Thing left there well, he's the richest character of the film. Sue Storm is under employ in spite of his power, but thanks to the cast director and the make-up artist, she's shining upon the movie. Finally, Van Doom should be a terrific bad guy, but a the moment he become interesting, we cannot see his reel power, he's getting behind to be useful in the next movie. So Fatastic Four is a reel disaster. We were accustomed to tormented superheros who think about their old life, who don't want to protect peoples, who wants to live a normal life with no great responsibilities, some people who doubt about themselves. But the 4 are superheros like in the 60's, an illustration of the great America who save the planet. Isn't' Captain America that Stan Lee is trying to product next ???"
"MovieManMenzel","6","2","5","2 August 2005"," It's a pretty decent comic book movie although it's a far cry from fantastic.
","I would be lying if at any point in time I said I wanted to see the ""Fantastic Four"". While I worked for Eworks, all we did was test TV spots and trailers for this movie and to be honest none of them grabbed my attention at all. In fact this movie looked so bad and I never wanted to see it. But again due to the lack of movies so far this summer, I decided since my brothers wanted to see it that I would see ""The Fantastic Four"" A group of scientists get money to go up into space because they are searching for new ways to cure diseases. While in space some kind of force hits the ship and now everyone on board develops special powers, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) has the ability to become invisible, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) has the ability to turn into fire, Reed Richards (Ian Gruffudd) has the ability to stretch, and finally Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) becomes a rock creature with super strength. Together they become the Fantastic Four! But there was one more scientist named Victor (Julian McMahon) who was on board the ship when the force hit and instead of using his powers for good, he decides to use his powers to destroy the Fantastic Four and ultimately control the world. And so ""The Fantastic Four"" ensues I have to admit I really liked the movie much more then I ever thought was possible. For a comic book movie it's pretty darn good. I mean compared to comic films like ""Blade"", ""Catwoman"", ""Dare Devil"", ""The Hulk"", and ""Elektra"" to name a few, this film is a masterpiece. The story is decent, it could be better but it's a comic book movie so I don't expect great writing. The acting surprisingly isn't too bad either, and that came as a shock. Jessica Alba is improving since her role in the awful"" Honey"" and everyone else is pretty decent as well. Honestly it was a decent popcorn flick, it's nothing to think about or take seriously; you just have to sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>There were a couple of things that hurt the film and I will go over them now. The first thing was the characters outside Sue Storm and Reed Richards were too childish. I mean they seemed like little kids. Also the dialogue was really bad, I mean when Sue says to Johnny and Ben ""stop fighting"", I literally busted out laughing because I couldn't help think what? Are they 3 years old or something? I mean wow who wrote that line. The whole dialogue thing was pretty bad at times basically because of bad one liners like when Dr. Doom goes ""Sue, You're Fired"" I mean give me a break. Also in the end the film feels very rushed. They take so much time for the characters to develop and understand their powers that by the time Dr. Doom comes into the picture it's like 10 minutes before the film ends. I mean the battle at the end was disappointing because it was very short and felt rushed.<br/><br/>Overall it's a comic book movie and all comic book movies basically have the same plot, a good guy or in this case good guys get powers, they decide they want to do well; some bad guy gets power as well and wants to use it to destroy the world or control it. Most movies are like this ""Spiderman"", ""The Hulk"","" X-men"" etc. The Fantastic Four does this well. It has a nice amount of action, an OK story, the dialogue needs a little fixing up and so does the end but in the end it's much better then the trailers and critics for that matter lead it to be. I would see the sequel which I know it coming so I can only hope they improve the few things wrong with this one.<br/><br/>My final rating for ""The Fantastic Four"" is a 6/10. Go to a matinée or take the kids they will love it."
"rebeljenn","3","2","5","1 August 2005"," Unoriginal
","The Fantastic Four is a typical comic book adventure, riding on the back of recent success in this genre. Although it is packed full of action, there is really little else to the film - and this certainly does not make the film memorable and/or unique. It certainly isn't original, and next to some of the other films of this genre, it adds very little.<br/><br/>The ending is as familiar as any other film in this genre, with an expectation of more action yet to come. (So typical.) And the science behind the special powers is far from believable - I felt that other stories of this genre had better and more-thought-out scientific explanations.<br/><br/>In short, this film fails to captivate in terms of originality and storyline. If you're a comic book fanatic, I'd recommend it, but don't expect much. If you're not, then there are much better films in this genre to see. If you're just looking for a little action, it may be worth it in between a slow-moving plot."
"YellowMonkey","3","2","5","31 July 2005"," Could have been decent, but for Dr. Doom.
","This could have been a decent movie. The Fantastic Four themselves were not too bad at all. However, the actual story was rather poor particularly because of the weakness of the Dr. Doom character. He was one dimensional and just plain annoying. He had none of the characteristics of the comic book character (that made the character interesting) and the costume was just AWFUL. Comic book costumes seldom translate to live-action without looking just ludicrous, and Doom's is definitely no exception.<br/><br/>Here's another comment, the fact that the Thing's love interest just happens to be black would be sad if it wasn't such a common thing for white Hollywood. God forbid they let the freakish monster have a white romantic interest. Hell, if the character actually was black in the comics, it might be some excuse, but nope. Why does it have to be a black woman who gets hooked up to the ugly freak monster? Duh, because this is Hollywood and it's still racist. Since there weren't any major characters who were a minority, they just had to cram one in. For shame.<br/><br/>Overall, if they put the Four heroes in a different movie written by someone with some competence, this movie could have been quite good. Like if they focused on sciency stuff and character development instead of brainless super hero action sequences. Oh yeah, and the plot was so predictable and straight forward that I was bored with it pretty early on. Mr. Fantastic should have stretched his brain to a huge size so that he could conceive of a more interesting way of super-heroing."
"Shnu","5","2","5","30 July 2005"," Wasn't loving it.
","The choice between going to see this on the opening night or Madagascar, my original preferences would have gone to Madagascar, the trailers looking quite amusing. But going with a comic book fiend didn't really have that option. Having seen quite a lot of the comic book movies out lately, Daredevil, Elektra, X-men 1 and 2, Sin City, Spiderman 1 and 2, batman begins etc, i wasn't really sure what else this movie was going to have to offer in relation to new plot lines and exciting stories to tell, but i was quite interested to find out. <br/><br/>Unfortunately i wasn't impressed. Admittedly they're based on predetermined characters so there's only so much you can indulge in them but the plot line was obvious, the villain was far from menacing, and how many different ways are there to show superhero's who just can't fit into normal everyday life.<br/><br/>All the recent comic book-turn-movie hero's recently have been popped out one after the other so quickly, it's not giving anyone a chance in-between to think up new and original story lines before jumping on the comic bandwagon. Maybe it would have been more successful if the writers had spent a little more time on some depth and plot in the movie and had the release a few months or years after the hype from Batman Begins had died down in order to give it a fresh start where it could have been let off from the comparisons in some vague attempt at creating something original. <br/><br/>Easy to watch, but it's probably worth waiting until it's shown on television because then you can do something worthwhile like ironing whilst watching it. Disappointed but occasional laughs."

","Out of the whole lots of Super Heroes Movie, this is by far the most cartoonish with actual cartoon like storyline.

Just an introduction to how they become Fantastic 4 and slowly discovered their ability and how to make the society accept them. That about it, really. The story is extremely shallow also the characters. And it even seems like rip-off from many places.<br/><br/>Anyway I personally think people go to see this movie because of beautiful Jessica Alba (she looks so DAMN Hot!!!!), and maybe Christ Evan, who help to add some charisma and humor to the movie. And the other two was more of a miscast. Personally, I think they are too old and if they're not old they still look like one.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely out of other super heroes movie league. But still this movie is very much watched able, if you don't expect anything at all.

"iwannabeyourlova","4","2","5","27 July 2005"," well was it worth it????
","Was this movie actually worth my £5?..........No!!!!! this movie was a complete let down. After the reading the comic book hero's comics, and waiting for the movie that was supposed to be movie of the year, turned out to be well over-rated. Some of you might be thinking what is this person taking about, but u have to see it from my side to give it a fair evaluation. this film, graphically was 10 years old and out of date, the process of the transformation for each character in the shuttle was pathetic, also the johnny storm animated burning man impression while flying across the world like a DE-railed version of superman (superman which i love BTW) spoil-ed the end. This wasn't backed up by the 'not so pleasing story line' that was absolutely perfect for a 10yr old, but I'm 17 so this didn't help me. seen as tho this movie would only be enjoyed by a 10yr old age group plus the older ones that have a slight sense of Brightness in them might like this movie. if u haven't seen it, don't, not unless uve got a kids under 10 (12 for those who i feel sorry for, loll) watch something else, but a good sense for this movie is that Ioan Gruffund - Richard Reeds, and Michael Chiklis - Ben Grimm played there parts really well, and kept me sane while i was pulling half my hair out. Fire boy johnny storm over exaggerated his part, he was like a little kid high on sugar, which suited those kids in the audience who were high on the £10 bag of fl umps bought in the cinema before watching the movie 'Bad Choice Director!' and as for Jessica Alba, she looked Hot, Really Hot, well............, only for the couple of scenes that i saw her in her tight blue costume :P loll other than that she was average, which is what i leave this rating as............average!!!!!

The reviews had been damning, a rather pathetic 24% at Rotten Tomatoes, so my expectations were low, and sadly realized, characters are painfully dull, for a super hero flick our hero's are neither 'super', or come to think of it 'fantastic'.In fact they rescue some fire-fighters and get labeled fantastic by the media, they defeat Dr Doom and that's it for two painful hours.<br/><br/>The film's only redeeming feature being Michael Chiklis as The Thing, at least he shows some personality even under all that make-up, which is more than can be said for Jessica Alba.Yet again movie makers subject us to a 'beauty with brains' character-she can't act for toffee and spends the entire movie pouting, and certainly give's Tara Reids performance in Alone In The Dark a run for her money in next years Golden Razzies awards!<br/><br/>One 'highlight' I must mention was the fabulous piece of product placement for Burger King-a priceless piece of direction as the camera blatantly pans out from a BK billboard to reveal a whopper, I'm surprised a price didn't flash up on the screen!<br/><br/>So there you go, for every Spiderman we get a Catwoman, for every X-Men we get an Elektra, and this year to balance out Batman Begins I present to you Fantastic Four.

","The film was actually quite good, up until the last-minute, lackluster ditch. Personally, I felt ripped off after solid performances, decent direction, and relatively good writing built up to the lack of a truly big battle with Dr. Doom. There should have been a no-holds-barred, knock-down-drag-out with FF and Doom; something akin to the ten-plus-minutes final battle between Neo and Smith in Matrix: Revolutions. But instead, in the final moments we got less than five minutes of Chemistry 101 that didn't even begin to tap into Doom's power. (In the comic books, Doom defeated the Beyonder, for god's sake.) The final battle should have been directed by Sam Raimi. At least he knows how to do a fight scene. All in all, the film was like spectacular foreplay leading up to premature ejaculation and eventual impotence. Women all over the world know exactly what I'm talking about here."
"Danny_G13","6","2","5","27 July 2005"," It's just *there*...
","Yet *another* of the conveyor belt line production systems provides us with a comic book adaptation, and this time it's the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba is about the most famous name here, and she's the overly attractive and cleavage-endowed Sue Storm. Along with a group of 3 scientist she makes a trip to the moon (I think) to sample DNA (I think) but when a sunflare attacks the expedition the crew all experience genetic changes and find themselves with super powers.<br/><br/>Yup, all original plot here.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie sees the four of them at loggerheads with Von Doom, the big bad guy. Sort of.<br/><br/>You see, the Fantastic Four is all a bit pointless. 4 scientist types get physically changed and then we wonder what the point is. Are they using these powers for good, or are they just trying to entertain the viewer? The ending reel is incredibly anti-climactical and really unsatisfying; not to mention cheesy and unoriginal.<br/><br/>I honestly feel confused by what I make of this one; on one hand it *did* entertain for sure, but on the other it was completely futile and I got nothing out of it.<br/><br/>As mentioned, for the guys there is Jessica Alba and her ample cleavage, and that's the attempt at giving the film sex appeal. To be fair, it works. She is a very hot lady.<br/><br/>And yet there's little more to say about all this.<br/><br/>It will kill an hour and a half, but if you expect something to think about and discuss, you might want to look elsewhere."
"BigBadVincentVega","3","2","5","26 July 2005"," Laughable.
","Despite preconceptions that did not favour my interpretation of the film, I went into 'Fantastic Four' (2005) with a fairly open mind. I prayed I would see a charming, dulled down, childish comic book film that would be otherwise comparable to the more adult X-Men films. Unfortunately, I was not pleasantly surprised as I had hoped I would be.<br/><br/>Instead, I was forced to sit through an hour and a half of nonsensical, diluted, monotonous mini-stories pieced together by incoherent scenes as part of an altogether bitty narrative. The first 20 minutes rushed out the initial story of the superheroes, while the hour in the middle was filled with pointless arcs and excuses for showing Jessica Alba half naked. The ending does not save the story either, but rather bores you with a predictably flashy fight and annoys you with a pathetic ""everything's wrapped up in a neat little package"" party scene, where love is declared and the American way upheld. However, surely the most patriotic Americans must have been sickened by the way their country was portrayed at times during this film.<br/><br/>Add these down-points to the poor screenplay (duly noted as incoherent narrative) and script that only serves to embarrass the already questionable actors and actresses present, and a truly poor film is the end product. Furthermore, it cannot be argued that the film is aimed at a younger audience, as the largely childish script and stories therein are contrasted with some notably violent deaths and adult themes.<br/><br/>Vince's Verdict: Poor writing and equally poor direction sends this one right down the drain. If you really need a superhero fix, go and see Batman Begins again."

The movie was over before it got started (thank God). The storyline just didn't seem to have any content or girth. I didn't even know the climax WAS THE CLIMAX. It was a bad movie anyway you look at it, if i could have gotten my money back i would have. Don't you just hate it when a movie is hyped up to be something its not and you would rather watch the previews again because they were more entertaining than the actual movie. To sum it up the movie was mediocre at best and is not worth your money or time. Batman Begins proved that comic book characters can be brought to the big screen the way they were meant to be. Fantastic Four just didn't live up to the hype and God i hope the isn't going to be a sequel. I give it a 3 out of 10. (because I'm not totally heartless)."

It's standard super hero fare in the most predictable of ways and this film ends up feeling like a T.V. movie with a big budget. The story concerns a group of unlikely scientists who go into space and are exposed to some sort of cosmic mutator that inevitably gives them bizarre powers. The CGI effects are alright, the acting ranges from bad to so so (with the occasional good performance from Ben a.k.a.

","Yes, slobbering. That's what you'll be doing at the back of the theater, your head slumped, your tongue hanging out, as you watch this week's Marvel-comic-book movie, ""Fantastic Four."" FF was my favorite comic book back when I was a wee lad. These were Stan Lee's original superheroes with ""feet of clay"" (even before Spider-man). But the real heart of the comic was the Thing (Ben Grimm)--the big, tough wise guy with the big broken heart. And he is the one thing the movie got right--Michael Chiklis (and the impressive make up) capture the Thing perfectly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are three other team members, who need to be ""developed"": Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Sue Storm (the Invisible Girl, er, Woman), and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch). Ah, for the old comic-book origin story, where the four are shot up into space, are exposed to ""cosmic rays,"" crash back to earth, and immediately start manifesting their super powers. Before you know it, they're fighting the Mole Man (and sometimes each other).<br/><br/>If only the movie had used such shorthand. Instead, well over half the flick is ""family"" bickering as the Four discover their abilities--and the origin of Dr. Doom (their greatest enemy) is outlined.<br/><br/>Doom is the movie's most serious misstep. In the comic books, Doom was a scientist who falls from the ""pure faith"" (yes, ""he tampered in God's domain,"" to lift a bit from Ed Wood's ""Bride of the Monster""). He had a regalness and grandeur about him, even as he tried to destroy the FF and take over the world (the perfect opposite of Reed). In the movie, Doom is another tiresome industrialist who (ala Norman ""Green Goblin"" Osborn) obtains super powers. His showdown with the FF at the end is somewhat less than epic (and the climax rips off a bit of ""Terminator 2"").<br/><br/>The whole movie feels as though they shot a first-draft script (characters fairly trip over the loose ends, and Reed is about as much of a super genius as Wile E. Coyote). But there is the occasional chuckle, usually thanks to Bashful Benjy Grimm."

What we have here is a lowest common denominator film piled high with product marketing and light on any thing to go wow or care about. For some reason I also got a feeling the movie got a fair amount of slicing in editing as well. For example near the beginning storm goes invisible in order to get past the police barriers only it doesn't show her doing this and does explain how Reed get's past them. Add to that the whole mess is caused by the fantastic four in the first place, yet the get treated like heroes. <br/><br/>All the way through the film the squabble amongst themselves like teenagers, including the 'baddie' Von doom who appeared to be no more self centered and evil than the main fantastic four. In short for super heroes that are supposed to fight for good and be super smart they came across as a bunch of high school drop outs. <br/><br/>If you think about it for a second and ask - why would anyone love these characters - apart from their tight fitting costumes, and even that is a taste thing - then there's little reason to. They didn't save anyone really, caused a lot of damage, wrecked other peoples property and generally where a pain in the arse. <br/><br/>Spider man, Batman (not 'and robin) and the X men all have something more going on - this I started to really not like the main characters early on, and their self obsession just made it worse as it went along.<br/><br/>Lastly what exactly did Von Doom have against them? Was it all down to his love of Sue Storm? If so that didn't really come across and he tried to kill her first chance he got. <br/><br/>This is supposed to be fantasy but it would help to have some kind of reason why everything was happening. This comes across with as much emotional depth as a gap commercial."
"skibbleyboo66","4","2","5","20 July 2005"," Could've been better, certainly. Much better.
","Before I turn this into a scathing review similar to my review of the remake of Dawn of the Dead (which I'm slightly tempted to do), I realize that I cannot do that and tell the truth about this movie. This really was not a waste of the money I spent to see this in the theaters, for the simple reason that it is fun to sit down and watch. Once. No more.<br/><br/>But what makes this movie fun? Is it watching the pretty special effects as Jessica Alba turns herself invisible, or as Ioan Gruffudd stretches himself out into unimaginable proportions? Perhaps it's watching the hilarious Chris Evans as he plays the Human Torch and tries to annoy Michael Chiklis in any way possible.<br/><br/>And... hate to say it, but that's about it. Yup. The two truly good points lie in the special effects and Chris Evans' performance as the teenage pyro.<br/><br/>The storyline. Ah, this is nice. Some outside force from space affects four otherwise ordinary astronauts in slightly inexplicable ways (a vague ""alteration of DNA"" is referenced), and suddenly they gain the ability to do amazing things, like light themselves on fire, stretch all parts of their body, become invisible, or even permanently become some rock... beast... thing. The story goes on to reveal the antagonist, how the antagonist is defeated, and that the guy gets the girl. Yup. Sounds like a pretty typical action movie. Unfortunately, nothing the story, script, or even the action does really rises above the average. One major fault of the storyline lies in its predictability. Of COURSE Ben Grimm is going to be resentful that he is stuck as a hideous rock-beast while the others can turn their powers on and off. Of COURSE he's going to do whatever he can to reverse the power, no matter the cost to him or to his friends. It just felt very unoriginal, and predictable. I've heard it said that Chiklis' performance was the best of the lot. I wholeheartedly disagree, for the simple reason that it was just so predictable. Evans, on the other hand, was a fun character to watch, whereas Ben Grimm's life after the accident was simply a sob story, and an overused one at that. <br/><br/>Perhaps it was poor timing to be released relatively soon after the Incredibles, a rather similar movie. It just felt like the Incredibles without the wit. And I'm going to get lynched for comparing such a famous group of heroes for an animated recent movie, but considering I'm not a comic fan, I have nothing literary in nature upon which to base this review.<br/><br/>In other words, I don't care if it's true to the comic, which it may or may not be. The fact remains that the storyline, the script, and the movie as a whole remains wholly unimpressive. The music was, put simply, forgettable. I don't remember it at all as I type this, having seen the movie a few days back.<br/><br/>And yet I liked this movie. I really did. I said it already, but Chris Evans really did do a good job with his role, and it seemed to fit him perfectly. The movie just could have been a lot better, perhaps if it had strayed more (?) from the comic's storyline, and given us an intriguing tale, rather than one more of Grandpa's boring old yarns. Rent it. You'll only need to see it once."

","This movie was really good. It is one of the best superhero movies I have seen! I can't believe that this movie has been taken so much crap from all those movie critics. Fantast 4 has comedy, drama, action and everything a movie needs to be number 1. Granted Fantastic Four is no X-Men, but I liked it better than any of the Spider-Man movies. It is true that you should not compare it to X-Men, Fantastic Four, or Hellboy because Fantastic Four is good in it's own genre. The special effects in this movie are somewhat disappointing, especially the Mr. Fantastic effects. Other than that the invisible force fields (which I found too Jean Greyishy) were cool, and the fire was really cool too. Well you should really check this movie out!"

I found this movie very enjoyable and the theater was very quiet with all attendees enjoying the experience. The critics pooh poohing it was a real mistake, and not totally expected.

","This was a great movie, i loved the humor in it. I also enjoyed the relations between the characters how they already had working relationships before the movie started and they were able to explain those relationships very quickly to give you a nice back-story. This is the first movie in hopefully a new franchise of Fantastic Four Films. The movie is really just the five main characters learning about their new powers and couping with what has happened to them. While this movie isn't as action packed as other super-hero movies are it was a nice change because this was more about the internal struggles of the characters and then also about the relationships within the group."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","14 July 2005"," Light weight comic book screen version
","Fantastic Four is light weight in its character development. It's lightweight in its special effects. It's lightweight in its dialogue. It's lightweight in just about everything. Light-weight is not necessarily synonymous with poor quality. For one thing, light-weight wouldn't draw heavy criticism. Pity the professional critics dumping all over the absurdity of the science stuff, barking up the wrong tree. They may as well denounce Harry Pottery for the very valid argument that there is really no such thing as magic in the world. Fantastic Four is not even science fiction. Isaac Asimov is science fiction (but not ""I Robot"", I regret to report). Fantastic Four is comic book, period.<br/><br/>I know that this movie is a living demonstration of cliché and predictability. Every fibre in me cries out against enjoying it. It isn't even my favourite comic of group heroes. While we are on that, not even X-men is. I wish that one day they'll make one with Green Lantern, Flash, Hawk Man, Green Arrow, The Martian Manhunter, plus of course Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman.in short, the JLA or in long, Justice League of America. But that was a long, long time ago, before there was even a Vietnam War, let alone a Gulf War. But I digress.<br/><br/>Shamelessly, I enjoyed Fantastic Four. I enjoyed the simple story, the simple characters, the simple quips (despite having heard them a million times), the simple special effects. I didn't miss the swearing and sex, which I got plenty of in Sin City, another comic book movie but enjoyed on a very different plane. I enjoyed Fantastic Four simply for being what it is..light-weight.<br/><br/>Update, 2017: My dream of half-a-century came true! ""Justice"" has dawned!"
"Stapa-Bomar","8","2","5","12 July 2005"," Better than the reviews
","I feel that many of the movie critics have been a little harsh on the Fantastic Four. Granted, ""The World's Greatest Comic Magazine"" did not become the greatest comic book movie, especially sharing the year with two of the best, Sin City & Batman Begins. As a fan of the FF in the pages of Marvel Comics, I can say the film was rather true to the characters. The bickering between the Torch & Thing, Reed's lack of people skills despite his brilliance, & Susan's role as the glue which holds the team together are displayed in all their Marvelous glory. Of all the characters, the Thing came off the best. I enjoyed many of the small touches such as his calling Susan by the name Suzy, his voice sounding exactly like I pictured it all of those years reading, and the tragic portrayal of his appearance. The plot of the film, featuring a Doctor Doom very different from the comic, was lacking in my opinion. This fact is not enough for me to give it a bad review. I think the director understood that the FF may have had to be presented little more campy & less serious than some other films of the genre. I've read complaints that the characters just seemed to go with the flow, not really being amazed as a real person would at gaining such powers. There's something to be said for that, but again I think that was done on purpose. If you like super hero movies, I think you'll enjoy the Fantastic Four. If you're sarcastic about every little ""unreal"" thing that happens, stay away. If you're a really big fan of Dr. Doom, I'd also recommend staying away."
"thom_osburn","7","2","5","12 July 2005"," Watchable, even enjoyable . . despite what you've read.
","I made a decision to read a few online reviews before seeing this movie, and my reaction in the theater was ""wow, what a relief"" as the film is nowhere near as weak as some (pro and amateur) critics would tell you. Sure, The Torch does not ponder the possibilities of being able to incinerate the atmosphere . . but who in a Marvel comic ever would? I read the comic when I was a kid from 1974-1987, and caught up on the 'Kirby years', so I am pretty familiar with the original storyline.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the casting / representation on screen of both The Thing and Reed Richards, I thought the casting, acting & dialog were all fine, even great!<br/><br/>Dr Doom: okay, they changed his origin to tie him in tighter for the 2 hour storyline. I was fine with the changes (so now he's not just a crazy person with an ugly face), I thought the dialog and Julian McMahon's acting were all acceptable.<br/><br/>Sue and Johhny Storm were another matter. I felt the movie stretched the limits of Jessica Alba's skills in interpreting the material. She is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful people in Hollywood today, but the material required more. She fared better in scenes where she had little or no dialog, just action (she seems to do fine with the physical nature of the job here). Minor quibble: she hardly looks like the Sue in the book to me. Chris Evans, the actor playing the Torch, did not look like the comic persona either. His charisma, looks and acting skills are undeniable but (compared to the comic) he seemed older and more athletic - an attempt to modernize him I suppose. He should look obviously younger than Sue (by the book), but he does not.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the effects in this film and (as a 12 year Photoshop user and 19 year professional artist) I think far too much negative criticism has been leveled at the film. Nothing like ""Mr. Fantastic"" has appeared on film to date that looked 100% realistic, period - and he is the only weak spot visually in the film. His comic-book is at the extreme threshold of believability, I assure you; and I think he will look fine on video. He looks at least as realistic as (the puppet) Yoda to me! All the flame, invisibility , and force field effects looked state-of-the-art, so those two are covered! I thought the Thing as portrayed ""in a suit"" rather than animated was a very good idea. He looked weightier and more subtle than Ang Lee's Hulk, so what is all the crowing about? Kudos to Michael Chilklis as well!!<br/><br/>No one even mentioned the sets, the Baxter Building looks absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>I sure hope that all the criticism does not kill off chances of a sequel. Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2 were better than their predecessors, and I think given the chance that the same will happen here.<br/><br/>I also hope my boyhood idol Stan Lee is proud of the film, he has every right to be. <br/><br/>Now, someone please release the 90's low-budget FF movie so everyone can see how good this current film is by comparison?"
"Brigid382","6","2","5","11 July 2005"," O.k.
","Alright let me start off by saying that I didn't dislike the movie but i wasn't thrilled with it either. I was kind of expecting more. Fist off Chris Evans rocked in this movie...I think his character was the best and he was by far the most fun to watch. Now as far as the plot went it just seemed to drag to me. I thought they spent too much time analyzing their powers and being all scientific about it and not enough time using them. I mean this is a comic superhero movie. There's supposed to be a lot of hero action stuff. There were really only two big action sequences throughout the entire movie. The first one was pretty good (the bridge scene) I'll admit I enjoyed watching it. but the finale kind of fell flat. I mean they hardly took any time to fight him at all. I mean the bad guy took the whole entire movie to become the bad guy. That kind of sucked. I mean how could they fight him if he wasn't a bad guy yet. I mean what kind of hero movie is it where you only really fight the bad guy once? Anyways that special effects were kind of boring. ""The Thing"" looked a little ridiculous and the stretching thing was just so gross to watch...my friends and i cringed every time we saw it..so if that's what you were going for u hit the nail on the head. Anyways if there is ever a second version of this movie...my advice action, action, action. There has to be more fight scenes where they use their powers. I mean way too much of this movie was analyzing and studying and really doing nothing. So if u ever get a chance to make a second one, please make it more exciting..And have a real bad guy through the whole movie. One fight scene with the bad guy just doesn't cut it."
"lfweigel88","4","2","5","11 July 2005"," Mediocre at Best
","Mediocre. Could have been a whole lot better. The sky should have been the limit with ""Fantastic Four"", but the movie stayed grounded for two excruciating hours. First off all, no one cares about The Thing's little pity party, or whether Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Women end up together, and about half the movie was spent on these two insignificant things. And the Human Torch's little rebellion should've stopped halfway through the movie, not lasted until the end, unresolved. Character development is crucial to any genre, but ""Fantastic Four"" seemed more like a seventh grade short story then a legacy that demanded a good big screen transfer. And being an action film, we wanted just a little butt kicking along with deep characters. We got neither. The first big action scene was a problem CAUSED by the Fantastic Four, and went way too long. The second actually had potential, but was over way too quickly.(It only lasted for about the last ten minutes). I was very disappointed with this movie. Marvel has it's good and bad films of late, and while this was no ""X-Men"", it didn't even beat ""Daredevil"" in my book. The characters in ""Daredevil"" actually had depth, while those in the Fantastic Four were about as thick as a sheet of paper."
"Animus","4","2","5","11 July 2005"," if only the villain had been good....
","Not a bad film, but hardly a good one. They re-wrote the background story, threw in a poor romantic subplot between Reed and Sue, The inhuman Grimm had the most human reactions of any of the characters, the action was good but the plot and story were pathetic and F/X, while beautifully done, was overblown to the point of hilarity. But the biggest disappointment was Doom, the character of Doom was a dismal conversion from the comics. This poor character was gutted from would-be World Conquering megalomaniac who combined magic and super-science and turned into a 3rd rate Norman Osboure Jr. A would-be corporate raiding CEO who gets 2 completely unrelated powers, which in itself is odd, since the rest of the people exposed got 1 power each and Doom was the best protected of the 5. Now on to what I liked, mostly the little things, Reed's befuddlement with interpersonal relationships, Johnny's hotshot attitude, Ben's mourning over his lost humanity, and the easily overlooked details like Johnny always drinking water after the change (because with an internal body temp of 200+ you DON'T give him alcohol). If Doom had been done better or if Alba hadn't been sleepwalking through her part it could have gotten a 7."

Those who don't like the movie are obviously the types who hate any movie that was not directed by them or did not come to their houses asking their opinion. After the debacle that was Daredevil I thought this movie got it right. The action was well paced and the skills were well represented. Mr. Fantastic is an easy character to make look like a cheap Stretch Armstrong ripoff but they did him quite well.

And most of the comic movies (excuse me...graphic novels) have been pretty average.<br/><br/>However, I thought this movie held up pretty well. The graphics were pretty good, the acting was adequate, and the script was great. I was not disappointed, go see this movie.<br/><br/>Note to all the 'true to the source' idiots out there...to be true to the source, you'd have to realize that these are just comics and the source is pen and ink, not real people. I thought Jessica Alba was great as Sue Storm! If she is not Aryan enough for some, too bad, you boys can go back to your closet, iron your sheets, and wait for the next rally. Why does her background have to match your expectations? I mean for hundreds of years, Jesus Christ was portrayed as white? And who complained? Who knew?

","I walked into the theatre expecting a piece of cinematic garbage. I am a comic book FREAK, and I read all of the reviews on ""R. Tomatoes."" Did I see the same movie as everybody else?! From the opening scene to the almost cliché Superman 2-esque ""street battle,"" I was taken on a wild ride. I enjoyed it much more than the overly-hyped machines that were ""Spiderman 2"" and ""Batman Begins."" The special effects were severely underrated. Critics bashed the effects as being too cheesy and fake, but they could not have been more wrong. The storyline does deviate from the actual comic book lore, but I don't remember Dr. Octavius EVER having a wife or a female character named RACHEL DAWES in the Bat series. Changes are essential. The movie is loaded with comedy, whether it's a sight gag or a one-liner. Some may frown upon the sitcom approach, but ALL comics are loaded with witty banter. The characters were also bad-ass. Chiklis, Gruffud, Evans, and Alba are fantastic together. But the real star of the movie is Julian McMahon. This Adonis of a man represented the subtle nuance required for Von Doom. I am now a ""Nip/Tuck"" fan. Thanks Julian! The only thing that prevents this movie from earning a 10 is the aforementioned climax with Von Doom. It could have been a little longer. Oh, and that theme music! It sounds like ""Roll out the Barrel"" with an 86-piece orchestra. Ottman should be ashamed of himself. Don't believe the negative feedback. Granted, this movie is no X2, but in this comic book lover's opinion, the critics should leave their egos at the door. Grab a bag of stale popcorn drowning in artificial butter flavoring, a watered down soft drink, and some costly Jujifruits and enjoy the funnest ride of the summer. Please keep all hands and feet in the ride at all times. FLAME ON!!!!"

Jessica also again brings such an innocence to these characters she's portraying! She's not ""cast"" (or chosen to play roles that she's ""HOT""), but more or less a woman whom you can't help fell in love with, because she's so pure.<br/><br/>2. Chris Evan as the Human Torch. He's the break out star of the Fantastic Four! The character brought to life (& then some) that I know & love when reading the Fantastic Four comics! He manages to steal every scene each time.<br/><br/>3. Michael Chiklis as The Thing. Who didn't want to be a Superhero as a young boy? Michael brings to screen how it's not great to be a Superhero. ((This is a complement trust me)). What I'm trying to convey is sure the character the Thing is a member of the Fantastic Four & the ""Strong Man"" but look at deformity.<br/><br/>4. Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. Julian really does have a certain Christa about him. Under used in this movie & could of been used much more.<br/><br/>Finally......every Hero has it's Villain right? Well the Villain in this review is...<br/><br/>Michael France as the writer. Ugh.

The pacing of the film was a bit slow but understandable as it is laying the foundation for this particular interpretation. <br/><br/>Julian McMahon was of course hot as usual and compelling. The tweak on the Dr. Doom angle was a bit unwelcome yet it worked in Julian's capable hands. <br/><br/>I also like the casting of the Alicia Masters character and commend Hollywood for casting people of color in so called ""traditional roles"".

","Forget all the bad reviews you may have heard, I'm not sure what the critics were expecting. Not every comic book film can be a Spider-Man or Superman.<br/><br/>Being that the film is about 4 central heroes I feel the film fleshes the characters out quite well. My disappointment was that there wasn't that much Dr. Doom in full form (he's rather weak when he's not). But this is a movie that tells us how the four became the Fantastic Four and that is more important at this point. We see the conflicts they have with one another and excepting what they have become. We will have plenty of Dr. Doom in the next installment.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of humor and I felt it was essential to a comic book movie like this. It all worked quite well too. One of my favorite moments being when The Thing sees his very own action figure. ""It's clobberin' time!"" <br/><br/>It's good comic book fun and I highly recommend it. Can't wait for the sequel!"
"bczech","7","2","5","10 July 2005"," Comic book movies don't get much better
","Let's preface this review/comment by saying this ""it's a movie based on a comic book"". Undaunted by the professional ""Critic"" reviews I attended this movie and was pleasantly entertained. It was everything I would expect...big special effects, comic book action and a great story line.<br/><br/>As compared to Citizen Kane, the Fantastic 4 is not a good movie but put it on a scale with other comic book movies it ranks just below Spiderman 2 and above Batman begins.<br/><br/>So is it all good? Not really. The casting of Jessica Alba as Susan Storm ""Invisible Girl"" was a poor decision. While the always attractive Alba does a fine job she seems to constantly be waiting for her cue to be struck. And Ioan Gruffudd seems to have trouble with his character too. While some may say that it is bad acting I felt that the problem was a complete lack of time in the story. Which brings us to the problem with the story. The Fantastic Four (comic book) is more about the interaction of the 4 individuals as one super team and their relationships, the villain/crime is more of a side-story, the producer/director spent a great deal of time building up to the obligatory confrontation. Maybe (hopefully) in a sequel they will spend more time on that relationship.<br/><br/>The biggest saving grace (or graces if that is proper) are the casting/acting of Michael Chiklis as Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm and Chris Evans as Johnny ""The Human Torch"" Storm. They have so much competence in the roles that you truly believed they were their characters, which is after all what they are supposed to do.<br/><br/>If what you are after is a fulfilling superhero movie with comic book action and fun go and see ""The Fantastic Four"", if not...then there are probably a dozen other movies showing...go see one of them."

","The Fantastic Four was my favorite title by far back in my comic collecting days. When I left the theater after seeing this film, I felt satisfied that the characters and integrity of the Fantastic Four legend were left intact. This film is basically the ""origin"" story put to film, so a lot is packed into it. Readers of the comic will notice some creative license taken with the origin, but I think what was done for the film works fine. The origin was changed to bring it up to the times (if you want to know what I mean, find a copy of the comic book origin and compare). Character development is thin, and there could have been more buildup to the climax, but this is not Shakespeare ... it's an entertaining live action comic book.<br/><br/>I'm grateful that the humor, pathos and nobility of the characters has been retained for this film. The film actually has heart, not just special effects. Hopefully it will find a sufficient audience to warrant a sequel. Now that the origin is laid out, a sequel would allow for further character and plot development.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis should be especially commended for bringing a Marvel Comics icon to life splendidly."

","Oh boy. Where do I even start? I'm not going to hate on this film. I'm only going to provide an honest review. Here we go. In a nutshell, this is an entertaining movie. It's a FUN movie. With that said, this will please more kids than anything. Teenage boys will like it for Alba (sigh), kids will like it because it's funny and fun, and everyone else might either hate it or find it at least entertaining. I fit in with everyone else. This movie was OKAY at best. I've never read the comic books, but I know enough about the Fantastic Four to say that not much justice was done to them. Reed Richards was mediocre, Sue Storm was not convincing as a character, Johnny Storm was either irritating or funny (at least true to his character), and The Thing was the one that very convincing and the only one I remotely cared for. Maybe it's because of the casting? I did not feel this to be the Fantastic Four at all. It felt more like a comedy. If it were, it would be a good one. But come on! This is the FF4! Why not be like how Spider-Man was and show us who they are? This could have been an excellent movie. But Doctor Doom, my all-time favorite Marvel villain (and perhaps the best villain) was done NO justice whatsoever. Okay, so McMahon is a decent actor. He did what he could. But there is no Victor von Doom here. Suddenly in this movie he's a comedian. Making lame jokes? Come on, that's not Doom! Perhaps there is too much Victor and not an ounce of Doom. Okay, I got that out of the way. Now let us move on to Alba as Sue Storm, which was obviously done for eye candy and eye candy only. I wanted to see her as Sue and not as Alba. With her acting skills and the bad script, Sue Storm surely seems to be invisible. I wanted this to be good, but alas this is the movie. The special effects are pretty good. The only battle scene left me saying, ""What? That's all? That's the climax battle?"" It was that unsatisfying. There really is no story here and I don't know what else to say except that it was just okay. No depth and there is almost no reason for anything that happens in this film. Maybe because Tim Story should not have directed it? I don't know, but 'Fantastic' is just not the adjective to describe this movie. It was what it COULD HAVE been, but sadly it was not. But as I said before, there is a high chance that the kids will like it, especially since it is entertaining at best =)<br/><br/>5.7/10 Stars"

It is an excellent start for a franchise. I hope they will continue to bring in fresh bad guys and not just use the same one each time. I can't understand why the HULK movie could not use the same special affects as fantastic four did with ""the thing"". I was so disappointed that the Hulk used a CGI hulk, I could not even bring myself to watch it."
"Hagia_Sophia","10","2","5","10 July 2005"," Fun Movie!
","I went to see this movie with no preconceived notions. I never read the comic books, I had only seen the previews of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought it was a fun movie! It seemed to move along well. It explained why the F4 got their powers and the affect it had on them. It also had a pretty nasty villain for them to overcome.<br/><br/>The thing I disliked most about the movie was that ""The Thing's"" wife left him. I thought that was a pretty crappy thing to do.<br/><br/>I say: Go to the theatre, buy a bag of popcorn and enjoy yourself. And, please, don't over analyze this movie. For heaven's sake, it's escapist and it's based on a comic book!"
"DrStrangeFate","Null","2","5","10 July 2005"," Great way to spend an afternoon at the movies.
","I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four and frankly did not give this movie much of a thought back when I heard a movie was being made about them. Having been a comic book fan for 30 years, I have always enjoyed the Human Torch and the Thing in their own adventures or when teamed up with another character but the Fantastic Four itself always left me flat. I have read many issues over the years but it has never really hooked me in. My kids actually wanted to see this movie more than I did (apparently there is a newer cartoon series around that got them excited about it) and so I took them on opening day to sort of get it over with.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The movie loosely follows the origin of the team and does well to illustrate the relationship between the characters. The love/hate relationship between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm, Ben's role as Reed's protector while at the same time blaming him for his situation, Sue Storm's unreturned affection for Reed, Reed's reluctant role as leader and analytical but naive reasoning. Reed's relationship with Victor Von Doom. It's all in here. There are many little things tossed in for comic fans as well... Doom's return to Latvia (presumably as ruler), Ben's raincoat and fedora, Johnny sky-writing the flaming F4 signal in the sky (which goes way back to the 1960s comic books), and a few other nice touches.<br/><br/>Although the story is flawed in parts... the whole Ben Grimm/Doom transformation part was not very well thought out. But other parts are very well done... I really like the way the relationship between Reed and Doom was explained and how the Doom character developed. Although in this movie does take it's fair share of artistic license such as Doom being with the F4 when exposed to the cosmic storm (which was not the case in the comics). I usually don't like when they fundamentally change things like this in comic-to-movie adaptations but here it actually works very well and helps explain why the relationship between Reed Richards and Dr. Doom is so venomous.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from acceptable to pretty good. Michael Chiklis was very good in both the Ben Grimm/Thing roles running the gauntlet of emotions from self-pity to reluctant hero pretty well. Jessica Alba was good but it was a little hard to believe that she would be chasing Ioan Gruffudd but did give this movie much needed sex appeal. Ioan Gruffudd did an acceptable job as Reed Richards albeit a bit bland which I'm not sure if Gruffudd's acting or the character itself is just bland. Chris Evans also did a very good job providing the humor elements and reckless nature of Johnny Storm. Julian McMahon did a splendid job as crazy old Dr. Doom and his fall from grace was well portrayed if a bit hurried. Limited screen time kept me from fully enjoying the Dr. Doom character.<br/><br/>All in all, while not perfect, this movie is a great way to spend a lazy summer afternoon. It's a fun movie with great visual effects, a decent story, and generally good acting that keeps the action humming along at a good clip. The movie plays very well for kids.. both my kids liked it very much. If I had to judge this movie against other Marvel movies I would put it above the Hulk and a little behind the first Spiderman movie and of course far above Daredevil and the Punisher."

","I'm back at home, just from the theater. By majority of votes, my friends, my girlfriend and I decided to see Fantastic 4. In fact, you do not lose yourself of much. <br/><br/>Objectively speaking, the film is well done. Casting was 2/3; the effects, good but non-impressive and sometimes very evident digitally; and story, deformed but still faithful to the likable atmosphere that characterize the comics and the animated series as well. <br/><br/>Subjectively speaking: In my opinion, these are the stronger points to favor than I can consider...<br/><br/><ul><li>The casting for Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm was excellent. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis perfectly were adapted to their character and also was very entertaining their mutual interaction.:P - How opportune they did to show the potential of each superhero without exaggerating nor underestimating. The effects in this aspect, fulfilled the expectations, coverall in the case of Human Torch and Dr. Doom. - The performance of Julian McMahon like Victor Von Doom, in spite of the deformed that was its history compared to the original idea. - The drama caused by Ben and his girlfriend, very sentimental and a good method to emphasize the racist factor of the society in which we live.</li></ul><br/><br/>Neutral points: - Neither Ioan Gruffudd nor Jessica Alba convinced me for the characters of Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Mr. Fantastic has a safer and more intelligent personality. In the film it seemed that the leader was Invisible Woman. Naturally they had to show his weak side to make the plot more interesting, and that the adults and teenagers felt identified. Still, he wasn't the Dr. Richards I imagined. As far as Alba, she gave a very good interpretation and obviously, boys were very pleased with her sexy touch, but neither she was the Sue Storm I imagined. In addition to all this, they already were together before the exhibition to the cosmic radiation. - Some special effects, like those of the elasticity of Mr. Fantastic, were very obvious at this point, but everything is forgiven. -.-"" - Dr. Doom was totally altered! Watch it for yourself. Very different, in fact, but, well, they did what they could, also is forgiven. <br/><br/>Points that can harm the film in my opinion, were the following ones: - That the film will be disappointing to so many fans of the comic, meanwhile exciting for the young audiences. - The lack of action in the film: it was a little neglected to only show a fight between 4 superhero of caliber and one of the most powerful villains in the Marvel Universe. It was easy to overcome him the first time, by brilliant that has been.<br/><br/>OK, I have finished. I recommend you to watch this movie in a 75%."
"orangefizz","6","2","5","9 July 2005"," Fantastic Four? Maybe Mediocre Four
","I have to admit that Fantastic Four was not as fantastic as I thought it would be (excuse the pun, couldn't resist). While even if you try to deal with the movie as plain silly fun, it still fails. I have to admit I do not know anything about the comic book so I was left a little clueless at certain points. But shouldn't the movie deal with telling the audience about the background information? I personally think that the movie lacked direction and could've been better, but wasn't. The actors were very beautiful and handsome, but they lacked any personality. The only one I thought did well was The Thing. The others were just sub-par. Jessica Alba, being as hot as she is, couldn't make the movie any more enjoyable.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I was questioning myself. This is it? The movie was just filled with light overused humor, along with kiddie special effects. A movie that could've been fantastic turns out flat. In my opinion it's worth a rental and well maybe go and see it in the theaters for the eye-candy. Other than that, you may want to skip it and see something else."
"androidprincesst","8","2","5","9 July 2005"," Not Spiderman, but not bad.
","Right off, this movie wasn't as good as Marvel's Spiderman movies. It was interesting to me, but I come from a Fantastic Four-loving background. I don't think someone less interested in comics could get into Fantastic Four movie the way non-comic readers could be engrossed in the first Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with the Fantastic Four was the plot wore a little thin. It was almost like they only had enough plot for 45 minutes of movie and tried to stretch it with scenes of the Human Torch (Chris Evans) doing stunts and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) breaking glasses.<br/><br/>But, on the positive side, this movie had many good points. Stan Lee had a speaking role, the scene with the Four on the bridge was impressively executed, and Ben Grimm and the Human Torch had a very good (and very funny) rivalry, as they should. Actually, most of the scenes with Ben Grimm were very well done. Michael Chiklis is quite an actor. If only certain other acting persons in the film could have done as well as he had, I could have given it a higher review.<br/><br/>However, despite its faults, I did enjoy the movie. In fact, the closing scenes with the team pulling together to defeat Doom were beautiful in a way. I think that scene would win back the casual fan that lost interest. But maybe I'm off base with my remarks. You tell me if it's good."
"Darcsyde01","Null","2","5","9 July 2005"," Good, simple fun
","I've read, and re-read some of the threads on the boards for this, and I have to ask, ""Did we see the same movie? I thought the move was really well made, and, for what it was suppose to be, just a good time. This isn't ""Cinderella Man"" or ""War of the Worlds (which ROCKED BTW), but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to be F-U-N,..that's it, that's all, and it succeeded in all aspects. The cast was well thought out, and performed their parts admirably. The humor between the characters kept the story lively, and (here's that word again) fun. Ben's angst over his transformation into The Thing was palpable, without pulling the movie into ""Punisher"" level, which is NOT what the FF is all about. The relationship between Reed and Sue was believable with him completely clueless as to how to deal with the woman he loves,and her as a woman frustrated when the man she loves, can't seem to get a clue. (I know people just like them, trust me.) And with Johnny, he's the gut you alternate between wanting to throttle one second (when he goes overboard) and envying the next (in his reckless abandon, and ability to get the girls) The story was interesting, and kept you moving along at a rapid pace, and the special effects were,..well,..INCREDIBLE! Michael Chiklis's range of emotions really came through through all that make up, enabling you to laugh, or cry with him. I've been hearing a lot of noise and people b***hing about ""miscasting"" because of Miss Alba's mixed heritage, and that the character of Alicia Masters is portrayed by a black lady,..SO FRIIIKN' WHAT? Didn't we all hear the same moaning and groaning about Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin in ""Daredevil? And he did a wonderful job! Both actresses did a fine job in their respective roles, and the fact Alicia was black just cemented the idea that it's not what you look like outside, but what's inside that counts. She (very pretty lady) was attracted to what was inside Ben, not his rocky exterior, and he was attracted to her in-spite of her race, or handicap. A lesson, I've noticed reading these boards, we could all use. All in all, I enjoyed this movie ,and everything with it. I consider myself a large movie fan, and a fan of WELL-DONE comic book movies, and I will be adding this gem to my collection when it arrives on DVD. I am also looking forward to any sequels!"
"mattshaw","8","2","5","9 July 2005"," Entertaining - Not bad
","Fantastic Four was my favorite comic when growing up. More than other comics of the period, it focused on the lives and and personalities of the characters. The movie does a perfect job in transferring these characteristics to the big screen. These were never extremely complicated characters. All of the actors do at least a passable job of recreating these personalities. The movie is fun and entertaining and thus achieves the first rule of any entertainment - it is entertaining. Even though they took liberties with the Doom storyline, he is still a good villain and acted well. Ben is clobber'in, Sue is mediating, etc. They may not be the XMen, but they are true to the comics I grew up reading and were very satisfying to watch on that level. I recommend it as a light and satisfying entertainment. I do not understanding much of the heavy criticism I have read here."
"ray-z19","8","2","5","8 July 2005"," Good movie overall, loved the special effects, not a bad plot..
","decent movie. Some lines were quite cheesy, i wont say which ones. You'll find out when someone says something in the movie that sounds corny, and no one in the theatre is laughing..The superpowers that they had were all depicted really well. The love story between Reed and Susan isn't anything spectacular but it does fill the role of a mini love-story i guess. All the actors were pretty good. I found the guy playing Torch to be really entertaining, really funny. Thing was good too. He was the most emotional out of all the characters, and brought a lot of real life issues to the movie. Susan storm was OK, but it was probably because she is hooooot...aha. Reed is decent in the movie as well and did a good job portraying the ""leader type"" role. The action was quite ""fantastic"", and had effects that were unbelievable at times, especially with the fire scenes. Overall the movie was entertaining. I don't follow the comics so i cant comment on that aspect but i enjoyed it as a regular viewer looking to be entertained in a Friday night out. Anyone who wants to see a movie, and not criticize it for ""bad acting"", ""stupid plot"", etc should just go see the movie. In my opinion movies are made to be enjoyed, not critiqued. I've seen a lot of negative comments about this movie but i thought it was good enough for at least an 8/10. Peaceout."

Ioan was the best looking science geek I've ever seen and he had a good command of book smart/life dumb Reed. Johnny was annoying, just like I recalled his character. But Michael Chiklis was the best and truly, I didn't expect to like him in this part. I thought he captured Ben wonderfully and really felt for him. Alba was okay as Sue, she had her moments which was a lot more than I expected of her. <br/><br/>Some of the dialogue was stilted. I reminded myself this was a comic book and they had to tell the story from the beginning so the uninformed in the audience knew what was going on. Mostly it worked.<br/><br/>I thought the effects, especially the storm, were very cool. I wouldn't want to spoil it for those who want to see the film but they are just enough and not too ""comic book"". <br/><br/>One warning. There were lots of little kids in the film, and some were probably too little. When Doom got started, at least one kid started crying. His manner of terminating employees could be a bit much for little ones. <br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER <br/><br/>And don't be too quick to leave your seat after THE END."

Also, when he decides to turn himself back, its not even half the time that it took him to get to that form than the first time.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba was a little....""eh"", like someone else who commented, ""she cant act.""

Disappointing entry for the genre that has a sorry story, old special effects and uneven characters. Alba and Gruffudd's past romance becomes tiring fast, Evans is a woman-crazed nut who takes his powers as a grain of salt and Chiklis is a depression-inducing character whose background and dilemma seem totally out of place in this picture. McMahon's power-crazed mega-billionaire provides flashes of interest, but the production's tone when dealing with him is so dark and disturbing that he too seems like he is in the wrong movie. DC Comics' 1960s invention was old and tired even back then because superheroes were nothing new. Hanna & Barbera's animated take on the comics were never anything noteworthy either and thus it becomes a bit of a mystery why anyone ever believed the premise would translate to the silver screen. I guess we are just going through another superhero movie surge in Hollywood right now. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

Less-than-stellar and barely 'fantastic' adaptation of the cult classic Marvel comic books quartet of reluctant superheroes (for the uninitiated : egghead scientist Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (a wan Gruffudd); Sue Storm/The Invisible Girl, an astrophysicist (a seemingly miscast Alba  who don't get me wrong fills out her sleek costume nicely but I'd have been pleased with say Naomi Watts); her hot-headed brother/pilot Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Evans, the only one clearly having fun with his new-found fame); and astronaut curmudgeon Ben Grimm/The Thing (Chiklis, the best of the bunch emoting under a ton of latex wonder) who gain their other-worldly powers in a freak accident in a cosmic quest to study DNA with fellow victim/financial backer and rival cum villain Victor Von Doom AKA Dr. Doom (McMahon relishing his role as the ultimate comics baddie) who has plans of his own for domination. The special effects are average in comparison to the recent crop of big-screen adaptation of comic book heroes but the screenplay by Michael France and Mark Frost is strenuously terrible with some truly awful dialogue that sound horrendous when delivered. Director Tim Story also seems out of his element in the big action sequences that could've added more juice to the storyline and the amazing characters (again Chiklis gets to shine even with the expert make-up by Bart Mixon) that has so much more potential that if a sequel is in the midst one hopes it'll be even more fantastic than this disappointment."

","The magic and majesty of the Fantastic Four franchise is tarnished for all time with this poor excuse for a motion picture incarnation. Lacking in everything necessary and required of a super hero movie, this is a film that never captures one's imagination. This is basically because it is unimaginative, hackneyed, and dull. The actors who portray the legendary characters seem to all believe that just wearing a costume will suffice and nothing else is needed. There is no heart or soul to these beings and they have no charisma or dynamics. As far as special effects, this production supposedly had a 100 million dollar budget. That's $100,000,000!

"lythis-love","3","2","6","1 March 2019"," did my laundry while watching the movie
","I love the marvel series and every attempt to make new movies and introducing new superheroes into our world. I never read any Comics, so my critics go to this film as a standalone.<br/><br/>I found that I guessed the plot of this within the first 5minutes of the movie. But the holes were so deep, I tried to fold my Pants with a sock, I was so confused.
I admit to have started grining when I saw Cole from Charmed as the supposed villain in the movie. He already played highly evil characters before, so I though he fitted very well. But admittedly I wished him a bit more evil as in my opinion he did not deserve a strong Name like Dr. Doom.
Right after Doom they introduced Storm as the female main character. I think they wanted to make her intelligent and she was some sort of scientist. But to me she seemed the shallow Assistent to Doom who would fall for him, as he was his Boss and had lots of power and Money.<br/><br/>I don´t even know how but in the next 3 minutes they already been up in space! Of course today, there is no Need for a Special Training to go into space. That was quite to fast! Also this predictible Scene from Storm: Oh look, we got some super tight and stretchy suits now which I will present to the audience with my perfect Body so everyone overlooks my lack of acting.
Ben the big Bloke was all over with his love to his wife and everyone new, you could relay on this guy. Well up in the air some sort of wild storm hit the Crew. They Kind of misscalculated the time it will appear, but they never explained why an how. Ben later just said, this is nature. Deal with it.<br/><br/>Magicly they all survived and been transported to some expensive private Hospital, thanks Mr. Doom!
They all been in quarantine, as knowbody yet knew if they were.. infectious?
In the Marvel University quarantine obviously means, you can hang out with each other outside on the balcony, be in the Cafeteria or even go to a snowboardtrip with your Nurse??? Stupidest Thing I've ever heard.
When the Nurse entered the room of a patient she didn't even weare gloves or a protective mouth cover.<br/><br/>Anyway here they discovered their new powers. OMG the Scene with Reed, sliding his Hand trough the gap of the door! I had to cover my eyes, it was to painfull to watch this mess of CGI Animation.<br/><br/>Well they discovered Ben had gone so they followed him back to NY. The doctors or what obvioulsy lifted quarantine as they .. well just left allthough theire powers have just emerged and nobody knows what they are?!<br/><br/>Ben made to NY with the Train? From top of some mountains right into the City he phoned his wife from the Corner in front of his house, to call her down and meet her. At the window you could see her waiting in a negligee. Well she just went down on the streets with only her negligee! Right on the streets with everyone watching. When she saw Ben she ran away, obviously scared. Can't believe anyone gave their OK to direct this ridiculous Scene.<br/><br/>The Trio heard Ben would be at the End of the Bridge... which could be any Bridge and any End. But they tried to meet up. Ben meanwhile had Trouble to addept to his new Looks, which he did quite well. He portrayed the confusion and addepting excellent.
Ben got into a huddle with someone who was about to commit suicide. And he Kind of saved him but also caused a huge Crash with like tweenty others who surely got injured. The fantastic Trio was also in the traffic jam and of course knew.. this had to ben? Why would they guess that. They haven't even seen him fully transformed.
This Scene though: There was a hold up and People watching the chaos. Reed suggested that Storm must use her invisibilty to get in front of the line. First of all: and to do what? She undressed infront of all the People, predictibly switching between visibillity and invisibility. I don*t know if we should have laughed or whistled.. I was just embarassed how flat this scene was made. When she eventually got infront of the line... she couldn't do anything and Reed and Johny also were just in front. WHAT WAS THE POINT? Was it really that obvious, give Jessica a Chance to Show off?
As this wasn't enough Ben's wife turned up (How did she know he was there? How could she come through the traffic?) and left her ring on the ground. It was very sad.. and confusing.
So it seemed they needed to find out about theire powers. Best place was Reeds Science lab in a huge loft on a top Building in NY. Stuffed with loads of devices, Equipment and medical Hardware. I heard him saying he was broke and had no Money...?! The Filmmakers really think the audience is stupid.<br/><br/>The Tests they made also were so laughable and completly senseless!What Kind of metal holds the temperature of the sun? If he was Close so become a supernova.. why wasn't the building and City around already been smushed into ashes? How can they x-ray or what Bens Skin and organs without shielding themselves. Also this is supposed to be an unknown structure and material.
I had no Idea what Kind of mirror or glass this was when they figured out Storm really was invisible. Why did he have to look through magnifying glass to see, if she really was invisible? Also there was this forced lovething between them. I could never have seen them as a couple, there was no chemistry whatsoever. Only Storm looking hot and Reed was a geek. The didn't fit at all. They put in a horrible Montage of everyone experimenting with theire new abilities - but they made it into a 1990 version. Until that I would have enjoyed the movie if was 9 years old.<br/><br/>In all between Van Doom became Dr. Doom. His Transformation took Ages to complete, also nothing really happened.<br/><br/>The following Storyline included mainly the four bickering over each other, Johny living his new life and Ben separates from the Group while Storm and Reed seem to fall for each other again. The whole city seemed to celebrate the FF although really they only reapired the damage they have caused themselves. And the all loyal true husband how loved debby so much.. found a new Girl in a bar. Just as plain as that.<br/><br/>Of course there had to come the fight against Doom were all of the four eventually unite and fight as a Team. They just figured it out within the last 5 minutes. There was like on Scene where I found a bit of acting from Alba. When she had to hold the storm of fire! I believed her. Although I wondered : At first Storm had to repell the fist of doom and she cried out, she couldn't hold it longer. Someone else took over. The Endscene of the fight however included her Holding against a supernova. And she did alright with that.<br/><br/>So now let me tell you about the end where I shoutet out loud: The four celebratet on a boat (Why didn't it sink with Ben transformed into the the Thing?) and there was the Blind one, Alicia. And Ben already seemed completly in love and forgotten his wife Debby which he mentioned like ten times in the moviè? That made me really angry at the end.. as if marriage and love was just something you Switch like your underwear. No great values they trying to teach us in the film."
"Leofwine_draca","2","2","6","11 July 2016"," Alongside Green Lantern this is the nadir of the modern superhero genre
","While superhero flicks have never been my favourite type of movies, I've always been willing to give them a go, and I've enjoyed most I've watched in recent years. Sadly, FANTASTIC FOUR is not one of those movies; it's one of the most appalling superhero films I've watched, worse than the camp classics of the 1960s and the cheesiness spawned during the 1980s. The movie fails because it has no heart; it goes through the motions without ever offering anything anywhere near profound, exciting, or indeed interesting. Despite a workable premise, the film seems to steal bits from SPIDER-MAN, THE FLY, and many other classic movies, throwing them together into a jumbled mess that just gets worse as it goes on.<br/><br/>You can't blame the cast. Well, you can, but at least there are a couple of good performers in there; namely Ioan Gruffudd and Michael Chiklis. Chiklis, the bald, hulking anti-hero of TV series THE SHIELD lends solid value as The Thing, a man made out of rock, but too often he's made the butt of jokes, and he never becomes more than a walking man-mountain. Ioan Gruffudd looks as smooth and dashing as he did in KING ARTHUR, but he's similarly wasted, left standing around and looking wooden throughout. At least he's better than newcomer Chris Evans, who'll make you want to smash his teeth in about ten seconds after you first saw him. Jessica Alba, who managed to do sexy in SIN CITY, is equally bad here, reaching new lows of blandness. The bad guy, a villain named Doctor Doom, should be scary or Willem Dafoe style OTT, but instead it's the slick, slimy and miscast Julian McMahon who just kind of slides through the film without making an effort.<br/><br/>The special effects in the film are surprisingly bad. Alba, as the Invisible Woman, has an okay look, but you can't really do much with invisibility that hasn't been done before. The Human Torch is better; the effects of him flying through the air and burning are decent, with a flashy, expensive look to them. Sadly, it's Gruffudd's Mr. Stretchy that lets the side down; his elongated body looks like nothing more than the CGI effect which it is. THE X-FILES underplayed it when Doug Hutchinson was cannibalistic serial killer Eugene Victor Tooms; any episode of that show is miles better than this trash.<br/><br/>Superhero films are usually noted for their large scale action set-pieces, and there's a halfway decent show-stopper here, as a fire engine threatens to crash off a massive bridge. Unfortunately that's the only good bit you're going to see. The ending is particularly weak, so much so that you'll have forgotten it a day after watching; I seem to remember somebody asking what happens to metal when it rapidly cools, but to be honest I was struggling to stay awake at that point. FANTASTIC FOUR is without a doubt the nadir of superhero films, and let us pray that they don't make another."

I'm not a fan of it nope but come on guys it wasn't that bad it's not terrible and really rottentommatoes what the hell why does this movie has a 26% on rotten tomatoes it is not all that bad like how critics said it was it should probably get a 50's but 27 come on. Acting may e was not good like for example. Chris Evans was great in the fil m I think he is a great human torch and johnny storm. Michael chiklis was a good ben Grimm now that's the real ben. Jessica alba is hot in the movie well she doesn't fit as sue storm but I didn't think her acting was all that bad. But ioan gruffudd acting was not good oh no not great I think he was a bad reed Richards he didn't even try. Yeah don't think it was that bad I kind of like it and the fight scenes were kind of mehhhhhh mediocre but hp yeah that's all. 7.2/10"

","The reviews of the movie were nothing but terrible, but I thought to watch it anyway. And I was very surprised to find that I was enjoying the movie and thought why was this getting such terrible reviews? Then the superhero thing happens, and as soon as the main characters obtain their superpowers, the movie takes a hairpin turn and manages to self destruct. I had never seen a movie that take such a turn in quality so suddenly, and when the end comes it feels like someone had just poured a bucket of cold water on you.<br/><br/>Such a shame, it seemed like it was leading up to something great but it just decided to give up. I can't help thinking there is a good movie in there somewhere."

","I though this movie sucked so bad. I went to see it in the theaters and i enjoyed it there, cuz it was big, and i could hear all the sounds and well... i was 9 back there!! Now i see it and its stupid as hell. I only liked the jokes and funny parts. Who would choose these casting to play superheroes together? no way. First they put Ioan Gruffud as REED RICHARDS????? Poor Stan Lee. I would rather have Sam Rockwell as Reed. I know he gave the best he had and it wasn't horrible, but he just doesn't look like Reed. Sorry Ioan, go back to the Dalmatians. Omg. Chris Evans as Human Torch. Does it sound sweet to you? Me either. I don't like his acting very much. He always has the same looks, hes boring, but he isn't that bad as Captain America. At least not as bad as Human Torch. But okay. Next on the list: Michael Chiklis. I honestly like this actor, and i liked him as Ben Grimm, but as the THING? Not at all. Sorry Michael, u just didn't deliver, even if u had some good emotional moments. Last but not least(get it? ahah as bad as the others? bad joke sorry :P) Jessica Alba. Shes gorgeous everyone knows, shes hot and all but, acting?, really?. Nah. Go make Sin City movies or spirit movies and leave Sue alone. AND NOW FOR THE CATEGORY OF THE WORST CAST EVER MADE: Julian McMahon...... Im sick just to thing that he got to play the bad guy in this movie.. Dr.Von Doom... disgrace.. The effect were really good in my opinion, i liked to see them falling from the building, but he hes better with the mask, and still not good or suitable for that really bad and strong villain. Thats my thought what do you think?"
"TheDarkPhoenix85","5","2","6","6 November 2005"," A lackluster and brainless mediocrity
","Fantastic Four's debut is a stale and pedestrian introduction to the superhero genre. Unlike Spider-man and X-men, and Batman Begins, it's a standout film due to its light-heartedness. But it is notch below the belt, not because the F4 weren't dark enough, but because they are too minor-league as superheroes. They're just too boring and too self-loathing for folks to care about. A novice-like director like Tim Story is just too one-dimensional for such a project; the film's special effects and the set pieces look cheap (I'm guessing because of the film's budget) instead of mind-blowing and thrilling; while the screenplay is half-baked & clichéd instead of dramatic, comedic or romantic. The movie is meant to establish things just to keep them moving. But there's nothing going on for the 4 once they're zapped by the cosmic storm. Instead of showing off their super- cool powers, ¾ of the film is spent on the 4 characters being bunched up in Reed Richards' pad arguing and moping about how they wan t to be normal, while Reed searches for a cure to what they call their ""disease"". Jesus, this is a superhero film for crying out loud. This is supposed to be a film about a group of ordinary civilians who get zap by cosmic rays, gain super powers, and fight crime. Whenever you have heroes that suck at their game, at least you want the villain to prove otherwise. But for Dr. Doom, the motive is about blaming people for his stupid mistakes and go off to kill them. Alas, his skin is affected by the rays; turning into metallic metal that conducts electricity. <br/><br/>The notion to cast Jessica Alba as Sue Storm was pretty idiotic. If a chick with the acting chops & good looks as Alba is given a role as a quintessential female who's a Genetic Researcher & M.I.T grad, then you'll probably have trouble letting it all sink in. But I think the writers know this (just a theory); otherwise why cast this woman for a role as a ""Genetic Researcher"", make her wear eyeglasses and not give her anything intelligent to do or say? Ioan Gruffudd is such a disappointment, and that's because he's the lead. If you thought Alba was the main defender, then you'd better pay attention to Gruffudd's work and you'll see that this guy has some talent. But in sheer irony, he sadly sucks hard in this film; giving the most boring performance ever. Sure, Reed Richards is an absent-minded genius and an introverted sap, but even he has some traits good enough to make him interesting. Chris Evans is fair as Johnny Storm the Human Torch and that's only because Johnny is the only character with personality. Johnny is the only member of the foursome who embraces his newfound gifts; he sort of help keeps the crowd from giving up on these losers. Michael Chiklis is the only redeeming thing going here; given somewhat, a distracting latex suit to don as the Thing. Nothing about Julian McMahon is the essence of ""Doom."" He's just a handsome face, and there's nothing menacing or villainous about him. <br/><br/>Not that I was expecting realism from a comic-book film, but there's no excuse for any lack of logic. After a colossal car accident on the Brooklyn Bridge, Sue Storm is asked by Reed Richards to go invisible (but her powers aren't allowing her to do the same to her clothes). So she strips down in order for her and her friends to get pass the crowd, but she and the others still had trouble getting pass them. To me, she would've had trouble getting pass the crowd whether she was invisible or not. Maybe this could've helped if she had the power to teleport.<br/><br/>The action scenes (count 2) are sloppy and shortincluding the final battle between the FF and Dr. Doom. The heroes easily defeat Doom without breaking a sweat? It's like: ""Man, Dr. Doom turned into metal all this time just to get his ass kick?"" How pathetic.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is just a mess. It may be good for the kidssince kids can't tell the difference between bad jokes and bad dialogue from good ones, and they'll go for the campy vibe that the film has, though there are some innuendo every now an then. But anyone old enough to buy alcohol, or have an I.Q higher then their waist measurements might avoid this film at all cost."

","Well, most people will tell you that Fantastic Four isn't a good movie. These people include so-called film critics, comic book geeks, and plain idiots.<br/><br/>Well, I am a comic book geek, fancy myself an amateur film critic, and have done some idiotic things in my life. And I still liked Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>It is an exciting, thoughtful cinematic adaptation of Stan ""The Man"" Lee and Jack ""King"" Kirby's creation, the Fantastic Four, the comic book that ushered in the ""Marvel Age"" of comics that gave us such characters and filmic fodder as Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Incredible Hulk, and Daredevil, among many others.<br/><br/>The film got many things right - Ben Grimm's horror at becoming the rock-skinned Thing, Reed and Sue's love-hate-love relationship, and Johnny Storm's shear love of being the Human Torch.<br/><br/>More questionable is the portrayal of Julian McMahon's Doctor Doom, which was changed quite a bit from his comic book counterpart. Well, I believe the dark, demented, jealousy-driven spirit of Victor Von Doom was still there, and a bit more fleshed out and realistic.<br/><br/>The humor was spot on, as was the drama, and you really felt sorry for these guys, especially Ben. Marvel's track record of edgy, depressed characters began here with the Thing, and in Michael Chiklis' tortured portrayal, he really shines.<br/><br/>I recommend those of you who have not seen Fantastic Four to see it, with objectivity and the idea of just having a good time. I just feel that when the spirit of the source material remains, a film adaptation can be good, and Fantastic Four is good.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

You should give it a chance and odds are you'll be entertained enough to recommend it to a friend. <br/><br/>Although many comic fans will be upset at the rewrite of Doom's transformation into Doctor Doom it doesn't taint the experience enough to sour the movie. The actor playing Johnny Storm (forgive me I do not know his name) does a perfect job bringing the personality of the comic book Human Torch to the big screen.<br/><br/>All in all, you should go see it."

","Stan Lee had a cameo part in the Fantastic Four (Mailman) as he did in The Hulk (Security Guard), I wonder why he didn't get a listing in the credits on the website? I think that it is great that Mr. Lee is included in the movies he had a part in creating. Too bad more people (creators & writers) don't do this. The Fantastic Four is a great display of the characters, but I was a bit disappointed in the fact that Ben Grimm (human form) was not played by an actor that looked more like the comic book form. Also as an avid reader of the original comic books, I have to say that there could have been a better job done in continuity of characters, the comic book Johnny Storm was not nearly as much a smart ass as he is in the movie, nor was he the public showoff."

It had some fun humor...OK, it was kind of ""campy"" humor in spots, but hey... what can be more fun than a silly joke or gag? I thought the story was interesting, especially since I personally did not know the history of how they came to be the Fantastic Four.

Still, the final showdown with Dr. Doom was actually enjoyable to watch than the 2015 remake's ""final showdown"" since that one sucked so much, I was left very bitter at the end.<br/><br/>So, I suppose, if you're like really to see a perfect representation of a big-budget Fantastic Four movie, you're not gonna get it with this movie, but...I would suggest that you skip to the final showdown with Dr. Doom since that actually felt like a real Fantastic Four fight scene, and like I said before, you're better off with the Incredibles, instead.

","Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) & Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). All set off on a space mission that sees them engulfed by a mysterious storm that imbues them all with different special powers.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is arguably the most loved on the page of the super-group comic book creations. Certainly it's Marvel's flagship offering in that corner of the super hero market. Odd then, that when it finally makes it to the big screen they throw money at it but employ the director of ""The Firing Squad"" & ""Taxi""? The whole film reeks of nervousness, with director Tim Story either fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie, or worse still, being directed himself by studio executives fearful of making a hash of said flagship movie. While the casting of Gruffud (dull), Alba (cleavage for hire) and McMahon (out of his depth as a villain) beggars belief. Sloppy CGI fails to ignite what little action there is, while the final smack down as our intrepid 4 battle with Von Doom, is of a TV movie standard. Yet it still has a smidgen of fun about it to warrant investing a damp dark afternoon with.<br/><br/>Chiklis and Evans are the plus points, the former injecting a bit of heart into proceedings and the latter some sexiness and some much needed humour. There's also some worth in the script's attempt at messaging about the perils and pitfalls of celebrity status. While who can deny that the first appearance of ""flame-on"" & ""clobbertime"" doesn't induce an ickle tingle down the spine of the discerning comic book fan (ok that may just be me hankering for my youth). If only the film wasn't so safe and had been in better hands. But hey! the film turned over a $230 million Worldwide profit, so what do I know eh? The sequel was inevitable, so one can only hope that with the same people involved they not only learn from their guardedness, but that they manage to stay faithful to the source and give it some much needed pizazz.<br/><br/>Footnote: The extended cut at twenty minutes longer, suffice to say, is a better experience as it has more pizazz. So 5/10 for the theatrical cut and 6/10 for the extended version."
"gigan-92","5","1","2","27 January 2011"," Pretty Redundant
","Probably one of my least favorite of the super hero genre. I never really cared for the Fantastic Four from the get go against Marvel giants like Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Hulk. They seemed, how do I putt this, lame? The characters are uninvolving and bore you to death with predictable, campy and almost childish performances. Ioan Gruffudd as a lead was dismal, unheroic and came off as an extremely lackluster protagonists. Chris Evans did his role so pathetically generic I felt like I was watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon. Jessica Alba, even reduced own to her underwear, could not sway me to forgive her pitiful performance. None of the characters came off as likable , and I don't really care if they fail or succeed, so in the end the film basically never even got my full attention. Michael Chiklis' character was the only interesting one really, but that's just one character amongst so many failed ones.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon plays the main antagonists and where as he does pretty decent, two big hitters: (1) his whole story arc seems like a rip-off from the first ""Spider-man"" film back in 2002, no explanation needed, and (2) he's barely in the movie. I mean at times I literally forgot there was even a villain at all.<br/><br/>The story feels pathetic as well, filled with pointless scenes of juvenile arguments, montages galore, cheesy romantic lines; this film rally works hard to make you cringe at every turn. Compounded is the fact that the film offers little action. There was pretty cool scene at the bridge, but the climatic end battle was incredibly short and was over in under three minutes.<br/><br/>Director Tim Story has reached a new pinnacle though: the biggest waste of millions of dollars I've seen in film making in a long time."
"Ziya90","6","1","2","29 May 2010"," I was not disappointed, may be because I hadn't any particular expectation
","Many people, or let's say the haters complain that Fantastic Four was too non serious, it was not dark at all and it was not entertaining, probably because of that. I can throw out that the second part is not true and also the first part is not a flaw. Why? Because Fantastic Four is not a dark comic book anyway like Batman for example and it is not too non serious (so unbearable) as they say. Yes, there are a lot of humor, funny scenes, funny dialogs, but firstly it is balanced (believe me, it is much more balanced than Peter Parker's dance in Spider Man 3!) Secondly it is fun and thirdly there are enough, satisfactory action that answers the humor. Fantastic Four is better than, even much better than some other super hero movies such as Superman Returns, Daredevil, Iron Man 2 or The Incredible Hulk. I will tell you something weird. For example, Iron Man 2 was very disappointing to me, because there was much humor, but less action, I got bored at times. As for Fantastic Four, it is director is a comedy-origin director, Tim Story you know and yes Fantastic Four includes lots of humor, lots of funny stuff as I said, but somehow it makes you satisfied on action, excitement and entertainment. May be the best side of the movie was that the director focuses on the changes of the four very much, the process that they explore their power, the use of these powers, at times, especially Johnny uses his powers just for fun. I so enjoyed these parts, because simply it was entertaining that to watch those ordinary people while they use their special abilities after gaining and of course this is the good side of it, their abilities make their life easier. The characters were likable, I liked especially Redd and Johnny. And these four people has four different personalities. Reed is a well behaved, polite guy, Johnny (in fact the deepest character in the movie) is womanizer, show-off, narcissist, fame hungry, a teaser etc. Ben Grimm is a helpful, a bit soft hearted and at the same time rude guy and knows his responsibilities, even if the decision he takes is too confusing. As for Sue, she has not any remarkable characteristic, but no problem. And Victor Doom. He is a playboy, a power driven man and he is the fifth, the one who becomes bad. The movie shows us if people who have these personalities gain special powers, what would they do?, who would they become? Step by step! Just because of this, the movie cannot be bad! Iron Man 2 had much amusement, but too less action, why people did not complain and they rated it high? When it comes Fantastic Four, they say just simply bad, because it is so amusing? Therefore, I see Fantastic Four as a kind of scapegoat. I was satisfied with action, there is not lots of action in Fantastic Four let's be honest, but it was satisfactory and at the same time, the movie was not boring at all, of course it changes according to everybody but. Returning to action, it has not lots of as said, not great, but really entertaining, especially the rocket scene was cool."

","Fantastic Four is certainly by no stretch of the imagination anyone's favourite superhero film. Perhaps that's partly to do with the fact that the Fantastic Four aren't your conventional superheroes by any stretch of the imagination. Their a dysfunctional 'family' of sorts with no 'secret identities' and masks to hide behind, no identity issues and certainly not quite so unbelievably noble and heroic (at least not in the beginning). The truth is that Fantastic Four is certainly not meant to be a serious superhero film or an epic or anything like that. The Fantastic Four are not meant to be larger than life legends like Superman or Spiderman. They are ordinary flawed human beings who are either over-awed, freaked out or downright depressed over their newfound abilities. The film itself is supposed to be a 'fun film'. If it appears campy, then that's the intention of the screenwriters. Because lets face it, there are enough epic tales of the spawning of great heroes (Superman, Batman Begins, Iron Man) and enough tales of super-beings tormented by their powers and by the world (The Incredible Hulk, the X-men trilogy), so its fitting that there is at least one film that is more light-hearted and has a 'coolness' and 'feel good' factor about it. One of the more appealing aspects of the film are that its protagonists don't have any complex characterization like most superheroes have. Their characters are an open book to us right from the start and their reactions are quite predictable throughout the film. Reed Richards (Ion Gruduff) is the cautious ever-analytic scientist who is curious and concerned about the team's mysterious new powers. Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) is the mature and orderly woman who detests the abnormality of her's and her friends predicament. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is easily the team's source of comic relief; he's the hot-headed youngster who enjoys his powers. Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkins) is the film's tragic hero who hates his transformation into the monstrous 'Thing' but gradually comes to accept his powers. Grimm is the only character whose characterization drastically changes and evolves over the course of the film. If the film has a flaw, its in its villain, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahan). While the idea of linking the Fantastic Four's origins with that of their archenemy is a pretty good idea, and the changes in Doom's backstory makes his rivalry with Mr. Fantastic more apparent, Doom's characterization and motivation itself is pretty lacking. We understand that he is a man craving for power, but what he intends to do with that power apart from killing people and damaging public property is never clearly explained. The final fight sequence between the Four and Doom, though pretty exciting, could have been longer and more elaborate. Instead, the Fantastic Four beat Doom in something like five minutes! which is thoroughly dissatisfying. All in all, Fantastic Four is a great film if you accept it for what it is and overlook its minor flaws."

","When I heard Chris Evans had been cast as 'The Human Torch' in a movie of 'The Fantastic Four', I fell off my chair. Fortunately, it turned out not to be the annoying ex-Radio One D.J., but an American actor of that name.<br/><br/>Following the successful 'Spider-Man' and 'X-Men' movies, it seemed inevitable Hollywood would get round to doing the F.F. - Marvel's first smash-hit comic, launched in 1961.<br/><br/>Four people risk their lives flying into outer space - scientist Reed Richards, his best friend Ben Grimm, girlfriend Sue Storm, and her headstrong brother Johnny Storm - where they are exposed to cosmic radiation. Back on Earth, they find they have each been blessed with super powers - Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band, Sue becomes invisible, Johnny bursts into flame without getting burnt himself, and poor Ben changes into a grotesque orange monster that resembles an unfinished statue. They become media darlings; Reed is nicknamed 'Mr.Fantastic', Ben 'The Thing', Johnny 'The Human Torch' and Sue 'The Invisible Woman'.<br/><br/>The movie sticks to this origin story but with one major difference - arrogant industrialist Victor Von Doom goes along for the ride. He becomes progressively insane, his skin peeling away to expose metal. He dons a mask to become 'Doctor Doom'.<br/><br/>When I saw this originally my first reaction was that it would have made a decent pilot for a television series. As a cinema movie it was a bit of a let-down, boasting little by way of spectacular action ( apart from an extended scene on a bridge and the climactic battle in a street ). Doom did not have any major plots to conquer the world up his sleeve, other than a determination to defeat the F.F.<br/><br/>The special effects were fine, and the cast portrayed the characters well ( Michael Chiklis being an outstanding 'Thing' ), but the lack of action sequences proved a handicap. Fortunately, the movie performed well enough at the box office to warrant a superior sequel; 2007's 'Rise Of The Silver Surfer'.<br/><br/>The other thing ( no pun intended ) I liked about the picture was that it eschewed the dark, angst-ridden approach favoured by the likes of other superhero movies such as 'Batman Begins'. 'Fantastic Four' was bright, colourful, fun to watch, which is just how it should be.<br/><br/>And Stan Lee's 'Willie Lumpkin' cameo was his best to date!"

And trying not to be too harsh with this one although it was entertaining on the whole it felt more like a let down. Based loosely on the Ultimate Fantastic Four the film tries to keep in spirit with the comic book however the problems are very clear and present from the very start. The first problem is that it moves way way to fast and thusly gives no time for character development which just makes the movie seem like a brainless action movie and does not make us care about the characters , something which I found very disappointing giving that I grew up on the cartoons and comics. The script just seemed very superficial that even I could memorise it without any problems. Although the actors done good with what they had it felt that just like Topher Grace as Venom they had very little to work with I would have to say that stand out performances were from Julian McMahon as Dr Doom apart from that the movie was nothing special at all.

","I saw this film a a few weeks ago on the New Year telly, and out of the choice there was of things to watch, this film was the right one. In admittance I had seen the second film first and thought that it wasn't bad either, though everyone had said that it was a big improvement on the first. So when I settled down to watch the first film I braced my self for a film that was, 'so bad it's just bad', but was completely surprised that the film wasn't bad at all, in my opinion it was actually quite good.<br/><br/>In fact as the film got to 30 minutes in I was sat trying to work out what was supposed to be so bad about this film? It had good pace, nice comedic moments and enjoyable, likable and fun characters, there was some heart in there to and the CGI was good and the action in the film is not too much as to over shadow everything else. So I thought that perhaps the problem would be that as the film went on that the end was to be a let down, many a film has been destroyed by a bad middle or pathetic ending, but no the film seemed to be well laid out and at a good pace.Some people I've asked have said that the film was cheesy, but the film is cheesy in a good way, like the new series of Doctor Who is and I believe that the Fantastic Four wasn't designed to be as hard and serious as Batman or X-Men. Yes the film does have some logic holes, but what action or Sci-fi film doesn't? The fact is that if you want a film that young children can watch or you can watch as a family, then I think the Fantastic Four is an all round enjoyable and lovely family film.<br/><br/>Now I will admit that I'm a viewer of the film that didn't read the Fantastic Four as a comic and do not remember the cartoon series at all, so when I came to this film I was just an ordinary viewer watching a set up film for a franchise. Now I understand why some fans may have been unhappy that the film left certain points and pieces out, but the fact is that film is a different medium, and what works in a comic book or cartoon may not translate well to film, or for the beginning of franchise. The first film has to set things up and I think the film is a good basis for the Fantastic Four franchise. Though I do think that perhaps the Fantastic Four may have been better served as a TV series, but that's another issue.<br/><br/>But to put it another way. I have seen and really enjoyed the new Batman Begins, Superman Returns and first two X-Men films, but I bought none of those on DVD. I own both of the Fantastic Four films and I look forward to a third one."
"johnnyboyz","5","1","2","2 January 2008"," Sorry excuse for an action film and not much better as a comic book adaptation either.
","Fantastic Four is a film that astounds and surprises but maybe not necessarily for the right reasons; it's a film that will have you laughing at it rather than with it for most of the time with its ludicrous situations and ideas that it so desperately wants you to believe; and yet it remains a solid if not unspectacular entry into the recent spate of comic book adaptations even if it does play out like a B-movie 90% of the time.<br/><br/>It seems ironic that the director is called Tim Story because he clearly doesn't have one to work with here since at its core, Fantastic Four is a film without one. In one half of this bi-linear film, you have Reed Richards (Gruffudd); Sue Storm (Alba); Johnny Storm (Evans) and Ben Grimm (Chiklis) all moping around trying to come to terms with their new powers and for Grimm, his new image. The other half consists of Victor von Doom (McMahon) getting a thirst for blood as he wipes out the board members that sacked him from his own company. It seems strange that Spider-Man from three years previous managed to show us Peter Parker's reaction to his new found powers in a fun and somewhat entertaining montage in about five minutes; here it takes up almost half the film. But there is plenty more wrong with Fantastic Four. If you can get over the fact that the 'bad guy' is called 'von Doom' and manage to refrain yourself from chuckling whenever his hilariously camp villain is on screen, you'll surely not be able to look past the way all the characters seem to whisper their lines for the first forty minutes; the way the film would then blast us with juvenile rock music whenever it felt like and the way Johnny Storm has the mental capacity of a sixteen year old yet is apparently smart enough to be an astronaut, despite not knowing what the temperature of the sun is.<br/><br/>Yes, Fantastic Four is a film that is on par with The Core in terms of not only scientific screw ups but terrible characterisation. I find it amazing that shortly after the space storm, or whatever it was, gives them the powers; they spend some time in quarantine and yet nobody there is able to register they have abnormal DNA inside them; nobody ever grabs one of the four and shakes them by the shoulders exclaiming: 'Shut up and listen; you're different' but the one thing that really takes the cake is the fact von Doom apparently doesn't even need to be in quarantine since we see him out and about whilst everyone else is at hospital. As a villain, von Doom is very weak with his victims being very obvious in obligatory scenes you just groan at: the doctor that wants to tell everyone; the board member in the car park and our heroes as a whole: his antagonism and sense of threat is either anti-climatic, needless or pointless.<br/><br/>As characters, our heroes that are the Fantastic Four are equally anti-climatic or needless. None of them are developed beyond any form of what they are at the very beginning bar Ben Grimm (aka The Thing). Grimm's fiancé it would seem, ditches Ben telling us she truly does go for what's on the outside and not inside. Grimm is also the strongest of the four and has the worst reaction to the accident: both physically and psychologically as he contemplates suicide on a bridge. He even finds time to tempt himself into falling in love again. It is here that I suggest the film should have been made with Grimm as the lone character. The film does not need Johnny Storm what-so-ever; it does not need Sue Storm either except for maybe getting some male teenage audiences in and the only reason for Richards' inclusion is so that someone has the level of intelligence to try and build a machine that'll reverse the effects but that is a sub-plot that is weak, underdeveloped and actually rather pointless. Take out Richards, give Grimm his intelligence and then you might have a good film.<br/><br/>But then we wouldn't be able to gush at Johnny's fire effect or the way he treats women like trash; we wouldn't be able to see him do his insane bike stunts to loud rock music. Johnny actually soaks up the media attention the film has within it but previous comic book efforts have society dislike their heroes at the beginning: Batman and Spider-Man are good examples with X-Men 2 using it as an entire narrative drive. Fantastic Four is a film that would have all its women in its universe blindingly attractive; I highly doubt girls as pretty as Jessica Alba would go on dates to an observatory with their boyfriends and that the nurse at the beginning would be as dumb and as attractive as she was, simultaneously. Fantastic Four is also a film that thrives on its product placement: one such tilt shot starts on 'ESPN' and then moves down to the action. Burger King's 'flamed to perfection' also cashes in  I guess a $100,000,000 budget wasn't enough for Mr. Story and co..<br/><br/>So with cartoon characters that are as badly written as cartoon characters in a three picture skit; a story that revolves around pretty much nothing for three quarters of the time and a film that is relatively action starved, the film is a failure. The only reprieve Fantastic Four might have is that its villain is defeated in its finale through good use of science rather than aggression but that is clutching at some extremely thin straws."

","This film has had a lot of bad reviews and has been labelled a let down, but I think if people just watched it for what it is and did not compare it to any other marvel film they would realise it actually is a very good film. This film is just the right film to watch when you're in the mood for a fun, relaxing, family film with good actors and good special effects. Any comic book lovers will love this film but if you're not you will still love it. Everyone know that basic storyline. Four scientists Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm head off to space with Victor Von Doom and get hit by a cosmic storm. Once they are all awake again in Victor's medical facilities they realise they have these unique powers. Reed, being able to stretch, Susan Being able to go invisible, Ben turning into a big, rock creature, and Johnny being able to set himself on fire and fly. They come to terms with their powers and realise they can use them to fight the forces of evil in the form of Dr. Doom, who is wreaking havoc as a metal electric villain. All five actors are exactly what this film needed, they couldn't of had a better cast if they tried. They can all carry off the hilarious lines, the serious lines, the sad lines all perfect. This film has a very kiddy feel to it and you know that there is no chance anything bad could happen to any of them. It's just a totally relaxed film, you can tell they must of had a lot of fun filming it and it's just a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed it so please forget about spider-man and x-men, watch fantastic four!"

","Fantastic Four (2005, Dir. Tim Story) <br/><br/>Four astronauts have their lives changed forever, when they end up being hit by a cloud of cosmic radiation. Reed Richards now has the ability to stretch his body like elastic. Sue Storm is now the invisible woman. Johnny Storm becomes the human touch and Ben Grimm becomes the 'Thing', a man made out of rock. But there is one problem. The journey's sponsor, Victor von Doom has also been affects and with full power, is a dangerous force which needs to be stopped, before it's too late.<br/><br/>Since the beginning of 2000, the cinema audience have been bombarded with comic book movie adaptations, and it was only time until we finally saw 'Fantastic Four' on our screens. This time came in 2005, but it didn't come without its drawbacks. Compared to other superhero movies, the running length is quite short, with much of the story focused on the characters. There are only two real big action sequences. Fortunatly there was a much improved sequel. The actors have been perfectly chosen for their roles, and are much like their comic book counterparts. The special effects are a bit dodgy though, with some scenes with quite poor looking CGI, especially with the elastic arms. It is still a great superhero film, and a great film for the whole family to watch.<br/><br/>""Where are your ears?"" - Johnny Storm (Chris Evans)"

Fantastic 4 has some great action scenes and thought the effects were spectacular.

","As a Marvel Fan Boy, it has been hit or miss with the comic book movies for me lately. When you are a fan of a franchise for so long you begin to analyze just about anything built off it under a microscope. I will admit, I was disappointed with how Spidey 3 and X-3 turned out. However, i am a fan of those franchise and I know absolutely nothing about the Fantastic Four or Doctor Doom. As Cypher from 'the Matrix' put it ""Ignorance is bliss""! I got a kick out of this movie. Each of the characters where entertaining, the plot was easy to follow, the special effects were cool and the movie's ending give me a good feeling as i left the theater. I left my evil little critic at home and when to this movie not knowing what to expect and end up enjoying it. Some hate it and i understand why. I left the theater asking the question ""Is that really how Doom got his power?"" Liberties with the source material is aways the case with these Comic Book movies and there is nothing we fans can do about it. I understand Fantastic 4 Fans. Hey, I'm a Spidey fan and I was royally ticked with how Hollywood treated Venom. However since i was Ignorance of the Fantastic 4 comics, i found bliss in this movie."

","This movie is absolutely awful. I didn't click on the spoiler because there is no way to give away the plot. There is no plot in this movie what so ever. Of course Dr. Doom is the villain, but you'd never know that considering that his only evil deed is being a jerk. I mean at least in other comic book movies the the villain had an agenda, a reason for the hero to stop him. In this movie The Fantastic four our praised by all of humanity and even the government, which doesn't make sense because in real life the army would crazy to try and stop them, but no everyone looks at them like regular people. If thats what really happens in life, then why aren't the X-men accepted by the rest of humanity, because people are afraid of what they don't understand. But my final thought is that this movie is crap, and special effects don't make up for lame writing.Next time give the characters some depths."

","I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. ""Fantastic Four"" is one of those.<br/><br/>Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.<br/><br/>People seem to be responding to the second installment, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer,"" marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's ""Spiderman"" series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

The moment when he leaves is kind of cheesy, like something you'd see in a kids' movie.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie wasn't the best out there, but I might give it a seven.

","First the beefs: <br/><br/>1. The producer needs to consider that some blondes have brown eyes (was I the only one creeped out by the blue contacts on Jessica's eyes?). <br/><br/>2. Jessica Alba does not have the face to pull off long blonde hair. It looked like straw and fake, the first film did a better job with her makeup. <br/><br/>3. With a character like the Silver Surfer why oh why bring back Von Doom? His presence made the plot all too predictable and wasted a perfectly good mysterious nemesis for the team to puzzle out before the world was ""eaten"". A different angle on the script and the loss of a predictable character would have levitated this film from ""good"" to ""great""! <br/><br/>4. As already stated, suffered from Batman syndrome or maybe a more modern phrase, Spiderman 3 syndrome, too many villains distracting from the core of the story, ""who is the Silver Surfer, why is he here and how do we stop this world ending event?"" <br/><br/>5. Considering Galactus created the silver surfer it seems a bit of a stretch that the surfer would have sufficient power to destroy his master. It would have worked better had he ""convinced"" Galactus to move on to another world. Could have had created some dramatic tension at the climax. <br/><br/>6. The whole ""oh my God we are alive hug"" at the end came across as forced and unbelievable. Maybe it was a pacing thing or the actors just didn't convey why they waited to embrace each other, I am not quite sure. It came across as contrived and unnatural. <br/><br/>7. They may wish to spend more time / money on Mr. Fantastic's stretching. It still suffers from a lack of believability, especially on the dance floor when is civilian clothes stretched with his arms and legs...<br/><br/>Bouquets:<br/><br/>1. The playful banter between the team was excellent, you really got the sense that they were family. <br/><br/>2. The surfer was brilliantly done! No wasted money on that sfx. <br/><br/>3. The obvious product placements were fun and reminiscent of Captain Amazing from Mystery Men. Lots of fun. <br/><br/>4.SPFX were very good for what they cost, just enough to be believable, but not so much that their costs required superfluous screen time to justify them. <br/><br/>5. Galactus was nicely interpreted for the screen, the comic book appearance of the character would have been too hokey, however I was disappointed that this ""entity"" had no semblance of an anthropomorphic qualities at it's core, like a face. <br/><br/>6. The performances of the heroes was excellent and felt very true to their characters, the use of Fishburnes voice as the surfer was well done and added a nice aspect to the alien nature of the character.<br/><br/>Overall a better film than the first one, even with its warts. Had von doom not been brought back and the team was forced to learn about the surfer through several encounters I believe the story could have been more compelling to the audience. It would also allow us to become more connected to the heroes and care about the peril they would find themselves in. <br/><br/>I really didn't get a strong sense that any of the team were in mortal danger or the planet, so in that respect it failed to deliver. However, I think that may have been because I was anticipating the clichéd ulterior motives and betrayal of Doom and the screen time devoted to this part of the plot, instead of learning about the surfer along with the characters in the film.<br/><br/>It was a good second effort, however I believe if the producers actually took an existing comic book script and adapted it or employed a writer who understands the material better, the stories will become better thus making for a more profitable film."
"oneloveall","5","1","2","25 May 2007"," Fun but dumb
","Four better and worse, Fantastic Four is your completely predictable and stereotypical comic book come to life. Take one part mediocre acting, two parts serviceable special effects, and three parts conceptual action and you have the successful formula for franchise gold. The good news is the film stays so close to this formula that it rarely has time to indulge, lull, or pontificate upon any lofty Marvel notion, some of which their cousin movies often get swept away in. The experience is one of the less geeky endeavors for the booming genre, substituting the often found Achilles heel of excessive fanboy devotion for a more generalized, all- around fun time. Without wasting too much attention on character background, viewers settle into the more entertaining aspects of each superhero's special ability before things get too redundant.<br/><br/>The bad news is that these five various fleeting super-powers we get to enjoy pretty much guide the entire plot through to it's predictably boring conclusion. Nothing really distracts this wooden script from merely going through the motions, and at times it can get overbearingly numbing. Coupled with the pretty-faced performances, and we get a comic-foursome as sincere Stan Lee's acting. Sure, Michael Chiklis plays against his airhead crew's type and offers some of the only emotionally graspable sentiment around, but even his lines come off painfully clichéd and just another element to move along the mechanics. Despite being just another pretty face herself, Jessica Alba is The pretty face, and any warm-blooded male under the age of 40 should thank their lucky stars she was cast.<br/><br/>Choosing Tim Story (Barbershop, Taxi) to direct might have seemed odd to your typical white nerdy teen- the precise demographic for this fodder, but producers were thinking bigger then those narrow confines. Story does nothing to help elevate this one, but a more accessible urban vibe, however subtle, pervades the film and should be credited for helping expand the audience a little wider then expected. Helping refine the more mainstream elements inside this superhero spectacle, Fantastic Four may be an easily digestible dose of the Marvel universe, but becomes just as dumbed down for it."

What caught my eye at first was the luscious man who calls himself the 'torch' and although that's what caught my eye in the beginning, I soon found that the movie is much more than that. Unlike most; it doesn't play (too much) with the eye candy scheme of things that we see in a lot of movies these days. I loved the fact that they did background on each and every character presented. That's important to me when I sit down on my lovely couch and devote that hour and a half (or so) to a specific movie. Details are essential for me and this flick is a good example of how a ""series"" should start out!

","This movie probably would've worked well in 1966, but in this day and age, its themes and characters seem suited for the dim witted and fat of America. This movie is filled with fat. Each character embodies a stereotype embellished with corny dialogue. Actually, the special effects weren't bad--I'll give it that much. What bothered me was that if you removed their superpowers, they resembled all the worst examples of humanity we see constantly on reality TV and the ""I'll do anything to be famous"" shows. They might've tweaked some of the personalities a bit to fit our era more. The schmaltzy and very hetero ending is right out of the 1950s. As I listened to the stupid script utterings, I wondered, does anyone really talk like this? Perhaps that is why comics work as comics--they don't pretend at real life. I am of the opinion that comics do not work so well on screen. I know I have many X fans screaming by now. Comics rely on exaggeration. The women are busty and bursting from clothes and the men have jaws like Hercules. In real life, this looks absurd. It is as if we peopled a movie with runway models. It becomes one dimensional and a bit boring."

","A good comic book movie is a movie you like even though you may have never heard of the superhero(s) or never particularly cared for them. A bad comic book movie is a movie you dislike even though you know the superhero(s) and you generally like the superhero(s). An OK comic book movie is a movie you are indifferent about after having seen it whether you knew the superhero(s) in it or not. Fantastic Four was OK as far as comic book movies go. I never followed Fantastic Four in the comic books, and I new very little about them; the movie helped me know them and their abilities a little better, which was good. The characters were not intriguing enough by themselves, so there needed to be some decent action as a filler. The action was not that impressive, nor was the final scene. The nemesis helps to make the movie just as much as the superheros. Movies such as Batman, Star Wars, Superman, Spiderman, etc. had excellent bad guys to compliment the good guys. The two need each other, and Dr. Doom just didn't come through."
"Surecure","7","1","2","25 January 2007"," With no high expectations you'll find -- while far from perfect -- F4 is still a fun movie
","Comic book movies have come a long way to being seen as serious action/adventure fare. The X-Men and Spider-Man series, as well as Batman Begins, helped to forge a seriousness in comic movies that has set a certain bar for achievement. However, The Fantastic Four seems to step back a bit to the more tongue-in-cheek method of crafting a comic book into a film. In doing so, it automatically handicapped its ability to create a realistic film, opting for a more fantasy based attitude. While the results aren't as disastrous as die-hard comic book movie fans suggest, they are not amazing either.<br/><br/>The story follows two scientists -- Reed Richards and Ben Grimm -- in need of funding for a project to observe an energy cloud approaching Earth which they feel could explain human evolution. They are forced to approach a wealthy industrialist named Victor Von Doom, who happens to employ Richards former girlfriend Sue Storm, to use his orbiting space station to monitor the effects of the cloud. The scientists along with Sue's brother Johnny to pilot their spacecraft arrive at the space station to find their initial estimates of the cloud's arrive time to be off and they are bombarded by the cloud's energies.<br/><br/>The five soon find themselves gaining strange abilities. Richards body becomes elasticized, giving him the ability to stretch to incredible lengths. Sue Storm finds herself with the ability to become invisible as well as create force fields. Johnny Storm gains the ability to burn at incredible temperatures and fly. Ben Grimm soon finds his entire body turned to rock. Von Doom finds himself slowly turning to an organic metal and gaining the ability to manipulate energy. Circumstances soon change finding Richards success taking off as Von Doom's company fails. This sets Von Doom off on a mission to turn the tables back in his favor.<br/><br/>With several great action sequences, excellent effects work and superb casting of some very strong talent (including the always dynamic Michael Chiklis), the film is certainly enjoyable from an aesthetic point of view. However, with a fairly shallow storyline and dialog that often is wooden and jagged, it falls short of its comic book film contemporaries. Those walking in with heightened expectations of greatness along the lines of Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2 will certainly be disappointed by the Fantastic Four's more juvenile approach. However, if one keeps in mind that it is more popcorn entertainment than Oscar worthy landmark, the Fantastic Four still manages to be an enjoyable action/science-fiction movie as a whole.<br/><br/>My rating: 6.8/10"

","Fantastic Four - Five scientists go into space for some reason and get bombarded with gamma rays or something. I'd go into more depth, but the Fantastics weren't my favorites in the Marvel universe. First Off, I enjoyed The Thing (Micheal Chiklis)'s acting as he goes through the trials and tribulations of being covered in Kaptain Krunch cereal and being unable to hold a drink (could he get a straw or something?). I also liked Ioan Gruffudd's Mr. Fantastic character, and wish he was given more to do. Finally I liked Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom, even if it was mostly a psychotic super-powered rehash of his character on Nip/Tuck. That's not necessarily a bad thing. His sparingly used evil scenes were fun. As for the other two, Chris Evans was mostly really annoying at first, but he's grown on me. Jessica Alba was really whiny. She needs acting lessons, as there was little to nothing endearing about her character.<br/><br/>Sidenote: The film's idea of keeping the team away from everyone and trying to undo their condition was kinda boring. The only time anything interesting really happened was when they left their H.Q.<br/><br/>Some of the effects are better than others. Some of the Mr. Fantastic effects look like they were done on the cheap. Same goes for the Invisible Woman force fields. Maybe they can fix that in the sequel.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a real story per se. It has moments and one liners. While that's not a terrible thing (The Thing threateningly telling kids not to do drugs was buckets of fun by itself), it keeps the movie from being anything other than adequate and being in the league of such comic book films as Spiderman, Superman, and Batman Begins.

","Comic book adaptations suffer from one fundamental problem. The extent to which the makers take the story seriously can damn or save them. Sadly, Hollywood seems to believe that if they make every film for an imaginary all-ages audience, they will recoup their costs. Unfortunately, after all the flops like Batman & Robin or Daredevil, Hollywood is still failing to learn that audiences want original ideas, good ideas, or both. Making a film out of the Fantastic Four, on paper, could have been a great idea. Unfortunately, the film soon descends into an extended episode of the morning cartoon series that introduced and wrapped every crisis or conflict in five minutes or less. In a market that is not overly saturated with CGI-riddled adaptations of comic books, this might not be such a big problem. Unfortunately, films like Fantastic Four have to compete with the likes of X-Men 2. Bryan Singer brought something to the table that is so scarily real the audience can feel the pain of the characters. Tim Story brings nothing, and makes a film that is worth nothing.<br/><br/>Not that we cannot give him marks for trying. There is an attempt to make Thing seem more human by giving him a fiancé who is unable to continue her relationship with him after she learns what has happened to him. The problem is that since nothing is made of their relationship before the incident, and no character development is offered, this plot tangent has exactly zero impact upon the viewer. In fact, apart from the television show I watched in fits and starts as a boy, I had little idea of who or what the Fantastic Four were, and I have about the same idea now. I cannot help but draw comparisons to X-Men, which gave me remarkable insight into Wolverine and Magento especially as characters. A big part of the reason I know less about the characters after watching the film than before is because the film gives me no incentive to know the characters. Susan Storm is probably the worst example. Jessica Alba tries valiantly to portray a character other than her Dark Angel persona, but is deeply hampered by the poor development of the script.<br/><br/>To the film's credit, the special effects used to realise the situations and the solutions used by the characters are well-realised. Hollywood will never credit them with this, but the crew who worked on Hollow Man have forever changed the depiction of invisibility in film. So much so, in fact, that this film is able to offer scientific explanation and progressive defeats of this natural camouflage. I just wish they could have put as much effort into telling a story. Much of the film concerns itself with celebrity and the media's ability to make a bad situation worse. Dialogue is occasionally offered in which The Thing informs Sue that he would give anything to be invisible, for example, but the feelings of the Four regarding their powers and abilities are never given anything more than a superficial exploration. It is only just now that we are beginning to learn that superhuman abilities and their concordant subtractions are a little more real than we were led to believe in the 1980s. The problem that films like Fantastic Four are incapable of exploring is that our society is creating far more Doctor Dooms than Sue Storms.<br/><br/>Another big problem for the Fantastic Four is that rather than working to go as far as it can within the notorious PG-13 limits, the film is as softcore as they come. Variety might be the spice of life, but Hollywood might as well be a McDonald's at this stage. About the only thing in this particular Big Mac that has any resonance in real life is when when the Four affirm that they do not wish to be ""cured"" of their powers, as terrible as the challenges they introduce to their lives might be. That I was able to type that out before the film finished on its first viewing should tell you a lot about the capacity this film has for genuine surprises. As much as I love a good film about terrible things happening to good people, this is probably one of the worst that august genre has ever produced. Roger Ebert says it all in the quote: ""I wasn't watching Fantastic Four to study it, but to be entertained by it, but how could I be amazed by a movie that makes its own characters so indifferent about themselves?"". We just do not care about these people, and therefore we do not care about the film.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows me well enough knows that when I rate a film a step above the worst possible, it means that the film is too bad to entertain in a good way, but it is too good to derive the kind of unintentional comedy that saves a lot of B-films from historical oblivion. Plan 9 From Outer Space is remembered fifty years after its release because it was made badly with a heart and soul. Its author genuinely believed in it. Fantastic Four is nothing more than a cynical cash cow, and it deserves to be forgotten in five years."
"BrigitteD","3","1","2","21 July 2005"," Not fantastic.
","These days, movie releases always seem to fall into three categories; sequels, remakes or comic book adaptations. The latter has been a tried and true Hollywood fixture since the first time we saw ""Superman"" don his cape and tights.<br/><br/>Thus continues the tradition of the Marvel Comics series in the form of ""Fantastic Four"", which reportedly underwent years of delay due to production and casting issues.<br/><br/>Some might say the payoff was well worth the wait, but perhaps I'm in the wrong position to judge since I've never possessed any degree of adept knowledge of the originating illustrated works, nor of its real-life counterparts.<br/><br/>After seeing such offerings as ""X-Men"", both ""Spiderman"" installments, ""Daredevil"" and its inferior spin off ""Elektra"", I've nonetheless gathered enough insight to determine that all these movies basically follow the same premise.<br/><br/>They are all accounts of average Joe's, whom because of extraordinary circumstances, become plagued, or blessed, depending on one's personal perception, by unusual abilities.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four"" gathers an ensemble of medical scientists, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), who are sent on a space mission, and soon become exposed to radioactivity emanating from a cosmic outburst.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, the group begins developing unusual symptoms, due to the altering of their DNA properties.<br/><br/>The eventual transformations presented here are ones of invisibility, flexible elasticity, spontaneous combustion and turning into a stone formation.<br/><br/>From then on, the group must learn to adapt to their powers, as well as to their new found public attention and resulting celebrity status. And somewhere amidst all the action, there is also an underlying social message about being different and being accepted for who you are.<br/><br/>As is expected from all these types of movies, there is the obligatory nemesis, presented to us, and to its adversaries, as Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). The cast of heroes is quite likable, and it's easy to get involved in their camaraderie and the laughter-inducing bantering they exchange when they are not out trying to save the world.<br/><br/>Considering the movie's closing scenes, as well as its progressive box-office clout, a franchise of many sequels will inevitably be made, but it's doubtful it's something that I'll be anticipating."
"Ytsejam","7","1","2","18 July 2005"," An honest super hero film
","I went to watch this film not expecting too much, partly due to some recent disappointments, as well as due to the tendency to heavily lace super hero films with CGI until they look like second rate computer games. <br/><br/>This film was a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>I'd always perceived FF to be one of the ""less dark"", family oriented comic books. This may be wrong, but that's the impression I had. So to me, the film held true to the comic book atmosphere. It goes to prove the point that a solid script goes a long way towards making a good film. Casting was OK (only *very minor* objection being Jessica Alba, whose skin complexion does not help her portray a blue-eyed blonde, but who did a good job as Susan Storm.) <br/><br/>Special effects were put to very good use, especially in the cases of the Thing and the Human Torch, and were used in good measure, without becoming overwhelming. All in all, a good adaptation of a popular comic book, which will probably appeal to the general public, without annoying the comic book fans by straying too far off the comic book."
"kolar1","7","1","2","17 July 2005"," Lighthearted and human just like the Spiderman movies
","The trick to making a successful comic book movie, or any sci-fi/fantasy movie, is to bring out the human characteristics of the main characters in the limited time available. The books, of course, have a definite advantage in this area, since they are not backed by money-hungry producers who want to see nothing but action and marketable T-shirt quotes. Movies with one hero (Spiderman, Batman Begins) are able to play out the characterization at length without slowing down the movie. In Fantastic Four, there were actually five characters that viewers needed to get the ""feel"" of before the action started.<br/><br/>I have to say that Tim Story pulled this off very well. I actually felt for Reed Richards in his naive but well-intentioned pursuit of scientific discovery for the good of mankind, as well as his not-so-well hidden regret about breaking up with Sue Storm. Ben Grimm, played by The Shield's Michael Chiklis, was fascinating as the loyal and tough friend of Reed's who deals with the majority of the angst that is involved in becoming a superhero. His depiction of The Thing, which is a lot more than just his voice, is superb.<br/><br/>In my view, the only weak link in this chain, seems to be the villain, Dr. Doom. It wasn't that I was displeased with Julian McMahon's performance, I just think the Victor Von Doom, along with the villain that he became, deserved a little more explanation. In the F4 stories that I remember, Victor was much more multi-faceted than the greedy and excessively rude movie version. Perhaps if the movie had been longer, there would have been time to flesh out this character a bit more.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fast and fun. It's safe for kids and entertaining for adults. The perfect summer movie."
"randylanders","9","1","2","17 July 2005"," Best Marvel Comic Adaptation Yet? It's a Possibility
","Having three kids (14, 12, 10) means compromising on movie choices. I wanted to see ""War of the Worlds,"" and my youngest overruled it saying it would be too scary. So, the kids talked me into FANTASTIC FOUR. I must admit I never cared for Marvel Comics as a kid (I preferred JLA and GREEN LANTERN), so I wasn't all that keen about seeing this film.<br/><br/>I was completely wrong.<br/><br/>The film was fantastic, no pun intended. Yes, there could've been more action, but this wasn't meant to be an action film. It was an origins story, and it was a pretty darned good one at that. The actors, in particular, gave a good deal of believability to what I always considered one of the most ridiculous comic concepts (i.e. cosmic rays causing super powers).<br/><br/>In fact, I daresay the acting is what drew me into the film. All five leads are simply incredibly believable in their performances. Ioan Gruffudd does a wonderful job of capturing the naiveté of a scientist. He's completely unaware that he's being used throughout the film, and this flaw endears his character (and the performance) to us. Jessica Alba gives a lot of depth to what could be a superficial role (I loved her reaction to her brother's nicknaming her ""I'm the Invisible GIRL?!"") Chris Evans captures the fireball free-spirit of the Human Torch, and Chilkis ends up being incredibly emotive under all that rock. Julian McMahon captures the slide of Victor von Doom from evil manipulator into outright evil insanity with perfection.<br/><br/>Storywise, it's an origin piece, so there's not always a lot of action. But the pathos of the Ben Grimm character, his personal crisis of a wife who leaves him over his crisis, von Doom's capitalizing on this crisis/weakness, and then the irony as he meets a young black, blind woman reminds him that things could be worse. I couldn't help but wonder why the incredibly talented Chilkis would've taken part in the movie as the opening sequence rolled. By the end of the movie, I couldn't help but applaud his decision to do so.<br/><br/>So I have to ask myself, is this the best Marvel Comics adaptation yet? *sigh* I thought both Spiderman 1, and I liked X-Men 1&2 were really good. I thought Daredevil was unnecessarily criticized, just as several comic aficionados are doing with this one. But in all honesty, I didn't want to go back and see those movies again. And I didn't bother watching Spiderman 2 until it was released on DVD. But I want to go back to see Fantastic Four again. So yeah, this one works for me. And if you go into the theater without the preconceptions, I think you'll be in line with me, too."
"SciFiHorrorFem","9","1","2","17 July 2005"," Brought The Comic To Life For Me
","I read Fantastic Four comics from the time I was a young kid, well into my teens and twenties. To me, the movie brought the comic to life. I was proud to see it and happy to get as many laughs and feel as much for the characters as I did. There was plenty enough action for me, along with getting to know the characters and seeing a lot of what they could do. First movies in a comic/superhero series always have to explain quite a bit about the characters becoming what they are and I thought Fantastic Four did that well. I am looking forward to it coming out on DVD so it can be added to my collection. I think the selection of Michael Chiklis as Ben ""The Ever Lovin' Thing"" Grim was a brilliant choice. He has great comic timing and he also is very good at dramatic acting as we have seen in the past in THE COMMISH and currently in THE SHIELD. He was also in an underrated movie from the 90's called SOLDIER and did a great job in it, also. Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Ioan Gruffudd and Julian McMahon all did really well in their roles, also. Evans as Johnny Storm was not quite as blonde as in the comics, but he did a great job acting like The Human Torch. He had that smart-alec, wisecracking attitude that he needed in the role down to a T. It was also great to see Stan ""The Man"" Lee in another of his infamous cameo roles in Marvel movies."

They are astronauts and scientists who are teamed up with Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who runs his million dollar concern and can afford the trip of a few days in the space just for Richards's discovery of a cosmic storm, which will cure sicknesses and that kind of stuff. But something goes wrong and the storm comes earlier than estimated. Back in Earth, Reed finds himself elastic, calling himself Mr Fantastic, Sue finds herself invisible, calling herself Invisible Girl, Johnny finds himself being able to burn, naming himself Human Torch, and Ben finds himself becoming the thing with a body of stone. The only who seems have survived the cosmic storm is Victor Von Doom - it seems that... But some event later get the fantastic four to change their minds and stop him before it's too late.<br/><br/>Despite the stubborn beginning, it's a great movie with great visual effects, great and fun characters, great actors and a great story. It has also a lot of great mind of humor, that got me to burst into laughing a lot of times. Further, the photography is also smart, as well as the cinematography. Everything seem realistic or real like, anyways. The smart thing I think the director and the film company have done in this case, is to take quite unknown actors into this movie, because I think that if actors such like Charlize Theron (who has been talked about being the Invisible girl) or Nicolas Cage or another big star had gotten the roles instead of those unknown actors, it had been a bad movie... everything had not felt that good, then, I guess. Now when it is quite unknown actors (except from Alba and McMahonm, whom I knew before from Dark Angel and Nip/Tuck respectively) who have the roles in this movie it is easy to identify with the characters and feel a sympathy for them. <br/><br/>In other ways, it's an amazing and pleasant movie, which yet can't strike Sin City from being the best movie I have seen this year yet."

","Nothing happens in this movie, that is the reason. There is no action scene until the final 2-3 minutes, which is a very small and short fight scene in the middle of a street. It ends in literally 2-3 minutes. There is a scene of them helping a bridge from collapsing, but there is nothing exciting about this at all. I don't know why this movie got made, it was really boring and one of the blandest comic book movie ever. It is call an ""Action Movie"" but it should have just been call ""Bad comedy Drama"" or something because there is no action.<br/><br/>The only positives I can think of is that The Thing looks just like he does in the comic (but very rubbery and plastic), and Chris Evans realized that this movie isn't working out, so that is why he went and did Captain America. I guess this movie kinda show the world who Jessica Alba is but honestly, she is a terrible terrible actress. Everytime she talks in any movie, it is like she is talking to a child. She is not a good actress and the only good movie she has ever done in her career is ""Sin City,"" and she was only in a little part of it.

","I was pleased with the quality of the Fantastic Four (F4) movie. When I left after movie I thought that it would do best with younger audiences and female movie fans. The demographics on the reviews seem to support that idea. I was aware of the Fantastic Four comic books, but I became more familiar with the characters watching the animated TV series. Each Fantastic Four character has an interesting opinion on their new found powers. The actors seem to portray this very well. Doctor Doom was also a good choice for the villain. He is a very popular comic bad guy who looks really cool. If/when FF4 becomes an ongoing movie series, I believe the sequels will have tremendous opportunity to improve on the success of this first movie. (Obviuosly Wall Street agrees as Marvel stock rose 12% on the Monday following the release.) <br/><br/>Since comparisons between F4 and the X-MEN movies are inevitable, I would say that F4 does not take itself as seriously the X-MEN series or as previous Marvel releases. (However, it never turns to the camp that has brought down the original DC Batman and Superman movie series.) Which may be a good move on Stan Lee's part. This will help him to build a well-rounded watchable library of Marvel films. I have even heard of possible crossover between Marvel movie series possibly involving the F4 and a planned Silver Suffer movie. That would cool. With the release of the Fantastic Four movie, Marvel has now brought all its biggest products to the big screen (X-Men, Spider-man, Hulk, and the Fantastic Four)."

The movie is around 1hr,45mins long, but they can still stretch it longer and I won't feel bored.<br/><br/>Trying not to give out too much: F4 doesn't focus on villain versus heroes. It focuses more on characterization and heroism. It doesn't flood the screen with, out-of-this-world special effects, but rather with more down to earth human psyche and team work.<br/><br/>The F4 is more ""heroic hearted"" than Spiderman in the movies (as opposed to the comics).

"MichaelMargetis","5","2","7","8 July 2005"," ""Dude... where's your... ears? "" - Johnny Storm (in response to The Thing)
","During the summer, you always get a couple of flicks that are simple-minded and non-intelligent but wildly entertaining and fun to watch popcorn action movies. Well, that's exactly what 'Fantastic Four' is, a brainless but kick-ass superhero movie that brings honor to the comic book. It's also so much better then the terrible (not to mention laughable) 1994 original adaptation of the popular action comic. This version has a lot of action/fight sequences, some good but ultimately cheesy comic relief, some sappy love scenes between Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Girl, and some positive and wholesome life lessons at the end. It's the so-so typical super-hero film, but I enjoyed myself most of the time watching it.<br/><br/>The 'familiar-for-fans' story follows two astronauts, Reed Richards (Ioan Grufford - King Arthur) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis - The Shield). Reed is an inventor, and Ben is a pilot. They propose a project to a millionaire running space missions, Dr. Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon - Nip/Tuck), he accepts, and they go on an experimental mission in space. Along with them, goes Victor's girlfriend, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba - Sin City) and her cocky, wise-ass younger brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans - Cellular) who was fired from NASA for getting it on with two Victoria Secret models in a flight simulator. The five go off into space for the mission, when something goes terribly wrong and all five have their DNA molecules disrupted by cosmic rays. Afterwards, they develop powers. Reed develops an ability to stretch his body like rubber giving him the name Mr. Fantastic, Sue develops the power to turn herself invisible giving her the name Invisible Girl, Johnny develops a power to turn himself into fire giving him the name the Human Torch, and Ben gets transformed into a giant molten rock man giving him the name 'THE THING'. The four decide to use their powers for good until they can get back to normal, but Victor who develops the ability to control electricity abuses his power and uses it for his own selfish reasons, killing people who get in his way. Victor takes the name 'Dr. Doom'. The movie then becomes the Fantastic Four's mission to stop the crazy, ruthless and diabolical Dr. Doom from taking over the world... Will they be able to stop him?<br/><br/>The 2005 version of 'Fantastic Four' has some awesome action sequences you can really get in to, but some of the screenplay's dialogue flat out sucks. I'd say a good 10-15% of the film's dialogue is beyond the point of cheesy and hangs on the edge of being ridiculous. But, you got to remember that 'Fantastic Four' is a kids superhero movie, and you can't expect Oscar worthy screen writing (they don't have Tarantino or Scorsese scripting these flicks). Tim Story does a surprisingly fine job with directing, since his last film was 'Taxi' with Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah, and we all know how much of a catastrophe and utter embarrassment that movie was. The acting is actually pretty steady for this kind of film. Ioan Gufford does a good job as the lead, Jessica Alba is acceptable as Invisible Girl, Julian McMahon plays a great villain, Chris Evans provides much needed comic relief and The Shield's Vic Mackey (oops, I mean Michael Chiklis) is absolutely friggin' awesome as The Thing. There are many funny moments in 'Fantastic Four' and that's always a plus in a superhero movie. There's also eye-popping visuals and Stan Lee has a brief part as Willy Lumpkin, Reed Richard (Mr. Fantastic's) friendly and elderly mailman. <br/><br/>When it comes down to the wire, 'Fantastic Four' is a so-so movie. It isn't necessarily a good film, but it is a far-cry from bad. It's one of the better super-hero films, and in my opinion better than 'The Hulk' and last year's most overrated pile of junk 'Spider-Man 2'. It doesn't hold a candle to 'Batman Begins' as the summer superhero movie, but hey, if you enjoy crap getting blown up, some funny one-liners, Jessica Alba in bra and panties and don't mind leaving your brain at the door, well, then, 'Fantastic Four' might just be the movie for you. However, I can't recommend you seeing it in the theaters. I'd say wait for video, it's a definitely worth the rental fare. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 7/8/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

The banter between Johnny and Ben was great and really added to my experience. I didn't like how Sue and Doom were ""close"" in the beginning, it took away from the original stories of how they were all knew each other in there teens. Doom was good and Julian McMahon did the job justice, and I liked the twist with how he and his powers developed. But the one big fight scene was too short and really only justified Reed's powers, even though the others did look good i thought reed was the best overall (even though Sue is my fav character in the comics, I didn't really expect that much from Alba).Johnny looked great when he was engulfed in flame and The Thing looks better on the big screen than in the previews. Overall I had fun and got into it. But being a huge fan of ""THE WORLDS GRETEST COMIC MAGAZINE"" probably helped as well. I have been waiting for this movie forever.

But this movie was not really about super 'heroes.' **It was a movie mostly about learning to deal with deformities and super powers.** This was not really a superhero saves the world kind of movie, which makes it different and more lighthearted, from say Batman or Superman or Spider-man. The sound effects were amazing! The visual effects and editing (for the first time I noticed) were adequate but in no way detracted from the story. And don't expect Oscar worthy performances.

No. But the film may benefit from low expectations and the fact that much cannot be expected from what is no doubt hoped to be the first in a series. FF sets the story up, certainly for those who haven't read the comic. For those who have, they're already buying in. I'm guessing the movie will be successful enough to deliver the force for a sequel. The ending obviously leaves open that possibility."

That is the basic summary of this film.<br/><br/>Dispute that I will give them graded for the incarnation of the Thing and the dynamic between him and the Captain America, hum, I mean the Human Torch.

That's all.<br/><br/>Apart these two good things the film is a let down and I think that we had to figure out from them that maybe Fantastic Four can't become a film franchise. Which is both sad and ironic, they were the very first super-hero team back in 1961 and in two decades of tries and Fox has failed four times in the row and don't get we started with Fan4stic!<br/><br/>Now to go to why they failed both with this one and its sequel is that they didn't try to em-praise the science fiction part of the Fantastic Four. Why to leave that out? Since their inception this team is all about alien civilizations, planet-consuming entities, mad scientist and they have Doctor Flipping Doom ,one of the most awesome villains of all time. Why to make a semi-romantic comedy drama and with the 2015 they went the other way around. Edgy, greedy and anxiety ,but in the end they did the same plots more or less with the first three films. Then Fox should have sold the rights back to Marvel and cut their losses.<br/><br/>Over all I have my doubt that we will see a decent Fantastic Four film any time soon. In all honesty that angers me to the full. I am ,at the time of this recording, 21 years old and I have seen Spiderman, Batman, the X-men, Hellboy, V from Vendeta, Sin City, Superman and of course the crew of the Avengers get good films in my life-time, why it can't happen with Fantastic 4 to?"

","What is it about Marvel's first family that Fox just can't get right? Is it the optimism of the source material? Is it the far-fetched concepts that made the comic unique when it was first published? Or is it that Fantastic Four is SO integrated with the Marvel Universe in the comics that on their own, the team isn't nearly as interesting as it should be? I think the problem with these movies, is EXACTLY the latter one I cited!<br/><br/>These characters are so uninteresting in this film that it makes you sad for the Fantastic Four to still be stuck at Fox, ever since the 80s (when Marvel had to sell their film rights off to save their asses from bankruptcy). And this film feels lonely, though it does have some sense of fun in it, precisely because the interactions between the team and supporting characters are weak compared to the cast of the much-wider Marvel Universe. I love the comics of the original Fantastic Four, but damn the film lacks the imagination and originality of its creative source material. It has the colours, but the content is lacking and derivative of other superhero movies. Spiderman worked well, and X-Men blew us away in 2000. So why couldn't Fantastic Four do the same? I don't know.<br/><br/>Colourful but lacking in story, character development, and the direction is soapy beyond belief. But at least it's watchable: unlike Josh Trank's notorious 2015 reboot."

","I am a fan of all superhero movies in general, of course there are a handful of them that I cannot be a fan of due to extreme poor quality. I'm happy to say that contrary to popular opinion, Fantastic Four is not one of those movies. It is a really good movie in its own way, perhaps it seems poor compared to Marvel's greats such as X-Men, Spider-Man 2 or The Avengers. <br/><br/>For one thing, casting is good to great for the most part. I don't think a better Human Torch could've been chosen than Chris Evans, Chicklis is lovable and adorable but still tough in a goofy way just like The Thing is supposed to be. Gruffud and Alba are not great but decent adaptations of the comic characters. Julian McMahon is a great character, but he's NOT Doom. He is an interesting and cool character but he's nothing like the source material, but he's really the only instance of that in this movie. <br/><br/>I liked the story, simple but sufficient. It's basically all five are exposed to radiation in space, which gives them all odd abilities. But then it shows all five of them progress as characters, they all have to deal with what they've become and choose what to use it for. <br/><br/>Action is also great, for its time anyways. The climax was imaginative, interesting, and just really creative I loved it. <br/><br/>In closing, yes perhaps the film was overly cheesy but that's how the original comic book characters were too. This movie is not great, but it is very good and not half as bad as it's made out to be. A heck of a lot better than the 2007 crap fest, which was a fun crap fest but still a crap fest."

","A group of astronauts gain superpowers after a cosmic radiation exposure and must use them to oppose the plans of their enemy, Doctor Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon).<br/><br/>I grew up on comic books, and I was never thrilled by the Fantastic Four. I cannot pinpoint why, but they were never my thing. Yet, this film took my lack of excitement and turned it around. At least somewhat. It far exceeded my expectations and yet remained as faithful to the comic as possible for a film. The inclusion of ""clobberin' time"" and ""flame on"" was smooth without being kitsch.<br/><br/>The effects are mostly good. With, sadly, the exception of Mr. Fantastic. I found the stretching to be very cheesy (though it gets worse in the sequel). The casting was decent, though I am very confused by Jessica Alba. If the point of casting her was to get her to take off her clothes, mission accomplished. But I think of Sue Storm as a scientist, not a sexual being... and here the casting fails."
"Lejink","5","1","3","1 October 2010"," Flame off
","As I've said before on my IMDb reviews, I am a super-heroes comics fan, although more of the DC than Marvel persuasion - there is undeniably something appealing to seeing childhood characters leap off the page in human as opposed to animated form. I know a little of the Fantastic Four, but what comes across from this movie version is that they are probably more on the super-hero-lite side of the fence (c.f. Superman, Daredevil - at least the way he was represented on-screen, The Flash, even Iron Man) as opposed to the super-hero-heavy side, where invariably the characters have deeper psychological stuff going on (Batman, Hulk and Spider Man spring to mind).<br/><br/>This FF movie, although enough of a hit to give birth to a sequel definitely falls into the former category, probably to its detriment. Perhaps with the focus shared amongst four heroes, there's no room for penetrating analysis into any of the four's psyches; even the Thing's rejection by his wife and feelings of being a freakish outcast from society is swept aside to the extent that he even recreates his mutation despite being cured by Dr Doom's machine.<br/><br/>So, on with the eye candy - Ioan Gruffudd is pleasant if hardly dominating as the leader of the group, ditto Jessica Alba, who if anything looks too young for her part. Chris Evans gets to give us ""yoof-full"" attitude while Michalel Chikris probably does best of the four with the greater demands of the Thing's character. Julian McMahon is anodyne but rarely evil as Dr Doom (did Stan Lee give every one of his heroes a villain who was a genius scientist changed by one of their own experiments gone wrong into their evil selves - Dr Octopus, Green Goblin also fit that template).<br/><br/>There's a smattering of sometimes earthy humour, usually from Johnny Storm's ""Human Torch"" and unsurprisingly Miss Alba gets to shed her clothes to play out the age-old ""Invisible Man / Woman"" clichés. The effects are mostly good, although there's some poor graphics work in an early sequence where Storm and girlfriend take to the ski-slopes from the skies.<br/><br/>It's all directed at pace and supported by a pounding sub-teen soundtrack which wasn't to my taste but tells you the age group it was aimed at. Despite all this, the film did, for me drag at times and seems to run on too long ad like I said is the weaker for the lack of empathy with any or all of the main characters.<br/><br/>That said, it's the way you'd normally expect a comic - book adaptation to be made, all day-glo and maximum volume. I prefer the guys from the dark side more (Batman, Spider Man) where the adaptations by Nolan and Raimi transcend the source material and reach out beyond the fascinated teenager I was too many years ago."

","Okay, after the Spider-Man movies, I was intrigued by this latest superhero flick. I knew it would probably be cheesy because the show and comics were kind of lame, but so were the Spider-Man shows and comics. However, I was astonished as to how stupid this movie was. Who was the genius that thought Alba would make a good addition to this film? She's terrible. She's awful. She's there solely for the scene when she takes off her clothes.<br/><br/>The effects were... half way decent. Almost. The screenplay is crap. And I do mean crap. And the only person who is the least bit interesting to watch in this film is The Thing. So, 25% of the actors in this movie make any effort. I think that pretty much sums it up.<br/><br/>As if the movie couldn't give me enough to gripe about, the villain was just lame. I mean, he wasn't scary or bad a** or anything. He was just... kind of mean and ticked off. The story is full of plot holes that I could go into detail about, but that would take up way too much time...<br/><br/>All in all, nothing about this movie reaches the ""decent-movie"" mark. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Wasn't this suppose to be the *Fantastic* Four?<br/><br/>2/10"
"tomb_92","5","1","3","23 April 2010"," Not terrible, but not the worst film ever. Enjoyable at times
","The problem with the superhero genre is that it has seemed have developed into a genre for the early teenager. Films such as The Dark Knight, Spider-man to some extent, Ghost Rider, Hellboy and Iron Man do not look to 7-11 year olds as their primary audience. That is certainly one thing that Fantastic Four does well. It doesn't take itself totally seriously and it has a laugh. The characters are stupid and annoying at times and the whole thing is way over the top, but this is great for a younger audience than what the superhero genre normally targets itself towards. I didn't particularly enjoy it but I can see why people did. It does well for its target audience."
"zetes","5","1","3","7 September 2009"," Bad, but not as bad as I expected
","Fantastic Four probably should have been more insulting, because, in reality, it's completely idiotic. It's the kind of movie where all the extras behave like movie extras and not just real-life bystanders. No one seems to think too much of it when a guy bursts into flames or a chick becomes invisible. Maybe a couple of gasps with one hand covering the mouth. I think the film mostly survives because the actual actors of the film aren't half bad. Both Michael Chiklis as the Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch are compelling whenever they're the focus. Jessica Alba is compelling, too, if only for her gorgeousness. Ioan Gruffudd is the only dud among the heroes. He always seems to add nothing to a picture. I also liked Julian McMahon as the villain. The stupidity of the whole thing isn't the film's biggest problem. The thing is, there's not much conflict in the picture. The Four (or most of them anyway) want to cure themselves, and too much of the movie is spent on this part of the plot. The villain doesn't do too much until near the end. The Four don't even realize he's a villain until the final fifteen minutes."

","When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting something brilliant. Something that matched the story of Spiderman ( struggling to find a place in the world) or the more relevant issues of X-men (trying to deal with a world that hates you). What I got from Fantastic Four was a boring, tedious, nonsensical film.<br/><br/>This film seems purely to be about Jessica Alba showing cleavage ( but lets face it, what films with her aren't) The actors in this film are hopelessly miscast with the director focusing on beauty rather than acting ability. Julian McMahon is terrible as Doctor Doom, a villain so bad that you want him to die, so it will something to the movie.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that the director has far too many issues in one film and does not focus on any one area. i.e The Thing trying to come to terms with his new life. This lasts for 5 minutes and its over The films only saving grace is Chris Evans who is actually fun as Johnny Storm and is cocky enough to add some some charm Overall though this film is a waste of time, don't watch it.

","contains spoilers The Fantastic Four was a pretty good super hero movie but it lacked something. I do not think it truly lived up to it's endless hype from early this year. In most super hero movies as in x men the first half is the characters discovering and honing their powers then the other half is using them to battle evil. In this movie three fourths of it is them not liking their superpowers trying to figure out how to get rid of them. Then the last quarter after they defeat Dr. doom they embrace their powers and decide to stay that way to help mankind from foes. So know we are left with only really 2 or 3 action scenes most of which are in the trailer. I imagine the next one (of course, if there is a next one) will be more action packed."

","Fantastic Four *<br/><br/>2005 was a year with only a few great movies based on graphic novels or comic books. To me the best were Batman Begins and the Director's Cut of Sin City. Both incredible films. Fantastic Four isn't however. It is actually one of the worst films of 2005. The cartoon series was so good because the characters were really into their powers but here the character seem that they know what powers they are going to get and it's nothing new to them. To be honest, I was rooting for Dr. Doom to kill all four of them to avoid a sequel which we all know is coming. The movie avoids clique comic book films but by doing that, the movie also avoids the intelligence and the competence of the characters. The movie really plays us for dumb. The movie assumes that we are not familiar to these characters and therefore makes no afford to properly introduce us to them. Spend more time on the characters like Spider-Man 2 does and less on plot and special effects on the sequel."
"juliankennedy23","3","1","3","12 October 2006"," Not so Fantastic
","Fantastic Four: 4 out of 10 Some comic book heroes don't translate well to film. Daredevil was a case in point. While a blind guy wearing a cherry red leather outfit might work on the panels of a comic book it looks silly on screen. (Not that this excuses the horrible Daredevil movie mind you) Mr. Fantastic (The stretching guy) of the Fantastic Four suffers this same fate. When he stretches it looks either disgusting (hand squeezing under the crack beneath a door) or quite silly (every other time he stretches.) Not that the character is helped by Ioan Gruffud's somnolent performance. He makes up one third of the most sleep inducing love triangle ever filmed.<br/><br/>The lady in question is the Jessica Alba who looks fantastic in and out of her costume (She turns invisible when naked sorry guys. But some dutiful frame by frame DVD action will surprise the patient) but she expresses no emotion about either man (Or for that matter having superpowers. But I guess looking like Jessica Alba is kind of a superpower in itself). The third part is our pseudo villain Dr. Doom. (I say pseudo because he turns villain sometime around the closing credits in the most truncated villain performance in the history of superhero films) Dr. Doom as written for the comics is the perfect screen super villain. Which begs the question why he is barely in this movie and more importantly why he is a metrosexual evil businessman (Forced to be evil because his IPO went down in price and the bank is pulling out? Which shows a remarkable lack of knowledge how IPO's work) When Alba tells Gruffud she never slept with Doom we have to believe her. I have a hard time believing these saccharine characters go the bathroom let alone have sex.<br/><br/>The other two members of the four (Evans and Chiklis) give competent if one note performances. But by the time all the introductions and back-story is completed the movie is over. With no villain, unimaginative action set pieces and some shaky special effects Fantastic Four is more mediocre than fantastic. Though there is that one frame of a not quite invisible Alba that is Fantastic indeed."

","Any comic-book fan would agree if I say that for us the main purpose of making a film adaptation of a Comic title is the chance to (finally) share with the whole world the magic and excitement that we know so well already. That's why some of the hard-core comic fans tend to be so vocal about an extreme radical departure from the source material. ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"". And while I admit that giving Spider-man organic web-shooters was a big improvement on the character, I must also say that it was somewhat disappointing to me to see the movie portrayal of the Fantastic Four. For instance, MARVEL's greatest villain is Dr. Doom. A character some consider to be one (if not the main) influence to create the character of Darth Vader (from Star Wars) who is only cinema's greatest villain. Did you know that? So it is sad to see such a scarce development of the Dr. Doom character that I can't help but wondering if it was a serious attempt of telling the broad audience the potential of comic's first super-hero team / dysfunctional family or just making a movie for the sake of it. I mean, ""The Incredibles"" was a better Fantastic Four movie than this ever was! And we're not discussing visual effects or castingO.k., we could discuss casting, Michael Chilkis notwithstanding, but the point is that a great opportunity was lost in this film to channel some of the greatest comic stories ever told. At certain point I even considered the possibility of a FF movie to be a period movie, set in the 60's that as a matter of fact were the years when the comics were the hot new trend, or so was I told, but then again I recently stumbled with the work of such great contemporary authors as Brian Michael Bendis, Warren Ellis and Mark Millar on the current comics and I saw how you can successfully update an old and established concept for the 21st century. Once you read their work you will clearly understand my frustration with this film. Is it bad? No it's not. Is it Fantastic? Far from it."

Simply not as interesting as the X-men movies.

Fire is archetypal, after all.<br/><br/>Well, I just watched ""Fantastic Four"" in HD over the weekend and it was not archetypal, it was abysmal. The only decent thing in the whole film was the Thing and the choice to put a good actor in makeup/prosthetics to bring that character to life. Everything else, from 1) poor casting of other roles: i.e. the cheesy Californication of the Torch and lame teen ""rock"" tracks, to a plastic Dr. Doom, to Alba as a mysteriously blond yet Latin Invisible Girl; to 2) the uneven effects work, especially the 'Poser model on fire (with HAIR!)' that served as the Human Torch. Only the Thing impacting the truck was super solid and felt 'believable'; to 3) the laughable excuse for a script/story. So many plot holes, lame coincidences, lame lines...so little drama, so little character development, so little ANYTHING worth watching. Did they use a computerized Mad Lib to auto-generate the shooting script or what?<br/><br/>I never write comments on films at IMDb, but the fact that this film was so bad and cost so much, and that the studio is going to make another one and probably ruin another childhood hero that should be treated w/ style and substance, ""Silver Surfer"", made me act.<br/><br/>There is NO reason films that are given these kinds of budgets and have so much potential have to be so damn bad.

Well OK it isn't as good as the Spider-Man movies or Batman Begins but still, it deserves a lot better than a 6.0/10.

","Doggonit, I liked this. Either wisely, or by falling backward into it, this succeeds where the ""X-Men"" and ""Spider Man"" things failed...there was no attempt here to put human pathos on a comic book existence, and this was refreshing. <br/><br/>Story could not ruin it, simply because of a sturdy 40+ year narrative supporting it before frame one was shot. We don't mind noisy spaceships in the vacuum, or gravity where there should be none; the invention predates ""2001"" or ""Solyaris"". <br/><br/>All Story really has to do is direct characters. And for what the movie is intended to be, the key is to not let the characters get in the way of the narrative. That narrative, by the way, is that of a squabbling, but at the end of the day a loving, family unit. ""The Incredibles"" (where the family is nailed, and the integration of the family with world is on target, too) sets the benchmark. Here, the focus is on embracing 'celebrity': so we essentially have John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br/><br/>For the sequelae to score, they will have to take visual chances -- also where this was bested by ""Incredibles"".

I mean this thing is on par with Batman and Robin, which as we all know set the bar pretty low for bad movies. Besides the fact that the plot is completely inane, not a single one of the actors could make his/her character even slightly believable. Now this is probably due to the paper-thin source material; but many of the scenes felt almost awkward, as if the actors themselves didn't even want to be spouting this drivel. I realize that comic book plots are not supposed to be realistic, and I accept that. But this movie fails on every level not just plot (dialog, character development, basic acting skill, walking and chewing gum at the same time...) Even if you have a sick fetish for Alba, that does not justify seeing this movie. And let's not forget the biggest tragedy of all: Fantastic Four 2. <br/><br/>Other Thoughts: Avoid this movie at all costs. If you're at a party and someone even suggests it, just walk out.

","I believe in formulas. I don't know why, but some story structures just work and others don't. Mozart used formulas, Dickens and Hitchcock and Shakespeare all used formulas. The artistry and uniqueness of a work of art comes from the interpretation or expression of the formula. A cliché is an overused interpretation or expression of a formula, it has nothing to do with structure. As a filmmaker, you can make a terrible mistake by trying to win your audience over by stringing clichés together, thinking you are doing formula. It's like a human body with no skeleton. By all appearances, it should seem normal and acceptable, but there is no internal structure that gives it function and form. It flops into a giant mess. Unfortunately, this movie is all clichés, and no internal structure, or formula that gives the clichés structure. Since clichés are fundamentally overused tactics, this movie scores low on originality. With no structure, it scores low on fundamental story. So I give it a 3 out of ten. But I bump it up to a 5 or 6 for the music and cinematography, but then take out 1 point for adding the mid life crisis angle all the heroes experience, simply because it is just too Big Chill, baby boomer navel reflection for my taste.

As a rule, superhero movies have never been all that great. (except for Spiderman, of course.) But this one takes the cake. I'd like to say one thing in closing: I'm pretty sure that the Thing was taller than 5'4"" In short: Don't waste your time. Read the comics. They are much better and at least you won't be forced to listen to Sum 41."

","Absolutely the (THE) worst film adaptation of a comic-book (graphic novel) ever made. The only reason I even give it one star, is due to Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans, plus the special effects. Chiklis isn't the greatest actor, but he does that sort of role well. I hated Evans, but that was the point, he's playing a cocky a******. The rest of the acting was pathetic, by that I mean the leads. Gruffudd was the worst, but followed closely by Alba and McMahon. Really feel sorry for Chiklis, his work in *The Shield* is impeccable, and I say that as someone who doesn't really like that sort of show.<br/><br/>Look, this is a comic book. They are always overly dramatic on the human interactions, but that is the appeal, simplistic human portrayals to mirror the larger than life characters. About all we got here were the stupid soap-opera interactions, slighting the larger characters. This was crap on a stick, the stick being our hopes for having some faithfulness to the genre. Now I have to go wash my hands, they feel sticky and smell bad from dealing with this poo. I can't believe I spent $20 on this fecal matter."

","FANTASTIC FOUR is a mildly entertaining version of the famous comics by Marvel. This movie deals basically with how the FANTASTIC FOUR became the super heroes they are, so a great deal of time is spent in the set up of the characters. We find out that Reed Richards is trying to convince old high school buddy turned big shot impresario Victor Von Doom about a space program. Reed's former flame, Susan Storm, now works with Von Doom AND is dating him. The setting up of Doom as the FANTASTIC FOUR's arch nemesis is a bit non convincing; there is nothing particularly menacing about him and his so called ""revenge"" motives are (at least to me) stupidly unfounded. Needless to say, the space mission with Reed, Susan, Johnny Storm, Ben(Reed's partner)and Von Doom turns out very wrong and upon arrival to earth, everyone's genetic structure is changed. Johnny Storm, Susan's kid brother, is believable enough as the cocky ""human torch"". Ben is forever physically altered, Richards' becomes an elastic being and Susan can become invisible and create force fields at the cost of great physical stress. Victor Von Doom's alteration is somewhat confusing; we never really know what ARE his genetically altered powers. Von Doom holds an intense grudge against Richards for making the mission a failure, stealing his girl and for his financial crumbling but ever since the movie started it seems that Von Doom was only waiting for something like this to happen only to be truly mad at Reed Richards. The rest of the movie moves along at a nice pace but there's nothing gripping about it. SPIDER MAN 2 has way more drama and X-MEN looks even more ""adult"" oriented than FANTASTIC FOUR. It seems the makers of this movie fought hard to make this a truly ""kiddy"" movie. It's ironic to remember that both, the comics AND the TV Cartoons depicted more a more mature version of the FANTASTIC FOUR. In the TV series, Reed looked more like a early forties man... kind of like a George Clooney type of guy. The casting will make many a fan cringe, despite the fact that all actors did OK with their roles. No matter how beautiful Jessica Alba is, she is probably the last person I would cast as Susan Storm. Johnny Storm and ""the thing"" were cast OK. Reed Richards could have been someone else and also Victor Von Doom, as they really don't look the part. Another thing that would have been nice to be included in this movie would be the TV series theme song. After all, SPIDERMAN included it some way into the film. The TV series intense, jazzy flavored theme song would have been very welcomed by yours truly. Only the frantic bass line of that original theme song was somehow spliced into this movie's original score. All in all, FANTASTIC FOUR was nice eye candy and nice movie to watch, but it's also a movie that begs for a superior sequel (a la SPIDERMAN or X-MEN)and better story."

To read that some members of our society actually believe that this is a great movie is an insult to the intelligence of the human race in general. This film is so flawed that I desperately wanted those two hours of my life back. I would complain about the $8.50, but I saw it for free. The characters are very plainly played by a very detached cast who seem to spend the whole movie just trying to establish their characters. Keep in mind these are the most simplistic of characters and could be fully explained in 5 minutes. Jessica Alba gets the award for dumbest scientist with her downright hilarious line ""That blast must have fundamentally altered our DNA."" I actually laughed out loud at the look of ""I have no idea what I just said"" on her face. These supposed ""scientists"" are so unphased by their transformations, that it quickly becomes one of the most comically unconvincing stories of all time. There are also plenty of just plain stupid ideas. One of my personal favorites was the testing of the human torch's ability to light himself on fire. When he decides to see how ""hot he can go,"" Alba's character states that he was ""approaching the temperature of the sun!"" I don't care what material that metal box he was in was made of, or how thick it was. If that guy was approaching the temperature of the sun, everybody and everything on the planet should be dead. Overall, this is easily the worst superhero movie to be released and also one of the worst films of all time. Cheesy scripting, bad acting, terrible plot, and B-rated special effects make this one almost unbearable."

"Aomalle27","2","1","3","25 September 2005"," This was a fantastic Farce!
","What have the people of the united states done to deserve a movie this bad? I mean c'mon, how many bad superhero movies do we have to suffer through. This movie pleases neither the comic book fan which seeks some continuity to the books, nor the action movie fan that has no frame of reference (ie. the comic books) but seeks some intense action and special effects. It's just awful from the get go. I think they had better production value to the old wonder woman TV shows. It starts off with a hodge-podge cast of characters thrown together for some research on the radioactive properties of a passing comet, on a futuristic looking space station. Reed Richards is the emotionally devoid scientist, Ben Grimm his pilot buddy. Johnny Storm, the reckless co-pilot, Sue his uber hot sister (played by Jessica Alba), and the nefarious Victor Von Doom. Now here's my problem, they can't bring Doom to keep with the stories of the comics, but even breaking with comic continuity, why would an industrial billionaire insist on going into space for a dangerous science experiment? If Donald Trump was funding an expedition into the jungles of Brazil, do you honestly think he'd insist on going? That's why they're billionaires, they let their money do the work. And why do modern film makers also have a supermodel looking type scientist? How many hot chicks have you seen at NASA? As Rhodes scholars? In any scientific field? Not to say hot chicks aren't smart, but really, they're hot, so they don't have to resort to science to hide their hideous looks to the world. That's what homely looking nags do. And why would Sue want to hook up with Reed? The writers of a movie are the only thing making that possible. If their's one thing tabloid newspapers have taught me, it's that hot chicks go for millionaires, sports stars, or politically powerful people. They don't go for reclusive scientists, without a penny to their name. Anyway, the experiment goes wrong, and all five (Isn't that odd, there's only the five major players on the space ship, where are the support cast so obviously needed to operate a space station?) are affected by the radiation of the comet. Wow, isn't that clever, they are all given powers to reflect their personalities; Doom is power hungry, and he gets great metallic power. Johnny is a firebrand and reckless, thus he gets fiery powers. Reed gets the ability to stretch, I suppose because he's so thrifty stretching a buck. Sue, is given the ability to go invisible. Which would be more apt for someone shy and quiet. Alba doesn't play it that way though, so it really doesn't make sense. Anyway the only highlight of the rest of the movie is Alba stripping down to her bra and panties, but here's where the movie goes utterly wrong. Why not either make this a whole movie of Alba stripping down, or break down and hire a writer for the movie. I mean it's cut as if they were writing the scenes as they filmed. I swear some of the actors were actually standing around with no clue what would come next. Skip this, otherwise I'll show up at your house, and then it'll be ""clobberin' Time!""."

As a long-time FF aficionado, I felt the movie remained true to the spirit of the comics. Other than the miscasting of the uber-sexy and non-blonde Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, I thought the rest of the cast totally nailed their characters, especially the Thing and the Torch. The interplay between those two caught the essence and original appeal of Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's creations perfectly. The special effects also did justice to the powers of the various characters: comparing favourably with the rather jerky CGI of ""Hulk"".<br/><br/>Interestingly, my wife, who knew next to nothing about the characters prior to viewing the movie, thoroughly enjoyed the film - much more so than Revenge of the Sith or War of the Worlds (I'm not sure I agree with her on these, but that's another story!)So you don't have to be a comics geek to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I sometimes think critics don't know how to deal with superhero movies: above all these are meant to be fantasies and fun and cannot, in my opinion, be judged in the same way as more realistic action movies.<br/><br/>One good thing about poor reviews: one gets a pleasant surprise when you actually find a film that does not deserve them!"

Chris evans has the cocky human torch down a tee and chiklis is brilliant as the self loathing tough guy turned stone.The little back and forths and bouts of bickering they have between each other are very good and overshadow the the sappy sue storm/ reed richard romance subplot.<br/><br/>The film ends on a cliff hanger which promises that we are in for a treat with the inevitable sequel, but if its script had more depth and the action was more exciting then we would have been in for a treat the first time round.<br/><br/>Oh and hardcore who don't agree can suck a fat one.That is all."

Instead of being scared by the fact that Johnny had just spontaneously burst into flames (and don't you think he might be slightly worried himself?!), Maria Menounos jumps into bed with him, all laughing and joking! I really can't stress enough that I didn't go into this film wanting to hate it, I don't dislike all Hollywood blockbusters, and even had some hopes for this; it just seemed to have no thought to the Direction, Script, Casting and even the Acting in some quarters.

","My husband and I saw ""the Fantastic Four"" last night at the big multiplex in Ipswich. The husband isn't a comics fan, but he's a big CGI fan. I was never a great Marvel reader, but I think the Kirby FF issues are every big as good as Marvel Zombies rave they are. ""The Fantastic Four"" struck us as the self conscious chapter one of a franchise, but still, we enjoyed the film. I agree that Chris Evans as the Human Torch made the film rock in more ways than one. I liked the depiction of him as a snow boarder and motorcycle devil. Too bad he couldn't be blond (The comics Johnny Storm is) -- surely he'd be the type to have a peroxide highlights job on his crew cut. By the way, the actor's name caused a bit of amusement in the UK gossip mags as Chris Evans is a British radio DJ notorious for binge drinking sessions that go on for weeks, and for marrying a teenage ""singing"" star and then divorcing her (Her name is Billie Piper and she was the assistant in the latest Dr. Who).<br/><br/>The actor playing the Thing also was outstanding,able to move the audience in spite of his foam suit. Reed Richards was too wimpy for me: I wanted him to have more gravitas, especially more gravitas by the end of the movie. Okay, it was an origin movie, I could see him growing into the role of the father figure of the FF, but he was still too weedy at the end. Sue Storm was too thin in more sense than one. Sorry, but there is no way I could see her wanting to be the love interest of a Lex Luthor-like Dr. Doom -- it was just too much like the TV Lois and Clark.<br/><br/>We rated the Dr. Doom separately because we are both Charmed fans and Julian McMahon tore a place in our hearts as Cole, part human, part demon. He gave a fairly effective performance as Doom, but the part called for him to be a Lex Luthor clone who becomes pure evil. McMahon had better scenes as pure evil when he played the Source, the head of the underworld on Charmed. He looked really fine in the skintight suit on the space station, but the part didn't give him much to do that was three dimensional, aside from putting on a metal mask. The scar weeping metal drops was really chilling, though.<br/><br/>The husband didn't rate the CGI very highly. He said the cloth effects on Mr. Fantastic were average, the invisible effects could be better, and the force fields came out of a Lightwave tutorial. He also thought showing peril on a bridge is clichéd, especially after the recent bridge scenes in the Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>But overall, we had a fun night out. The movie obviously sets up the sequel in the closing sequences. We would be willing to see the next FF film- providing it has stronger characterization for Sue, Reed, and Dr. Doom."

","What you need to know is this: They stayed true to the comic-book! Sure, Dr. Doom was changed, but he's been pretty much ruined in the comic over the years, so I think it was the right choice to reinvent him for the movie. The other characters remained intact in virtually every detail, and the movie was generally *great*. If you have any interest in superheroes and larger-than-life concepts, forget about the bad reviews. Those critics are just not sensitive to this stuff.<br/><br/>I have been reading FF comics for twenty years, so I was understandably worried that Hollywood would mess up this movie as well, as they've done with several other comics-based movies (esp. Elektra - argh!). But I also retained my optimism - fueled by the excellent trailers -, and despite the almost unanimously terrible reviews, I went in to this movie with high hopes. And throughout the movie, as no bad scenes or twists came along, my enthusiasm just kept climbing. Hey, maybe the Hollywood suits found the original story too complex to mess with, and left well enough alone?! For once!<br/><br/>In any case, this movie joins X-Men and Spider-Man as a truly successful new film franchise based on classic Marvel comics - and because the FF concept is just so much more grand and colorful and sci-fi-like than the regular-joe grounding of Spider-Man and the murky, moody mutants, I'd have to say that Fantastic Four is my favorite Marvel movie yet. A fantastic romp!<br/><br/>Every actor was totally great (although I would rather have seen Elisha Cuthbert as Sue). Especially Johnny Storm, who was far better than I'd expected. The bickering between Ben and Johnny was also GREAT. Just right. Beautiful. I don't understand why many critics found it boring - I thought it had lots of sting.<br/><br/>OK, the movie wasn't 100% perfect. There could have been a stronger focus on Reed and his great intellect. There could have been a slightly better dialog in places, and various plot points could have been better explained (like, Doom really only cures Ben so he can leech the cosmic energy off of him, and he does - so how can the human Ben just go back and become the Thing again, if his cosmic radiation went into Doom...? Well, I just would have liked this point to have been addressed). But overall a delightful, highly entertaining movie - if you belong to the true target audience! ;-)<br/><br/>I rate the FF movie a very solid 8 out of 10 - and I'm very close to pushing that up to a 9!"

","Most action movies seem to move really quickly through the plot in order to focus on the special effects and action. This film was exactly the opposite. The building and transformation of the characters took so much up so much of the plot, that there was very little room for the action scenes. The beginning of the movie was slow, the middle of the movie slow, and the end of the movie was really fast, but still slow. The climax of the movie was horribly short, and afterward you are left with the feeling, ""Was that it?"" That being said, the special effects did look nice, and the interactions between the characters (especially Johnny and Ben) were sometimes humorous. But it seems like they tried to make a comic book action movie and accidentally made a mistake for a drama. The high points of the film are minimized so that the subtle points (which most action-movie viewers did not come to see) are very-much drawn out. Almost a third of the film could be removed, and it might actually make the film better. Overall it wasn't awful, but it was really that good either."

","This is a movie of a major missed opportunity: Doctor Doom. Victor Von Doom is one of, if not THE major villain in all the Marvel universe. And since Marvel absorbed DC with all its classic heroes, Marvel must do something very right, and you can't do super heroes right without also doing super VILLAINS right. Enter Doctor Doom. He's unique. He's terrifying. He's Darth Vader, Count Dracula, Hitler and Satan all rolled into one. He's got style and substance few heroes ever achieve. In this movie, unfortunately, he was relegated to a standard cookie-cutter bad guy. Doom, much like the Joker and other Batman movie villains, could (and should) have easily upstaged the heroes. In fact, there could have been a movie made all about him (and before anyone says you can't make a movie about a villain, how many Dracula movies have been made over the years?) Doom's major strength lies in his genius. He does NOT HAVE super powers. He makes his own! Normally, altering the basic story of a comic is forgivable in the essence of dramatic or cinema-paced storytelling, but this is criminal! Doom getting ""powers"" along with the other FF strips him of everything that makes him threatening and cool. Moreover, it takes away the thunder of the heroes as it takes 4 people to defeat just 1 when they have the same essential background. Doom has always been a self-made villain, seizing power for himself, not getting it by accident, and therein lies the terror--the heroes have powers beyond humanity, and yet Doom still finds a way to become their equal--imagine if he DID have ""powers"". Well, this movie giving them to him and then having him still get beaten means the writers gave this great character no greater thought than ""We're doing the FF movie, so who is their major nemesis, okay let's get the costume right, and give him the standard villain duties to look menacing and then get beat up."" However well this movie may have treated the FF themselves, it was a travesty for Marvel's greatest villain. If they make a sequel to this disaster-piece, leave Doom out of it--most Marvel villains can tolerate being reduced to cookie-cutter bad guys, and I'm sure they're lining up for the FF sequel, but godforbid trashing Doom further."

In particular, as you might have guessed, I'm comparing this movie to Batman Begins, which was a severe, heartbreaking letdown. While Christopher Nolan chose to shroud Batman in darkness, FANTASTIC FOUR dances in vivid pastels. While Batman markets to those of us who've grown up too fast, FANTASTIC FOUR instead markets to the kid in all of us.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I get a kick out of seeing the Fantastic Four on-screen. I attribute this childish exuberance to having never once seen an animated episode of Hannah-Barbara's Fantastic Four :(<br/><br/>Basically, super-heroes are not tough to do. The name of the game is simplify, don't over complicate, and FANTASTIC FOUR dishes out exactly what we kids are looking for. All we really want to see is Mr. Fantastic, the THING, the Invisible Woman, and the Human Torch standing proud in the flesh, wearing the costumes we've grown to love. We want to see them flaunt their super powers ... a lot, and that's what they do in this movie. Batman Begins supposed that the audience wanted to see the background psychological trauma that shaped the infamous dark knight. That would have been nice if it had been done correctly and taken to the proper extremes, which ""Begins"" failed to do. But the kid in me also wanted to see Batman use little gadgets and drive the Batmobile like he did in the comic books. I don't care how cheesy the Batmobile looked, I want to see it! Gimme the cheese, full blast!<br/><br/>Thank heavens FANTASTIC FOUR did not focus on psychological trauma, or else it would have devoted 120 minutes to the strained relationship between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman. That would have turned out to be a weird & twisted Sleepless in Seattle, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>THE FANTASTIC FOUR gets the comic book feel just right, without being too Disney on one hand and without getting too boring and drawn out on the other. That's how the comics books operated back in the day. They portrayed the difficult themes of adult life but were rhythmic enough to keep you flipping the pages.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty short and fast paced, which considering the playful direction the production took, was a good thing. We are taken on a whirlwind tour of the accident that created the super team, given a light taste of their personal troubles with society, and zoomed through their battle against Doctor Doom. At the end you're left still feeling high-spirited with a couple minutes to sip a soda and reminisce about the good old comic book days with your blokes. I would highly recommend bringing kids to see this movie, more so than I would with any other super-hero movie of recent memory.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie was its portrayal of Doctor Doom. Okay, so he has these devastating electrical powers which I don't remember him having in the comic books, but that's not important. His voice is too highly pitched. Behind the mask he's a weaselly corporate executive, but if I did Doctor Doom, I'd have him older and more foreboding like Darth Vader. Perhaps James Earl Jones was too busy with Verison and the MARVEL casting team had no where to turn on a tight schedule.<br/><br/>Speaking of MARVEL, the great American comic giant has pushed quite a campaign recently wouldn't you say? I remember ten years ago when I heard rumors of an X-men movie, and of course the foremost question on my mind was, ""Will Arnold Schwarzenegger play Colossus?"" (He instead chose to do Mr. Freeze, which no doubt helped him greatly in his political campaign.) Well I'm glad to see that MARVEL finally sprinted to the big screen in recent years churning out:<br/><br/>1. The Hulk (my favorite)<br/><br/>2. Spiderman (lukewarm for Raimi), Spiderman 2 (pretty good)<br/><br/>3. X-men (not bad), X-men 2 (better than the first)<br/><br/>4. Daredevil (haven't seen)<br/><br/>5. Elektra (haven't seen)<br/><br/>Having been so pleased with THE FANTASTIC FOUR and betrayed by Christopher Nolan and DC Comics, the next question on my mind is, which MARVEL super hero should be next?<br/><br/>How about the BLOB?<br/><br/>""Nothing can stop the BLOB!""<br/><br/>JY<br/><br/>Jimboduck-dot-com"

","this was only marginally decent at best. really, honestly, in light of more than 40 years of fantastic four history, it sucks ass.<br/><br/>Marvel continues to shock an dismay as they ruin every great character they have for the sake of ""franchising"" aka money. Just because the Stan Lee origin story works for Spider-Man, that doesn't mean that it makes a good story when you try to fit 4 times as many origins and personalities in 1 film.<br/><br/>ALSO, ""extreme sports"" and shi**y soundtracks don't make for a good or successful film. Ask someone to sing the theme to Superman or to Batman, and then ask someone to sing the theme to Fantastic Four. By degrading the music, you degrade the legacy of the film, ironically degrading your precious ""franchise"" faster.<br/><br/>And on the subject of ""franchising,"" the point is to make as many independently successful film series as possible, similar to putting out multiple comic book titles. The point is not (or SHOULD not be) to sell a familiar symbol or title to someone, only to have it be a different skin for the same film! STUDIOS: You're not just buying a logo, you're buying decades of rich history and storytelling. Reed Richards is supposed to be one of the smartest men in the world - a technological genius. ONE NEW DEVICE IN TWO WORTHLESS HOURS OF A MOVIE?? what a waste. and Daredevil would never fight Elektra in broad daylight out of costume in public.<br/><br/>and to Avi Arad, I'm guessing: New York City is coming along fine since 9/11. I don't know if you've had a chance to leave Los Angeles to check it out, but most everyone's coping fine. the last thing we need is another ""New Yorkers standing as one"" scene in a Marvel movie. As if those scenes in Spider-man 1&2 weren't enough to make you want to move to France...<br/><br/>The only hope we have left is that some major studio will buy Marvel Enterprises so that we can someday see an Avengers movie. You won't be able to put Chingy or Nickelback on that soundtrack. But in the meantime, I can't wait to see a Captain America movie all about how troublesome high school was, but look at how much ass he can kick now! (featuring the music of Disturbed).<br/><br/>This film only gets a 3 for Michael Chiklis, though no more, because the thing shoulda been bigger."

","I think that this movie was a lot of fun to watch. I didn't go expecting an award winning experience, I went in with an open mind hoping to be entertained for a couple of hours and that's exactly what happened.<br/><br/>I never read the comic books so I had no expectations or anything to compare it to. Some people I've talked to heard it got bad reviews and turned their noses up at it, but if I always listened to critics I'd miss a lot of enjoyable movies. It had great special effects and good action sequences....yet they didn't overdo the action to the point where it took away from either the story or the acting. There were of course predictable moments but overall it was a great time. The thing I loved most was that there wasn't a plot that involved taking out the entire city/world with the touch of a button or keystroke that our superhero friends had to stop before they took out the villain. I get a little sick of that kind of ending all the time, instead it was bad guy wants to take out good guys and good guys prevail.<br/><br/>Overall it was definitely worth watching, I'd see it again!"

","The new summer blockbuster hit is a enjoyable movie for all the family, where they can spend two wonderful hours together. The movie is aimed for much a teen audience than an adult audience, but still adults will enjoy this movie and fans of the Marvel comic books will find this movie pleasant. Although is not followed the original time line of the Marvel Comics.<br/><br/>As in my own experience in the theater, the movie was more enjoyed by teens and teens rather than most of the adults, but still I heard the comments of some adults saying "" that the movie was fun, and they were glad to bring their children to watch it together.<br/><br/>One of the most important part in movie based on superheroes comics is that the actors and actresses portraying the characters, known the mannerisms of the role they are playing so at the moment to convince the audience, the audience can accept and believe the role they are playing. Knowing about the comic books I believe that the main character portrayed very well their roles in this adaptation.<br/><br/>I have to give a cheer to Jessica Alba, because the mainstream public can see, she have moved away from her role in Honey; and she can appeal to more fantastic and serious roles, like her ""Nancy Callahan"" her role in Frank Miller's Sin City. Also I like to appoint this movie can show how versatile actor Michael Chiklis is, portraying the role of The Thing, and this movie can help to introduce Ioan Gruffud to a more diversify audience in America.<br/><br/>At many comic books adaptations in to movies, there are some comic book characters that are submitted to changes in the movie versions of the comics books; in this version of the Fantastic Four the character Alicia Masters was changed from a young Caucasian woman to beautiful African American woman. Kerry Washington did an splendid performance of the blind sculptress.<br/><br/>A change that was made in the movie, was the origins of Doctor Doom; it was a change that the fanatics of the comic series didn't like to much, although Julian McMahon did a decent job conserving the essence of the villain in the movie. This is the character that had most changes in the film version, but is fun to see Doctor Doom in a new scenario beyond the comic books universe.<br/><br/>Even this movie suffered changes it's still fun to see this movie, the changes are less to important because people will enjoy it and can spend two hours sitting in a movie theater and forget about the problems they have for just one moment."

","I know that this review will likely infuriate many Fantastic Four fans but I don't mean to insult or offend it's just my opinion which is how this works. Fantastic Four are not your typical super heroes. They are more kid oriented and their powers are almost cartoony so taking them live action would be much more of a challenge than something like Batman, Spiderman, or even Superman. Enter the newest film by director Tim Story. He goes for more of a balanced mix between campy, dark humor, and real live action trying to humanize the heroes as best he can.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is about former Nasa scientist Reed Richards and his best friend pilot Ben Grimm. Richard's has gone bankrupt and needs funding for his next project. In order to do that he turns to a former adversary, Victor Von Doom. He pitches him the idea of studying DNA in space in order to get a better understanding of it. Doom agrees if only to get 75% of the all the profits. Planning the trip into space is the lovely, and former girlfriend of Richards, Sue Storm. The two clash from the moment they meet again. Sue insists that her womanizing, off the handle brother Johnny Storm pilot the ship with Ben sitting co-pilot, an idea Ben is not crazy about. The five of them head into space and they must set up their equipment before getting hit by a cosmic storm which they will be protected from inside the ship. The storm is estimated to be nine hours away but suddenly as Ben goes outside the ship to set up equipment they discover the storm has shifted and is not minutes away. The team rush to get Ben back in the ship but it's too late and Ben takes a direct hit from the Cosmic storm and the rest of them, including Victor are exposed as well. When they return to Earth they seem fine but gradually slowly discover that they're DNA has been fundamentally altered giving each of them extraordinary powers. Ben Grimm goes through a horrible metamorphosis and is turned into an enormous solid rock creature and loses all human features. Devastated he escapes the compound to go home to his wife and when his wife turns her back on him he goes away to think. Unfortunately his appearance and strength causes some commotion on a bridge and accidents ensue. The team use their newly found powers to work and save people and they go from nobodies to celebrities overnight. Johnny Storm loves it, he embraces it, but the rest of the team only want to hide away and find a cure to their powers. The media name them The Fantastic Four and Johnny gives them all their super hero names. Unfortunately Victor Von Doom has cracked under the pressure of the newly found powers and the failure of his company and has become Dr. Doom. Doom wishes to destroy Reed and his team leaving him the only one who will be Fantastic.<br/><br/>As with most original Superhero films this covers the basics, where they came from and their beginnings. It's fun to watch the team fight amongst each other until they get a handle on their powers. There is a slightly different tone to this film because basically the only evil being fought is the man who wants to destroy them. It's more about self defense than it is about defending the world. For an action film it lacked as many action scenes as I would thought but nonetheless is quite captivating and has a great story. Parts are very campy but they fit well and I think Story meant it to be that way. The cast...Ioan Gruffudd, as Reed Richards. He does a decent job and he has a very leadership quality to him although his character wasn't as depthy as it could have been. There was a passiveness to him that slowly broke out with his powers but they never really covered it. The biggest name of the film really, Jessica Alba also did the best job. As Sue Storm she was outspoken, and intelligent and did one of the better acting jobs. I think a role like this could really give her the breakout she needs. Chris Evans was almost overused. His obnoxiousness poured through and despite some funny one-liners he needs to be toned down for the future. As an actor he's okay but needs to find his niche. Michael Chiklis did an incredible job as both Ben Grimm and The Thing. The story didn't go much into his true emotional state and how he felt about losing everything but when they did touch on it, he did decent. Julian McMahon as the evil Dr. Doom did an incredible job. He was viciously evil and they gave him the space and events to be a little more than PG which was nice for such an evil character. Frankly I think any future installments to the Fantastic Four will be a downward spiral. As much as I would love to see Doom come back and do some more world domination evil, it would be tough to carry on the story in a watchable manner. I think in fact Tim Story was lucky enough to pull this one off which is quite watchable and amusing. If you love the Marvel comic books or even just Superhero films it's worth seeing, maybe they'll leave it with this one (cough yeah right cough cough) 7.5/10"

","I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. This is a fun, tongue-in cheek, yet action-filled film with a terrific cast, the only exception being Jessica Alba, who does *not* make a believable blonde. Still, her acting was competent, and everyone else's was terrific. Got some great chuckles from the one-liners, especially those delivered by the characters The Thing and The Human Torch. Other than the aforementioned Ms. Alba, everyone looked perfect for their part. Talented and handsome Welsh actor Ioan Gruffud, known by many for his TV role as Horatio Hornblower, was a great coup in casting. At first, I thought he would be too young to play Mr. Fantastic, but the story was nicely set up so that he wasn't. Mr. Gruffud (pronounced ""Griffith"") added a touch of class to this fun film, which truly puts the word ""comic"" back into ""comic book superheroes."""

The spirit of the comic was very well captured, the special effects are pretty good, and the film as a whole is entertaining. The ending is perfect for a sequel: It lets you waiting for the next one. I'm sure there will be Fantastic Four II, III, IV and even more.<br/><br/>I'm not a comic fan, but I liked this movie. More than Batman Begins (2005) although less than Superman."
"Victor Field","7","1","3","30 July 2005"," It may not be fully fantastic, but it deserves more than four stars out of 10.
","Let's get this out of the way - ""Fantastic Four"" is not as good as the best superhero movie of the past few years. But then again, not even the ""Spider-Man"" movies are as good as ""The Incredibles,"" so that was only to be expected.<br/><br/>I think the reason a number of people were predicting/hoping this would be the disaster of the summer (a mantle that at the time of writing seems to be assumed by ""The Island"" instead, which serves Michael Bay right for producing ""The Amityville Horror"") is that the movie was deliberately setting out to be not as Important as other Marvel/DC comic book movies of late - less brooding, more lightweight and enjoyable. That, and the strange casting in front of and behind the camera (Hornblower as Mr. Fantastic? Chris ""Not that one"" Evans as the Human Torch? The bloke from ""Nip/Tuck"" who used to go out with Dannii Minogue as Dr. Doom - though he's never referred to as such in the movie? And the multiracial and sexy-beyond-belief Jessica Alba as the very WASPy Sue? Even Alba fans objected to casting the latter as someone who is, after all, regularly invisible). And the fact that Simon Kinberg (who already has two strikes with ""xXx2"" and ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" - I don't care if that was a hit, I didn't like it) gave an ultimately uncredited hand to the script.<br/><br/>And while it's true that the special effects sometimes aren't of ""The Lord of the Rings"" quality (the scene where the immodestly dubbed Mr. Fantastic falls down a building is distressingly cartoonish), that the movie isn't as effective with the love story between Reed, Susan and Victor Von Doom as with the Thing and the Human Torch, and that there aren't as many all-out action scenes as you could wish for - the battles don't come along until well into the movie - it does work when you take it on its own terms instead of expecting a dark, gritty origins movie. (Though let's face it, who expects doom and gloom from a movie executive produced by Chris Columbus?) Unlike ""Elektra,"" it's not ashamed to please its audience and has a healthy sense of humour about itself - so healthy that it almost becomes a bit camp, but only almost.<br/><br/>With three appealing turns from our title quartet (only Ioan Gruffudd lets the side down as Reed Richards, not quite living up to his name of Mr. Fantastic; Michael Chiklis and especially Chris Evans have the most colourful roles and really bolster the movie when they're on, and though Jessica Alba has less scope in her role as the Invisible Woman she's nowhere near as lost as, say, Katie Holmes in ""Batman Begins""), attempts to infuse emotion into the story that keep your attention until the fights start, and a villain in Julian McMahon's Victor who at least has more going for him than the ones in - yes, again - ""Batman Begins,"" it's nothing more than a good, unambitious movie. The movie could have done without the songs over the credits though (John Ottman's score isn't Elfman or Williams, but at least he has a good old-fashioned heroic fanfare here), but that's hardly a major criticism. And be honest; would you rather have something that shoots relatively low and hits the target, or something that overreaches and dies? <br/><br/>Then again, this is a movie that has Jessica Alba in Spandex. And materialising in her underwear. And saying things like ""It's been a good two years, Victor"" and ""We can only stay for one drink because I have to go and meet Victor."" Did you really think I was going to hate it? Did you really?"
"japamo","8","1","3","28 July 2005"," The Movie's Only True Shortcoming is -- Shortness
","Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment ""professional"" critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However, last night Ifinally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.<br/><br/>The ""Fantastic Four"" (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing ""superhero"" motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought ""Batman"" mode, nor is it the FF's modus operandi. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly channels ""Lilo and Stitch""'s and Sister Sledge's theme of ""We are family, where nobody gets left behind.<br/><br/>Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially deleterious side effects may occur. As even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, ""Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?"" Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) amply demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to ""bust out"" and enjoy his incendiary new powers.<br/><br/>The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) searingly evokes. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and gingerly attempt to reconnect with your fiancée? Wouldn't you swim in morose self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The encounter with the potential bridge jumper and the saving of his, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this ""brute""'s good soul. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects Ben's nobility and deep psychological resources. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) does not show a genetic scientist's demeanor, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. The New York public cotton to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if inadvertent? I suppose Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism)helped sway public opinion. Ben's erstwhile fiancé, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.<br/><br/>Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to tenebrous, Darth-like evil needed a bit more flesh. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, my criticisms are mere quibbles.<br/><br/>The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment, comparable to the original 1978 movie Superman, which, as you recall, also had its share of social and superpower inuring, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.<br/><br/>Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. ""The Trial of Galactus"" storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its ""shortness"" problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.<br/><br/>As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:<br/><br/>Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"

It may help that my husband is a superhero buff so I went in knowing the story of what happens to the Fantastic 4 - so seeing it come to life is what's cool for us.

","After reading the 'professional' reviews I went to see Fantastic Four with some trepidation, but the film is much better than many of these reviews would lead you to believe. The casting for the FF themselves was spot-on, and the film develops their personalities and relationships brilliantly. This is also the film's only real flaw - although the scenes showing how the Four adapt to their new-found powers and how they relate to each other are enjoyable, too much time is spent on this and not enough on developing the adventure itself. Victor von Doom's transformation to the evil Dr Doom is done fairly well, but Doom himself doesn't really come across as the towering evil genius you expect from the comics. There is none of the egomaniacal posturing or the grand ""Who dares to challenge the magnificence of Doom?"" type lines we've all come to know and love from the comic books. Overall, though, the film was a pleasant surprise and well worth watching for anyone who has read the comics. For anyone who hasn't but who has the capacity to return to their childhood for a couple of hours, this is a good introduction to some clean, comic book fun."

","Fantastic Four is a perfect example of a what a PG-13 comic book movie based on a story that was meant to be fun and light-hearted should be. I caught this in theaters and i swear i had a great time. It's funny, has a great action sequence on the bridge, and a pretty decent villain. This is not a masterpiece, nor did it intend to be. It's good old fashioned fun at the movies. Remember those days?<br/><br/>Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) steals the show with his clever one-liners and fire ""everywhere"". Especially funny when cracking on my other favorite Ben Grimm (Micheal Chiklis). Kudos to Chiklis for fighting to make the Thing in costume and make up instead of CGI. It paid off because the costume looks great and computer graphics would have crapified the whole flick. Just like they did with Mr. Fantastic's stretching ability which looks pretty damn horrible. Jessica Alba, on the other hand, is still smokin' hot. She was okay in the movie too.<br/><br/>This is an underrated movie that is lots of fun to watch, so if you don't feel like getting confused, depressed, or bored, this is a fine alternative.--- 7/10"
"Rich B","7","1","3","24 July 2005"," Fun entertainment with no great meat. Enjoyable, funny, with Chiklis, Evans and McMahon great to watch.
","All the production news, pre-release rumour and reviews were all pointing towards this being a bad movie. I was waiting for and expecting it, but as someone who has grown up reading comics, these years are the ones we are looking forward to. Our comic heroes are coming to the big screen and they are coming in droves, and not in eighties low budget style, but in big screen and with big budgets.<br/><br/>Basically I couldn't miss this, I couldn't dare, despite what people said about it. Yet I still feared the worst.<br/><br/>The early news that the latter portions of the movie were entirely re-written and re-cut during the editing process without the actors was worrying, and then seeing the reviews and the hefty defence of the movie by the Studio and actors was worrying.<br/><br/>Something you have to think about with the characters in Fantastic Four is that they aren't like characters like Batman. Batman is hard edged, real, gritty, violent. Where the line between good and bad is bigger than the black and white put together, and that's where the Batman character lives.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a lighter base of characters and stories, like Spiderman and such. There are clearer sides to be drawn on good and bad, and the characters stay there. The world is more fantasy than real, and with that I went to see the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>It starts off really fast, and keeps going like that. You really do notice that the story goes along faster than most other movies. Development of the characters before anything happens to them is out the window and before your seat is warm the team are in space and being hit by a storm.<br/><br/>Now this isn't really a bad thing because firstly the pace of the movie seems pretty even, there's no point you're wishing it would either hurry up or slow down, it seems quite well paced throughout. Secondly, the character development isn't really forgotten, it's bundled in with the rest of the story, and this makes for a refreshing change. After all the story is about the Fantastic Four and Dr Doom, so let's see them.<br/><br/>Character development is pretty loose on Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman (I can't use the word girl when referring to Jessica Alba) and Von Doom. What you get is the bare minimum to set them up for the second film. The characters that we see a bit more of are Thing and Torch, and this is also good for they are at loggerheads from the beginning of the movie and are two entirely different characters.<br/><br/>Thing is a family man, gentle and caring, and very thoughtful of others. Torch is a wild young guy who likes extreme sports and thinks only of himself. They're shown quite well, and the cheese factor seen in some of the trailers is not so apparent when you see the movie itself.<br/><br/>For me the characters of Doom, Torch and Thing stand out the most. Doom is played by Julian McMahon very well, he's evil and self centred, making him an excellent choice for the new Hitcher role. His slow move to internal destruction and total acceptance of evil is well done, and his little nuances are good fun to watch.<br/><br/>Chris Evans has some superb lines to deliver and delivers them with spot on timing. He's funny, and the comedy works. Michael Chiklis looks very at home in this role, although I kept thinking of Vic at certain points in the movie he did manage to shake the bad image quite well. He shows his trouble with accepting who he has become even through that huge suit, and you just can't help but like the character.<br/><br/>The film really is a setup for the following movies, and there's nothing wrong with that, but you have to remember what this is. It's not gritty, meaty, thoughtful material. This is fun entertainment. Sit back and enjoy a comic ride, and it does work. I left having been entertained, and although I quickly moved on to think of other things, I still enjoyed it. Just because it is a comic adaptation, do not judge it with the same eye as Batman.<br/><br/>Action is what makes the most of this movie. The set pieces are well conceived and orchestrated, particularly the early bridge piece that introduces the world to the characters.<br/><br/>I'm not going to slate this movie, it's not fantastic, but it is good entertainment and opens the way for a strong series. The characters are good, with Torch, Doom and Thing stealing the show, and the action is strong as well. It's worth a watch if you don't fancy something to make you think too much, but do want to come away feeling you enjoyed yourself. Just remember two things, it's light, and it's entertainment. It's a popcorn movie."
"ElKabong-3","8","1","3","23 July 2005"," simply fantastic!
","Among the very best of the comic book superhero movies, ranking up there with Spiderman and Batman Begins for quality. Casting was good, acting was adequate, special effects were tremendous. I hope my appreciation of the FX is not colored by how much superior they are to the 1994 dog of a flick directed by Roger Korman. Aside from the title, the two films have almost nothing in common. The plot line adheres to the comic book story very closely, with the only major difference being that of Dr. Doom being exposed to cosmic rays and changed along with our heroes. While a fairly major thing, this did not seriously detract from the film story. There were other miniscule departures, such as Ben Grimm being married, but these did not have a big impact on the plot. I have heard it said that the story was somewhat juvenile, to which i say, ""It's a comic book Superhero movie."" you aren't going to get Gone With the Wind, but you do get a fine and entertaining film. I haven't heard of anybody who thought that they wasted 8.50 by seeing it. Personally, I enjoyed it greatly, the film makers made the story come to life from the pages of Marvel Comics. Probably the best of the superhero movies from Marvel comics, and surpassed overall only by the magnificence of Batman Begins in all the comic book genre of films. I heartily recommend.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"cultjones","7","1","3","23 July 2005"," 'Fantastic Four' the whole family;
","The trend of Marvel heroes being transferred from the comic books to the big screen continues with Tim Story's adaptation of the 'Fantastic Four'. By having an ensemble of popular TV actors rather then any big names, Story allows the audience to concentrate on the movie and the incredible special effects. <br/><br/>The sexy Jessica Alba from Dark Angel and Sin City fame takes on the role of the Invisible girl and although the male audience will be disappointed to learn they'll hardly see Ms. Alba, rest assured when you do see her, the wait is worth it. <br/><br/>To see Michael Chiklis from 'The Shield' as straight up 'good guy' is both strange and refreshing. Casting Chiklis as the 'The Thing' could have been considered as a risk but both the producers and Chiklis must be smiling to learn their gamble paid off and then some. <br/><br/>Julian McMahon who plays the slick Dr. Troy in Nip/Tuck excels as the villainous electric Von Doom while on the other side of the intensity spectrum, Chris Evans dons the 'flame' of 'The Torch' and has the audience chucking with his witty, Ryan Reynolds-esquire performance. <br/><br/>The enjoyable and atypical plot enables the audience to gradually learn about the characters, their powers and the emotions they endure as they come to terms with their fate. Even though the final confrontation between good and evil leaves a lot to be desired, one can't help feeling that this is a solid foundation to build a successful franchise on. <br/><br/>With humour, incredible stunts and effects, 'Fantastic Four' has something enjoyable for the whole family."
"darylh91","7","1","3","23 July 2005"," Damn the critics!
","Of course i was ready to be disappointed after reading every critics in US harshly bashing this movie and all of the people involved in it - and of course i really should thank these so-called critics since i was pleasantly surprised with the result. F4 is OK, better than just OK; it's enjoyable - it has the simple clear fun comic book feeling of their creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby back in the 60's. and for me it was almost more than i hoped for in the first place. F4 is one of the best comic book adaptation so far. Only X MEN 2 and BATMAN RETURNS are superior, OK far superior; F4 is as good as X MEN and SPIDERMAN 2 and inches away above SPIDERMAN and BATMAN BEGINS. And please don't bother compare with DAREDEVIL, HULK or worse again ELEKTRA, CATWOMAN, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, SUPERMAN (yes, not all of the movies from the 70's were masterpieces), SPAWN or THE PUNISHER as there are some of the worst movies ever made in any genre. I can understand that both critics and fans were dubious when heard about the chosen director of this project. Tim Story is no Bryan Singer,Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan or even Joel Schumacher (sic!); he was in fact the director of 2 terrible idiotic movies. and Jessica Alba is no Michelle Pfeiffer or Halle Berry, Julian Mac Nahon is no Ian Mac Kellen, Ioan gruffud is no Patrick Stewart, Chris Evans is no Alan Cumming... i could go on and on with the different names attached to the project. But finally everyone involved did their job and they did a good job. The director is not as talented as Bryan Singer (he did such a wonderful job on x men 2!)that's for sure but he did a decent job though; the actors were pretty close to their character and Chilkis and Evans were particularly good. Even Alba did good. That's true she is way too young to play Sue but if you want to blame someone, blame our youth male oriented obsessed society; not the actress. The screenplay was fairly true to the essence of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby'comic books. anyway, hats off to everyone involved here and hopefully F4 will be as enjoyable as part one."
"mullermike","8","1","3","23 July 2005"," Nothing original but an enjoyable flick
","I have to say, I usually don't read Stan Lee comics. Nothing against them, just never got into them. So, for me, this movie going experience was my first trip into the world of the Fantastic Four, and it was a good time. Chris Evans, playing Johnny Storm, is superb as the cocky flamethrower and manages to steal just about every scene with his over-the-top flamboyance. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba display good tension and chemistry from the moment they share a scene. No need to delve too much into the drama of their relationship, you see the way the two look at each other and you know there's a past. Gruffudd's performance is convincing (though it's obvious this guy is English, trying to use an American accent) and Alba, wow, what a sweet presence she adds to the screen. Obviously, she isn't hard on the eyes, but she carries herself in such a sensual way that you can't help but fall in love with her.<br/><br/>I must say, the biggest disappointment I had was with Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom. He played his part well, but like the villains in Daredevil, he wasn't shown enough. He does play a great bad guy (of course, he is an evil businessman) but I didn't think they had enough tension build up between him and the FF. You knew he was gonna be po'ed about his business going under, so there was no chance for hostility to build, it was pretty much there once the failed experiment took place. And for a bad guy, he didn't have much of an agenda. He basically was trying to get back at the Fantastic Four, turn them against each other, but no bold plans for overtaking Manhattan, holding the world hostage, nothing. For an evil guy, he certainly didn't have many evil ambitions, which I find ironic, since he had been an adventurous entrepreneur. Makes you wonder.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis does a good job of playing a tormented thug. Man, if I had strength like that, I wouldn't be mopey, I'd be out there kicking the crud out of people, just for the fun of it. Chiklis was perfectly cast as The Thing, though I found it rather crass that his wife left him because he was deformed. I guess love doesn't last forever if your spouse becomes a mutant.<br/><br/>As a whole, I pretty much got what I expected from this movie. Great special effects, good action (though not enough of it), believable interaction between the characters, I give this one high marks. Not a bad movie to show to kids either (though it does show Alba briefly in her undergarments, oh ya). Just do yourself a favor: when you're watching it, suspend your disbelief, just for a short time. Let the special effects and the fun carry the way and don't over analyze things too much. No, seriously, don't do it."
"freaky_dave","7","1","3","21 July 2005"," A decent filmgoing experience
","The Fantastic Four will win no awards. It has a lot of flaws which include too little action and an ending that was over much too quickly. Jessica Alba, though very attractive, does not act well in this film, but the other three, especially Chiklis and Evans, do well enough.<br/><br/>In the script, Tim story captured a lot of what made the comic so charming. One thing was the way the four always fought among each other, almost as much as they fought their enemies. He also went for comedy more so then sincerity, and it works for the most part. If marvel fans remember the comic, they will notice these scenes and get a chuckle out of them. The Human Torch was always a prankster, and he always teased the Thing. They were the two that fought one another most of the time as well, and you will see that clearly with this film.<br/><br/>A lot of people who have given this movie bad reviews probably never read the comic. I just can't understand all the hate that this movie is getting even though it is much better than War of The Worlds, a film that many people seemed to like, but I found to be rather dull and boring. True the special effects could've been better, but Tim Story did not have the budget that Steven Spielberg was given, so I can forgive him that.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that Fantastic Four should've been a little more serious than it was. There were entirely too many jokes and not enough science that could've made it better. I didn't quite accept how they changed Doom's origins from the comic, but it didn't bother me too much. Fantastic Four, to me, was just light hearted fun, and it is not on the same par as Spiderman 2, Superman 1 and 2, or X-men 2. However, it was a whole lot better than The Hulk and Daredevil, and in my opinion better than the first X-men movie."
"musicwalt","8","1","3","20 July 2005"," decent flick
","FF sticks to the comic strip's original style. Character development is limited although complete enough to do the trick. The special effects are well done and the action is pretty much contiguous. Events are a little rushed in order to make the movie a standard length film rather than an epic length extravaganza. It helps if the viewer has read the original comic books because the tempo of the movie seems to follow the scene by scene jumps that were showcased in that format. For FF historians the movie will jog some old memories of the ""good 'ol days"". The chosen cast is a fresh mix that blends well with today's new breed of action characters. While I wouldn't consider this an art film it is a good source of commercial entertainment. The sound effects are realistic though there is no notable musical score. This is an introductory feature film that introduces us to the novelty that is the Fantastic Four. It's also the intro for Dr. Doom, and it sets us up for more to come. Most folks will look forward to at least one sequel."
"Bogmeister","6","1","3","20 July 2005"," Frivolous Four aren't quite Doomed
","Let's be clear: this is the 2nd live-action version on this original quartet since they first appeared in the 1961 comic book. It doesn't matter to me that the 1st version (early nineties) was never released. Marvel now has two (2) tries at this and they nearly flubbed it again (much like with The Punisher). It's not quite the deal breaker a lot of fans believe it to be, with just enough of the spirit and accuracy for the characters to pass the grade. Just. My main problem is not with the four heroes, but the villain.<br/><br/>Chiklis as The Thing/Grimm is great. He grumbles & groans as I've always imagined he would if stepping out from the 4-color pages. They may want to evolve the suit in the sequel a bit. He provides half the humor. The other half is provided by Evans as The Torch. Not quite the Johnny Storm of the books, but there's just enuff there with his repartee with Grimm and his kid brother standing with Sue. Frankly, I found the comic book Johnny kind of boring when he wasn't arguing with Grimm. And yes, I don't like Evans' buzz-cut, but oh well. Alba as Susan & Gruffudd as Reed have been getting a bad rap; I think this is fallout from the other two having all the best lines and scenes (gee, sort of like in the comic books!). Alba's performance was not embarrassing and, yes, she was bossy in a scene or two - playing Johnny's older sister, as in the comic books. Gruffudd was overly awkward as a young scientist lacking social skills but he was always less colorful, character-wise, in the books. Some of the later writers (after Stan Lee) in the books (in the eighties) made him even more boring than he is here. And, it was telling, in the final battle scene, that Reed did take command (finally).<br/><br/>And now we come to the villain, as essayed by McMahon. Dr.Doom is, was and will be the greatest super-villain ever created by the biggest comic book company in the world. Here is where the film falls into travesty, from which there is no redemption. By contrast with the books, we have Von Doom as interpreted by a TV actor who doesn't alter his performance one iota from the characters he played in Nip/Tuck & Charmed. All right, some may argue, what if an audience has never seen those TV series for comparison. Sorry, no can do. McMahon shows he has no range whatsoever; forget 'limited range' - NO range! His inflections & line readings are the same, regardless of what the scene calls for. It's all done with the same, slightly smarmy tone. There was nothing to be done with his actual voice, I suppose, but, perhaps, if Doom returns in a sequel, it's not necessary to have the same actor. Let's have Doom possess a commanding, domineering voice, as he was meant to. And, most of all, let's have his motivations be correct; none of this lusting for Sue, this petty griping about money. That's just not Doom - it's some Doombot or his loser cousin.<br/><br/>The problems with Doom outweigh some of the liberties taken with the FF's history. I would've given almost anything to see the FF crash-land a space shuttle in a deserted area after exposure to the rays in space, as visualized in my mind for 35 years. I could've done without Grimm's wife, a clumsy attempt by writers to give The Thing more angst. I don't know why the screenplay was unable or unwilling to just start with Doom in Latveria (picture Doom seated on his throne as news of the FF breaks out: ""Hm, I'll have to delay my plan for global conquest until I dispose of these 4 clownish freak-isms.""). But, those are all the breaks and just quibbles. At least they managed to include Willie Lumpkin. As entertainment, this FF film outstrips The Hulk(03) handily and is not quite up there with X-Men(2000). Hopefully a sequel will move things up a notch, influenced more by some Jack Kirby spectacle."

","I'm glad I still went to see it. I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>I agree with the critics on many points. The pace was uneven, some of the storyline flawed, etc. Yet, I thought it followed most of the FF comic feeling, pace, and level of action. The casting was good too. The Torch and the Thing were the best. Jessica Alba did great as S. Storm. Grufford played Richards as I would think he had to be played, a brilliant mono-cerebral person having a tough time dealing with the changes. I did not like the Dr. Doom story arc. First it was too much like the Spiderman's Goblin stuff.<br/><br/>OK, it was not the WhaleRider (one of my best) or Batman Begins, but at least it was not a Van Helsing or Devil Boy (or whatever it was called). <br/><br/>To me the FF movie will be more memorable then the War of the Worlds remake and even Batman Begins, though the quality of these two was much higher."

I also disliked the casting of Kerry for Alica.<br/><br/>But I decided to keep an open mind until I had seen the movie. Today I did and I was blown away. Sure Ben did not look quite alright and Jessica Alba only made a decent Sue. (She was OK but there were better actresses for the role.) That did not matter though as the movie was great. Sure, the origin was changed but not in a really bad way. Despite the origin taking up a lot of time, there was plenty of action and the fight against Doom was pretty cool.<br/><br/>There was also plenty of humor in the movie, something which most movies really lack.<br/><br/>Ioan, Chris and Micheal did their parts very well and adequately resembled the comic counter parts (though for Micheal this was more a case of the right attitude than looks). Jessica Alba's acting was good but she simply did not resemble Sue. Just dying her hair was not enough.<br/><br/>But during the movie one completely forgets such ""details"". As well as odd storyline plots as Doom having invented unstable molecules instead of Reed and Reed being nearly bankrupt.<br/><br/>In all, the movie was a fantastic experience and I am eagerly awaiting part 2!"

Alba, who played Sue ""Invisible woman"" Storm, was fake with her powers, just her whole way of acting was very fake.. Which disappointed me because I thought Alba was a good actress.

Just that thing that makes them Actors! Then Michael Chicklis, who plays Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm, he's good! But he didn't impress me a lot, only the tricks they pulled off with him as ""The Thing"". Well Chris Evans played Johnny ""Human Torch"" Storm and he had ""it""!!! He has humor, he has the looks and he just gives that flair to his character and the powers that character has!

","Ah, summer. It brings to mind memories of beaches, ballgames and adventures to your favorite swimming spot with your best friends. It was a time when you could let your imagination get the best of you as you day dreamed of what you'd be when you grew up. Maybe there would be a trip to outer space... And, hey, wouldn't it be wicked cool if you and your best friends somehow got super-powers on the trip and came back home to pal around and amaze everybody? If that's all that you are looking for in a cineplex adventure, then the ""Fantastic Four"" is right up your alley.<br/><br/>Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chicklis) are at the end of their list of potential backers for an orbital research experiment when they come knocking at the corporate door of Reed's old MIT classmate, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon). Victor makes them a loaded offer, but with a short window of opportunity, they can't refuse. Along for the ride is Victor, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba, whose character is Victor's own researcher, girlfriend and Reed's ex) and Sue's brother, an adrenaline-junkie pilot named Johnny (Chris Evans). The science behind the trip is so far-fetched that it makes ""Frankenstein"" seem like an article in The New England Journal of Medicine by comparison, so there isn't much point in going into detail. Once on the station, the phenomenon they have come to observe acts erratically and ends up irradiating this party of five. Things seem alright for a few days until they each begin to exhibit differing symptoms of exposure. The various abilities to stretch, turn invisible and become an impervious rock monster have Reed, Sue, and Ben all in a struggle to accept what has happened to them and try to find a way to reverse it, while Johnny has a ball lighting himself on fire and flying as a side effect. Victor is the slowest to develop because he was in the safest part of the space station, and he is more concerned with how the failed experiment managed to damage his face, company, relationship with Sue and reignite his envy of Reed. Care to guess who becomes the villain as the movie progresses? Wanna' bet there's a showdown?<br/><br/>It mostly hits its intended target of being a purely adolescent bit of summer entertainment, but the pubescent charm cuts both ways and misses some details. When Johnny gets Ben to smack himself in the face with a cream pie, it is a laugh-out-loud bit of slapstick that would make the Three Stooges envious. But it seems odd when a firefighter at a rescue scene is the one giving them cues on when and who should speak to the press corps that have gathered. And when Ben's fiancé (Debbie, played by Laurie Holden) comes out of her apartment and crosses the street in the middle of the night in only a thin negligee, the director, Tim Story, has gotten almost voyeuristic. Sue wears glasses with her hair up in campy style to signify that she is a scientist, but it's more about justifying packaging Jassica Alba's figure in a tight top than costuming the character. The film's objectification of women is its only serious downfall, but it has plenty of company in the school of campy film making. The one thing the movie does to balance the gender scales are the 2 scenes where Johnny ends up naked (hidden by water and then a jacket tied to his waist) after he burns his own clothes off. However, this is not a film with any real subtext and has no intentions of being one, so these things slide by.<br/><br/>Comedy seems to be the real focus Tim Story has brought here from the comic book. This is not about revenge (Batman Begins), bigotry (X-Men), repression (Hulk) or even accepting your place in the world (Spider-Man). This is a gee-whiz adventure with current and believable - but not great - special effects. Even John Ottman's score is surprisingly pedestrian in comparison to his striking music in ""X2"". But it is light-years (in both effects and style) beyond Roger Corman's unreleased 1994 ""Fantastic Four"" production, which was made mostly to hold onto the franchise rights. The best things here are the characterizations of Reed, Ben and Johnny. The script takes the actors right where they are supposed to go. The Sue Storm of the comics is the steadfast moral center of the team, but the script makes her a little bit too generic and too young. Although, to Alba's credit, she does attempt to make the role her own. The villain, Doom (the evolved Victor), is deflated from the comic book. Doom was an endlessly evil and obsessive character who was meticulous in each detail of whatever scheme he was planning. He garnered his power through political manipulation, his own science and black magic. That the character in this movie had no back-up plan for the mission's failure and to watch him unravel over his jealously about Reed's success with the press and Sue just reduces him to ""villain of the week"" status. However, Julian McMahon clearly had fun playing the role, and that translates well for the production.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four"" is another entry into the rapidly growing comic book genre of films. It goes its own route by not taking itself as seriously as other translations, and it is better for it. (How can you not have a little love for a movie that makes room for the series creator, Stan Lee, to stroll up and deliver the mail to the heroes? ) However, pandering to the audience makes the film stumble in places, and I'd be curious to see what a more adult director might do with a sequel. <br/><br/>($56 million on the first weekend?

","""Fantastic Four"" felt like it lacked a bit, but it was still a good movie. Many people are saying it's total crap, which I don't agree with. I liked it well enough.<br/><br/>This movie felt lighter and fluffier than most of the superhero movies that have come out within the last few years. It was sort of like a beginner's superhero flick; it's about the right weight for a child. (That ""can he stretch any part of his body"" thing is a different story.) It had less brooding darkness and doom and more humor. People fond of ""Batman Begins,"" etc. may not be so fond of that, but I found it charming.<br/><br/>It's well-acted, in my opinion, and the effects are fairly good. The writing feels unoriginal, and the jokes, while not cliché, seem kind of obvious, but not cheesy per se. The biggest problem was the final showdown, which likely took all of two minutes and was quite the anticlimax. It's no more than a mild scruff, and we needed to see the characters do MORE than they did. They deserve it - the whole movie's been building up to getting to see them whoop some butt big time!<br/><br/>Pretty much the two characters they screwed up are Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, and Dr. Doom. Johnny is really one-dimensional and annoyingly scripted up until the very end, when he becomes dully two-dimensional and only sort of annoyingly scripted. But they completely wasted Dr. Doom. First, it took the whole dang movie to make him go from Victor Von Doom to Dr. Doom (he should have put on that mask an hour earlier), and then he's finished in that little blip of a final battle. I have never read the comics, but from what I hear he's one of the baddest of the baddies. You wouldn't know that from the film. However, this isn't entirely a bad thing for those Julian McMahon lovers, except it means all the more drool they're gonna get all over themselves.<br/><br/>Still, despite its downsides, I can't completely slam ""Fantastic Four"" without feeling like a wretch. To be honest, I find it sort of cute in its lightness. Not to mention it has a fair amount of eye candy. :)"

","I watched Fantastic Four last Friday (release day) and it basically made my evening. Entertaining flow, good casting, random wisecracks and no down-times made the movie well watchable.<br/><br/>Bad direction, made up by decent acting and casting. Jessica Alba was adorable, and the lesser known trio Ioan Gruffudd (Welsh actor, last seen in King Arthur as Lancelot), Chris Evans (20-something kid from Cellular and Not Another Teen Movie), Michael Chiklis (the bald, overlooked actor who rose to recognition in the FX cop drama The Shield) all did a good job, so did the villain Julian McMahon (the Aussie who starred in TV shows such as Nip/Tuck and Charmed). Julian will not make a good James Bond, though. He shows more dark side than calm.<br/><br/>It was a good idea to keep the ""Thing"" character unchanged once he gets that form. If they showed him growing from human to thing and vice versa whenever he desired, it would confuse a comic reader and movie-goer with HULK - which would not make it a very good comparison for most.<br/><br/>The special effects were alright, nothing compared to Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2. The story was way too far-fetched for even a superhero movie. The first 10-15 minutes which involves the trip to outer space was dumb.<br/><br/>Other than that, I would recommend the movie, with low expectations."

That would have been asking a lot, perhaps for a movie four times as long, which this certainly didn't need to be. But I appreciated Michael Chiklis' Ben Grimm/""The Thing"" and even the somewhat heavy-handed Chris Evans' Johnny Storm/""The Human Torch"". I honestly liked the ""Bridge scene"" where the FF were essentially introduced to the public. (And to cheering throngs much like ""Spidey"" was three years earlier.) The way ""Mr. Fantastic"" wrapped himself around ""The thing"" to try and get him to cool down was, to my recollection, right out of the Marvel comic book...nicely done.<br/><br/>And where I was at (Rogers, AR) there was applause at movie's end, which seemed to be in homage to a nice flick instead of a merciful ending. I was hoping for some superheroes with a bit of personality (although ""Reed Richards"" was a bit wooden) in a non-stylized, realistic looking city, much like ""Spider-man's"" New York, and IMO this movie delivered what I wanted.<br/><br/>Right now (July 14) less than a week after the FF opened the worldwide take stands at $91 million. More money at the box office does not necessarily make for a great film, but I think this one may have surprised a few people. And, apart from some rough language in the film and one or two scenes, I'm glad that it did.<br/><br/>(As a sequel, I personally would love to see a non-politically-correct film of the FF taking on the old soviet apparatchik Ivan ""The Red Ghost"" Kragoff and his super-powered gorilla, baboon and orangutan (also bombarded by cosmic rays) done in today's state-of-the-art computer animation, but that, too, might be asking a bit too much in an era when most ""westerners"" under 18 have no clue what the Soviet Union was...)"
"bobsteimle","4","1","3","14 July 2005"," A bad Spiderman imitation
","Victor von Doom plays the Green Goblin, and our Fantastic Four play Spiderman, but in a sappy, silly way, without such good acting. The Thing was particularly annoying as he lost his temper faster than a two-year-old having a tantrum. The romantic interest between Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl is puzzling at best. The hot-shot flame-thrower dude is so conceited that, even though he is really funny, I still didn't like him. Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic, is the only likable character in the movie, and the only one with any real acting ability. The basic story of the rich man losing his fortune, blaming it on the hero, and turning to evil is the same as Spiderman.<br/><br/>This movie gets boring toward the end as we wait for our heroes to stop grumbling and fighting with each other and stop the bad guy. I loved the comic books as a kid and was really looking forward to this movie. It was disappointing for me, but I think your average preteen who has never seen the comics will enjoy it. They really should have had someone who knows something about science advise them; they got some of the science wrong as well."

","* Possibly some spoilers * I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I wanted to like it a lot. Unfortunately they pared the script and direction down to appeal to that 12 to 17 year old demographic that drives so many Hollywood movies. Unlike the Spiderman movies there was no real character development. Reed Richards is a mature, level-headed, clear thinking person - in the comic book. The movie portrayed him as a love struck idiot/genius, incapable of forming complete sentences or taking any action. Ben Grimm had no real edge to him (""Poor me. Poor me"") and his confrontation with his ""fiance"" was pitiful. The Torch and Sue were fairly accurate - the movie Johnny was more annoying than the comic Johnny, and the movie Sue was much stronger than the one in the comic (this was good).<br/><br/>Plot was boring. I'm still not sure what Von Doom was so angry about. He was jealous? Of what? He had more money than god and now had power. Alba is nice, but that kind of money and power can get you anyone else you want. The fact that he can't have her is hardly reason to risk dying. Maybe it was the acting that made it all seem so mundane and trite.<br/><br/>Maybe Fantastic Four II will be better. Spiderman 2 was better than its first, as was X-men 2. Both follow-ups had more depth and a richer character development. Maybe they'll spend a little more money somewhere and get a better story or better effects, hopefully both. Maybe I'll lower my expectations of Hollywood - again.<br/><br/>See Batman Begins. See it twice. That's what these movies should be like."

","I'm a big Marvel superheroes fan, my favorite among the hundreds are, the Xmen, Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. I've followed their animated versions on TV, plus of course their big screen adaptation, the other two, Xmen 1 & 2, and Spiderman 2, were standouts, they've really made it a true superhero movie that every fan can be proud of. Now, here comes the Fantastic Four, I must say, that I was excited for this movie, the trailers looked great, and I was intrigued by how they're gonna show the evolution of their powers, I know with today's technology in CGI, there is virtually nothing impossible, so for one movie with lots of CGI to stand out, one has to have the human emotion, vulnerability and empathy, even with out too much of the computer graphics, people can relate with the character. That i think has been the problem of Fantastic Four, we didn't relate well them, unlike in the Xmen 1 & 2 and Spiderman 2. These four character have such great superpowers, there's one who can elongate himself to limitless nights, one has the ability to ignite himself on fire and can even be hot as the temperature of the sun, then there's one woman who can be invisible and generate force fields which can contain the power of the human torch, and the Thing, which has superhuman strength and a virtually invincible body, and yet all they do is engage in child play, and lots of stupid bickering and engaging in numerous cat fights. What are they trying to show, that all of this is supposed to be fun? Well, it wasn't, the only good thing about is actually Michael Chiklis' makeup for the Thing, it really showed a sad face, that within the thick armor and muscular frame, their is a gentle person inside."

"iohannkn","7","1","3","12 July 2005"," FF Movie Not so Bad
","This film has been released to a lot of bad reviews, but I enjoyed it a lot. It actually succeeds DESPITE itself. So let me start with its problems: <br/><br/>Cons: 1. Jessica Alba as a Red-Haired Sue Storm? Huh? Oh, well - this is Hollywood... 2. Reed Richards is a young, green, timid guy? Excuse me? This is Reed, the tough, brilliant, fatherly perfect husband guy - he's the LEADER of the FF! How can he be callow and insecure to start with? Oh, well, at least the character has some room for growing up.... 3. Last, but not least, the major complaint - THEY PROMISED US DR. DOOM, SO WHERE IS HE? Julian McMahon is a good actor, but he plays Doom (Doom? The arch-nemesis and arch-megalomaniac, Marvel's premiere figure of melodramatic tragedy and horror, the Phantom of the Opera of the whole Marvel world? The Marvel counterpart to Milton's Satan? The Tyrant Hold-Fast of Marvel mythology?), he plays Doom rather like Star Trek's ""Q""! And his whole nature is changed - instead of the angry, lonely, self-obsessed, self-righteous yet dastardly and evil magician-scientist megalomaniac Latverian son of a Witch, a man utterly alone and utterly embittered, we get a smarmy, oily, even womanizing Victor, a financially well-established, conventional, American business-fish, swimming in boardrooms and oceans of money. Why throw away the great iconic character just to replace him with a common, generic one? His name is Doctor Doom, for cryin' out loud!!!<br/><br/>Okay - so those are the basic gripes. But there are other things that work well: <br/><br/>Pros: 1. The characters of the Four are well-realized by actors and company, after a kind of shaky, ""who are these people?"" start, and if they seem to be thin, at least there's some development to fill them out a bit. 2. The action scenes are well-realized, in the current visceral way, eg the cosmic storm, the cars and trucks come flying across the screen later - done well enough that an old guy like me is going ""ouch"" and cringing at the worst visual impacts. 3. The Ben-Johnny rivalry is pretty well-rendered, and as long as it doesn't descend into toilet-humor can be a strength in the sequel to come. <br/><br/>But the main advantage, in the end, is that the characters Lee and Kirby created still come through, and despite the miscalculations and occasional goofiness in the film they are still appealing and exciting. Perhaps the Fantastic Four can survive even a lame Doctor Doom!"
"jessman1128","6","1","3","12 July 2005"," Slightly better than mediocre
","Fantastic Four was better than mediocre, but not by much. I am not familiar with the comic book series (this *is* based on a comic book, right?), but the movie trailer gave away pretty much the entire story so I already knew what was going to happen for almost the entire length of the movie. Take the bits and pieces of the trailer, throw in a bunch of filler sequences, add a decent ending, and you'll have the final version of this movie.<br/><br/>I understand the need for the introductions, explaining how/why the people got their powers, and so on...but come on, couldn't they have made it any more interesting? The special effects were decent in places, but nothing to get all exclamatory about. The acting was...decent...but, again, not all that superb. The dialog seemed forced in many places. Most of the laugh lines were so cheesy I couldn't even force a smile, let alone a laugh. There was only one time when I truly laughed, and one other time I let out a half-hearted chuckle. If you're expecting comedy in this movie (which I wasn't) you will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>All that being said, why did I even give out 6 stars? Well, all-in-all it was an okay movie, one that I believe kids and families would enjoy. There were some decent special effects, the ending (the only part of the story I didn't know from the trailer) was worth seeing, and of course the presence of the lovely Jessica Alba.<br/><br/>I know this is supposed to be a review of Fantastic Four...but if anyone is still considering between seeing Fantastic Four or Batman Begins, please go see Batman Begins by all means. There is no comparison between the two."

","Intending to study cosmic rays, scientist Reed Richards blasts off into space along with his companions Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Johnny's sister Susan, and a rich but nasty industrialist called Victor Von Doom, who has financed the experiment. They meet terrible fates when they are tragically bathed in the rays, and as a result are endowed with different special powers... Reed is able to stretch his body indefinitely; Johnny can turn himself into a flying human torch; Susan becomes able to make herself transparent, and unfortunate palooka Ben Grimm is turned into an over-sized hulking monster consisting of orange-ish rocks. Victor Von Doom's body gradually begins to transform into metal, and he becomes the infamous villain ""Dr. Doom"", now out to destroy the ""Fantastic Four"" (as named by the media).<br/><br/>This is not a pretentious or heavy-handed concept; this is a comic book story first and foremost, with the added quality of having characters we can get somewhat involved in. The film chooses to center itself more on the origin of these unusual characters and how their unnatural transformations are affecting them, and that's fine by me. Nowhere does this work better than through the sad and pitiful characterization of poor Ben Grimm, alias The Thing (perfectly played by Michael Chiklis), who gains our sympathy and delights us with the clumsiness and despair of his unwanted predicament. He has our hearts in his hard, bulky, four-fingered hands. He can also be funny as he constantly gets teased by Johnny Storm, who's always trying to get the best of the poor misfit. This was my very favorite element of the film, and it was in perfect harmony with the original comic book. I liked that the Thing's look was achieved through an actual body costume, rather than needless CGI, which didn't help the lousy HULK movie.<br/><br/>Johnny the ""Human Torch"" can not only be antagonizing to gullible Ben Grimm, but equally annoying to us as well with his boyish and gung-ho eagerness to accept his fiery new persona a bit too readily. But I suppose this helps bring some contrast to the proceedings, as Reed Richards as the rubber-man is kind of bland, and Sue Storm doesn't get to do much when she's not stripping down to become invisible (she's played by the ultra-attractive Jessica Alba, who's decent enough in the role, by the way).<br/><br/>Not a great film, but a good one - and certainly enjoyable enough for a Marvel Comics fantasy. It would be nice to see a sequel now that the beginnings and problems of the lead characters have been effectively dealt with. I'd love to see Michael Chiklis climb into that Thing costume at least once more as he yells: ""It's Clobberin' Time!"" *** out of ****"

","Very loyal to the comic book feel, but it wasn't much of a 'human' story. It might have been more interesting if the characters had been more surprised about their new found powers/conditions. Aside from the Things character, everyone else was like ""Hey I'm a complete freak, but oh well, back to business.""<br/><br/>It might have been more interesting if the story had focused more on each individuals personal demons and nightmares while dealing with their new strangeness.<br/><br/>I know it's based on a comic book, but I think a story is more interesting if peoples actions are a little more believable according to their situation. It's like saying the 'normal' laws of emotions all of a sudden don't apply and it makes the whole story hard to swallow."

","When I left the theater after seeing Fantastic Four, I was a little disappointed. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting a bulletproof story line and flawless acting, but F4 left me wanting more.<br/><br/>After considering it for a while, I realized F4 is truly a comic book movie. If I were reading this movie off the pages of a Marvel comic book I probably would've been a lot more satisfied. The convenient turns of events and hokey one-liners would've been a lot more acceptable. The mediocre acting wouldn't even have been an issue.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about F4 is how it explained the origin of the group when an accident in space involving a wave of radiation gave them their super powers. It also explained the origin of the group's arch nemesis, Dr. Doom. Also, the movie featured some really cool special effects.<br/><br/>I have a number of small gripes with the movie however. First, I was annoyed by Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards. He just seemed too wussy. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm were cast perfectly though. Jessica Alba is a little too ""teen movie hottie"" to play Sue Storm in my opinion. The one-liners in this movie were just plain cheesy. One-liners are either great or horrible. Cool or hokey. In this case, hokey. Furthermore, when Ben Grimm freaks out for the whole movie about being the Thing and finally gets to be himself again, he changes himself back at the end. It had to happen, but in this case it was just irritating.<br/><br/>Finally, my last complaint is the anticlimactic final battle between the four and Dr. Doom. It only lasts a couple minutes, and Dr. Doom goes down in a blaze of....water? Its a clever defeat, but much too boring for a movie that was already lacking.<br/><br/>Concluding, I gave this movie a 6 because, well, super hero movies are cool and the Fantastic Four rule. I just think they might have been a little hasty releasing this one. In a sub-genre of the movie industry where Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins reign supreme, Fantastic Four will inevitably be remembered as filler."

","Okay, I knew going into this movie that it wouldn't be Spider-Man, X-Men, or Batman quality, but I hoped it would be good. Not that it was awful, but it sure wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. It's not even the plot's fault, though others would say so. The plot is exactly what I was predicting and what I wanted. 4 people get superpowers, and fight another guy with superpowers. What's wrong with that? No, the problem here lies in 2 things. One is minor, the other very important. The minor one is dialogue. A lot of the dialogue is pretty good, but there are a fair share of one-liners that didn't deserve to see the light of day. The other problem, and this is a big one, is casting. Don't get me wrong, I loved the actual Fantastic Four. Johnny, Ben, Sue, and Reed were all really well done, and I didn't really think they would be, so I was impressed. However, Dr. Doom needs some tweaking. It's not even the actor's fault, in my opinion. He's just not menacing enough to be a supervillain. Towards the end of the movie, when Doom is in the Doom suit, he looks very menacing, as he well should. But with lines like, ""You're fired!"" and that awful voice, you just wish he was never on the screen at all, and what kind of a movie would that have been? Anyway, the FF are fun to watch, and it is a very watchable movie. However, it does suffer from EXTREMELY poor casting on one of the most important character. 'Nuff said..."

","The Fantastic 4 has a bad rap. People think the previews look horrible, The effects look horrible, Etc. Etc. My advice is this. If you want to see a thinking man's comic book film then see either of the Spider-Man or X-Men films. If you want to go see a fun, leave your brain at the door, light hearted, semi-funny comic book film then go see The Fantastic 4. Basically in my opinion it's a live action Incredibles. The plot is pretty simple. 5 people (Reed Richards, Sue & Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm, & Victor Von Doom) go on a mission to space to explore a cosmic storm that they think could hold the key to curing diseases. Well they thought wrong as they get caught in the cosmic storm that unleashes radiation on them all giving them super powers. Reed gains the ability to stretch as his body becomes like rubber, Sue gains the powers of invisibility and can create invisible force fields, Johnny gains the ability to control fire as well as fly and turn his whole body on fire, Ben becomes this ""thing"" that looks like orange rock, and Von Doom becomes disfigured and has the ability to control electricity. Reed, Sue, Johnny, & Ben use their powers for good, while Von Doom uses his powers for evil. The 4 take up the names Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards played by Ian Grufford), The Invisible Woman (Sue Storm played by Jessica Alba), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm played by Chris Evans) & The Thing (Ben Grimm played by Michael Chickless, from my hometown Lowell, Ma.). Von Doom becomes Dr. Doom and tries to destroy The Fantastic 4 as the media has dubbed them. The F.F. is a classic superhero vs. the super villain story. Just like the comic book the film becomes lighthearted and funny when the story starts taking itself to seriously. the special effects on Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, and especially on The Human Torch are awesome. I (before going into this movie) thought the the Thing looked horrible. Seeing him on the big screen he looks a lot better than he does on the small screen. Chris Evans & Mike Chickless nail their roles perfectly. They had to have read a lot of the comics to get into their characters. Grufford & Alba are a little stale, but then again so are Reed Richards and Sue Storm. I can't remember the name of the actor who plays Doom but he was actually my biggest problem. Dr. Doom is the Magneto of The Fantastic 4. He's the Joker, or Lex Luthor if you will. Basically he's their biggest enemy. He needed to be more menacing. I'm not saying he was bad I'm saying he could have been better. Doom is the reason this movie doesn't rank higher than The rating I give it. All in all Though The Fantastic 4 is fun, an a good time at the movies. I hope there is a sequel. I think it will do good enough to gain a sequel. The again does that really matter? I mean the Flintstones got a sequel for crying out loud. I hope the screenwriters just make Doom a more menacing villain that he should be and that might put the Fantastic 4 franchise un track with the Spider-Man, & X-men franchise. On a scale of 10 I give the Fantastic 4 a 6 1/2 out of 10. Go to the movies, leave your brain at the door, and have a good time. Like I said if you enjoyed The Incredibles, you'll enjoy the Fantastic 4."

","After reading the reviews of this film, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. But for a summer afternoon when you have nothing else to do or you've already seen all the other good films you could do a lot worse. I think what bothers me the most is the fact that in more capable hands the film could have been a whole lot better. It has some good things in it, but the weaknesses it does have are glaring. So where do I begin? The acting was a mixed bag. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm (The Thing) was easily the best of the lot. Even covered in heavy foam rubber rock he managed to make his character come to life. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm wasn't too bad either. At least he showed a genuine enthusiasm for the role. In truth, Jessica Alba has been knocked around rather hard by the critics so I won't pile on. Who cares if she can emote, or she doesn't look like she could be any kind of a scientist? She was good eye candy, and that was good enough for me. It was fitting that Ioan Gruffud play Mr. Fantastic though because his plastic performance fit in with his character. He was as dry, stale, and emotionless as the suit on Ben Grimm. Even when he was supposed to get emotional near the end, one could see no change in his performance. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom could have phoned his performance in as well and probably did. As the villain, he just wasn't very threatening or villainy enough. Hopefully if there is a sequel they will both be given the boot.<br/><br/>The script by Michael France left a lot to be desired. The love triangle between Doom, Richards, and Storm was never believable not even in the early moments of the film. The script spent too much time having the characters whine and whine about their powers and not enough about them being super heroes. And when they finally did settle down and have a couple of adventures, (exactly two, one on a bridge and one near the end of the film)the adventures just weren't that ""fantastic"" and in truth, only the scene on the bridge was worthwhile. The climactic battle at the end was more or less ""anti-climactic"" and merely passable.<br/><br/>Worse was the editing in the last hour of the film. There was a lot of jumping from scene to scene and a certain lack of continuity.<br/><br/>So hopefully, if there is a sequel, the least we can hope for is a better script, a director who knows what to do with the story, and the kind of special effects one would expect out of a film like this. As it stands now though, the initial effort was just barely passable. You may enjoy certain aspects of it while you watch, but when you wake up the next day you'll probably be hard pressed to even remember most of it.<br/><br/>I give this film a five out of ten."

This movie left me hungry, and not for a sequel, I was hungry for more content and more substance to the actual film. It was basically a movie about really cool superpowers and what the 4 of them do with it. There was almost no attempt to make us love the characters or understand how they really really dealt with these new amazing powers.

I had no idea that we could do some of the things that we do with computers. It's more visually stunning than the film itself is. I think the biggest problem with this film is that it has too much comedy in it. Another problem that I had was the score. I think they should have gotten Danny Elfman to do the music for this movie. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie. I'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out. I had a lot of fun watching it. It just had a few flaws here and there. Not bad, but not Fantastic."
"Connective","6","1","3","10 July 2005"," Ignore the Reviews
","If you're going to a superhero movie to see intense drama and brilliant character development, get over it. That seems to be what the professional reviewers are looking to see in this movie. As a result, they tend to give it low scores or ""thumbs down."" However, if you want to see a visual reenactment of a comic book series that features outstanding action and characters that don't take themselves too seriously, this is a good film. There are several things that differentiate the Fantastic Four from other comic book superheroes. The first is that they don't wear masks or have hidden secret identities...they are who they are. Another key differentiator is that they rarely work alone, choosing instead to combine their powers into a super team...sort of like the New England Patriots. Actually, this is a good lesson for teams of all kinds, that each member has strengths that can be drawn upon for the success of the team. This movie depicts these differences and has fun doing so. So, ignore the reviews and go have some fun for yourself by seeing ""The Fantastic Four."""

","Folks, this isn't Shakespere. It is just an enjoyable summer movie. It was better than either Spiderman movies. But not as good as Batman Begins. I almost didn't go to this flick because of the negative reviews. Luckily my wife dragged me to the movie. The cast was very good, and this flick had a lot of humor and attitude. Michael Chiklis was wonderful as the Thing. I have a feeling the next movie will be even better. There's not a ton of action, but what's there is very well done. When I was a kid we never read any reviews. We just went to the movies and enjoyed ourselves. We miss a lot of good movies because we rely on some else's opinion. Of course that's just my opinion. Enjoy the movie."
"bortrea","7","1","3","10 July 2005"," A light simple fun and entertaining popcorn movie
","It has concerned me greatly to see how many accredited and professional critics have reviewed this movie with so much harsh and negative words. When I went to see this movie, thinking that it would be a weak entry or worse a poor movie, I was surprised to find out how wrong the critics were. It was as if Hollywood had marked this movie for death and sent our the word, ""destroy this movie"". The reviews have been unrealistic and uncalled for.<br/><br/>Now is this movie perfect, no. Is it a bob or a bad movie, no. I would compare it to first, the first X-Men movie. It too was simple in plot, had a modest pace and a lighter less complex approach to characters. It had a good final showdown with the apparent bad guy. It was a short film compared to the current lengths. It also compares to the first Spider-Man film in that it was lighter in tone than say films such as Batman Begins and X-Men II.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four never takes itself too seriously, but does stay on a moderate track for a family film as drama goes. It will please adults that are not bent on dark twisted character driven plot lines. After all this is a normal set of characters that did not have their uncle murdered or there wife and children wiped out by some villain. They were changed into there super powered state by mere chance. They are now normal people coping with super powers and public stardom. Most of the movie moves from one stage to the next setting up mild drama and humor, moving the plot towards the finally.<br/><br/>So far I have observed, from the so called true professional critics in Hollywood, that most of the poor reviews, some of which are bold attempts to trash a film that is far from as bad as they hope people will think it is, are personally or Hollywood motivated.<br/><br/>You don't have to take my word for it. This was a fun entertaining family film (goodness forbid that we have a fun entertaining family film). It works well from that point of view. Just go see this after you read the reviews, say from a review service that collects all the syndicated reviews for movies. Then sit down, relax, get that pop corn out and watch a fun and entertaining movie that does not require you to see a shrink after you are done. I promise you, this will be a nice change that you will enjoy. You will say, that was not what the reviews said it would be, that was fun. What was their problem?<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the critics. They are too full of their own self importance on this one."

","I saw this movie with the expectation of it being the horrible abomination of a movie that the Hulk unfortunately was. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it. I have heard that it doesn't hold true to the comic too much but since I don't read FF I didn't care that much. The acting was cool. I thought that it was nice to see Hornblower (reed) in a bigger role than I am used to seeing him in. The thing was great. The actor did it well and the fact that he was not done with CG really earned respect from me. To be frank I thought the final fight was a bit lacking in Entertainment but that is just an opinion. Over all I give it a 7 and from what I experienced and hear.. if you like the comics don't go see it, but if you never read the comics it should be a good experience for you."
"azjazz","6","1","3","9 July 2005"," Rough around the edges
","I just came back from the show. I give it a 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>First, I'm glad that Marvel was finally able to get the F4 on the big screen as a major motion picture. The F4 comic was a favorite of mine years ago, and I was eagerly waiting for the official release.<br/><br/>Well, the movie was OK, but it could have been so much better. It was obvious to me that a lot of the problems came from the director's seat and the scripting.<br/><br/>The acting never ""gelled"" for me for any of the actors. This was due to a fair number of poor lines being handed to the actors, but the majority is due to bad direction. Many scenes could have made it if they were redone. Tim Story just didn't have enough experience as a director to know when a shot scene was ready for use.<br/><br/>Scene continuity and pacing was a constant problem in this film. Again, I blame the director.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba did about the best job of all the actors, but even she had some scenes where I lost her character. Michael Chiklis also did an admirable job in a lot of spots as the Thing.<br/><br/>The special effects were OK, but nothing to write home (or to IMDb) about.<br/><br/>They did do a really good job making the Thing look realistic, however.<br/><br/>Another positive thing that Marvel did on this movie was to avoid the all too common ""Let's introduce half of all the characters that ever appeared in the comic"" ploy to appease the fans. The right amount of characters were introduced in the movie without adding more confusion.<br/><br/>Things I wish were done differently:<br/><br/>(1) I wish that Bryan Singer didall of the Marvel movies. The X-Men series is probably the hardest plot line to pull off successfully, but it has been the best comic-to-big screen series I have seen yet. He could probably have changed some of Marvel's recent ""clunkers"" (this movie falls into this category) into hits.<br/><br/>(2) Less time spent on Johnny being a bratty thrill-seeker.<br/><br/>(3) Continuity. There were scenes where the F4 were supposed to be in a secure, isolated observation area, and the next thing you know - poof! - they're out in public. Also, almost every scene where Victor Von Doom reappeared in seemed awkward in the transition. Lots of other continuity problems as well.<br/><br/>(4) Make the F4 seem more like a team. Johnny's character seemed to constantly throw this off. And while past friendships and romances were brought out in the film, they didn't seem to be very solid relationships.<br/><br/>Oh, well. If they do a F4-2, maybe they'll get the kinks out."
"noor_001","7","1","3","9 July 2005"," Give it a Shot!
","The Fantastic Four is not as horrible as people say it is. Yes its kinda cheesy at times, yes they changed the origin of the F.F. and Dr. Doom, and yes it could use more action sequences, but its fun at the movies. <br/><br/>The film had great moments like Dr. Doom battling the Thing (I wish it would have lasted longer). The Human Torch out flying a heat seeking missile is pretty cool on the big screen. And the relationship between the Torch and Thing is pretty fun and true to the comic book. <br/><br/>Performances were also not horrible. The weakest link is Alba, but she looks smoking hot (twice Alba ends up in her bra and underwear) and to be honest I thought she would be worse then she actually was. The Human Torch and The Thing were cast well and both actors have solid performances. <br/><br/>The Thing looked as well as one could hope. Spectral Motion (Blade 2, Hell Boy, X-Men 3) did the SFX make-up and they are a very up and coming in the entertainment industry. Even Dr. Doom looked cool but we literally only get a few shots of him in full costume. Dr. Doom could have used a more intimidating voice. Mr. Fantastic at times looks to CGI but only for a scene where he and the Thing fight. <br/><br/>Tim Story was not the best choice as director and should not return for the sequel. They need a more action friendly director, someone with a more defined visual style. Also, the score was invisible and just did not stand out.<br/><br/>In the end all I can say is if you like the Fantastic Four or comic book movies, you should go see this. Families and Kids will probably like this the most. I can not wait for a sequel. They can fix the problems that were in the first film and to compare it with Batman Begins, X-Men, Spider-Man, Blade, Etc. is incorrect. Those are all much more dark/serious stories and that would not at all work for the F.F.(Dr. Doom should have had a much more dark origin) If this movie had come out pre X-Men it would have a better response from fans and critics. The bar has been raised so high in the last few years, F.F. comes off just as above average."
"erichvm","7","1","3","9 July 2005"," Flawed but Lots of Fun
","After reading so many negative reviews and finding so many positive ones unconvincing, I went to see ""Fantastic Four"" expecting to see a real load of garbage. What I got instead was a good time very much in keeping with the tone of the comic. I also discovered that a lot of the criticisms being made about the movie betray a surprising inability for viewers to suspend disbelief or to follow film narrative. <br/><br/>What this film does right is worth mentioning first. Despite widespread complaints, the only problem with Jessica Alba's presence and performance was that her blue contact lenses were completely ineffective. She accurately captured exasperation at the men around her, as well as maternal warmth when necessary. No, she isn't going to win an Oscar for this film, but she did just fine. The character of Johnny Storm was also handled well, with a suitable amount of the current ""entitled generation's"" attitude infused into his classic character to make him seem a young man of the times. His tendency to be rash, to show off, and to chase girls was nicely captured, and he provided a lot of the movie's fun with his antics. Michael Chiklis's Ben Grimm/Thing was the best of the bunch, just as has been widely reported, and he managed to convey the character's humanity from inside all those prosthetics, which is no easy feat.<br/><br/>The special effects for all three of these characters was good, especially the two men. The Human Torch was beautiful and exciting to watch and the Thing, except for his neck, really seemed to be composed of rocky orange plates. <br/><br/>The action in some cases came straight from the pages of the comic book, and in every case was fun to watch. Each character comes to use his or her powers with increasing confidence and skill as the film progresses, making the finale, when they naturally make use of them as a team and become greater than the sum of its parts due to both familial unity and the leadership of Mr. Fantastic. Although some of the details have been changed, this really is the Fantastic Four we have come to know and love from the comics.<br/><br/>The storytelling is not terrifically clever, though the exposition is handled efficiently. If there is a sequel, I would like to see more energetic direction and a smarter script. However, the jokes were appropriate and very much in character, and the relationships (except that between team members and Doom) are well developed and faithful in spirit to the comic.<br/><br/>Now some complaints. Poor Ioan Gryffud. He should have had the chance to loop a few lines where he became excited and lapsed into his Welsh accent. Also, the CGI when using his powers was lazily done, and often not in the least bit realistic. I thought he should come across as more of a distracted genius than he did, but since that always caused problems for me in buying his relationship with Sue, perhaps it was a wise choice by the filmmakers. Julian MacMahon, except for his strangely fake-looking eyebrows, is visually perfect to play Victor von Doom, but plays the character so naturally that he never comes across as frighteningly evil, just as hopelessly self-involved. On the one hand, this is more believable than the grandiose, pontificating and speech-reciting Latverian autocrat we all know and love, but once the mask is on, there is no creation of a new persona with a duly intimidating voice and familiar delusions of world conquest. It's just the same guy, only now in a mask. And yes, the mask DOES look cool, so no worries there! The other women's roles in the film were thin and pretty silly, I'm afraid, and there does seem to be a missing scene between Alicia and the Thing that gets them from point A to point B (not such a problem if you assume time passes between the climax and the coda), but overall things ran smoothly.<br/><br/>If you like comic book movies, or the Fantastic Four, go see this, but don't go with high expectations. You will be entertained if you let the child in you watch it, but if you think you'll get the fine direction of the X-men films, the relatable characters of the Spider-Man films, or the atmospheric darkness of Batman Begins, you'll be disappointed. Just go to have fun, and you will get what you came for."

","I really liked this movie! I was skeptical about going after hearing several reviews, and I was very glad I went. One of the things that always differentiated the FF between groups like the X-Men, or the Avengers, was their relationships to one another. I really was glad to see that the movie really developed the characters. I loved the practical jokes and fighting between Johnny, and the Thing. Of course, also the relationship between Sue and Reed. I was hoping that Doom would have been more of a monarch, and ruler of Latveria, but they seem to have skipped that. They also changed his character, and power a little too much, but I was OK with that. The special effects were really great. I also loved seeing the people of NY really loving them. That is another thing that always made the FF so cool, was that they were loved by everyone. Unlike the X-Men, who are feared by most people, or Spider-Man, who is misunderstood. I hope people skip the reviews like I did, and go see this fun movie!!!"

","I just finished seeing this movie and just had to post for all those who may have been scared off because of the negative reviews. I use and enjoy review sites such as Rotten Tomatoes, but they have it wrong this time. Don't worry, this is a fun movie; nice use of special effects that don't overload the movie with very good character interaction. Clean use of humor, and really catches the pathos of the Thing's dilemma, and what would you do if your body changed that way. I am a fan of comic books, and especially appreciate the good job of the new Batman and Spiderman franchises. While this is not as good as those (I think a more experienced action director is the difference) it is a good representation of the FF legacy (taking into account the normal updates and modifications.) No this is not a fake review; but, a review by someone who enjoys movies for what they are. All 3 theaters were full of families, teenagers and old codgers like me. At the end, a nice smile and round of applause from the audience. Lots of laughs and claps through the movie. Not academy award or super legend stuff, but a nice start to what is suppose to be a trilogy.<br/><br/>Family friendly; action not bloody violence; Jessica for the teenagers, sexiness for the guys and strong character for the girls. Don't wait for the DVD, see it and talk about it with your friends. For you information, I liked the Spiderman movies, thought Dare Devil too dark as well as Elektra. The Hulk was just a bad movie, over reliance of CGI. This is a much better movie."

","I'm going to be short and to the point. This movie was excellent, I'm going to say excellent, since everyone is going to say fantastic. Anyway, the story differs a little from the original storyline but the characterization of the characters was just perfect. The plot is straight forward with few surprises and it was always nice to a see a nod or two to the hardcore fans with cameos by stan lee and mentions of Latveria. Dr. Doom was just awesome, I've never been able to imagine what his voice would sound like but the way his voice was so menacing beneath the mask in this movie was chilling. Doom is probably the best portrayed Marvel villain as of yet. Reed and Sue were both well portrayed and there was a great number of invisible woman jokes to get a good chuckle out of. The hands down BEST part of this movie was Chris Evans and Michael Chicklis. They banter and go back and forth so much as Human Torch and Thing that it was just like reading a comic of Fantastic Four. That was the real gem of the movie. And who doesn't like a bad ass hot head like Johnny Storm? This movie is definitely an 8 of out 10. I know I know I said I wouldn't be cheesy but come on, it's the freaking fantastic four. So I say.

"Movie Nuttball","10","2","10","22 August 2005"," Arguably the greatest Superhero movie ever! Arguably the best movie of the year! Extremely exciting! Everything in this movie is PERFECT!
","I had the chance to see The Fantastic Four on 8/19/05 and I was totally blown away! For months I dreamed of seeing this film and now the task is complete! I am a big time F4 fan and love the characters and I love the actors and actresses that made them real! I'll go by steps of the big time things that happen in the movie and a little more so without a further a do! <br/><br/>The Beginning: I loved it when the 20th Century Fox logo came and then the Marvel logo appeared with F4 comic pages turning by and hearing John Ottman's excellent score! The movie begins quite differently with only the title and no credits! <br/><br/>The Story: I love how the story surrounds the viewer with five main people. Reed and his old girlfriend Sue, her new fiancé Victor, her brother Johnny, and their friend Ben. Just fantastic! <br/><br/>Actors & Acting: <br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards: I was surprised by this actor I am really not familiar with. He really has good talents. He resembles MLB's Tino Martinez and actor Gary Sinese in My opinion. I think he was the perfect choice to play Mr.Fantastic! Whenever something happens he makes it so believable because of the looks he gets on his face and such. He's just a very talented actor! <br/><br/>Jessica Alba as Sue Storm: Not just a beauty but also a very good actress! She was really something here. So convincing! She was a very good choice to play the Invisible Woman! <br/><br/>Chris Evans as Johnny Storm: Another good choice! Actually I feel nobody could of pulled off this role as the Human Torch! <br/><br/>Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm: Just excellent! I never did give any credit to this actor in the past but now I see that this man is full of talent! I felt sorry for him as the Thing and actually had tears in My eyes when his girlfriend left him. The Thing suit works out really well believe it or not. They could have chosen CGI but this worked out! He reminded Me a little bit of the Hulk but the Thing is a totally different character. Like the others he to is very convincing! <br/><br/>Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom: My favorite in the movie! Though I am not familiar with him but also like Gruffudd I am an instant fan of his! He was the absolute perfect choice to play Dr. Doom! His looks are very neat and right away I knew that he was going to be a top notch villain! As the film went on as Victor Von Doom got more power hungry the more I liked him! When he became Dr. Doom he really changed into a menacing foe and had a really big presence throughout the last fifteen minutes of the film. He is just excellent in this film! <br/><br/>Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters: This actress was really good.<br/><br/>The Action & Special Effects: The movie so exciting in many different departments and action is one of them. The action is just unbelievable! Mr. Fantastic's stretching, Johnny's flame on, Sue's invisible powers, Grimm's looks, and Dr. Doom's lighting bolts are all so magnificently superb! <br/><br/>The Scenes: There were many scenes that I thought were really good. The entire bridge scene was just really cool, the small fight between The Thing and Mr. Fantastic, I laughed at all of the humor between the Thing and Johnny and of course the fight between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four at the end! That was awesome! But the cosmic storm scene was extraordinary! It was so emotional seeing the huge storm hit the four of them. That was really a one of a kind scene! One of the greatest scenes ever in My opinion! That's all I can explain about it!<br/><br/>The Musical Score: This is one of the reasons what makes the film so spectacular! This is arguably John Ottman's greatest score to date and possibly ever! Every scene the score is played is just right! He should definitely get nominated for best score at the Oscars! <br/><br/>The Directing: Tim Story is a great director and I just love the way he made this film!<br/><br/>Final: Its just a spectacular film! It has very good actors, great characters, great character development, great special effects, a tremendous musical score that's one of the best I have ever heard, and great directing! So I don't know why everybody is complaining. I have seen what I call the big four which are Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds, and now Fantastic Four! All of them are outstanding and does not deserve any negativity! I'd love a sequel to the F4 and I hope everyone returns! I really like the people in this one! I also hope Ottman and Story returns as well! I want this movie to become a saga! I'd also love see other Marvel characters join this team in movies like the X-Men and Spider-man and what about crossovers like the Fantastic Four and Superman? I'm ready for more Marvel and DC! F4 2, Hulk 2, X-Men 3, Spider-Man 3, Blade 4, Daredevil and Elektra 2, and what about Iron Man, Ghost Rider, She-Hulk, Thor, Alpha Flight, and so much more! Imagine the possibilities! Bring it all on! <br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE : Before the film began I saw the trailers to Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, New World, and the Transporter 2! All look really good! There is a scene when Chris Evens holds a Toy Biz World Wide Marvel Legend Action figure of the Thing! If you like Marvel Comic movies then I recommend The Punisher (1989 & 2004), The X-Men, X2: X-Men United, Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Daredevil, Elektra, and The Hulk!"
"myword2k3","7","2","10","6 July 2005"," It hasn't been a fantastic summer season, at least not for the movies. Does the trend continue?
","It hasn't been a fantastic summer season, at least not for the movies. Not to say that there have been too many mediocre movies as opposed to good ones, quite the contrary. The big summer movies thus far (""Star War: Revenge of The Sith"", ""Batman Begins"" & ""War of The Worlds"") have pleased large sections of the audience but haven't had the universal appeal that truly merits them the summer crown. So is this the movie that finally deserves the title? Scheduling couldn't have been more kind to ""Fantastic Four"". It comes at a time when the all-important family audiences have been offered nothing but much darker and more adult fair and family movies that did not manage to seamlessly tap both the parent and the adolescent crowd (e.g. ""Madagascar""). That is not to say the comic book adaptation tries being brainy whether it be with how well the characters are written or the plot plays out. Nevertheless it does provide the necessary thrills and spills to keep both young and old entertained during its short 1 hour 45 minute runtime.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the movie follows the exploits of four everyday human beings who are given extraordinary powers. In his quest to study a once in a lifetime cosmic event Reed Richards a/k/a Mr Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and his longtime buddy Ben Grimm aka The Thing (Michael Chiklis from the excellent TV show ""The Shield"") decide to a/k/a for financial assistance from the ever-scheming Victor Von Doom a/k/a Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon from another excellent TV show ""Nip/Tuck"" and the not so excellent ""Charmed""). In an instance Victor's current squeeze Sue Storm a/k/a The Invisible Girl (What?) (Played by the gorgeous Jessica Alba) and her immature brother Johnny Storm a/k/a The Human Torch (Chris Evans who's ""Cellular"" I've yet to catch) are added to the mix and we're off.<br/><br/>Unlike many recent superhero outings writers Michael France & Mark Frost hurry up the proceedings and our heroes, and obligatory villain, are speedily given their powers. It's an enjoyable, if familiar, ride as we discover the characters individual strengths and weaknesses just as they do. We've seen it all before from Peter Parker's first web slinging episode to Matt Murdock's terrifying first sonar vision and subsequent martial arts training. Nonetheless I personally always find such scenes/montages entertaining and feel they're very informative to the large numbers in the audience who're meeting these fascinating characters for the first time.<br/><br/>I'm not a frequent reader of the ""Fantastic Four"" title but from my little knowledge of the title I can safely say that they've tried to stick as closely to their origins as possible. The only victim is the character of Victor Von Doom. Fortunately, it isn't as bad as many had imagined. Making the ruthless tyrant from Latveria a Donald Trump type tycoon might not have gone down well with fans of the character but it plays out pretty well. Plus the obvious setup for a potential sequel indicates where we'll find Dr. Doom next. It's also enjoyable to see the famous sites such as the Baxter Building carefully replicated on screen.<br/><br/>One of my greatest fears regarding this movie has always been The Thing's bodysuit and make-up effects. It just looked terribly bad in the early stills, trailers and promotional artwork. Although I would've loved to see a larger version of the character Michael Chiklis excellent performances helped me look past that. He really gets into the skin (every pun intended) of the character and truly owns the role.<br/><br/>I was right about one thing though - the addition of Jessica Alba to the cast definitely had to do with trying to get horny 12 year olds in the cinema. It's so blatantly obvious from her body hugging, cleavage revealing getup to a random scene where she's made to strip on the pretext of turning invisible and sneaking past a crowd. Imaginative? Sure. But why go through all the hassle when both Reed and Johnny manage to sneak past the police barricade without resorting to such cheap tricks? Oh well, at least it gives the perverts out there another scene to screen cap (*cough*please e-mail me the link if you find it online...*cough*). I still don't think she fit the role and what's with the whole Invisible Girl thing? Maybe I remember it a little different but wasn't it always supposed to be ""woman""? If anything truly stands out like a sore thumb it has to be the by-the-numbers plot. You should truly leave your brain at the door as every scene can be predicted right from the offset. In place of it we get great scenes exploring the ""first family of comics"" aspect associated with F4. Director Tim Story could've easily gone with over-the-top special effects laden match-up (king of puns aren't I?) between The Human Torch and The Thing but instead decides to tackle it very much like a family dispute.<br/><br/>The movie may not deserve the summer movie crown I mentioned earlier but it is a fun ride. If it wasn't for the been there, done that vibe one gets after stepping out from the cinema and the no-brainer plot it would have definitely bowled over the audience and critics alike. On the whole though it's a pleasant popcorn entertainer."

Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) was coerced into sleeping with a Thai prostitute whilst serving in the armed forces then murdered someone because they laughed at the fact it was a bloke. He now repeats desultory Buddhist chants whilst preparing the food but still wonders their real meaning. Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) is your atypical American, blaming the fact he is balding and overweight on the spliff he smoked when in his youth. He is now on a number of antidepressants and in love with the factory secretary who thinks the only thing wrong with her is the fact that she has a photographic memory."

","The plot: Five people are in a space station and they get hit by some sort of solar storm, which gives them super powers. Four of them become the Fantastic 4, and they do some super hero type stuff while dealing with their anxieties over their drastically changed lives. The fifth becomes the bad guy, and (surprise!) there's a big battle at the end.<br/><br/>The good: Jessica Alba. Holy Mary mother of God, that woman is gorgeous. What a body, what a face, what an outfit! Good acting as well. Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm is also great, that guy could stand in a corner and chew gum and his screen presence would still steal the show. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm is rather entertaining, he takes great pleasure in picking on Chicklis' character, which got a genuine chuckle out of me on more than one occasion. Overall this movie was surprisingly funny. It certainly made me snicker many more times than most of the pathetic comedies Hollywood is putting out these days.<br/><br/>Special effects were great overall, the only really obvious CGI scene being where Reed Richards character (the rubber man) gets heated up and begins stretching out of control, falling through a window; it looked really fake. Everything else was quite acceptable. The climatic battle was even impressive.<br/><br/>The bad: Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards. He's easy to miss as he's completely overshadowed by anything or anyone appearing on screen at the same time as him. His character doesn't even reach the level of one-dimensionality. An obvious stinker in the middle of his three entertaining co-stars. Julian McMahon as the bad guy, Victor Von Doom, is nearly as banal. I had a hard time telling the two of them apart. But at least McMahon is evil, which in and of itself gives him some personality. Oddly, in the ""behind the scenes"" feature on the DVD, the actor has much more personality in real life than he does as his comic book super villain character.<br/><br/>I also give the movie a point deduction for the obnoxious ""hip"" music that keeps blaring through the soundtrack. I know it's made for young ""hip"" kids, but really...no need to annoy the crap out of the rest of us. Oh well, at least it wasn't rap.<br/><br/>Overall, nothing great, just about what you'd expect but for the surprisingly funny jokes and of course, the amazingly beautiful Jessica Alba. I liked it. You could do far, far worse with these super hero movies."

","It seems like everyone hates this movie. I enjoyed it. Keep in mind it's an 'origin' movie, so they have to tell the story of how these people became the Fantastic Four. Thus, it's a little slow and plodding at times, but it is an entertaining movie. The special effects were good, the acting was decent. My only real complaints were that the movie was a little short and the big fight at the end was over too quickly. Dr. Doom is the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe, and he should be able to put up more of a fight. It seems that some of the Marvel movies are made with about 1/2 the budget they need. Now that this is a bona-fide hit and a sequel has been announced, expect a bigger and grander Fantastic 4 #2."

The negative comments i have read all seem pretty stupid because most of the try to compare it to batman. But fantastic four is completely different. It is not supposed to have a dark and brooding tone like batman. The fantastic four were always much more lighthearted. I think the movie is true to the comic and i liked it a lot. The special effects could have been a little better in the space scene but the rest of them were very good. My most major complaint with the actors was the actress of Alicia Marsters who in my opinion was terrible. Also, i did not really think Julian McMahon played the part very well.

The special effects are a real treat, but the script fails to distinguish itself from more recent comic book adaptations leaving you with that seen-it-all-before feeling.

","If you go into this movie not expecting anything (as I did), you'll be very pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this movie, as the fun, comic book movie that it was... it made fun of itself and the Fantastic Four characters were great, they all had a wonderful on screen chemistry, even with the evil Dr. Doom... Though a few parts of it were a bit over the top, it made me laugh, (especially the characters played by Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans), and that is the biggest thing I look for in a summer movie.

"d_bito","7","1","4","10 July 2005"," Not as Bad as Feared
","Honestly, when I set out to see the Fantastic Four, I was pretty much convinced I was going to see something very painful. After the fiasco of Daredevil, and judging by some rather... interesting choices in the trailers, I pretty much figured that this was going to be another Comic Masacre. I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film managed to avoid being indecipherable to people new to the Fantastic Four without explaining every little detail to the point of being boring. It was a little goofy, the scene where our five main characters get their powers standing out as a good example of some moments which were unintentionally funny, but it managed to feel a lot like watching the actual comic book. As the Fantastic Four has always tended to be that way, I can't see it as a downside. The movie actually made me laugh at several points, Johnny in particular was hilarious, and I thought Von Doom was really well done.<br/><br/>The plot line is very slow-paced, and there isn't a whole lot of super-heroing all things considered, but as it had to explain five separate stories whilst trying not to give anyone the short-end of the stick, this is understandable. Some things that bothered me would only bother someone who was a little familiar with the Fantastic Four beforehand. I can't fathom Jessica Alba as Sue Storm. Her performance wasn't bad, but it just didn't feel as though she were playing Sue Storm. It felt as though I was watching Jessica Alba, and I didn't get that with any of the other characters. The special effects were fun, and some of the scenes managed to be shocking without an over-use of gore or violence. Another good thing about this film is its lack of preaching. There were no long-winded speeches on teamwork or heroics, and while there were definite and strong moral themes, especially about acceptance, they aren't shoved down your throat.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'd say it's a good film to see, especially in a group."
"beckerboy","8","1","4","10 July 2005"," Satisfying
","The story was weak, and it did feel like a prequel, but as a fan of the comic back in the late 70s (and a non-comic reader in recent years), I feel like the filmmakers got the essence of the characters, and especially of their interactions with one another, exactly right. Casting was perfect (although I'd have preferred a slightly more Eastern European take on Dr. Doom) and took me right back to being a comic fan. The storyline was admittedly weak, and the movie just seemed to end rather unexpectedly with very little buildup, but the 11 year old fan of the Fantastic Four inside me left the theater very satisfied."
"Crook","7","1","4","8 July 2005"," The most comic book-like of comic book adaptations.
","I read a couple of reviews of this film which compared it unfavorably to other superhero comic book adaptations, such as that of Spiderman or Superman. But to me, this movie was the most like the experience of reading an actual comic book. That was what I enjoyed about it. I actually went to see it only because Ioan Gruffudd is in it (and annoyingly, he has been the least interviewed of all the cast members). I took my 10 and 12 year old sons. We liked it a lot better than the professional reviewers did. Plausibility is not a requirement when you're talking about superhero powers. We buy the abilities of Superman because we've grown up with them, but really--kryptonite? Why would kryptonite weaken someone who was born on a planet made of kryptonite? I want some plausibility in my comics, but I don't require absolute fidelity to the laws of science. I'm looking forward to sequels, because they can have more plot and less exposition, but as someone who hasn't read this particular set of comic books, the amount of exposition was fine."

","I got to screen Fantastic 4 last night when it came in to our theater and it was very entertaining, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm are the characters that steal the spotlight, because of their humor I thought, but they also had nice action sequences. Jessica Alba is pretty good as Invisible Woman (or girl). The acting could have been better, but it got the job done. SPOILER ALERT: I did enjoy the traffic scene where the 3 others were looking for The Thing and how they all demonstrate their powers for the first time in public. Also when Dr. Doom walks through the parking garage towards one of his former board supervisors and doesn't say a thing to him, then just decides to electrocute him after he had talked a little too much. Scenes like that with Doom made the movie as good as it is. I'll leave everything else to the viewers eyes. 7/10."

","I have never read a Fantastic Four comic (what can I say I'm a DC man.) so take from that what you will. I've heard lots of rabid haters of this movie. Both from people who have seen it and from those who have not. Some folks (specifically Harry Knowles from AICN) could not wait to bash this movie. Now, I admit there is some cheesy dialogue here and there, and some special effects that ain't so special but after the movie was over I was happy. And that's what I go to the movies for... to be entertained. And judging by the crowd they were happy too.<br/><br/>The action starts early but It's the Four discovering their powers, bickering, mastering their powers, bickering, and learning to work as a team, and bickering that made me enjoy the movie.

"alexcomputerkid","4","1","5","18 August 2015"," A below average and very goofy affair.
","Next to the massive popular The Avengers, The Fantastic Four has the most potential as a Marvel film adaptation. You have an interesting duo as lead characters that can bring so much depth in different ways. They are superheroes that don't hide their identify and live as normal beings. Let's not also forgot the Roger Corman produced a very low budget Fantastic Four film that never got a released in 1994. When first mainstream Fantastic Four was released in 2005 from director Tim Story, we were long overdue for it and when there were two excellent Spider-Man films from Sami Raimi before that, Fantastic Four was suppose to be really something. Well it works perfectly as a popcorn film but you really want something better as a superhero film when you consider that it is the Fantastic Four and the source material it comes from.<br/><br/>After an attack with radiation on a space mission, four astronauts and Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahorn) all get some type of superhero powers. The four astronauts who later together create a team later called Fantastic Four. The team who's villain later is Victor Von Doom himself and who wants revenge.<br/><br/>Due to the plot, this is a film that has places a high value on casting as the team of characters that has to work together through most scenes. The very attractive Jessica Alba plays invisible woman Sue Storm; an actress who's acting has never been that sharp and this is really some questionable casting. Chris Evans plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch; a character who can create fire which kind of brings you back to the Stephen King adaption Firestarter and character that is so hard to like due to his hotshot attitude. Villain Victor Von Doom is only in character in the last act and actor Julian McMahorn makes the character very cheesy and not at all menacing. Besides the fact that he looks very cheap, the only superhero you can fully like is The Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who you feel a lot of sympathy for due to having issues with his appearance and it is tough to watch his divorce with his wife Debbie (Lauire Holden). The divorce part of the plot could have been covered much more and it really is a question mark as to why it only had two scenes to it.<br/><br/>We can also say this film falls due to a bad script. The plot has no ideas in the middle and for people wanting action, well don't expect a lot of that. Even when you get action, it's lot of running around without any type direction, especially a particular bridge scene. The writing by Mark Frost and Michael France is either a lot of garbled talk that does makes for a confusing first act or that it is writing with a lot one-liners that takes a direction like it was made to be comedy. The special effects are rushed and are so very far off from what we see in superhero films of today. The Fantastic Four has some ideas no doubt but in the end it is a mess that get lost with many flaws.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is a very hard film to sit through. This movie is very different from the superhero films of today which makes it both odd and refreshing. A below average and very goofy affair."

","Fantastic Four (2005): Dir: Tim Story / Cast: Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon: No, this film is not about a great game of golf although that might have been more entertaining. No, this film is about the abilities of four individuals infected with superpowers when a space project goes wrong. One of them can stretch to great lengths. One can render herself invisible. Another can become a human torch. While another becomes a rocky creature called the Thing. They must defeat the evil Dr. Doom before he can wreck havoc on mankind with a sequel. Directed by Tim Story with not a shred of story yet it is overwhelmed with special effects and mindless action. Story previous directed Barbershop and the idiotic comedy Taxi. Michael Chiklis as the Thing is terrific generating the one interesting character. He feels cursed especially when his fiancé rejects him, although the whole concluding blind woman thing is a bit over the top. Ioan Gruffudd as Stretch fails to extend a personality. Jessica Alba as Invisible Girl might as well have been invisible. Chris Evans plays the Human Torch who accepts his powers as a gift and goes to the press about it. Julian McMahon plays the nitwit villain Doctor Doom. Transcending the comic to screen results in a film that is about as fantastic as a kick in the ass. Score: 4 ½ / 10"
"utgard14","5","1","5","7 May 2014"," Disappointing
","What a missed opportunity. When it was first released, I thought ""Meh, it's okay I guess."" I gave it a six. But over the years I had zero desire to rewatch this movie or its sequel. For the purposes of this review I finally did rewatch it and was surprised at how bored I was by it. I always knew it wasn't a smart movie, but I had remembered it being more fun than it is. As time goes by, its flaws stand out more.<br/><br/>The cast is mixed. Ioan Gruffudd and Chris Evans are probably the most suited to their parts. Evans is especially good. Jessica Alba looks pretty but her Sue Storm seems like an airhead at times. Michael Chiklis is a little old for the part of Ben Grimm. Ideally Ben and Reed should be the same age yet Chiklis is ten years older and looks it. I would say Julian McMahon was miscast but I can't since I don't know what character he's playing. It sure as hell isn't Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>The movie seems to end just as it's getting started. There are no defining moments or memorable scenes. Most of what made the comic book work is absent; notably the actual 'fantastic' part. The score is forgettable. The script is weak. Tim Story's direction is workmanlike. There are some fun moments, mostly from Chris Evans. I appreciated the lighter tone to the film. A Fantastic Four movie shouldn't be dark. Still, the negatives outweigh the positives. I suppose it's worth watching if you are a fan of comic book movies or of the Fantastic Four in particular. But keep your expectations low."
"strong-122-478885","3","1","5","3 June 2013"," Pigeons Aren't Required To Show Respect To Superheroes
","While viewing Fantastic Four I thought that when the pigeon pooped on ""Thing"" that just about summed up this dismal superhero movie in a nutshell.<br/><br/>I just wished that my hero (the pigeon) had called on his buddies and, like a massive swarm, the whole flock of 'em had pooped & pooped & pooped all over the Fantastic Four. Yeah. That would have been so absolutely delightful to see! Don't you think? <br/><br/>Yeah. OK. I know that sounds mighty nasty, but, hey, that's the way I feel about this dreadful superhero movie. I rank Fantastic Four as being in the same league as the horrendously bad Watchmen. It's movies just like these 2 (and there are others) that make me despise the whole superhero genre to the 10th power.<br/><br/>This film wasted too much time giving the viewer a blow-by-blow rundown of how each member of the ""Four"" had acquired their fantastic powers through exposure to cosmic radiation. I think that this sort of thing should've already been established right from the start and that way we could've all been treated to a really exciting tale of non-stop superhero super-heroics like we so rightfully deserved.<br/><br/>This film lost itself some major points with its blatant product placement of those familiar trademarks belonging to both Pepsi and Burger King.<br/><br/>Don't you think it's hilarious that the evil Von Doom's initials are V.D.? <br/><br/>Without a doubt, I think that Jessica Alba is the ultimate, clueless, bimbo actress, bar none. Her and that no-talent Michael Fassbender would be ideal teamed up together in some trite romance.<br/><br/>Even though it's not really that great, either, I'd say that the Fantastic Four cartoon series from the 1990s was far superior to this live-action fiasco by a long-shot.<br/><br/>I understand that Fantastic Four is due for an upcoming ""reboot"". Spare me!"
"MBunge","5","1","5","25 October 2010"," One of the bad movies I actually like
","Hollywood has taken the classic comic book The Fantastic Four and made a great movie out of it. It's called The Incredibles. This official, big screen adaptation of the comic falls far, far short of being great. In fact, it's pretty crappy in most respects. As bad as it is, though, I still like its lighthearted tone and the few things about the FF that it gets almost precisely right.<br/><br/>Born in the Cold War days of the space race, the Fantastic Four comic was about a brilliant scientist named Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), his best friend and pilot Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), the woman Reed loves, and her kid brother Johnny (Chris Evans). The four of them defy government orders and sneak aboard a rocket ship to launch it into space, where they're bombarded by cosmic rays and are transformed into the stretchable Mr. Fantastic, super-strong and rock-like Thing and the more obviously descriptive Invisible Girl and Human Torch. The foursome band together to argue like cats and dogs while using their powers to protect humanity, most notably from the evil schemes of an Eastern European tyrant, scientist and sorcerer named Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon).<br/><br/>To start with, this film butchers that origin about as badly as any super-hero origin has been butchered in movie history. Here, Reed is a financially strapped scientist who has to go to wealthy industrialist Victor Von Doom and ask for his help in conducting a science experiment involving an approaching cosmic storm. Sue and her brother Johnny work for Von Doom, with Sue even dating the guy while Reed, who was cold and forceful in the comics, is reduced to an insecure and socially awkward misfit who broke up with Sue years ago.<br/><br/>They fly up to Von Doom's space station, get zapped by the cosmic storm and change into their super-powered forms, with Von Doom being included this time as a metalized version of the old Spider-Man villain Electro. Back on Earth, the Fantastic Four become a media sensation while Reed tries to work on curing their conditions. Reed and Sue grow closer as Von Doom is caught up in a stupid subplot involving the loss of his company. Eventually, Von Doom dons his traditional hood and metal face-plate and tries to destroy Reed and company. They fight. The end.<br/><br/>I believe the background of this movie is that it was first intended to be a comedy, something like a super-hero version of The Addams Family or The Munsters, and some studio executives then demanded it be refashioned into a more stereotypical comic book adventure flick. If that isn't true, it should have been because that's what Fantastic Four is like. There's a whole lot of humor and fun with a few badly designed and badly pulled off action sequences sandwiched in at the beginning and end.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good.<br/><br/>Johnny Storm is may be the best ever big screen version of a comic book character. The rambunctious 60s teen who could burst into flames is recast as 20something hothead who's never met a risk he didn't want to take or a woman he didn't want to kiss. This irresponsible guy learning to be responsible is actually a big part of both this movie and its sequel.<br/><br/>The tempestuous relationship between Johnny and Ben is also wonderfully captured here. The familial animosity between the two of them flows naturally and is the source of a lot of the movie's best laughs.<br/><br/>The story also does a nice job of illustrating the pitiful plight of Ben. The idea of being remade into horrible monster was much more of a compelling concept for a super-hero a half century ago. In a world that's much more used to the grotesque, it doesn't quite sting as much. But the film finds little ways of emphasizing Ben's suffering that are almost touching.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four also works hard at trying to be as much fun as possible, which is a nice break from so many other super-hero movie that treat everything so SERIOUSLY. There's something childlike and marvelously silly about the idea of people with costumes, code names and super-powers punching the forces of evil in the nose, and most super-hero movies move Heaven and Earth to squelch that sentiment. Where those films try so hard to be dramatic, this one goes for comedic and it's a nice chance of pace.<br/><br/>Now for the bad.<br/><br/>Reed Richards is a shlub, Sue Storm is a cypher and this movie aesthetically sodomizes Dr. Doom. He's turned into an utterly different and vastly inferior character. I can sort of understand why they thought they needed to change him. Countless sci-fi and fantasy storytellers have ripped off Dr. Doom to create their own bad guys and it might have been thought that the genuine article would have come off as derivative of his own copies. But if they didn't think Doom would work, they didn't need to jam him into this film. They could have used the Mole Man, Blastarr, the Skrulls or several other FF villains to do whatever evil-doing needed to be done.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four really isn't a good movie, but it demonstrates yet again that being good and being entertaining are not the same thing. For all its faults, and they are legion, I still had a great time watching it."
"blackplastick","1","1","5","15 September 2009"," Terrible - Not faithful to the comics AT ALL
","None of the characters were faithful depictions of the comic book characters. The script sucked, the film was rife with inconsistencies, and the special effects were mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Dr. Reed Richards was not a timid naive pu**y, he was a tormented super genius who had his sh*t together. Ioan Gruffudd was an incredibly bad choice to play Richards, he looks nothing like him.<br/><br/>The Human Torch was a funny prankster - many of his lines were feeble attempts at humor, not actually funny. Also I would point out, in the comic he was not a pretty boy, he was drawn with a heroic, manly facial structure.<br/><br/>Ben Grim lived up to his name - he was grim and angry, sometimes funny but mostly not. The only positive is that Michael Chiklis was the perfect actor for Ben Grim - but he did not pull off the personality.<br/><br/>The invisible girl was sometimes melodramatic but was often the member with the most common sense out of the four.<br/><br/>Dr. Doom was complete fail. First of all Dr. Doom is one of the most intimidating frightful villains in the entire Marvel Universe. Julian McMahon has a voice that sounds more like Bill Gates than a terrifying super villain. He was basically a nerd in a badly constructed doom costume that barely resembled the classic Dr. Doom armor and an overdone iron mask. They did not faithfully depict Dr. Dooms intentions. Dr. Doom is really not so much of a villain because his intentions were always to bring order to a chaotic world using any means necessary. He was not vengeful or ""evil"", he simply did what had to be done to save his homeland. Instead, they depicted him as some vengeful maniac who simply wanted to see the end of Reed Richards. This is not the story told in the actual comics."
"dfwilson","9","1","5","8 December 2005"," True to its maker.
","Having only seen the DVD, and having not seen the trailers, I have to say that the movie was a delightful surprise. Comic books are not about character building, although Michael Chiklis does a great job portraying Ben, nor are they about non-stop action. Comic books are about capturing the imagination. They are about superheroes, crime fighters, personas based on the wish fulfillment of every caring child, the desire to make a difference in our small yet seemingly significant environment, to stand up for the downtrodden, and fight for what is right. For me this movie revives those childhood feelings, and does what every good comic book should, it draws me in and spews me out into a world where even the least of us can have a dramatic impact. And oh yeah, who wouldn't want to see Jessica Alba strip down to her ... I can only imagine, oh yeah."

","I saw this movie and I thought it was better than what all these other critics are saying. When I read the comic books, I liked them not for their action content but for their character base. The Fantastic Four was never about going right into a battle without knowing what you have to fight with first. The battles in Fantastic Four were always about teamwork and unity against evil. And when they weren't battling, you got to see who these characters were. That's the great thing about the Fantastic Four. They helped people relate to the heroes more. You have four very different people joining together to fight crime because of a freak accident. Ben Grimm is the blue collar ""everyman"". Sue Storm is the beautiful driving force of the group. Johnny Storm is the young, thick-headed show off. And lastly, Reed Richards is the thinker, the brains, the father figure. That was what was so Fantastic about this comic book series. Not the action. I'm glad that the movie was so faithful to the comic books. I also have nothing to complain about the acting. At times, it felt like script reading but every single thing that Ben Grimm did as The Thing made up for it all. He, in my opinion, did an excellent job at capturing the inner struggle Ben Grimm went through every day. I liked this movie and I recommend seeing it not for the action, but for the heart this movie has. It's worth at least a matinée ticket."

","Parents, here finally is a comic book movie that you can take your 8-12 year old child to, and not have to worry about language or intense violence. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy. It has plenty of action, a very good storyline (sticking to the original Marvel comic book), good acting and special effects, and a family oriented brand of humor that is well interspersed between the action scenes.<br/><br/>I'm an adult who was turned off by the darkness of Batman Begins, and could not believe that it got by with a PG-13 rating. Same goes for Star Wars III. Both of them were too intense for the very market they were aimed at --- the 10-12 year old toy buyers, etc. Why did they change these perfectly fine movie series into frightening dark and intense films? Both of those movies turned me off.<br/><br/>But Fantastic Four was just right. Perfect fun and excitement for the entire family. I can't wait for the sequel !!"
"robi7","7","1","5","11 July 2005"," The essential Fantastic Four captured on film
","I've been waiting a long time to see this movie. The Fantastic Four are one of my favourite comic book hero's. So you can imagine, with such expectation the likelihood of disappointment is high. I took my daughter to opening day and left the cinema with confused thoughts.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie was it's development of the characters. They were real, even Von Doom (considering the things that went wrong in his life I'd be mighty angry too). I loved the by-play between Johnny and Ben, hilarious. Some of Johnny's lines were predictable but were delivered with such roguish charm that it was hard not to enjoy his character.<br/><br/>The down side of the movie was it's lack of drama or incident. We had the space station, the bridge, Doom's attempted elimination of potential threats to his plan and the final battle with Doom. But for a feature length movie of its type, this was not enough. At least not for my 12 year old daughter. Overall, she enjoyed the movie and had a few laughs along the way but next time can 'we' add some extra drama and tension (I know for the first installment this was meant to be light hearted but .....).<br/><br/>Anyway, being an obsessive personality I had some free time the following night so I took myself off to see the movie again and you know what, I enjoyed it even more. I had a greater appreciation for the work and left the cinema satisfied in the knowledge that the team who put this work together did a great job in introducing us to the Fantastic Four. It displayed some of the original freshness we were treated to way back in the early 60's. Can't wait for number 2. Wouldn't mind seeing Galactus and the Surfer!!!"

","I saw Fantastic Four last night and found it extremely entertaining. The special effects were amazing and I thought it was a very well paced film. I loved how each of their powers were presented and how Susan's powers were ""scientifically"" explained. I admit you must suspend your disbelief when trying to understand The Thing's or the Human Torch powers. However, just like Xmen and Spiderman I don't think about the science and I enjoy seeing the great action that brings this awesome comic to life. I've always thought FF was a pretty cool concept and having seen the movie I'm blown away by how it was presented. It's definitely not for people looking for some drama or a deeper story. The trailer tells it all, the movie is a great ride."

The Thing's make-up was a bit of a disappointment, but after a while, it didn't seem to matter. The special effects were great, well-done. Not half-ass-ed CGI at all. I'd totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great, fun summer flick. There's nothing parents would find objectionable for kids. There's nothing Christians, Muslims, Hindis or Jews might find offensive either. I have to write ten lines to get this thing posted, which means that I'm just going to blather on for the next couple of lines to flush out my full ten line minimum. Who can write for ten lines?"

","My experience with the Fantastic Four is minimal, since I have only seen the Fox Network cartoons of the mid 90s.

Michael Chiklis' portrayal of The Thing is very well done, and you can feel for his depression very well.<br/><br/>The other characters don't get as much development as The Thing, but it's still there. Johnny Storm changes from a wild teen to a respectable hero. Susan Storm and Reed Richards' relationship also develops, but the romance isn't as great as other movies. Also, Victor Von Doom's development into Doctor Doom is fun to watch, but a bit rushed.<br/><br/>On the other side of the film is the amazing special effects and action. The first time the heroes come together as a team and save people is a great moment, and how they change from a dysfunctional family into one of the greatest superhero teams is done well.<br/><br/>While this movie isn't as great as the Spider-Man films or Batman Begins, it is still very good and does what it sets out to do: Entertain."
"eichelbergersports","6","1","7","6 July 2005"," 'Fantastic?' Not quite, but Marvel film satisfies true fans
","While some critics have called 20th Century-Fox's newest action summer flick, ""Fantastic Four,"" ""'Spiderman' times four,"" I prefer to describe it as ""Spiderman"" *divided* by four, since it takes that Marvel Comic and slices it up, dividing not only the drama, but the action and interest, as well. Rabid fans of the graphic novel may love it, but the casual movie fan will watch, react on a very low level, leave the theatre and think about where to grab a bite to eat. It doesn't stick around very long, friends. That's not to say it is a bad film, it isn't. Just compared to the recent ""Batman Begins,"" ""Sin City"" the ""X-Men"" pictures and the above-mentioned webslinger flicks, it doesn't really hold up. It does follow that last movie's modus operandi (as well as Marvel's 2003 dud, ""The Hulk""), however. People conduct scientific experiment; experiment goes horribly wrong; people become infected with some kind of radioactivity; instead of dying of cancer, they gain super strength, speed or some other kind of amazing super power. In this one, nerdy scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd, ""Blackhawk Down,"" ""King Arthur"") is working  you guessed it  on an experiment to eliminate diseases. To do this he must travel into space with colleagues Susan Storm (Jessica Alba, ""Sin City,"" ""Dark Angel"" TV series), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis, ""The Three Stooges,"" an Emmy Award winner for ""The Shield"" TV series) and hotshot, arrogant pilot, Susan's little brother, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans, ""The Perfect Score,"" ""Cellular"") . He is also joined on the mission by corporate maverick, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon, television series ""Charmed"" and ""Nip-And-Tuck"")  think of an evil Richard Branson  who paid for this whole enterprise. Of course, the shuttle floats through a radiation cloud and all aboard are affected by it. Richards becomes as flexible as a rebind; Susan has the power to become invisible and create a force field of some kind, while her brother becomes a human flying torch; and Grimm turns into a rock-like thing. The four return to earth, but bicker among themselves before finally teaming up and taking on Van Doom, who is slowly turning into a titanium covered, electromagnetic powerhouse. I'm really not quite sure why Von Doom is ticked off at the quartet, but he might be jealous of Reed's wooing of Susan, who knows? He does get a chance to emulate Christopher Walken in ""Spiderman,"" as the company owner who gets to wipe out his board of directors, though, before going after the four heroes. The most interesting performance here is by Evans, who seems to react the most realistically to his sudden advent of super powerdom. He brags about it on the national news, gladly wallows in the attention and adulation of fans, and even shows off at a motocross event  something most of us would most likely do if we were in the same situation. As for the others, their low-key performances almost put one in a stupor. I recommend this film, but not very highly."
"kamcgann","7","1","8","8 July 2005"," Better than Batman Begins.
","Fantastic Four is a better movie than Batman Begins is a film. Even though the movie has two principal characters miscast, Reed Richards and Sue Storm, there was, surprisingly, enough chemistry and pace to make for an enjoyable movie. I was pleased that there was no megalomaniacal world domination plot or threats from a shadowy society cursed by the incoherence of Yoda and coming across about as menacing as Ninja Turtles. The effects are blended well into the storytelling and the Thing's costume works very well. Although few would look as good as Jessica Alba does in her FF suit, she is too young and lacks all of the intangibles required for an actor's presence and ""weight"" in a role. As they should, the Thing and Johnny Storm are the highlight of the endeavor."
"maddog51_89","9","1","8","8 July 2005"," Not perfect but well done
","Any true comic book fan will appreciate this movie. Sure the origins are different but overall I did enjoy the movie. All the actors in my mind played their parts perfectly and the chemistry between them all was also very VERY well done. Especially the chemistry between Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis because anyone who reads the comics knows that the Thing and The Torch are always busting each others chops. The only bad thing about the movie is when Jessica Alba goes Invisible. I kinda wish they would have casted someone really ugly as the Invisible girl because every time she used her power I sighed. And don't forget about Doctor Doom. Extraordinary that is all I am going to say. Extraordinary. So there you have it that is my opinion and I am sticking to it."

","I think it was pretty good. When i first heard it was coming out in movie form, i thought it was gonna be really boring, one of those typical sci-fi action movies. Well it WAS a sci-fi action movie but it was really engaging and interesting. For me, a movie is considered good as long as it captures my attention and makes me lean forward and focus on the movie, every minute. That's exactly what i did with the Fantastic Four. The cast was pretty good and the plot too. There was a lot of action so it captures the viewer. All this was toppled up with humour injected at several points. I wouldn't say it was the best of all movies, but it was alright, it was better than i expected, i would say. If u are a fan of the Fantastic Four comics, you may have different opinions..i dunno. But I've never read the comics, and I didn't have any prior background info about the characters. So it was okay for me. If you're someone who doesn't like elaborate artificiality like for example, a man who can stretch like a rubber band, or man who can just light up and fly around on fire, than maybe u'll not really be a fan of this movie..but hey, go with an open mind and you just might enjoy it! Afterall, Jessica Alba IS hot. :)"

","oh come on people, what were you expecting? i had low expectations myself when i went to see this movie, but i came out satisfied.<br/><br/>for those of you still in awe with Batman Begins, yes it's a far stellar movie. but FF is NOT trying to become one of those! it's not meant to be a serious, deep character building movie. in the comics they fought aliens and travel to other dimensions, and you expect the movie to be on the same tone as Batman?? well for starters, the characters and powers themselves are already somewhat silly, campy, 60's material at best. who can took Lee and Kirby's version of their origin without laughing hard in this modern age? just the achievement of making Mr. Fantastic, who's supposed to be a genius, stretch himself without looking silly is already a great accomplishment! you gotta understand they filmmakers were trying very hard to walk a fine line between campy powers and realism, and i think they succeed well! the reason why ""The Incredibles"" works so well is because their entire environment are not real. now the FF's got pretty much the same powers, but they gotta look and feel as in the real world. that took some hard work and i'm pleased of what they did.<br/><br/>my one minor quibble is about Dr. Doom, whom i feel isn't quite badass enough. perhaps he should be given a larger, grander cause of evil.<br/><br/>i hope they'd do well in the box office, cos i'll sure be in line for the sequel."

","Finally hitting theaters one of the groups most beloved heroes in the Marvel Universe through the dissemination of comic book adaptations that hit the screens in the early and mid-2000s. After the successful X-Men (2000) and X-Men 2 (2003) director Bryan Singer, Spider-Man (2002) and Spider-Man 2 (2004) Sam Raimi, criticized the film Hulk (2003) of Ang Lee and fiascos Elektra (2005) and Daredevil (2003) - is regarded as the ""first family"" superhero earn their live-action version - I say family because two of the members are brothers and two marry, and have a which is extremely close to the family.<br/><br/>The characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby are led to this new entertainment platform by director Tim Story and maybe that was a grave error of producers. Story before commanding that this was his first major film, had only directed films of little relevance as Barbershop, The Firing Squad and One of Us Tripped, but he was called for this movie for his work in another best-known film, the bad Taxi (2004), starring Queen Latifah, Jimmy Fallon and Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen. Taxi has proved to be a film with many flaws, but still Story earned this new opportunity with a popular movie at hand and where he could shut up the critics, but unfortunately it does not. Fantastic to serve as a fun movie, but it has too many misconceptions and mistakes that end up hurting too grotesque credibility and magnificence of the work.<br/><br/>The brilliant but virtually bankrupt, Reed Richards, just asking for the help of billionaire and former college classmate, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), so that it finances in companies Von Doom a trip to space where you can study better human DNA and where they would be found cures and medical advances for humankind in various segments. Victor accepts in exchange for having 75% of profits from discoveries and Reed, without much alternative, eventually accepts knowing that could help many people with their discoveries of the trip. Along with him, his best friend Ben Grimm, go on the trip to Reed's ex-girlfriend, Sue Storm, who has worked for two years for Victor - Johnny Storm, Sue's brother - besides himself Victor. During the space expedition, an accident reaches the ship, causing its crew undergo changes in your body and gain special powers becoming the ""Fantastic Four."" Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), the leader of the group, replaced by the ability to stretch his body made rubber is known as Mr. Fantastic. Sue Storm gains powers that allow her to turn invisible and create force fields, becoming the Invisible Woman. Johnny (Chris Evans), can increase the heat of your body and fly at tremendous speed, and the Human Torch, and Ben (Michael Chiklis) has his body turned to stone and gains a superhuman strength, turning the ""Thing. Upon returning to Earth soon after the accident the new powers begin to be perceived and exploited, causing all have to adapt to them and the new life they had to lead, how to get used to the status of celebrities who bring them powers. In parallel, the quartet did not think anyone else that was on board also acquired powers with radiation. Victor, who became the Dr. Fate, tries to deal with problems in companies related to disaster mission and ends up realizing new powers, he can generate a powerful electric charge.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Mark Frost and Michael France seeks to bring the comic to the emergence of a faithful group of heroes (creation of uniform exposure to cosmic waves, personality of heroes, their being known heroes and not hide behind masks as Most other heroes etc.), and this is not the main problem of the film, which has the continuity errors, and lack of expendable scenes twists and a powerful enemy, some of its main deficiencies. The roadmap seeks to give equal space to the entire group creating dramatic arches misguided and without strength, jokes that do not always work and excessive action scenes. But it is clear simplicity and little development of the story, and in the end the only purpose was to introduce you to the heroes and not give them an enemy already impressive, and it is a serious mistake because Dr. Doom is the main opponent of the quartet .<br/><br/>It's amazing the amount of continuity errors, unsatisfactory explanations and free scenes that try to generate laughter and emotion without success. For example: Reeds, seeking to bring his friend Ben back to normal appearance, creates a machine capable of recreating the cosmic storm that hit in your home lab. If Reed knew what was in the storm, why not recreated before? What basis he had to recreate it in the lab? Because he knew that it was composed? Why go to space and risk his life if he knew how to do it? Why the ""Thing"" needed more power on the machine to reverse his condition, but to return to the ""thing"" it just came on the machine alone without anyone to help you get in and close the doors on the outside, and on up out of there again transformed as the ""Thing"". And now, knowing that he could return to normal when he wanted, why he would want to keep as the Thing? Just trying to pass a moral lesson that we should accept our fate? Not really convinced that excuse.<br/><br/>Other examples: Why Ben's wife appears on the scene on the bridge where the new superheroes use their powers and are applauded by the people? Just trying to provoke an emotional scene tears poorly prepared. Not to mention the fact that in the same scene, Sue is invisible to get past the guards, but soon after the other heroes who were with her were also able to move normally even without being invisible. All this to show Jessica Alba bra and panties and trying to provoke laughter with the embarrassing situation. Is also funny to see the justification for the emergence of the powers of Dr. Doom, he was also struck by cosmic radiation. Only the specific characters were the giant ship at the time of the accident, with no crew.<br/><br/>Quartet, Mr. Fantastic, even though the group leader and have a brilliant mind, is arguably the most boring character of all and uses her powers on very few occasions. Ioan Gruffudd is not a bad actor, but his character is only intended to cause a few laughs with his skills, contributing little to ""save the world"". Jessica Alba already has a role a little better and try to be responsible for the long drama in your scenes with Gruffudd, but the story is so simple, but the tension between them gets too dragged and bored. To stand out even if we have the beauty of Jessica Alba, who glued or clothes bra and panties on the bridge, and pleases the audience production. The protagonists, the best are the ""Thing"" Michael Chiklis, that appeals to your way threatening, but a good heart - already ""Human Torch"" Chris Evans is also very interesting. For being a womanizer, irresponsible and have an accurate census of humor, he is what most stands out like the fame acquired and see in this great chance to get more women and be admired. Beside the ""thing"", he stars good times during the plot. Already the villain Dr. Doom, played by Julian McMahon is entirely one-sided. Although it contains the main features of comics your character, such as excessive pride, being vain and a liar, traitor and ruthless - McMahon cannot provoke empathy and make the viewer feel involved and threatened.<br/><br/>Good even in this adaptation, one cannot but mention the makeup, especially the character ""The Thing"" that preserved the facial expressions help in the performance of the actor - and the special effects are excellent, whether filming mixing CGI with real scenarios, it is when dealing with particles: invisibility, fire, water, ice, etc.. Popcorn and a movie that entertains, this is fact. Perhaps at first appear not noticed any defects, and us more delighted with the effects, but on the film, eventually overcome the defects of the qualities. Fantastic Four is a movie for fun, and it will not be in the imagination of unforgettable films of superheroes."
"TheMovieDiorama","4","0","1","18 March 2020"," Fantastic Four is one cheesy foursome that rarely felt fantastic.
","The mid naughties was a gateway for superhero extravaganzas. 'Spider-Man 2' was a critical and commercial success. 'Batman Begins' revolutionised dark, gritty tones found in the sub-genre. Even 'The Incredibles' packed enough hearty familial fun to rise above Pixar's stratospheric bar for quality. Unfortunately though, several comic book intellectual properties, mostly those released by 20th Century Fox and based on Marvel superheroes, failed to meet this superlative standard. 'Daredevil' and its spin-off 'Elektra' are obvious candidates. However, the most disappointing production would have to be Story's mildly entertaining adaptation of 'Fantastic Four'.<br/><br/>A team of scientist astronauts whom become enveloped in a cosmic energy cloud, granting them temperamental yet special abilities. Reed ""Mister Fantastic"" Richards can stretch every limb. Ben ""The Thing"" Grimm whom has transformed into a rock golem. Susan ""Invisible Girl"" Storm can turn, well, invisible and generate forcefields. Then there's her hot-headed brother, Johnny ""Human Torch"" Storm, whom can generate fire and turn into a fireball. All garnering unique superpowers, yet hosting the most inexplicably dull personalities available. Bolstered by a screenplay that pretends to care for its source material by shoving as many references down the viewer's throat as possible, Fantastic Four can only be surmised as soulless. A featureless franchise set-up.<br/><br/>Story's direction, or in this case mis-direction, is brimming with the correct ingredients. Origin stories adapted with surprising accuracy, aside from Grimm whose partner leaves him due to his new boulder-like aesthetic. Superficially inadequate, let's be honest. Victor von ""Doctor"" Doom has decent development, until the inevitable third act where he is likened to an expendable piece of metal with his underdeveloped plan for vengeance foiled in just over three minutes of battling. Chiklis' enduring makeup to realistically present The Thing is well-executed. Yet, much like any team ever in existence, the characters need to mesh their personalities together to produce works of art. That's where the film falters, majorly.<br/><br/>Story and his cast of superheroes never became one family. The distinct lack of chemistry between each protagonist was abundantly clear, with forced lines of comic book humour attempting to disguise the absent management. Reeds and Susan Storm in particular presented zero dynamic chemistry, and therefore made the entire aura of unity crumble quicker than The Thing's hopes of resembling a normal human being again. Gruffudd lacked any sense of command, solely focusing on his intellectual capacity. McMahon as the antagonistic Doctor Doom rarely exuded menace, and really did not suit the iconic costume that was randomly worn by him. However, and this was inevitable, the biggest contributor to the feature's weakness is Jessica Alba. She just cannot act. At all! Every single line of dialogue was delivered with a undertone of confusion, it was as if she had just woken up from a ten year coma. Where's the sparkling romance with Gruffudd? Where's the commitment to the cumbersome script? She might ""look"" the part, but damn she cannot act.<br/><br/>The visual effects were hit and miss, mostly miss with Stretch Armstrong doing his plasticised rubber thing. The plot is powered by inconsistent pacing. And the only captivating individual was Washington as Alicia Masters, yet t'was all too brief and made little to no impact.<br/><br/>The potential was there. Shells of characters, plot points and comic relief resides within the tedious dialogue. Unfortunately though, Story just did not know where to take this story. Personalities were buried, acting was sub-par and Story settled for dated visual effects over a compelling narrative. As mentioned previously, Fantastic Four was a soulless experience that failed to meet the rising standards within the sub-genre. ""Flame on""? Flame off more like..."

There isn't much action or excitement in it until the last half hour or so. While I appreciate that they took time to show the main characters getting used to their powers (unlike the 2015 reboot), the film at times felt less like a superhero movie and more like a sitcom. It didn't have much of superheroes being superheroes, in short.<br/><br/>The climax at the end was decent but nothing too spectacular, and the humorous scenes are hit-or-miss. The special effects are pretty good, though, and I really like the soundtrack.<br/><br/>This isn't one of the best superhero movies out there or one of the worst. It's just very middle-of-the-road.

","At least it is better than the reboot.<br/><br/>Mr. Fantastic is distant like he is in the source material, but not as distasteful. You sort of get the impression that he's kind of a cold-hearted jerk in the comics, refusing to help people and pushing them to make deals with Doom because he doesn't see the time sacrifice as a benefit to himself and his research.<br/><br/>In the movie, he's a lot nicer.<br/><br/>Susan Storm, well, she's kind of just eye-candy in the movie isn't she? An excuse to see Jessica Alba almost naked and because of that, they lacked any real development for her. It hurt the film.<br/><br/>Johnny and Ben are by far the best and truest to the comics, but then they are also the most entertaining, the saviors of what would otherwise be a very boring film.<br/><br/>Sure it was an introduction, but one that was overly bland with only small parts that were really entertaining."

","I have never been a big fan of the fantastic four in the comics or as characters so this film was already behind before it began with me but I still gave it a chance and oh my did it suck. The story starts with broke scientist Reed Richards proposing to his old friend/enemy Victor Von Doom an experiment in space that could help cure disease. Along with Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm they go into space and after an accident they all return with there own unique abilities. Now the main two that are focused on is Reed and Sue and there past and present relationships, the guy they got to play Reed is terrible and really lacks the acting chops to play a character like this. Also even though Jessica Alba is beautiful she is not a very good actress and she fails to deliver a good performance as Sue. The side characters are a mixed bag I actually thought Chris Evans performance as Johnny Storm was good and he was easily the best character of the film. I also thought the guy they got to play Ben was good and he managed to make you feel for him in his situation. But one of my favourite villains in marvel is DR Doom but he is not well done hear in fact it is pretty poor with his motivation and real presence in the film not really mattering and taking a real back seat to the Fantastic four. Another side character you meet briefly is a blind woman that is meant to be trying to help ben get through life but it is just so hard to buy as you only see her like 2 or 3 times. The story takes bad tropes from past comic book films that did it much better and it just is nonsense half of the time and peoples motivations are not really well enough explained. The script is also trash and I later found out that Chris Evans made up a lot of his lines which makes sense as he is really the only one who has any decent lines in the whole film. The style being the fantastic four you would think would be great but it isn't I mean the Human Torch looks cool and heck even Doom looks cool when he becomes Dr Doom but the others looks silly and the whole cinematography is just off. So overall avoid this film and look forward to the new reboot that is coming."

","Not THE Fantastic Four oh no...its simply Fantastic Four here, much cooler. So this is the first major production for the Four after the now cult Roger Corman B-movie effort. Team of clever people head out into space and get hit in the face by an interstellar cloud of space stuff and obtain super powers. Naturally one of them becomes twisted and evil with his new found powers and much fighting ensues, that's it, that's all there is.<br/><br/>Thing with this film is everything moves so fast at first. One minute the Four are discussing this space cloud, next they're discussing it with Von Doom, then they're all up in space in this space station, then they get hit by the space cloud and then just as quickly they're all back on Earth. The beginning feels so rushed so they can get to the fun stuff and silly special effects, and boy is there plenty of that. Most of this film really feels like a setup for the inevitable sequel, half the film is basically the team getting to grips with their powers and messing around.<br/><br/>Its all a rip off if you ask me, most of the time we only get to see Grimm and Johnny arguing bickering and pranking each other, whilst Reed tries to study their new powers. Alba as Sue Storm does literately nothing accept for flirt with Reed, regurgitate her new nudity/invisibility issue and look absolutely ridiculous with her fake blue contacts and fake blonde hair, she looks like a mutant from the X- Men. The real killer is the fact we don't actually see Doctor Doom anywhere until right at the very end! This film has no villain! its true, the first superhero flick I've seen with no actual antagonist. Then when we do finally get some Doom action its a blink and you'll miss it scenario plus it never feels like Doctor Doom, just the actor McMahon in a plastic mask (what's with the eyebrow makeup on that guy?).<br/><br/>The sole bit of action for the most part is a highway pile up on the Brooklyn Bridge which gives the team a chance to flex their new skills in complete CGI glory. I can't really moan about the CGI because its obvious from the outset that the film was gonna be heavy on it, but this doesn't entirely excuse how bad it looks. The only character that looks reasonable is the Human Torch, Mr Fantastic looks anything but fantastic...but his CGI effects sure do look plastic. The Invisible Woman just comes across as bland and completely uninteresting whilst The Thing is so very clearly a stretchy suit. I think its hard to translate this team onto the big screen though in all fairness, they have a more childish vibe about them, their outfits are hard to update...and basically they're just dull all round.<br/><br/>There is a very comical light-hearted feel to the film that borders on infantile at times. Now I can't say that's a bad thing because the film does adapt the comicbook atmosphere very well, what else would you expect with characters like this? But at times the film is just embarrassing to watch, there is some really cheesy ultra hammy dialog and gags, dumb visual gags...dare I say pratfall stuff and loads of quickfire quips and one liners. I mean yeah Johnny Storm is suppose to be a good looking cocky mouthy young astronaut but some of his scenes with The Thing are simply excruciating to watch. Does he really need to shout out 'flame on!' to turn into the Human Torch?<br/><br/>The whole film looks bad and highly fake, not much better than a TV series...hell the Roger Corman movie isn't far behind really. The performances are weak, there is no bad guy and virtually 90% of the film is about nothing more than origins and tomfoolery, literately padding for the sequel in a crafty money milking operation. On one hand they do admittedly capture the spirit of the comicbook genre with this guff but on the other hand it really is a typically terrible sanitised sterile Hollywood production.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Well, it's fantastic enough, I mean, the script writing, the plot points, the story details and development are rather weak in Fantastic Four which makes the adventures of Fantastic Four in this movie a little cheesy, but it's so much fun and entertaining that you can forget about it and really love it! The characters and special effects and action is most of the show in Fantastic Four. I love how the superheroes combine their superpowers to use them together. That's what makes the Fantastic Four so fantastic!<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is played fantastically by 4 fantastic stars! Ioan Gruffudd is Mr. Fantastic aka Dr. Reeds Richards. Gruffudd is excellent in his lead supplying the most personally intriguing character. Jessica Alba is The Invisible Woman aka Sue Storm. Jessica is great in this film and I wouldn't replace her if I could but I don't think she resembles a good Sue Storm. Alba is almost too good looking for the part, she is, and I don't know if I bought her and Gruffudd as a compatible couple, but I'm jealous, so. I don't think she was the best to be The Invisible Woman but I loved her in this movie anyways and she is my main attraction to the film. Chris Evans is The Human Torch aka Johnny Storm. Chris Evans does great as the brash and cocky Johnny and Chris is even hotter than a super nova! Check him out, no, no wait, what I mean to say is Jessica Alba is hotter than a supernova. Check her out. Yeah, that's it. She is. He is, too. You can see Chris Evans emerging into a can't miss star. Michael Chiklis is The Thing aka Ben Grimm. Chiklis at the time is peaking in his acting career and let's be thankful he landed this part because he's really good as The Thing and Chiklis only makes the movie better. Jilian McMahon is Dr. Doom aka Victor von Doom and McMahon very solidly plays one believable arch villain.<br/><br/>I really love the superheroes that makeup The Fantastic Four. I love how each member standing alone possesses their own invulnerability. The super elastic Mr. Fantastic cannot be crushed or clutched or critically harmed with conventional hand-to-hand combat. The Invisible Woman can go invisible, go figure, and she is also able to create a energy force field around herself or anything else for protection. The Human Torch has the ability to 'Flame on!' turning himself into a blazing fireball impervious to extreme heat. And The Thing is a strong guy with super human strength and an impenetrable rock-solid body. You can drop any one of the Fantastic Four into any dangerous situation and they will fair okay, but together as a team, The Fantastic Four is unstoppable!<br/><br/>Thank you, filmmakers for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing, but most of all, thank you, Stan Lee. I can't begin to thank you enough, Mr. Stan Lee, so just for starters, I thank you for The Fantastic Four. They're fantastic!"

","This is one of those movies where you can tell that all they needed was just one more draft of the screenplay written to get it right. If they had done this, I definitely think this film could be deserving of a 7/10, but as it is, it's a 5/10.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the odds are so uneven, we have four heroes, but only one villain. Hardly fair. Another villain should've been included to even out the odds a little, or perhaps just give Dr. Doom an arsenal of robots that he could use to combat the Fantastic Four. Granted, Doom probably is the most powerful character in the film, but four slightly less powerful beings fighting against him still makes it seem an overly one-sided match.<br/><br/>The second problem is the execution of the comedy. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love a sense of humor in superhero films, and I don't care for hyper-serious ones with no self-awareness, superhero films of which type have been getting more prominent over the past few years. But the issue in Fantastic Four is that so much of the comedy is just done poorly, all this bad humor culminating in a horrific montage.<br/><br/>The film definitely has positive qualities, all the characters are very well-cast, especially Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. The visual effects are also a treat, the uses of each character's superpower is very well-done and the sequence in space where the characters gain their abilities is very cool.<br/><br/>Overall, mediocre. Not terrible, but not good either. The sequel was definitely better."
"Lott444","1","0","4","8 January 2014"," What a shame...
","It's been many years since I have seen this movie so I found myself watching it again just to see how I felt about it now that I am a little older.<br/><br/>The heroes seem to do things which make no sense in their reality and complete sense in the reality of the writers. If I know the writer was working for a specific effect or purpose in a scene it's like seeing the strings on a puppet - it loses you and you find yourself out of the story and thinking about the writer/story teller.<br/><br/>There is an incident in public which requires the team's action. A huge crowd has gathered and is blocking the team from getting there. Reed tells Sue to turn invisible, take her clothes off and get to the front of the crowd. She does so and slips in and out of invisibility unintentionally, with people watching mind you, and she is embarrassed when people in public see her in her underwear. Eventually, her powers work properly and she starts pushing her way through the crowd. When she gets to the front of the crowd the rest of the team is there.<br/><br/>Now think about this: how does this make any sense in their reality? The situation is the team is faced with an immovable obstacle and somehow the solution is to have Sue become invisible? Replace the crowd of people with a brick wall or a door. Does invisibility help get through? In the end she has to shove and push her way through so why did she need to strip naked and turn invisible? Of course, it was because Sue is played by Jessica Alba and the writers wanted a scene where their sexy lead female actress titillates the male demographic and provides a humorous scene at the same time. I knew it and I am willing to bet many others knew it instantly, too. The motivations of the writers was so transparent (no pun intended) that it took me out of the movie and I sighed in embarrassment, just like Sue.<br/><br/>Most of the actors were terrible in their roles. Particularly bad were Jessica Alba and the guy who plays Dr. Doom (I don't care enough about him to look up his name). Jessica Alba is beautiful and talented at modeling but she's not believable as a genius scientist. She was put there to appeal to teenage boys. What will Hollywood do next? Cast John Cusack as Richard Nixon? hahahaha-- oh....<br/><br/>I will say Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans played their roles very well and were the only real likable characters to be seen here. There was some bad dialogue but that's more the writers' fault than theirs.<br/><br/>Filling out the cast are some very cheesy actors in supporting cookie-cutter roles like the evil corporate board members. Or the cops and rabid fans who love the Fantastic Four immediately and give them the reception not seen since the parade given to Buzz and Neil Armstrong after returning from the moon landing.<br/><br/>Nothing really happened besides the team getting their powers and arguing. They spend the whole movie bickering and only really work as a team once and even then it's kind of small potatoes.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba strips naked again. That makes it twice in this movie.<br/><br/>There is inconsistent logic all over. When the team is seen in public for the first time they are instantly popular - like Beatles popular and they hadn't done anything huge like save the world. Yet when Doom's transformation is evaluated by a medical doctor, the doctor insists on contacting the CDC to make sure his powers aren't contagious or deadly. Where was this concern upon the public seeing a giant rock man, a man who can ignite himself, a woman who can turn invisible or a stretchy dude? Aren't these just as potentially infectious? Why didn't any other person in the entire world show any concern about people with the powers of gods walking among them and why didn't the U.S. government immediately start asking the same kinds of questions the medical doctor asked? <br/><br/>Oh, Jessica Alba naked again and uses her invisibility to hide in another comical scene. Three times...<br/><br/>Hey, this movie is making me hungry. I feel like eating. Maybe I will have a Whopper from Burger King, or Lunchables washed down with some Dos Equis and Pepsi and play the Fantastic Four movie game on an Xbox I bought from Wal Mart.<br/><br/>Oh, back to the movie. I find it hard to believe these people are friends, let alone the first family of heroes. Despite decades of friendship and teamwork, the two best friends in the movie are put at odds faster than rival moms at a Black Friday Forever 21 sale.<br/><br/>Doom was changed from a villain with a complex moral code to a one dimensional unethical corporate CEO of a company which sells... something? He gets muscled out of his company despite the fact that the FF is insanely popular for some reason. The popularity of the team SHOULD translate to new investors on that alone... but that is never considered by the writers who want motivation for Doom to hate Reed.<br/><br/>We don't need another corporate CEO driven mad by his new powers and on the hunt for revenge. We already had that with Norman Osborn in Spider-Man and again in Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 (replace CEO with scientist).<br/><br/>I'd watch through the end credits to see if there is a fourth scene of Sue accidentally being naked but I'm losing interest fast."

They gain superpowers but not all of them are happy with all the changes.<br/><br/>The movie starts too slowly. For an action superhero movie, this really needed to start out right at the space station. There's no time to waste on too much unnecessary setup. The action needs to start as soon as possible. The fact is the whole movie is one big introduction. The group dynamic hasn't been set yet. The constant fighting between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm still isn't something between old buddies.

They tried to provide comedy, action, fantasy, science fiction. From my view their attempt is in vein completely. Tried to fix up the dialogues but acting spoiled them. Director tried to show some romance like other science fiction superhero film, I must admit one worst romance and boring dialogues I experienced.

"stephen7272","6","0","2","11 April 2013"," Pleasant but not satisfying
","The problem with the existing Fantastic Four movies is that they follow the comic books too closely. As a result there are very few surprises. The biggest surprise is the employment of Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, turning this character into a sexually enticing superhero; resorting to near nakedness in at least one scene. As a result it has a slight whiff of the Carry On's about it. It could be Barbara Windsor playing the part of a cockney Sue Storm. <br/><br/>Julian McMahon makes an admirable attempt at playing Victor Von Doom, particularly in the use of his vocal range and hand movements. He could easily be mistaken for a sinister version of Captain Von Trapp in the Sound Of Music.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd excels theatrically as the socially inhibited Reed Richards. But lets face it, we watch the Fantastic Four to see The Thing. And Michael Chiklis has the most memorable moment in the movie as The Thing when he is tricked by the motives of a humble pigeon on Brooklyn Bridge.<br/><br/>Chris Evans turn out to be the traitor among the cast, ditching his ""Flame On"" repertoire for a new Star Spangled uniform as Cpt. America.<br/><br/>Worth watching but really it's just an introduction to the characters."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","3","19 December 2012"," Disappointing superhero bore
","This movie is one of the prime examples of how not to make a superhero movie. This was one of the first modern age films based on comic book superheroes, especially the ones from the Marvel universe. But let's look at the films that came before this one. Blade films had featured a dark, Gothic style and intense, bloody action scenes with a troubled antihero as the protagonist. The X-Men films were more colourful and suited for younger audiences, but even they dealt with topics such as discrimination and the dangers of having supernatural powers at your disposal. Did Fantastic Four try to replicate these feats? No, instead it tried to be as kid-friendly as possible. Because of this the action scenes have no power behind them, the characters are about as black and white as they come and the whole film is awash with bright colours and shiny gizmos.<br/><br/>Not that there's anything wrong with making a kid-friendly action/adventure film, but even such a film needs to have decent characters and a good storyline. Kids aren't stupid and they deserve better stories than this. And I even think that the story isn't the biggest problem here, even though it ends up being nothing more than a grudge fight between to egoistical scientists. Rather the characters and their actors are at fault here. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is a boring genius with no backbone. Susan Strom (Jessica Alba) looks amazing, but has no real characteristics, ending up being just the token chick of the group. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) is a clichéd whiner. And lastly Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon) is one those stereotypical ""must get back at my school rival, even though I'm one of the most powerful and richest men in the world and he's just a failed patent inventor"" type of guys. The only character that might be called a good one is Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), perhaps because he actually faces a real personal dilemma, his problems have strength and soul behind them, thus making him sympathetic and relatable.<br/><br/>And as stated, the story isn't anything special either. It amounts to nothing more than a petty rivalry between von Doom and Richards, which isn't all that exciting really, because there are no stages at play. Nothing substantial is threatened and because most of the protagonist are so boring, you don't really care whether they triumph or not. Sometimes in these cases a good villain might make the movie entertaining - rooting for the Galactic Empire and all that - but in this case that doesn't apply either.<br/><br/>The film has some saving graces. Ben Grimm is surprisingly good character, as stated, and I actually liked the little subplot dealing with his love life as well. Plus the action, while pretty meaningless, is at least enjoyable to watch visually and the special effects in general aren't half bad, even by today's standards. They look fake nowadays, but in this regard the bright comic book style actually works for the movie's favour.<br/><br/>So, my final verdict is that this is a pretty weak superhero film. It made some pretty lazy decisions in regards to the storyline and the visual style, plus its characters are not all that interesting. But it's bright and pretty and you might enjoy it if you're looking to turn off your brain and relax for an hour or two. It's not the worst superhero film I've ever seen, but it's way below average and I wouldn't recommend it."
"ARTaylor","6","0","2","18 May 2011"," Plays it Safe, Becomes Lackluster
","Fantastic Four was certainly not the best, but neither was it the worst comic book adaptation. I was mostly underwhelmed by it. I'll sit through it, but I won't go out of my way to see it. I ended up with a lackluster ""meh"" feeling.<br/><br/>It came out when comic books were just getting started and didn't do anything to stand out from the crowd. It came out after Spider-Man, X-Men, Blade, Hulk, Daredevil, and Punisher, all of which were origins. Rather than do anything different, it just followed the established and already well-worn origin format. It was practically following the same exact beats and scenes as Spider-Man and Hulk. There was nothing about it to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>As said, the casting is hit and miss. Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans are terrific, almost perfectly cast. They are exactly as I imagine when I read the comics. If they did a reboot, I would greatly appreciate if those two returned. Ioan Gruffudd is mostly uninteresting. He doesn't do anything interesting. He does have Reed's bumbling social awkwardness, but not the intelligence. Jessica Alba was terrible casting, merely there for a ""big"" name in the credits. I assume that when people said ""big name"" the producers heard ""bra size."" She is absolutely nothing like the comic version. And they just threw in scenes to show off her body without much reason, like the bridge rescue.<br/><br/>And they completely missed what makes Doctor Doom so great. He's one of comic book's greatest villains. Here, he's nothing. First, they made the mistake of going with his Ultimate version rather than the far more interesting main universe. Then, he does nothing for most of the movie except hate everyone else. Julian McMahon tries hard, but he isn't given much to work with.<br/><br/>The special effects were good. Mister Fantastic and Human Torch looked cool. Though it isn't too hard to make a woman invisible. I absolutely loved that they did Thing in practical make up since it looks so much more realistic than anything they could do digitally. And it wasn't just some crappy TMNT-copycat.<br/><br/>Considering that there are four superheroes, there's surprisingly little action. There's the space station disaster, the rescue on the bridge, and the end battle. It's mostly technical jargon from people reading a script, with none giving the impression they know what it means. And the action just doesn't give the time necessary to build up anticipation and make people care about what's going on. It's okay for what it is, but too many other movies have done it better.<br/><br/>It's an okay, middle of the road movie, neither terrible nor terrific. It played it safe to make money for the studio and didn't excite anyone. I did think that the second movie improved on a lot of aspects. But I am no where near sad that they decided not to make a third in this series."

","Not having read the comics this is based on I can't say how well the story compares or if the actors portraying the characters were similar enough their comic counterparts. The first part of the film showed us how the four heroes and their adversary gained their superpowers, it does this reasonably well unfortunately it doesn't give us any real insight in to their characters.<br/><br/>Of the five main characters only Michael Chiklis's ""The Thing"" inspired any interest perhaps because he was the only actor who didn't look like he was hired for his good looks. The other characters were fairly forgettable; Ioan Gruffudd's Mr Fantastic didn't live up to his name, I was far more impressed with him on TV's ""Hornblower"" series than here, Jessica Alba who has been good in other things seemed to be there solely to appeal adolescent male viewers but it takes more than looking good in her undies to make the character interesting, Chris Evan's character the Human Torch was just annoying, he acted more like a twelve year old attention seeker than an astronaut and finally Julian McMahon's Doom is never going to be remembered as one of the great, or even good, super villains.<br/><br/>The four heroes of the film seems to spend more time arguing with each other than doing anything interesting which seemed more annoying than entertaining and when they do something it is hardly world saving; just saving a few people after an accident which was caused by one of the four anyway, likewise Doom doesn't do anything world threatening, he merely kills a banker then goes after the four heroes.<br/><br/>I'd only recommend this if you have to see all super hero films or want something that isn't too scary for the children... although if I was picking a super hero film for youngsters I'd pick ""The Incredibles"" as that had far better characters who seemed much more human even though it isn't live action."
"griffin84","3","0","1","18 June 2009"," Special Effects and One Hot Chick, a Movie Does Not Make.
","In the early 2000s, comic books entered into a new Renaissance in film. Sony gave us 'Spiderman', 20th Century Fox made 'X-Men', and every studio in Hollywood immediately started grabbing up every single superhero story they could get their hands on. So it was only a matter of time before Fox decided to bring Marvel's first family to the big screen: The Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>So here's what the studio does: first of all, make sure that the budget can give them realistic-looking superpowers (actually, that's the one thing the movie does right). As far as the script goes well, they apparently only had enough money for the special effects. The humor is forced, the science is hokey, most of the dialog in the movie is delivered via bickering, and quite frankly, it seems like there are more plot holes than actual plot points! <br/><br/>The characters are lacking serious development, and it's obvious that this movie suffered from some serious poor choices in casting. I know that the studio obviously thought casting Jessica Alba would bring in more revenue (once they stopped drooling over her in the blue jumpsuit), but doing so brings the iconic character of Sue Storm down to nothing but eye candy. <br/><br/>In the comics, Johnny Storm was a fun-loving teenager, and frankly, the corny one-liners and immature whining that the script gives us may actually have made more sense had they actually cast someone a big younger than Chris Evans, who is not only way too old for the part but also looks older than Alba. Actually, scratch that: no actor could have pulled off the lousy writing they gave this character. <br/><br/>Julian McMahon isn't the worst choice to play a comic book villain, but there is no transition from scummy business tycoon to actual psychopath. When does he suddenly decide that he's capable of murder? <br/><br/>The pacing in the film is all over the place. It seems like the directors wanted to get to the action sequences as quickly as possible but the action is incredibly lacking. The final battle with Doom is over way too quickly. In fact, there's a few scenes where Johnny (sans fire) performs a number of stunts that actually seem more hyped up and better shot than the big finale! <br/><br/>On a side note, the Extended Cut gives us a little more dimension to the characters (especially Ben's relationship with Alicia), although the editors should be shot for throwing in their little tribute to Wolverine (I won't spoil it, but it's nauseating). <br/><br/>As we all know, Marvel started its own studio to get better control of the movies they release, which has proved more than effective with 'Iron Man' and 'The Incredible Hulk'. Let us all hope that after they finish with their current line-up, they decide to go back and fix this monstrosity. 'The Fantastic Four' was one of Marvel's greatest creations and the characters deserve better than this."

","I'm not going to give it a completely craptastic rating since I've never read the F4 comics as a kid or whenever, but this movie was just bad in so many different ways. In an era of superhero films where we see them taking on a usually childish genre with incredible, mature, and serious finesse (case in point, the X-Men series), we expect there to be some kind of obvious change from the nonsense we've seen before.<br/><br/>F4 has no such pretensions. It's blatantly obvious about the transition from ""dude"" to ""superhero"", even making such pithy statements as ""we need a team vehicle"" and ""let's sell our own marketing brand!"" *SNORE* Yes, that's exactly what we need to see, a marketing ad in a film that's poorly disguised as self-mockery. Never mind a good story or a good premise for a film, let's turn this into the ""round of laughs"" nonsense.<br/><br/>As for the premise of the story, well, I'm not really quite sure what it's supposed to be. First we have the origin story... okay... I'll give them that, even though they've royally screwed with Dr. Doom's origin story and source of his powers. Then we have some weird interlude where they figure out how to use their powers, then save a bunch of people from a pointless, random pileup on a bridge. Then, taking the nonsense further, this is where they try to go into the ""marketing scheme"", with the characters discussing logos, action figures, etc and a dull side story about The Thing and his quest to get back to his older self. Too bad it's about as well executed as watching a rock sit on a bench.<br/><br/>They manage to shoehorn the Thing's classic line (""It's clobberin' time!"") without it really making sense, and Johnny Storm's character is about as poorly acted as a plank of wood. The only redeeming thing about this film is watching Jessica Alba for the eye candy, because as far as acting talent goes, she has none. Don't bother renting or watching this movie."

","I know very little about the Fantastic Four. Basically what I know is their powers and how they got them and that they have one of the most interesting main villains in their hands, Dr. Doom. But that's about it, as I never did find their comics very appealing.<br/><br/>Considering what I've heard about this movie I was expecting a total catastrophe, but it really wasn't. It was just rather mediocre in every level, not terrible, but not really that great either. The plot didn't have any real sense of excitement and even when the groups powers were revealed to the public the instant acceptation they got was just weird little moment with no question or ifs. They were just embraced instantly.<br/><br/>Other flaw that springs in my mind about the logic of the story is the rather peculiar logic of things. Like in the scene in which Human Torch first time lights up. The end of that scene really doesn't make much sense in any level.<br/><br/>There are some things that work pretty well. The jokes are well timed and I chuckled out loud in a couple of occasions and just as I expected, the Thing/Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) turned out to be my favorite character.<br/><br/>All in all, in comparison to the best Marvel films out there, Spider-man franchise, Fantastic Four is pretty half baked effort."

","Aimed strictly at the kiddie set, FF tells how four astronauts are molecularly altered by cosmic rays, resulting in such powers as the ability to stretch (Reed Richards), turn invisible and manipulate the very air (Invisible Girl), become a flaming, flying freak (Human Torch) and grow orange rhino skin and be able to move mountains (Thing). This first movie spends time developing each character as he or she starts to adjust to the new powers. They also take on Doctor Doom, a metallic-masked villain who can do some really nasty stuff with the flick of a wrist, like boring a hole through the middle of someone. Most of the FF's off time is spent kibitzing with each other. The humor is broad and aimed squarely at the pre-teen crowd, the exact opposite of X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN. The movie is clunky at best and could have used more action. And the gal playing Invisible Girl seemed oddly cast to me. I would have preferred a more polished actress like Rachael McAdams or even Kirtsen Dunst. But then again, they didn't make this movie for an adult male with three grown children. Maybe the kiddies loved her in this role."

","This is a good example on how NOT to do make a comic-book conversation. It is poor written, has some poor casting, moves to far away from the comics and is at best described as so-so.<br/><br/>The basic plot of the film is that it shows the origins of the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom. The film shows Reed Richards and Ben Grimm looking for funding and assistance in research to conduct research in cosmic rays and go to Richards old university friend Victor von Doom. He agrees and goes with them into space to his own space station with his girlfriend Sue Storm and her brother Johnny. After exposer to the cosmic rays all five of them gain superpowers. The Fantastic Four become famous in America and set out to be superheroes, whilst Doctor Doom's company starts to crumble and he looks for revenge against the group.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four is a bit harder to make they some other superheroes from Marvel, it can't be made to be like X-Men and it doesn't have the emotional depth of Spiderman. It tries to be a light kids film, but ignores the fact that Doctor Doom can be sadistic and that he is a tyrant. The casting for the film was worst, Jessica Alba was too young to play Sue Storm, Ioan Gruffudd isn't a good actor, Julian McMahon is too pretty and not sinister enough to Doctor Doom and Michael Chiklis is not good looking enough to be Ben Grimm (but he was decent as the thing). The film didn't have a good plot, it was too predictable and just not exciting. It was hard to care for any of the characters. It didn't have the impact like other superhero films. The movie is also disloyal to the comics, Doctor Doom was the ruler of his home country, not an industrialist. Doctor Doom was also around before the Fantastic Four were around and it was Reed Richards who he blamed for it.<br/><br/>The film basically goes nowhere fast."

","My Take: Lives and breathes in special effects. It only ends up silly and tiresomely forgettable. <br/><br/>Like all summer movie throwaways, it's best if you don't expect anything brilliant in FANTASTIC FOUR, a big-screen romp of the famous Marvel creations by Stan Lee. It is what it is, a big-budget comic book of a movie, complete with busy special effects and... well special effects. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but even so, FANTASTIC FOUR is a style-over-substance action picture. A big dumb summer movie that does its job, but that ain't worth remembering for. Once the credits rolled, there's hardly anything to remember in this lively but predictably forgettable summer movie of the generic order.<br/><br/>The characters are, unlike those in other superhero movies like BATMAN and SUPERMAN, have no back story other than they are superheroes. Hence, these ""supers"" aren't interesting to the least. They're just a bunch of special effects creations with no heart, or even soul. Even if they are played by real actors like Ioan Gruffud (Mr. Fantastic), Jessica Alba (The Invisible Woman), Michael Chiklis (The Thing) and Chris Evans (The Human Torch, the most annoying of the batch), they never really shine as humans and more of special effects creations.<br/><br/>Firstly, they hardly have an origin. Sure, it is briefly explained that they were victims of an unknown space cloud, but then what? When they become super, they save a couple of people, but not enough to outnumber how many times they act like a couple of celebrities at Tinsel Town. A real superhero wouldn't do that. No, a real superhero is very secure about his personalities. These guys don't seem to have some either. When I'm in a middle of a crisis, I'd like a hero that doesn't come with paparazzi.<br/><br/>Besides the special effects which were actually good, everything else is bad. The acting is mediocre, with Alba being the weakest and Evans being the most annoying (could you get a more annoying superhero?). The script baffles the worst lines of that summer (what do you expect from this thing?). If special effects will make your time, FANTASTIC FOUR might too. If you ask me, I forgot most of it until I saw it again. This ain't the kind of movie I'd watch more than once or twice.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of 5."
"RichardKleiner","5","0","1","10 May 2008"," A tragedy!
","In the wake of recent Marvel comics adaptations, this one was waited for fans for a long time and just ended up in the dump.<br/><br/>Since it's an origin story, there should be some character development prior the ""super accident"" that makes the hero super, and why not some after it. The problem is that in this movie, there was too much development. And it wouldn't be any problem if there was some five or six action sequences to balance. But, there's only two, yes, TWO action sequences, and they fall short.<br/><br/>The effects were rather average, but the most incredible disappointment was The Thing. It's almost unbelievable that in 2005, what, ten years or more after Jurassic Park, they would still use prosthetic make up for such a character as The Thing. Even worse, considering the fact that ""Hulk"" which included a far more awesome and properly animated CGI character (although the movie sucked too) was made before Fantastic 4.<br/><br/>The performances were good coming from Ioan Groaffurd (or whatever way it is spelled), as he is British, and British actors are good from birth. The rest, while having their almighty star power, don't live up to any of the Fantastic 4. The guy from Nip/Tuck couldn't manage how cool yet dreadful Doctor Doom really is, his transformation was too slow, and had to show his stupid face for an hour and a half with only wearing the classic metallic mask and his emblematic green hood just at the end, when he's beaten. But we don't want to see the guy from Nip/Tuck. We want Dr. Doom! Chris Evans as the Human Torch may be the only one who did portray his character's personality well, but that's because he's like all the characters he has played before. As for The Thing's personal story, it just went on for too long and too tragic to be enjoyable or interesting. When Chiklis is in his normal appearance, he can sort of act properly, but when he is The Thing, he looks awkward and not dramatic. It's impossible to feel sorry for him. And with Alba, it's more than obvious that whatever talent she has, it's not acting, but just to have a ""nice"" body (she is pretty, though).<br/><br/>John Ottman, while making an uplifting and spectacular end credits suite, hasn't made any part of his score worth remembering. There's nothing to discuss.<br/><br/>Some of the humor I liked (""Little Buttons!""), but it wasn't enough. And it is kinda tragic to see such an awful treatment for one of the beloved classic superheroes in old comics and 90's TV, specially when both Spider Man and X-Men were both so respectfully and masterfully treated.<br/><br/>It's family friendly, so if you see it with your kids it'll be a delight. But don't expect the same experience as you would have with watching the above mentioned superhero movies (and it's first respective sequels).<br/><br/>If you could have your list of the worst Superheroe movies, this one could easily be on the top 5.<br/><br/>I'm sad for trashing it, because I know the movie came with good intentions."

","I have always loved the Marvel Universe; from the heroes, villains, face offs, and the intriguing story lines. And since they started really making these titles into major motion pictures I have been excited every time I hear of a new one taking off. There have been some true success stories including: Spider-man, Blade, and now Iron Man. And an equal amount of flops: Daredevil, Elektra, The Hulk. So I would have to say that this is without a doubt one of the more disappointing set of heroes to be brought to the silver screen.<br/><br/>At first glance, it does look bad. With Jessica Alba, and Julian McMahon alone this could be flushed on instinct. Dr. Doom can be considered one of the primary villains in all of the Marvel Universe, yet he is undeniably destroyed by the appalling performance of Julian McMahon. Really this isn't McMahon's fault. He was poorly casted as Dr. Doom, and can't really do much since he is a poor actor to begin with. Jessica Alba is arguably the worst actress in Hollywood right now. If you want to debate that, I point to her work in Honey, Into the Blue, and Good Luck Chuck.<br/><br/>The directing, costuming, and set design also make this film such a travesty to the source material and the people who really enjoy it. There are two main reasons that this was successful though. Its aimed at kids, and the general public can enjoy it. This is why they shot it the way it was done. So they could make the most profit without solid actors, a good script, or well known director. Because Tim Story's track record of Taxi and Barbershop don't exactly put him first in my mind for Comic Book action franchise director.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Four is pretty bad. All the characters are shallow and weak. The story is cliché and below average for even this subject matter. But if you have no prior knowledge to the material and are simply looking for a decent laugh and a little action this might be a good movie for you.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"

I suppose it was Doom who done it for me, being one of the coolest villains of all time.<br/><br/>However, I can't say I felt the same way about the film, as it was about as exciting as an old man walking a tortoise.<br/><br/>The majority of the film spent building up to a 10 minute climax. The fantastic our spend the whole time establishing their powers, until they finally use them in an unspectacular ending. The same amount of time is spent building up doom, who when eventually identified, turns out to share none of the charisma of the original comic book Doom. What I found even more disappointing was the American accent he spoke with (despite being Latvian).<br/><br/>Johnny was the least likable person ever, and I hated reed Richards. All I wanted to see was doom kill them, but when he was revealed I didn't want either of them to win!<br/><br/>Every disaster prevented by the four, was also created by them, cancelling out their heroism. It was a it like breaking a chair and then fixing it.<br/><br/>In terms of production, the film wasn't too good either. Everything looked very artificial, as if the entire film was encased in plastic. It had a huge over use of CGI, and visually seemed quite bland.<br/><br/>I would have rated it lower had it not been for it's marvel comic book character content.

","Even though this wasn't a real high quality movie, it was still one I enjoyed watching, despite the fact that it was lacking some fundamental needs for a good superhero/comic book movie.<br/><br/>""Fantastic Four"" makes several mistakes. One is that it takes itself a bit too serious, which goes at the expense of the fun of the movie. It still entertains but it isn't halve the entertainment this movie potentially could had been. It also picks a too serious approach of being a superhero. The characters are all struggling with their powers and personal emotions but in this case we just couldn't care less for it. When you have a concept of having an human torch, an invisible girl, a rubber-man and a big massive thing, a serious and more emotional approach just doesn't work out.<br/><br/>But another real problem with this movie is its story. It's a terribly underwritten story in which basically very little interesting ever happens. At least not enough. You should expect some more fireworks from a superhero movie, especially from one with a main concept such as this one. Perhaps this movie got aimed too much toward young children? But if that was the case, then why wasn't there more fun included?<br/><br/>The build up also all seems wrong. For instance it seems to take forever for the transformation of Victor von Doom into Dr. Doom to take place, as if it's still a big surprising plot twist. You know from the start on; oh, that guy is going to be Dr. Doom and that guy The Thing and that girl Invisible Woman etcetera. As a direct result of this all, the ending also seems to come out of nowhere and the movie is over before things really start to take off. The movie could had done with some more in between action and an earlier introduction of the main villain and his evil scheme.<br/><br/>The special effects are passable but no way this, or the movie as a whole shows anywhere on screen that this movie got made with a $100,000,000.

","Fantastic Four (2005) is essentially the origin story of this band of Marvel superheroes. The four soon-to-be heroes are sent into space, subjected to cosmic radiation, shocked at the resulting effects on their bodies, and band together to stop a would-be evil villain. An origin story like this would seem to be a good place to begin a franchise. Unfortunately, the results are incredibly mundane. For the first in a series, Fantastic Four felt awfully tired. There's just nothing here to get all that excited about. Special effects  seen 'em before. Characters  2-D and paper thin. Comedy  lame. Plot  predictable. Acting  is that what they were doing? I can't think of one moment in the movie that made me sit up and take notice. There wasn't a single ""Wow"" moment for me.<br/><br/>A lot has been made about the casting of Jessica Alba in the role of Sue Storm. Besides the fact that I've never understood the attraction of this Barbie of a woman, I thought she was terribly miscast. She's supposed to be Johnny's older sister? Ridiculous! I just love the scene where she scolds her ""younger"" brother. Watching Alba attempt to act mature is hilarious. And her relationship with Reed has all the chemistry of oil and water. Again, she's too young to pull it off. Finally, Jessica Alba as a genetic researcher? Yeah, right. The worst case of casting since Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist in The World is Not Enough. Unbelievable!"

","I suppose I can agree with the critics two stars because of the story, and the fact that Spider-Man has proved the best adaptation from Marvel Comics, but the special effects are something to appreciate in this film. Basically a team of experts, including scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), his love interest Sue Storm (Sin City's Jessica Alba), his brother (Chris Evans, not to be confused with the ginger guy that used to be married to Billie Piper), his friend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and fellow scientist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) go into space to investigate a strange cosmic cloud that is passing the Earth, and is supposed to trigger evolution. Obviously something goes wrong, and all five of them go through this cloud. When they get back to Earth they seem to be fine, Von Doom is the only one who is not with them, and one by one, they discover (accidently) their abilities. Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic who can stretch like rubber, Sue becomes The Invisible Woman (obvious what that means) who can also create force fields, Johnny (the only one loving his new powers) becomes The Human Torch who can produce fire at high temperatures and fly, and Ben (the most unfortunate of the four) turns into a rock-like creature with super strength, known just as The Thing, and he loses his wife because of it (don't worry, he gets a blind girlfriend in the end). Meanwhile, slowly, Von Doom finds he can produce high electricity, and simply names himself Dr. Doom (duh!). Reed thinks he can find a cure by simulating the cloud and reversing the procedure, to the delight of Ben, but Johnny wants to stay the way he is. In the end, even when he was cured, Ben changed himself back into Thing, they all defeat Von Doom, and are officially The Fantastic Four.

Thankfully, my wife convinced me to settle down and watch it with her, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Fantastic Four is far superior to its sequel.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the whole 'origin of' aspect to the film that I preferredgetting to see each character discover and master their new talents is a whole heap of fun. It's possible that this movie succeeds due to it's witty script, light-hearted approach, and well-defined villain (The Silver Surfer wasn't really 'evil', and his boss Galactus was a massive disappointment, being nothing more than a hungry space cloud).

","This movie focuses on the origins of the Fantastic Four, and ends with their first defeat of Dr. Doom. For some it may have been too slow in getting to the FX action we're so used to expecting in high budget 'popcorn' films. But for me, someone who read all the current Marvel comics while I was living in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco when I was a college student during the mid 60s, this film totally conveyed the dialog and feelings of the characters, the team action sequences,and the anticipation from the 'continued next issue' endings of the ""Fantastic Four"" comics.<br/><br/>Although I never read the origin of Dr. Doom (so I don't know if the film was 'accurate' in this and the Victor-Sue back story), the whole rest of the film was an accurate visualization of the comic book series for me. It was made for the fans. This film, like the first ""Spiderman,"" was character focused. <br/><br/>All of the Four were richly drawn, and were improved extensions of the comic book characters: outstanding were Jessica Alba, making Invisible Girl a much stronger and fuller presence than I remembered her as in the comic, and Michael Chiklis as the Thing, perfectly capturing his pain and humor. I'd say they carried the film, but Chris Evans as the punky, slightly arrogant Johnny Storm, and Ioan Gruffud, as the wuss scientist who transforms to be the Four's leader, get good screen time and complement / off set the other two, making for an interesting quartet of ""Super Heroes.""<br/><br/>The only weak spot: Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. His powers and their display were good, but in these days of great voices like Patrick Stewart, James Earl Jones and and Ian McKeller, Doom just didn't sound evil enough. Since Von Doom was from a foreign country, at least he could have had a foreign accent to make him more 'alien.'<br/><br/>Everything in the film, and all the little touches (I'd forgotten about Alicia, Ben's blind girlfriend), showed the respect of the film makers (and Stan the Man Lee himself) for the content and the fans. Having the Fantastic Four work together, surrounding Dr. Doom in a circle using their combined powers in concert to defeat him was a perfect touch-- that's the way they did it in the great issues.<br/><br/>At the end, when Dr. Doom's ship leaves for Latveria, like the closing panel of a Fantastic Four issue, others may have felt it ended too soon, because there had only been one 'battle,' but for me it was a highly satisfactory origin issue, leaving me eagerly anticipating the next issue...

","The problem with this film is that it embarks from a popular franchise, yet it really was not ""fantastic"". The overall casting was good, but I think the plot was far too weak, as the film just seemed to coast without any real energy as such. This is probably because it was all crammed into a period of 1 hour and a half, whereas most other marvel films last at least 2 hours. As a result the audience is thrown into a plot without a chance of gaining any depth from each of the characters or plot. As a result the film was just too light hearted, which is not what you want in an action / adventure film. Scenes such as when they were in space was absolutely pathetic, The Thing's story was just all over the place and the romance between Mr Fantastic and Invisible Girl was extremely casual.

","Fantastic Four is a big disappointment. It had the possibility to create a fantastic movie series and it did not do it. The film has poor acting, directing, and the story is not very good! Overall, a poor film that should have been done better! <br/><br/>The acting is poor in this film. Jessica Alba is no Susan Storm and she does a bad job portraying her. The film probably just wanted somebody of physical attractiveness in this film. Same with Ioan Gruffud. At times he does well, playing an intelligent and determined Reed Richards (ecspecially in the beginning), but he does only mediocre at best. A disappointment for him because I was expecting better. Chris Evans is good as a cocky and arrogant Johnny Storm but he does nothing special. Michael Chiklis is the bright point as the Thing/Ben Grimm. He does a good job of portraying the anger, dismalness, and suffering of the Thing. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom! I will be flat out honest, he has ruined this character. McMahon has no where the intensity to portray this character. After watching him on screen, I think he may not even want to be there playing the character because he acts so sub-par. He lacks the anger, determination, and evil genius of the Doctor Doom character. He does a very bad job! One of the most disappointing interpretations of a character ever.<br/><br/>The story in this film is pretty bad. Mark Frost does little to nothing in creating a good or interesting story for that matter. I could never get into the film. One bright point of this film is the portrayal of the Thing. Chiklis and the story do a good job of showing the pain and suffering of the Thing in his character. Also note-worthy is the Johnny Storm character. He is arrogant and cocky which is a surprisingly good portrayal of the character. I hate the Dr. Doom character. McMahon can't be fully to blame but the writers can as well for creating this character. He has his greediness but he seems as if he is lacking in determination and evil capabilities. And it seems as if the writers try to make up for that in the movie by giving him some sort of unlimited/cosmic/god-like powers which only make the character worst. What makes Doom dangerous is his character, not his powers.<br/><br/>Special effects are pretty bad! I mean, I imagine it must be hard to create a Thing costume but this one is just so fake. And some of the special effects seem way overdone including the final showdown between the 4 and Doom. <br/><br/>Overall, a big disappointment. The Fantastic Four is an excellent comic book group and they deserved better than this. Mostly bad acting and bad character portrayal is what ruin this movie. If you are a Fantastic Four fan, you might want to avoid it so you don't lose respect for your characters.

I hope that if and when I see the second that it is better then this one. I'm not saying the movie suck, it just wasn't that great."

","A highly enjoyable comic book adaption with brilliant special effects and some nice touches. I particularly like the pre-transformation in-jokes such as Richards ""always stretching"" and Grimm ""solid as a rock"". <br/><br/>Good performances from the cast, and the appearance of the characters, and their temperaments, are true to the comic book (although to be fair, it's been several years since I've read it!)<br/><br/>In short, deserved to be better reviewed. OK, it's not a deep and moody psychological drama, and there are one or two plot inconsistencies, but that's because it's a COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION, get over it. I think some of these critics have forgotten how awful superhero movies were in the past (anyone remember those 70's Spider-man films?) and need to re-assess their expectations of this genre. Not quite up there with the very best modern adaptations, but a pretty damned good movie all the same."

","The next in the Fantastic 4 series is just being launched in the UK as I write this, and I came across this first in the series quite by accident when surfing the Sky channels earlier this evening.<br/><br/>When I was a child 40 odd years ago I used to read the marvel comics, and the Fantastic 4 were up there amongst my boyhood superheroes. The transition from Marvel comic to widescreen film for Superman, Batman and other contenders really hasn't worked for me, they failed to make that transition. So although my expectations for the Fantastic 4 were hovering at basement level I thought what the heck - I'm gonna watch this first episode to see what I can remember from those long gone years.<br/><br/>As a result of my very positive experience I'm happy to share the humblest of my opinions. I thought this film was brilliant. It may sound really odd to say it, but I found this film very true to life! The 4 characters were exactly as my memory remembers them. Stretchy, Torchy, Ms Invisible, and not least the grouchy Thing with a very reliable built-in attitude problem.<br/><br/>I am definitely gonna queue up for tickets to watch the next instalment.<br/><br/>Oh yeah - well done to the folks who brought this to the wide screen!"

","When an experimental space voyage goes awry, four people are changed by cosmic rays. Reed Richards, inventor and leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body, and takes the name, Mr. Fantastic. His girlfriend, Sue Storm, gains the ability to turn invisible and create force fields, calling herself the Invisible Woman. Her younger brother Johnny Storm gains the ability to control fire, including covering his own body with flame, becoming the Human Torch. Pilot Ben Grimm is turned into a super-strong rock creature calling himself Thing. Together, they use their unique powers to explore the strange aspects of the world, and to foil the evil plans of Doctor Doom.<br/><br/>What I didn't like from the theatrical cut of the film was that the pacing was way too fast, which didn't leave any room for character development and other important element. Now that TWENTY MINUTES are added back in this extended cut, this film was a LOT better. I'm pretty surprised my rating has gone up from 6/10 to 9/10!<br/><br/>I love that this version has more character development and emotion to enhance the film when it was totally panned by critics. Who knows. If this cut was released, it might have made better reviews. I'm also surprised there weren't that many action scenes, although I really did not mind it.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are really great in the film, as well as the action scenes. There are some funny bits here and there, mainly from the character, Johnny Storm. It's just your average entertaining family movie!<br/><br/>I liked the acting by the main four heroes, including Jessica Alba (I don't know why people hated her in this movie). I also find it quite refreshing from Chris Evans' acting. His character doesn't act serious, like many superhero does.<br/><br/>Do not compare this from Batman Begins or Spider-Man. I might include this in the ""best superhero movies ever made"" list because it's just good with its characters as with its story. This is Fantastic 4 everyone! Watch it now (the extended cut)!"

","Fantastic Four: A group of social retards that must face off the pathetic little unhappy scientist because he couldn't buy a pony. In a nutshell, that is metamorphically what the movie amounts to.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffurd (or should I say Bob Saget playing Danny Tanner in Full House?) is a super nerdy scientist who becomes Mr. Fantastic during a cosmic storm (which in itself, is nothing special, even if its on the silver screen). Ioan Gruffurd is convincing but is written in the footsteps of Danny Tanner in Full House, thus reducing the impact of his role.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba is the Invisible Girl, who can turn invisible (duh) and create force fields. Her role is no more than OK. She has many corny moments but still has an occasional good line. It is also pretty obvious why they chose such a bad actress for the role (as you will see three times when she's next to being naked.) Some guy I forget plays Ben Grimm. Ben Grimm is one of the highlights because the guy plays a nice, average human tortured by his inner conflict of being huge. The inner conflict is pulled off really well, and the actor who plays him makes it all the more convincing.<br/><br/>Chris Evans plays the Human Torch. Another highlight of the film. Yes, the character is written as a jerk, but his wonderful performance makes him a lovable jerk and provides some of the better humor of the film. However, he has one or two pointless scenes (random motorcross scene?), making you wonder why its even there.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon plays one of the wimpiest villains ever (aside from the villains of Batman and Robin), Dr. Doom. In the comics he is the archetype of evil, a force to be reckoned with. But here he does little damage, his motives are non-existent, and he has some extremely corny lines spoken in a very cheesy manner. He looks intimidating but is not. What I do like about him, though, is his very, very last scene in the film. That's it.<br/><br/>The storyline is a bore aside from Ben Grimm's emotional conflict, and the action is almost non-existent. Only towards the end is there a heavy action sequence, which sadly reeks of Tim Story. There is one earlier in the film, and it's pretty bad too.<br/><br/>What can I say? The movie is bad. It has its moments but in the end, just can't pull it together. 3.9/10."

","Despite the part of the cast that is doubtlessly performing in an outstanding manner (that is, Michael Chiklis as Ben - my childhood favorite- and Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom), the whole movie has gone all wrong.<br/><br/>Not even the great visual effects can make up for the tangled and stupefied plot. The fight scenes are quite spectacular (although the one on the bridge is pretty low) and the make-up artists have done very well. While Jessica Alba I consider good, and I have already reviewed the acting of Michael Chiklis, the other two of the four are profoundly miscast. Ioan Gruffudd is totally uninteresting (he is supposed to be the lead main brainy and clever superhero, remember) and Chris Evans is also lost in his role which I would not have considered to be as tough as to get anybody lost in it at all (an easy-going careless torch-man)<br/><br/>How can you mess up a very simple first-of-a-franchise movie about the supposedly touching background story of supposedly nice and evil, respectively, supposedly interesting action heroes? This is a riddle to me. <br/><br/>I hope the second part will do better. There is so much more to these characters than what has been shown here."

","Jessica Alba is more powerful than all four ""heroes"" in this cosmic bomb. Not for acting ability, but because she appears in a skin-tight outfit occasionally.<br/><br/>Now let's just get one thing out of the way. We know Super-Hero movies can be good. We've seen them. We know that if someone actually works on a screenplay, competently directs, an casts adequate actors, we can actually have a pretty decent flick. Fantastic Four leaves me wondering why anyone would allow this mutant thing onto the screen.<br/><br/>Looking beyond the fact that the villain is played by the demon guy from Charmed, who is essentially the same character, and that Reed Richards is played by a guy I would card if he tried to buy cigarettes from me, the story is one of awkward shifts from point a to point b via special effects and barely-believable character dialog.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than an attempt to make money on a franchise. It's not even thinly veiled. If it weren't for the funny back-and-forth between Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, and the aforementioned Jessica Alba factor, this movie would be completely unwatchable."

It's a real pity that Julian McMahon was a bit boring in the role of Doom at times. A look at Ian McKellen as Magneto in X Men or Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman would have been an idea. And, wan't Doctor Doom supposed to be the king of Latervia? Only a brief glimpse at the word on the boat at the end!? The general story of how Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben came to terms with their powers was accurate and the responsibilities that come with them too made the characters interesting.

","We bought this DVD because it's one of the few movies we enjoy watching with our 8- and 5-year old kids. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm are the best parts of this movie. Evans manages to be charmingly full of himself and an endearing trickster, constantly needling Chiklis's gentle giant. There is a lot of humor and action in a story about people coming to terms with superpowers. Those looking for a dark, complex, updated retelling will be disappointed. This is a live-action comic, not a graphic novel.<br/><br/>This movie suffered from being released after The Incredibles, the excellent Pixar parody of The Fantastic Four comic book. I think my boys prefer The Fantastic Four to The Incredibles because there is not a marriage or children in peril, both of which are scarier to them than men getting killed by Dr. Doom. The Fantastic Four was also unfavorably compared with Batman Begins, which came out the same year. While I really enjoyed Batman Begins, it is much darker and more of a brooding psychological journey, unsuitable for young children.<br/><br/>There is some gratuitous partial nudity in the film and about a half a dozen swear words which seem to be added to earn a PG-13 rating."

The one aspect I particularly liked was the fact that it used fairly low key actors and actresses and didn't take itself too seriously, unlike the X-Men films which I found hard work and tedious.<br/><br/>Overall a decent addition to the recent Marvel list of films, and I am actually quite looking forward to the sequel."

What we get are a modicum of visual effects that are moderately successful. Lots of cars get thrown around in this movie, that's for sure.<br/><br/>The synopsis, or what there is of it, consists of five people going into space(it's that easy when you are wealthy like Julian McMahon to just up and go to space when you feel like it)to find cures and stuff for disease. They encounter some sort of life force entity which gives each of them powers beyond what mortal man can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd is Reed Richards, the nerdy shy scientist whose job at NASA sent him into bankruptcy with pal Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm..always watching his friend's back through all the heartache. Jessica Alba is Sue Storm, Reed's ex who still carries a torch for him. She has been working under the millionaire Victor Von Doom(what a name, huh?), played by Julian in all his menacing glory. Julian is indeed the only real thing this film has going for it with the exception of the harrowing bridge sequence caused by a man who planned to jump off of said bridge. To close out the group is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, a cocky, self-assured pretty boy who is to pilot the ship to space. I'm surprised he had enough brains to pilot his car on Earth much less some ship into space.<br/><br/>Anyway, after the crew encounters the anomaly in space, Reed's limbs become tender and he can now stretch them for miles and miles, Sue can make her entire body invisible, Johhny can turn his body into a flying fireball, and poor Ben forms into this huge rock creature. Victor's body is slowly growing into steel while also carrying a unique ability to shift electrical current with his hands.<br/><br/>Victor, who loses money from his company for his funding the space fiasco, lets lose on his boss who tells him he's finished, and once he sees that Sue, who he has a thing for, is still in love with Reed, DOOM will soon come upon The 4.<br/><br/>The film opens sappy story lines like the whole love angle between Reed and Sue, Thing's unbearable hardship with how he looks, and sister trying to stop fire torch brother from enjoying his unique abilities. Reed is trying desperately to solve the riddle behind how to change everyone back to their original normal form, but brick walls seem to always stand in front of him. Meanwhile, Doom likes his increasing power and will tool his resources to try and unleash a flurry of rage against those who sent him into financial ruin."

","I've been a fan of the 4 for a long time and used to read the comics as a kid. Years ago a Rogert Corman version of this was made that I saw and it wasn't that fantastic. So I didn't have very high expectations for this movie. I caught this at the drive-in as a double feature with ""War of the Worlds"". Well, Fantastic Four turned out to be a pretty good action flick. Most of the actors fit their parts really well. Michael Chiklis was great as the Thing. Chris Evans and Ioan Gruffudd were perfect in their roles as Johnny Storm and Richard Reed, respectively. Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon weren't really right in their roles as Susan Storm and Victor Von Doom but they were acceptable I suppose.<br/><br/>Visual effects were top notch, the CGI didn't look too cheesy and there were some great scenes using them. When Johnny Storm turns into the Human Torch it really looks cool.<br/><br/>The story was fair and they didn't stay true to the comic. Dr. Doom is merely a genius in a suit, a lot like Iron Man, and doesn't have electrical powers like those depicted in the movie. Even though the story deviates from the comics it's acceptable enough and is entertaining. The characters though, are exactly like the comic. The constant banter between The Thing and Human Torch is dead on and Chris Evans provides much of the movie's humorous moments. Mr. Fantastic's egg headedness is so straight from the book.<br/><br/>Overall this is an entertaining super-hero movie that the whole family will like."

","i applaud anyone who puts jessica alba on screen. at least the film captures her walking toward us in several scenes. the movie would have been better if it simply videotaped her walking for an hour. what kind of director decides to photograph her in poor light, limit her time on screen, and make her invisible? the only thing we could figure is that it was in her contract that she be invisible during the romance scenes, specifically so she could get out of the on-screen kisses with her co-star: they of no good chemistry. her alleged brother (do these two look like siblings?) is also trying to save this shipwreck, but the result is inevitable: the writing and dialogue make you cringe and make you wonder what age group was being targeted. we were thinking 12-year old boys. FF2 could work as a sequel, but i just hope that some casting director sees jessica alba walking and puts her in a movie where we can just watch her walk. (maybe it is time to rent honey again.) we really wanted to know who made this movie so we could avoid them in the future. amazingly, i really liked mr. and mrs. smith, and i think that THAT director knew what to do with angelina jolie's beauty. if i were the production company, i would get the mr. and mrs. smith director to teach the FF2 director how to light his star and how to luxuriate over her."

","I read Marvel comics within a few years of the start of their golden age, beginning in the mid- to late 60s. It's sort of amazing they haven't done real movies until now. Each of the main Marvel characters was made for movie-making, they had more depth and texture than either Batman or Superman, plus their associated characters and their powers were generally more interesting. My personal favorites in the golden era were the Fantastic Four and Thor (interestingly enough, at the time Daredevil and the X-Men - earlier movie selections - were considered two of the weaker entries for Marvel). The casting for this movie, as for all the Marvel movies, is flawless, although Susie was more reserved in the comics (like most any red-blooded guy I have no other complaints re: Alba), and Johnny considerably more responsible, neither flaws fatal in my mind. My primary complaint is not much happens action-wise in this one, the character development is fine but we're here for the bells & whistles too. I'm willing to give them another shot with Silver Surfer."

","Fantastic Four is a fun film for the family and a joy to any of us who grew up with Marvel comics. It's very true to the look and feel of those friends you met on the pages of the comics as a kid in a world only you and they could understand. (Since you didn't realize there were millions reading the same thing at the time!) Reed and Susan are cast much younger than in the comic which adds a new dynamic since they are much less parental (and Sue especially is much more babe-alicious). The Thing is obviously a rubber suit, which is disappointing. Perhaps they should have gone with computer graphics despite Chiklis's protests, but the state of the art then might not have been that satisfying either. The bit that only a blind woman could love the Thing is dated and a bit prejudiced against both the ugly (Thing) and the disabled (the blind woman).<br/><br/>What does work is the coming alive of all those special effects you worked in your mind. They usually work very well here and only get a bit tired toward the end when it's obvious Dr. Doom is on a hoist when ""flying"" back after being smashed, etc. And the same pathos you remember from the comics, The Thing's sweetheart unable to handle his change, and his decision to sacrifice his life for Reed, are here as well. Johnny Torch is perfect, just the way he wad depicted in the comics and all the cocky attitude that made him one of my favorite superheroes.<br/><br/>Some folks say you shouldn't compare this to Spiderman, etc. I don't think it's possible not to compare. Spiderman will always be my favorite, but the FF (especially Johnny Torch) will always be right up there, and this film ensures that.<br/><br/>All in all a wonderful film and a fun way to share the same joy you had as a child with your own children. ""Fun on!"""

","It's definitely not up to par with the other good Marvel movies - Spiderman and X-Men - but is certainly an underrated movie like Daredevil was. This movie had it's dumb moments but overall it was enjoyable. I liked Thing and Torch the most but Invisible girl was pleasant (of course it being Jessica Alba doesn't hurt). With the previews that it received I stayed away from it for a long time, I never had the burning desire to see it, if you'll pardon the pun. Having stayed away for so long I wished now I would've seen it earlier - I've wasted several hours of my life on bad movies, usually with the phrase ""That's two hours of my life I won't get back."" uttered shortly thereafter... The fight scene between the Thing and Mr. Fantastic was hilarious and well done.

","An adaptation of Marvel's bickering first family, ""Fantastic Four"" has its moments, but fails to capture the magic of the comics. Part of the problem is the casting. Mr. Fantastic is bland, and the Invisible Girl, irritating. The film's Dr. Doom, the nemesis of the clan, is also VERY lackluster. Instead of a regal villain in a hulking suit of armor, we are treated to a petty megalomaniac in a trench coat. The saving grace? The Thing and the Human Torch, both of whom distill their comic analogues very well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I am sure that if you are not familiar with the comic book version of the Fantastic Four, this movie was entertaining enough, but it is a step down from its printed page roots."

Once back on earth, they discover that they have each acquired some strange ""super power"" which allows them to do ""fantastic"" things.

The real problem with the film is that the heroes spend more time talking about their powers than doing anything very interesting with them. There's a fairly nifty little fight scene at the end, but it takes way too long to get there for it to be really worth the trip. On the other hand, there's a breezy quality to some of the writing, particularly in the put-down exchanges between Ben and Johnny, which helps to compensate for the rather sappy conversations between the former lovers, Reed and Sue. And the special effects are very good for the most part.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a minor addition to the over-saturated superhero genre, but it's also not quite the unmitigated disaster many critics claimed it was."

","'Fantastic Four', I believe, is the most underrated of all the superhero movies, by far. People compared it to Spider-Man too much, probably because it was the first Marvel movie to come out since Spider-Man 2, and they missed the point of FF. 'Four', directed well by Tim Story, is not supposed to be as dramatic and intense as SP2, but rather just a fun, catchy, and addictive movie, which it is.<br/><br/>The story is like this: 4 scientists, Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), her brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), are launched up to the new space station to record the affects of a cosmo storm with the man who is funding the expedition, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). Instead of recording the affects, the storm gives them the effects first had. The five of them receive astonishing powers and abilities, and in Grimm's case, it's not pretty. Soon, Von Doom disappears into seclusion, but the other four soon become known to the media as The Fantastic Four! The special effects are top notch, especially all the scenes with Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch. There are a ton of computer shots in the film, but you won't be able to tell with most of them, because the rendering and editing is very good. It's a decent story, but I wish there had been more crime fighting then there was. Tim Story does do a nice job of showing how the newfound mutations affect each of the character's lives, including Von Doom. The writing is decent, but once again, I wish there was more crime fighting. The direction is great, as I've said before. The acting is what you'd expect from a movie like this, not good, but not bad. The best portrayals are from Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans, as they capture the aura of their characters very well. The worst is Von Doom, who is nowhere near as cool as he is in the comics. McMahon is the right guy for the role, he just needs to read up on the character and give him more anger. Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba play their roles reasonably well, but you don't get the feeling from Gruffudd that Reed is the leader of the group, because as Mr. Fantastic, he is. All in all, I enjoy FF whenever I watch it. There is no language at all, and there's a lot of funny lines and cool scenes that kids will enjoy. FF is good for kids ages 11 and up. Not as good as Spider-Man, but better than Hulk and Daredevil.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

","I like Fantastic Four, but the reasons are very different to why I like for instance X-Men, Hulk and Batman Begins (the latter two are in my view not even super-hero movies even though they get called that). What I like about Fantastic Four is that it acknowledges its rather goofy roots. We have a large guy made of rubble and we have a guy who stretches. Campy hilarity is bound to ensue so we might as well go with it.<br/><br/>In spite of the comical elements the film luckily manages to touch upon the more serious themes and I personally thought Victor Von Doom kicked ass, because he wasn't being such a pompous villain. <br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a breath of fresh air in the imperfect heroes category and a brilliantly funny film. It did have a few rushed elements, at the end we never quite got what was going on with Ben and Reed's machine. The important thing is that we got to hear those three wonderful words: ""Don't do Drugs!""... just kidding:<br/><br/>IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!"

Watching them get through their conflicts and deal with each other's personality quirks as they gel into the Fantastic Four is fun and more interesting than if the movie had been ONLY action, action, and more action. It's not perfect. The screenwriters didn't make Jessica Alba into a convincing scientist and they didn't make the development of the bad guy from ordinary jerk into evil monster all that convincing either (I don't blame the actors for these flaws). The acting and writing for The Thing is especially compelling. The movie does what it sets out to do (I don't expect a superhero movie to be a life-changing experience) and is enjoyable with a few flaws so it gets a 7 rating - the most common so far for this movie."

","Of the numerous comic book heroes that have been adapted for the big screen lately, I found this one possibly the best. Admittedly by their very nature, attempts to adapt youthful fantasy into live action film is a venture fraught with peril. The ""take it or leave it"" finality of live action that won't insult the images formed by us early on is surely difficult for any production team to pull off. And lets face it. Stan Lee is to comics-books what Tolkien was to high fantasy. In a wise move, Stan Lee himself was there to lend his own touch to the finished product, a move which is probably responsible for the ease with which I was able to accept the characters. The special effects were fine, with no inconsistencies glaring enough to yank me out of the story-line.<br/><br/>I was however quite disappointed to have found the ""Goth Guy"" scene gone from the final cut (or at least the one I saw here in Canada). I had heard somewhere that Preston Peet was ""a sight to behold!""....and certainly one I was looking forward to seeing, judging by the description given me. It sounds to me like it should have stayed in the final cut, so hopefully it'll be returned in some future CD/DVD release? Maybe just as an out-take perhaps?"

","Just as spider-man 2 had too much soap-opera elements throughout it. FF disappoints in its lack of development. It felt like you would expect another hour of action after familiarizing yourself with the cast. What's the point of introducing Alicia (Ben Grimm's blind girlfriend) if you're not going the sculptures that she works on? Including Doc Doom in the FFs origin was a majorly bland movie short-cut. The character development was lopsided at best. You didn't know if you'd see action in the next few minutes or some boring blah-blah by the so-so cast. Speaking of cast, the human torch, the thing and RR were well chosen but the script they had to deal with was so terrible and their acting skills so weak (bar the torch) that I found myself groaning throughout a quarter of the movie. I don't know what Stan Lee thought of the movie but other than the *superb* costumes and special FX I'm a little bummed out by this movie<br/><br/>It felt like this movie was a plug for Jessica Alba's budding (I mean it lit'ly) career.

It had just about everything I expected from it, action, special affects, a decent storyline, good looking cast and lots of humor (which is lacking a lot of times in super-hero films). Finally somebody have the guts to say that being a super hero is cool! instead of it always being such a burden. I thought that was great, and fresh. Another thing I loved about the movie (and spoiler up ahead!) is that a lot of times when you go to see a movie you know a little bit about what's gonna happen and you have to sit and wait for all the beginning that you already know from all the trailers and publicity, and wait for the good stuff. Here we knew that Michael Chicklis is gonna turn into the thing. So the first time we see him after his back from space they play a little joke on us. We are sure we know what's gonna happen, we are sure we're gonna see the thing in that mirror, and than it turned out that we were wrong. They played a game on us, and I thought that was brilliant and smart and funny.

","This film does right was so many comic book movies have done wrong, it makes the source material fun. This is definitely the funniest and light-hearted comic book film I have seen so far, although the a few scenes with Dr. Doom take a dramatic turn and are almost too violent for the tone of the movie throughout. But besides that there are plenty of laughs to get you through the far-fetched notion of this comic universe, as a big fan of the Fantastic Four I was weary of the transition to film. But this is the most faithful comic book adaptation, they even introduced the Things slogan ""its clobbering time,"" in a clever manner too, through marketing an action figure, kinda ironic isn't it? The film does a good job of despersing the attention to all the characters, not just the one with the most interesting story ( arguably The Thing, with his beauty and the beast situation.) I was impressed with the effects work too, little touches throughout constantly amused me and gave the characters depth. After all, dealing with powers so great in real world scenarios could lead to strenghts, such as Mr. Fantastics stretching for toilet paper when he runs out, or weaknesses such as The Things inability to eat easily with utensil, because of his enormous hands. Sensibilities such as these have only been explored in the better comic book movies such as Batman Begins and the X-men series. The action is nice throughout, I like to see steady action sequences throughout the movie until the climatic finale and for the most part they deliver. I have to say the biggest fault of this film is the finale though, its a big too simplistic and short. Sure, it gets it's point across and they finally work together as a team to overtake evil, but it's over to fast and not as grandiose as other offerings in the genre. If your a fan of the series your not to be disappointed."

","There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.<br/><br/>Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.<br/><br/>Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my positive rating).<br/><br/>The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm). Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.<br/><br/>The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group which is why I'd give him top billing.<br/><br/>The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).<br/><br/>This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman."

","You needn't bother with 'Fantastic Four' if you're expecting a superhero film with a dark edge, such as 'V for Vendetta' or 'Batman Begins'. This film aims to be much more of a light-hearted action flick complete with all-American heroes who have little time for brooding in the shadows. And that doesn't mean it is a bad film because, while I am a huge fan of 'Batman Begins' and the latest Spider-Man releases, there is something to be said watching a more traditional take on superheroes who are boisterous and gung-ho, and the lines between good and evil are very clear-cut. To be quite honest, this film is meant to be a fun popcorn flick and doesn't pretend to be anything else.<br/><br/>Based on one of the lesser known Marvel comics, 'Fantastic Four' revolves around a group of four-- scientist Reed Richards, his girlfriend Sue Storm, her younger military brother Johnny and Reed's strapping best friend Ben Grimm-- who are exposed to cosmic rays during an experimental mission in space. The radiation from the rays alters them on the genetic level, bestowing them with super powers. However, unbeknown to them, insidious businessman Victor Von Doom was also altered too and he intends to use his powers to conquer the world and it is up to our heroes to put a stop to his plan.<br/><br/>The story is solid enough with the intention of providing simple entertainment that doesn't require much abstract thought from the audience. The heroes are all likable, all-round decent people with the cocky Johnny providing the witty one-liners and the Reed/Sue/Doom love triangle leaving you cheering on the naive but nice Reed. The actors make an effort to fit their roles (Michael Chiklis was definitely born to play Ben/The Thing) and clearly have a good time doing so.<br/><br/>'Fantastic Four' is a film that drives to the heart of what superhero comic books are about; the good guys being good and trumping the detestable, arrogant bad guys. It's fun, bright and action-packed and is certainly a better effort than other comic book adaptations such 'The Hulk' or 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Although I hope any sequel takes a slightly darker edge, don't let critics' disparaging reviews put you off this as it is very entertaining."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","1","21 April 2006"," Too many characters, not enough exploration
","I debated on whether or not I should review Fantastic Four. The film managed to convince me that the movie was not made for people like me  people who don't read comic books and have only basic comic book trivia 101 walking into the theater. I knew of all four powers, I knew of all four characters, and I even knew about Doctor Doom. The film didn't bother enlightening me beyond what I already knew.<br/><br/>The film is busy associated names to faces to their respective powers, but I never learned who these people are. I felt like the filmmakers decided to make the comic books an integral crutch to the viewing experience  if you want to enjoy Fantastic Four, go pick up some comic books so the characters actually have personalities, histories, and development. The movie flirts with the idea of character exploration and character motives almost as if it's nodding to the comic-book enlightened crowd, and then it goes on with condensed and abridged story line of the Four's first adventure.<br/><br/>So while the film managed to turn off my interest in the plot, in the characters, it actually did provoke my sense of curiosity  did the fans feel like they had a movie made for them? A movie that other people can get and understand, but not become absorbed in? Or did this cinematic Fantastic Four offend the hardcore fans who know every frame of the original comics? Were the Fantastic Four accurately represented on the screen? Did the movie offend the hardcore fans? <br/><br/>In the film's defense, perhaps it tried juggling far too many tangents with its limited amount of screen time. The film obviously features not one, but four main characters who must get an introduction, juxtaposed to the scene where they all get their powers (mercifully, all four are mutated at the same time), juxtaposed to the scenes (yes, plural) where all four explore their newfound powers, juxtaposed to the scene where all four really use their powers  when everything is said and done, the film is cutting left and right from one character to another, frantically trying to get the story of all four superheroes to its audience, but it's too much.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four can't keep up with all four characters, it can't fill the scenes with the necessary energy to keep them moving and interesting, and it fails. Take for example the scene were Johnny the human torch learns about his new ability to spontaneously combust while skiing, and the scene drones on with the enthusiasm of an accountant. The scene feels obligatory, shot straight out of the textbook ""how to shoot a revelation of an unnatural phenomena."" Cue his obliviousness, cue his date to look over and see the flames, cue his tragic fall that conveniently allows him to exhibit his newborn power to fly. Yawn and cut.<br/><br/>But what about the guy behind this super power? How does he feel about being able to light himself on fire without hurting himself? The film skips the confusion of how he defied the fundamental laws of physics, it skips the potential fear or concern that he's losing his mind (which probably strike most human beings before accepting they had super powers), and it jumps right to his excitement as he doesn't bother to get dressed before sharing his new find with the others. And you know what? That by itself  that one single tangent  it doesn't bother me! I'm fine with it. Sure, they didn't have to show Johnny going through a number of psychological phases to develop his character and accept what he's becoming. I understand that.<br/><br/>The problem is the sheer volume of similar incidents where the movie simply skips over the characters growing into their powers and the people they are destined to become. The problem isn't the one example that I've presented, the problem is the film provides 100 minutes worth of examples that I can present at the drop of a hat.<br/><br/>Poor Ben Grimm  he really is the outcast. He's the only one who gets to realistically deal with the hand fate decided to deal him. But once again, the film delivers it more out of obligation than a passion for his story. The energy needed to sell the scenes have (by this time) abandoned the images on the screen. The narrative just passively states, ""Oh yeah, by the way, the Thing's love interest abandons him."" The film doesn't feel complete  it feels like its missing a key ingredient to its story. Maybe the viewer who stayed up many a nights reading to see if the Fantastic Four would pull through the latest issue have a more intimate understand of who these characters are supposed to be at heart.

","Fantastic Four/2005/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Ioan Gruffudd Michael Chiklis Chris Evans Jessica Alba Julian McMahon<br/><br/>I really was looking forward to this movie and it was good! Of course, it was not as good as I thought it would be. I really thought this would be the movie of the summer. That's the reason why I saw the movie the first day it came out- July 8, 2005. This movie has a lot of what audiences want to see- action, some humor, and drama. It did have about one or two scenes of romance but who cares? In this movie, there are five scientists (Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), and Susan Storm (Jessica Alba). All five of them are affected by rays caused by a (I won't tell you what the rays were caused by) that changed their tendencies and gave them super powers. But, unfortunately one of the scientists turned bad on the other four scientists. As you probably know from the previews or if you read the comics, the scientists have nicknames now that they have powers. Ben Grimm is The Thing, Reed Richards is Mr. Fantastic, Johnny Storm is Human Torch, Susan Storm is Invisible Woman, and don't forget about Victor Von Doom being Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom kills a few innocent people (one he wanted to get his revenge on for sacking him) in this movie and also has an evil plan to eliminate the Fantastic Four. This movie has spectacular effects that drive you insane. No one could ever hate this non-stop dramatic, comedic, thriller. Every actor/actress in this movie played their parts fantastically well. I'm going to say this though that ""Batman Begins"" tops this movie for sure but this was fantastically well-acted, etc. but it just wasn't what I thought it would be- the most fantastic movie of the summer. Movie directed by Tim Story."
"shino","8","0","1","31 March 2006"," Surprisingly Good, Maybe Very Good.
","I was honestly expecting very little from the film; the cheesy-looking poster doesn't help. But thorough competence all-around (and I don't mean this patronizingly) makes for quite and entertaining 90 minutes. Start with the writing. It does a very good job at capturing the dynamic of the group, the constant bickering and sparring between the members, as well the impression of four people who have long been friends and understand each other very well. I remember being struck by the importance of the interrelationships as a kid reading the books and the cartoon series--it wasn't batman and superman working together. The plot and dialog are intelligently handled. The acting is quite good as well, Chiklis is a great Thing, and I also liked Gruffudd and McMahon as Mr Fantastic and Dr Doom. McMahon is sort of a welsh Kevin Spacey. (why is it that when I see American films and there are unknown actors who strike me as good, they seems to always be from the UK, NZ, or Aus??). The younger Storm kids are good as well. The action is quick-paced, the special effects very good, and it has the right amount of humor. Lastly, the sex, language and violence are fairly restrained, so my kids were able to enjoy it.<br/><br/>I admire the film because it's a fairly straightforward adaptation of the comic, competently handled in every aspect, does not go for (too many) cheap laughs, and does not inject overblown ambitions into the story. It's always a pleasure to be surprised by quality entertainment."

","I originally watched this show for one reason and one reason only: Julian McMahon. I had been a fan of his in Charmed, and I thought there was no harm in going to the cinemas to watch a film that I would not normally pay any interest to.<br/><br/>Little did I know that this film would become one of my favourites. The film boasts some of the best special effects I have seen in a long while (this coming from someone who constantly watches her favourite TV shows such as Charmed and picks fault. Ho hum) as well as some of the best casting (despite however much some people beg to differ).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the background storyline involving Reed and Susan, as well as the constant rivalry between Johnny and Ben.<br/><br/>Although many people criticise this film, saying that it is a load of *fill in the blank*, I beg to differ.

","Bland, forgettable addition to the myriad CGI-happy super-hero flicks (of alarmingly variable quality): in this case, I recall watching the cartoon version from my childhood and, frankly, apart from the excessive technical jargon unpersuasively mouthed by the cardboard characters, this big-screen adaptation shows little or no sign of a higher intelligence at work and, indeed, in the brash antics of Chris Evans and the lame rock score, suggests that it was primarily designed with the dreaded 'teen market' in mind! As such it's mindlessly enjoyable, particularly Michael Chiklis' wisecracks...and Jessica Alba's presence certainly doesn't hurt (though it had to be her character that was rendered invisible by the script!)."
"dj_bassett","Null","0","1","14 March 2006"," Not a bad adaptation
","Generally people were unnecessarily hard on this movie, which does what it tries to do fairly well. If you're looking for a decent Fantastic Four adaption you'll find it here: the storyline charts the origin of the group and their big nemesis, Dr. Doom.<br/><br/>It's exceptionally well-cast: Chiklis is the definitive Ben Grimm, but even Jessica Alba, a woman who I was sure would never deliver a decent performance in her life, does okay as Sue Storm. (Not that it's an exceptionally tough role, but still.) The personal interactions are generally believable, as far as ""believable"" goes in this kind of thing. The movie makers get the look right: it's bright and colorful the way the comic always was, and full of the gizmos the comic always had. And while I can't say the CGI work was standout, it's not intrusive, anyway.<br/><br/>I can't say that this will ever be one of my favorite comic book movies, though. One of the problems, oddly, is that there's a bit too much personal interaction: a comic book movie that only has two real action sequences seems to miss the point, somehow. The second, more serious problem, isn't really the movie's fault so much as the source material: I just don't think this series has aged very well. I think people generally are looking for something different in their comic book heroes than what the F4 can really provide  there's a kind of simple innocence to these guys which I'm sure some find appealing, but frankly which I find to be rather blah. Another way to say it is that I find these guys pretty dated.<br/><br/>Still, that's not really the movie's fault. And while I'm unenthusiastic, generally people who are fans should enjoy this."

Cringeworthy moments included The Thing's ex girlfriend showing up on the blocked bridge from out of nowhere! and dropping the ring which poor Ben couldn't pick up. And flame boy leaping into the air and signing the FF logo in the air after the extremely stupid nose kiss proposal.

"chowdhmi","8","0","1","28 February 2006"," A good comic book adaptation
","Having been a fan and collector of comics for over 20 years this movie was something of a bugbear for me.<br/><br/>Would it be as dire and disappointing as Daredevil, as superb as Spiderman, as cack-handed as Captain America or as pitiful as The Phantom? Well, the answer is, it's pretty good. Whilst by no means a character study with the depth and emotion and lavish attention to detail of a Kubrick masterpiece it is a well-made, fairly restrained comic-book adaptation that brings the characters to life well (Michael Chiklis gets right under the rocky skin of Ben Grimm) and explores the usual 'superhero origins' with skill whilst remaining clear of getting bogged down in too many details.<br/><br/>The actual scripting is typical comic-book dialogue, which is always going to be slightly cheesy and full of one-liners, but isn't as bad as an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, the special effects are suitably impressive, and the cinematography suits the action genre well.<br/><br/>Now for the bad things. Ioan Gruffud as Reed Richards is really badly cast. His Reed Richards is awkward and geeky and science-obsessed before his transformation, but afterwards (at least according to the comic books) became a much more 'heroic' figure, with a more typically macho outlook. Unfortunately this doesn't translate well in the film and he appears to remain as limp as he ever was. Also, the final scrap with Vic V. D. is confusing and short and the end of the film comes so abruptly that I was genuinely surprised that it had finished.<br/><br/>All in all, more right with it than wrong, and one of the better comic book films. Up there with X-Men 1 and Spiderman.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see Superman now!"

"AndrewRGray","4","0","1","20 February 2006"," Are These Reviewers Kidding?
","I read the glowing reviews for this movie and I have to wonder: Are they kidding? The Fantastic Four is probably the worst of the recent major studio superhero films, greatly inferior to the new Spiderman, X-Men and Batman films. Maybe they are kidding, or maybe they are marketing drones trying to generate artificial word of mouth. Whatever the case, F4 is lame movie.<br/><br/>Although the cast ranges from tolerable (Chris Evans and Jessica Alba) to good (Michael Chilkis), and the FX are okay, the script is, in a word, bad. After the complex story lines and driven characters of recent comic book films, F4 comes off hasty and ill thought. At one point Ben Grimm, a.k.a. ""The Thing"" leaves a medical clinic high in the Rockies (it sure ain't in the Catskills) and walks, apparently overnight, to Brooklyn (where the audience must endure the line ""this here's the only mook from Brooklyn what's gone into space."") Johnny Storm (a.k.a. ""The human torch""), after an absurd extreme snow skiing slow-mo montage, is implied to have sexual relations with a gorgeous nurse, even though the same nurse an hour before measured his body temperature as being over 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn't she, ah, have suffered some serious scalding?<br/><br/>It's the kind of film where any character can be comprehensively summed up with two words (""kindly egghead"", ""hotshot pilot"" or ""evil businessman"").<br/><br/>Every super hero must oppose a super villain, and the quality of the villainy often determines the story's success or failure. Here in Fantastic Four we have Victor Von Doom, a handsome corporate leader who apparently has political ties to someplace called Latveria even though he went to MIT with Reed Richards and then hired Reed's sweetheart Sue when he became the head of Von Doom Industries which is so successful it has its own space station even though they can't float an IPO and Von Doom's grades weren't so hot. Since all the complexity went into Victor's insane back story, his character is wholly unburdened with it: He's the kind of character that's soap-opera handsome and drinks a cup of hot, steaming evil with breakfast. Villains like Ra's Al Gul or William Stryker do evil because they think they are doing good; Von Doom does evil because it's in the script.<br/><br/>The climactic action set-piece is a major disappointment, leading (of course) to the ""it's over but not really over"" ending demanded by a mediocre action film like this. The producers of Batman Begins, X-Men and Spiderman hired good writers and good directors before they undertook the mission of bringing beloved comic book heroes to the screen. The result is movies which are both thrilling and compelling, movies where you have something to think about when the action lulls. The mediocre directing and sub-par script of Fantastic Four proves the wisdom of that course. With this film we see the sad result of writers who don't respect the source, and don't bother to make a script worth filming."

All of the actors mirror the Marvel Comic book heroes but McMahon's Dr. Von Doom, the story's villain. McMahon seemed a bit weak in his role due to a lack of enough ""evil"" displayed in his character. Michael Chiklis' Ben Grimm/The Thing steals the show with his soft-hearted & sensitive big man portrayal.

Bombarded by cosmic radiation, all five people are transformed into super heroes to their surprise. After medical testing upon returning to Earth, each member discovers their new gifts & realizes the good that could come of them. Richards gained the ability to stretch his body to unbelievable lengths, Johnny could ignite himself into a human torch & could fly, Sue could create force fields & turn invisible, & Ben Grimm gained incredible strength & is encased in impenetrable rock. While three of the astronauts adapted to their gifts, Grimm was saddened by his gifts because of the horror his wife would endure once she sees him. The members decide to go to Richard's apartment to find a cure for their ""gifts"". After a major accident on a New York bridge, the newly dubbed Fantastic 4 rush to action to save citizens from peril. Meanwhile, Dr. Von Doom goes through changes of his own,...into the planet's worst & most lethal villain.

","Well, the votes are in and ""Fantastic Four,"" latest in a rapidly bloating sub-genre of superhero flicks, is officially deemed a turkey by the critics, and a qualified success by the audiences.

Chris Evans is like that, but in reverse. He mangles every scene he's in. Somehow, his background antics manage to constantly distract the audience from the plot, the actual tensions (few though they are) in the dialog. Hell, he manages to ruin the humorous bits!<br/><br/>Look, I know they wanted the character to come off as brash, hotheaded, maybe even a trifle arrogant. But Evans, flashing a smarmy smirk at every chance, and flexing his plastic pectorals, actually reaches through arrogant and comes out the other side, past obnoxious and aggravating, and out into downright teeth-gratingly awful territory The actor is a disgrace. His timing is putrid. His tone of voice is like a harpy dancing up and down your spine. Heck, even his haircut stinks.<br/><br/>He ruins the movie.

","Fantastic Four joins Daredevil, Catwoman, Elektra, Hulk and all Batman movies except the first one and Batman Begins in the surge of disappointing superhero movies made in the past years. In the superhero/comic book movie genre this one does not compare well to other, more successful attempts such as X-Men (an obvious comparison and a much better movie in many ways), Batman and Batman Begins, Sin City and even Spider-Man. To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything larger than life to begin with, just an amusing ride, but found myself bored to death due to the shallow characters that give no texture for the viewer to become attached to and the run-of-the-mill storyline with its expectable ending. A complete waste of money in my opinion. I'd recommend the aforementioned movies or even Hellboy or Blade I/II instead."
"nobles-4","3","0","1","3 February 2006"," A huge let down.
","Now, let me say in advance that I'm a huge comic book fan, so I may be a tad biased. Fantastic Four was a huge let down. The Fantastic Four I grew up with are scientific explorers, chartering new and as of yet unexplored aspects of our universe, and often times fighting aliens and giant monsters in the process. The Fantastic Four comics are full of deep philosophical points and great characterization.<br/><br/>The movie, not so much.<br/><br/>One of the major problems is the liberties the movie takes with the material. Mainly with Dr. Doom. They completely changed the character. In the comics, he's the fascist dictator of the (very fictional) country of Latveria. He was an old college buddy of Reed Richards who he blames for the disfigurement that forces him to wear a mask all the time (even though it was his own fault). He's a scientific and tactical genius, and is pretty much one of the coolest villains Marvel comics ever created. In the movie, he's hardly even recognizable. He's a businessman who accompanies the four on their trip into space and gets super strength, electric powers, and metal skin. And his turn from just being a jerk to homicidal tendencies seems so random.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, the pacing is very rushed. It seems like everything is just going by so fast without slowing down to properly tell the story.<br/><br/>The fact that they never even showed the group getting back to earth from the space voyage that gave them their powers and just showed them waking up in the hospital was just annoying. Also, when Johnny Storm (played by Chris Evans) first manifested his powers, he was skiing with some woman. He burst into flames and crashed into a pile of snow, causing it to turn into a mini hot tub. Instead of the natural reaction of screaming and asking what the hell is going on, the woman just dropped her skis, implying that she was going to get in.<br/><br/>During the movie, Ben Grimm (played by Micheal Chiklis) returned to his fiancé. Since he was a giant rock man, she was understandably freaked out. But after he helped save several firemen from falling to their deaths, she handed the engagement ring back to him. Now, if your fiancé, rock monster or not, saved the lives of several firemen, would you just hand the ring back? I doubt it.<br/><br/>The jokes in this film were incredibly cheesy. They had this little comedy montage in the middle of the film that was completely pointless and did nothing to further the plot. The only good parts were Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm, and their interactions. Those parts were very well done.<br/><br/>However, in regards to Johnny Storm, I hated how, when he went of to enjoy his powers, he went to do a motto cross event. I was thinking ""wouldn't it be better if he went around the city playing superhero?"" But alas, the higher ups decided that it would be better to have him doing extreme sports to help bring in the younger demographics.<br/><br/>During the movie, Ben Grimm met a blind girl who didn't really care that he looked the way he did, and was nice to him. At the end of the movie, they were hanging off of each other like they had been dating for weeks. Obviously, there had been an intention to have more scenes between them included, but they were cut out.<br/><br/>Also, at the end, Dr. Doom was just allowed to be put on a boat headed to Europe, even though very shortly before that he was blowing up chunks of Time's Square. Now, he had been petrified by this point, but don't you think the police would have kept him in their custody just in case? All in all, this was a rather disappointing movie with several rather obvious plot holes, bad pacing, and little respect for the characters. Some people have praised this movie for not taking itself too seriously. I personally think that's this movie's biggest fault."

It wasn't one of those films where you had to think hard it was just a film that you laughed at and enjoyed. I was a bit annoyed that Julian McMahon's character the evil, powerful Victor Von Doom didn't get enough screen time. I understand the film mainly focuses on the four but he is so talented and can play evil down to a t.

","'Fantastic Four' is a first-rate Marvel comic book crammed into a second-rate F/X movie. Director Tim Story doesn't do anything funky with the material (ordinary people turned into freaks after a cosmic mishap in space) and he's given us one of the lamest villains since 'Star Trek: Nemesis'. Maybe Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is cool in print, but he blows violent chunks on the big screen. Super-stretchy Reed Richards and Sue Storm---also known as Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl---are not any better. At least Sue's brother, Johnny Storm (aka the Human Torch), uses his newfound fame to get girls...and more fame. He's one of the rare superheroes who actually ENJOYS being a superhero.<br/><br/>I didn't have much use for Reed Richards or Sue Storm. It doesn't help that these soft-soap characters are played by a reliable bore (Ioan Gruffudd) and a marginally talented beauty (Jessica Alba). At least Johnny is refreshing in his youthful exuberance and arrogance, even if he's also a bit of a doofus. On the other hand, I couldn't get enough of Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), better known as the Thing. This one character nearly saves the whole movie. I liked him so much, I went right out and bought the action figure. Now the ugly rock man proudly sits on my bookcase alongside the Buddy Christ, Marv from 'Sin City', and Yogi Bear.<br/><br/>The Thing is the thinking man's Incredible Hulk. Chiklis works hard to show the heart under a mountain of rock. He makes the most of his cumbersome makeup. I actually some genuine emotion for him 2 or 3 times. First, when he was given a well-deserved ovation from the crowd after saving some firemen and their truck from going off a bridge. And then when he gets kicked to the curb by his terrified wife. And once again at the end of the movie when he proves he'll sacrifice anything for his friends. A real hero. It's true that as a comic-to-movie adaptation, 'Fantastic Four' is more like the ""Fantastic 1 and a half"". But the Thing rocks. I've got his action figure to prove it."
"svendupuits","4","0","1","31 January 2006"," Superhero movie gone bad
","The Fantastic Four is the latest in a long line-up of recent superhero movies. These flicks were pretty much all over the scale; from the excellent Spiderman's, Hellboy and The Incredibles to the mediocre X-men to the pretty bad Daredevils of this world. Unfortunately, The Fantastic Four does not live up to it's pedigree.<br/><br/>The entire movie feels rushed, and with a playing time just over 90 minutes, it probably was. The story, unabashed, takes major leaps and bounds, effectively eliminating the tension-arch. A pretty clear example was the cosmic storm that was suddenly rushed in. Along these lines were many of the character-developments; Ben, after being transformed back to normal, jumps right in the cosmic-storm-simulator again to be transformed back to The Thing to save Reid. This was pretty unbelievable after several occasions where Ben clearly states he hates himself as The Thing, and blames Reid for not doing enough to cure him.<br/><br/>Some people have commented that these kind of shortcuts are taken because of the cartoony/comic book nature of the movie. I, however, beg to differ. Spiderman I and II showed that good and believable character development is no problem for a superhero(movie). It must be said that The Fantastic Four had to deal with 5 major characters and the movie would have probably benefited greatly from an extra half hour. At the end of the day the movie kept me glued to my seat, mainly to see how this movie was cramping' Stan Lee's style. <br/><br/>As far as superhero-movies go, there are much better out there."

On the plus side, it IS pretty, and Johnny is played perfectly."
"JimD73","3","0","1","27 January 2006"," Nothing Fantastic About It
","Well, after a big slump, comic book movies have made a comeback. This year already had a few entries. Batman Begins and Sin City were both exceptional, and Constantine was at least decent. Sure Elektra was also around for 2005, but we'll just forget that one exists. The final of the five major releases this year was The Fantastic Four. Now, Marvel had plenty of well-accepted conversions in the past (X-Men and Spider-Man for example), though others (like Hulk and The Punisher) didn't fare so well. Which side does The Fantastic Four fall on? The basic premise of The Fantastic Four, to make a brief comparison, is like that of The Hulk, except a little bit dumber. Basically, Dr. Reed Richards (Gruffudd) and his partner Ben Grimm (Chiklis) are a pair of scientists who have hit some hard times. When they find out that a cosmic storm is about to pass Earth, the employ the resources of billionaire Victor Von Doom (McMahon) to test out how it would affect human DNA by bringing a sample to his shielded space station. So, Reed, Ben and Victor head off to the space station, along with Victor's current flame, Sue Storm (Alba), who also happens to be Reed's ex. The final member of the team is Sue's brother Johnny (Evans), who, despite being an immature womanizer, is somehow a spaceship pilot. How he managed to become a pilot is unknown, though it does say that, in the future, we really must have lowered our standards. Also, why they send these five when it seems that Ben is the only one with space experience is a little puzzling.<br/><br/>Anyways, when they get there, the storm is apparently moving much faster than first thought, and they all get hit with it before the shields can react. This causes them all to get certain special powers. Ben turns into rock and gets intensified power. Sue can turn herself invisible and create force fields. Johnny can turn himself into fire and fly. Reed can stretch his body like a rubber band (surprisingly only one reference to his genitals, just for us Mallrats fans). The four of them become quick celebrities, dubbed the Fantastic Four by the press. Victor, on the other hand, sees his company go down the tubes due to the failure in the space station, and, with his power to control electricity, is now lashing out.<br/><br/>Victor never does get to wreak havoc like Norman Osborne (aka The Green Goblin) did in the first Spider-Man. In fact, no havoc is really wrought at all. It seems the whole movie is just about the four of them interacting until the final half hour, at which time Victor goes a little nutters. Up until then, we have absolutely zero action scenes, unless you count a big rescue scene early on.<br/><br/>So, what exactly fills this middle up? It mainly revolves around Grimm, aka The Thing, who is the only one of the four who cannot turn back to normal form. He is understandably ticked and Reed is trying to invent a machine to reverse the process and return Ben to normal. The other part of the movie revolves around Johnny, aka The Human Torch, who has taken to his powers and wants to exploit them to become a celebrity. It's all well and good in theory, but the lack of action really does hurt.<br/><br/>The other plot point, as you probably could have guessed, is the flame rekindling between Sue and Reed. It does seem obligatory, and overall just doesn't work. Gruffudd and Alba have very little chemistry together, making their romance just seem fleeting. Then you have to factor in the fact that Alba is far too young for the role. While Gruffudd is sporting some grey hair, Alba still looks in her mid-twenties, showing off plenty of cleavage and bleach-blond hair. Basically, she is the walking rack of the movie. Gruffudd isn't much better himself, showing that he is by no means a leading man. Chiklis is pretty good underneath the giant foam suit that is The Thing, and Evans, even if you have to hate his character's guts, does a decent job as the a-hole of the four.<br/><br/>The movie could at least be a little better if it took itself even a little bit serious. Grimm's torment and Johnny's ego are both subjects that could be dealt with in a way that actually affects the audience. The way that it decides to go is basically as a huge comedy, with lame jokes everywhere (mainly spouted out by Evans), only of which one or two are actually grin-worthy. Especially annoying is one sequence that seems like something that would fit better in an episode of The Real World. This feels less like a comic book movie and more like a wannabe spoof.<br/><br/>Well, the best thing I can say about The Fantastic Four is that it as at least tolerable. I can sit through it without gagging much, unlike some other comic books movies, such as Hulk or Batman & Robin. Still, there really is no value to seeing this either. It completely lacks on action, the jokes are lame, the acting is mediocre and the plot is pretty ridiculous. It's not necessarily what a comic book movie shouldn't be, even if it does contain a lot of aspects that say otherwise, but it has nothing that a comic book movie should have.

","for a superhero movie, this one wasn't fantastic. but I'm sure it was a hell of a lot better then the other version floating around at comic book shows. me, I'm not a big fantastic four fan. never really read the comics. i was more of a superman batman guy, but, i never hated marvel, and i always liked how each superhero had there own issue to deal with.<br/><br/>for me, fantastic four was a decent flick. Sure, it was entertaining, and at times exciting, but when compared to other great marvel films (both spiderman's, both xmens), its more eh! marvel seems to have a hit or miss with there comic movies. you get great ones like both spidermen and xmen, and you get misses, like the hulk, punisher, and daredevil. Personally i like them all, and they are all entertaining, its just some, like hulk, could have been better if it took a different approach. daredevil as well, i found it to be very entertaining, just, not the best comic book film ever.<br/><br/>overall fantastic four is not fantastic. its good! worth checking out, although i doubt it will be in the place of honor on my DVD shelf"

","Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic, the leader of the four), Jessica Alba as Sue Storm (The Invisible Girl), Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm (The Thing) and Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom (Dr. Doom) did a great job with a slack script. However, Chris Evans had the cool character and played him flawlessly and Michael Chiklis, who wore a thick body suit, played his character with so much feeling that you could sense his pain, sorrow, and happiness. The top applause should go to Mr. Chiklis.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the Fantastic Four. When I was a kid I tried to read the comic books but it never caught my interest - neither did Spiderman. The hero's I liked the best were the Green Lantern (the original only), Superman (who doesn't?), and Captain America. So I wasn't a fan, but this movie seemed to me to be true to the original characters and the theme of the comics. I also really enjoyed how they adeptly brought the characters into the 21st century.<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent, and the Four's interaction was well played. 8/10.<br/><br/>-Zafoid"

","Well, I just watched the movie on DVD last night for the second time, since my first time was at the movies, because 1st- I am a huge fan of comics, not necessarily F.F., and 2nd a big budget movie came out, so I went to support. What a bad movie, and last night I gave it another chance and it got worse. The best thing about this movie is the special effects, except Reed Richard's stretching effects. The acting is pretty bad and most of the time it is the director's fault. The extras on the DVD is about the special effects, and it has nothing to do with the content of the movie, and I think they know that there was no content, so the best thing they could do is talk about special effects- well big deal. If you want special effects AND content, go see King Kong! I see that there is an F.F.2 in works...I REALLY don't understand why! Spider-Man & X-Men...sure, but this movie needs to be buried."

","Fantastic Four is the story of five scientists who travel into space, and after being blasted by cosmic rays, gain special powers. Reed Richards can stretch any part of his body to any length. Susan Storm can turn invisible and fire force fields. Johnny Storm can generate flame. Ben Grimm has turned into a giant rocky creature with amazing strength. Victor Von Doom can generate electricity. As the four main heroes try to find the cure for their powers, Doom becomes power hungry and turns evil.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is one of those movies that's not meant to be taken seriously. It's for pure popcorn entertainment, and it accomplishes that very well. The movie has a good blend of humour, drama, and action. Some parts are kind of corny, but that can go for any film.<br/><br/>The cast is good. Ioan Gruffud, Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, and Michael Chiklis do good in their roles, and Julian Macmahon is awesome as Doom...Until he gets into costume, and he starts to overact a bit.<br/><br/>My main problem is the story. The movie captures the tension between the four, and Ben's stress with what he's become very well. However, it focuses way too much on that, and all the action in the movie is reserved for the last 15 minutes. Doom doesn't even appear in all his comic book glory until the end, and it's disappointing. Also, the Fantastic Four fight to save themselves at the end, and not for the lives of innocent people, like most superheroes.<br/><br/>The movie makes for a fun watch, but if you're looking for a serious film, this isn't it. 6.5/10"

And after terrific superhero action films such as BATMAN BEGINS, SPIDER-MAN 2, and X2, FANTASTIC FOUR is just a crippling, abysmal, and believe it or not, ""cheaply-made"" trifle that can't generate any steam whatsoever. The action sequences are dull, the actors (especially Alba and Evans) are awful, though the studio, with the miracles of airbrush and heavy make-up, make them look really pretty, the writing sucks, and the direction is some of the worst seen since BATTLEFIELD EARTH. So I hope you all hate me by now! FANTASTIC FOUR is a wasted mess and in every sense of the word, uninspiring. There is not a single cliché the film overcomes, therefore if any film wins my vote for Worst Picture of 2005 during the Razzies, it's this junkie, messy piece of gloss. Grade (D-)"

","I was excited about this, and why not? Super hero films give us a blatant excuse at immersing ourselves in an action film we might otherwise end up over-criticising. Spider-Man and Xmen are still films I can watch over and over again....but this film is a mess. <br/><br/>We have an action film, where action, in the true sense happens only in the last 15 minutes of the film, so its left entirely to the characters to carry the film. And its a pity because you couldn't care less about any of them, they all descend into clichés, with whom you cant identify with. I challenge anyone who says they felt for Ben Grimm/Thing or that the film had a credible bad guy. Julian McMahon's Von Doom is the worst acting I've seen for some time. And there was absolutely no love presence between the actors playing Reed and Sue. A shame because Ioan Gruffudd can act, but he was ill advised to be part of this rubbish.<br/><br/>Add to this poor special effects, no tangible plot - other than leading to some defined sequel in the future and you have one of the most over-inflated disaster movies of the year. Take my advice and stick with Xmen and Spiderman."
"DonFishies","5","0","2","4 January 2006"," Watchable, but only barely.
","I wanted to like this movie. I did. Yes, I knew it was supposed to be fairly bad, but I still wanted to enjoy it. And really, you can't, because it's a terribly flawed movie. <br/><br/>The dialog is silly. <br/><br/>The special effects are good in small doses, especially for when the Human Torch is doing his thing. But when Mr. Fantastic starts stretching? Get ready for something horrendous. The Thing is clearly too short to really be the Thing (I don't care if Vic Mackey wanted no CGI or not), and the story really has a rough time trying to make us feel for him. His wife just gets up and leaves, no question? What the hell? And then they try to humanize him more with the blind black chick, only to have her on screen for a total of 5 minutes? Come on.<br/><br/>The acting is alright, and unfortunately the only person who could really do anything was Chris Evans, since he gets all the best dialog in the movie, and clearly is a great choice for Johnny Storm. Everyone else just gets stuff modest at best.<br/><br/>What really makes the movie all the worse however, is the fact that a lot of it is too comedic for its own good. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies work because they have just the right dose of comedy, camp, action and realism. Fantastic 4 has far too much comedy, not enough action, next to no realism, and gets campy way too often. But that's what they get for getting the director of Barbershop to do this.<br/><br/>And oh Jesus, I haven't gotten to the best part: Jessica Alba in some of the worst casting in history. She is not Sue Storm. While there may be problems with the rest of the casting, this is just unspeakable. You can't help this choice at all. She's no scientist, and she barely works as anything else either, let alone as the Invisible Woman. It becomes obvious that she's only there for eye candy when she randomly strips during the bridge sequence to help move attention away from The Thing. For one, she's wearing a thong (I'll make a slight assumption here, but doing all that work in the lab all day really helps me figure scientists do not wear thongs), and she's Jessica Alba. She worked as a stripper in Frank Miller's Sin City, but there, she wasn't brainy, and wasn't a real amazing person there. She's supposed to be here...and isn't. Go back to your day job as the sex appeal honey.<br/><br/>But is it watchable? Yes, but only barely. The story is still there, and the whole hype of the media fascination with them is something that is only half explained in other comic book films (I want more of J. Jonah Jameson Raimi!), and is more touched on here. Plus, some of the things that really don't work, are given some time to try throughout the film. And come on, the cameo by Stan Lee is enough for people to see it. And it was definitely amusing to see both Ben Mulroney and Maria Menunos showing up.<br/><br/>A good polish of the script, less comedy, better casting, and nicer CGI would have made this a worthy contender for a good comic book movie. But unfortunately, has to sit it out and wait for the sequel in order to even potentially be thought of as ""great"". <br/><br/>5.5/10."

","I'm not as big a comic book fan as I used to be but I'm pretty familiar with Marvel characters. I don't have any problem with CERTAIN things about the comic book being changed for entertainment purposes or whatever. However, I think they took too long to develop the characters and just get down to the fighting so they could really display how FANTASTIC their powers are supposed to be. The characters were cast well...no problems there...but why all the jokes, if you call them that. I think those that take on Marvel projects in the future should take notes from X-Men and Spiderman. While they obviously have their fair share of jokes...they get down to the nitty gritty in terms of developing a real plot and action. Fantastic Four was OK for a summer movie...but that's about it. When the sequel does come out...I hope they don't focus on jokes again with Human Torch. He is so powerful to let his character go to waste. I'm not saying his character wasn't played well 'cause it was but he can do a lot more. I must say though...the special effects were done very well.<br/><br/>The tagline for this movie was ""Prepare for the Fantastic"". Well..I'm still preparing.

","Most Marvel Comics' fans complain that The Incredibles ripped-off The Fantastic Four, and while they are right, when it comes to the movies, The Incredibles was entertaining while Fantastic Four was not. Fantastic Four relies on one-liners and special effects to carry the movie, not trusting the story and bombarding the viewer with quick scenes and supposedly funny lines. Cheap jokes about an invisible girl can only go so far, even for the target audience of pre-pubescent boys. The radiation cloud of doom inflicts unknown damage to five scientists who travel to space in hopes of finding the key to life, rendering each person with radioactive powers. Michael Chiklis, who is usually a good actor, gets very little to do in this movie expect to sulk around and say dumb things like ""It's clobberin' time"" or ""Look at me, I'm huge!"" as The Thing, and his talents are wasted. Jessica Alba was good as the cute starlet in Sin City, is adequate here as The Invisible woman, while her brother is some guy who catches on fire (Chris Evans) and hates the fact that he cannot use his powers to pick up chicks. He is by far the most annoying character in the movie. The other super hero is Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) who tries to find the cure to the super hero problem while trying to figure out his relationship with the women of his life. The evil doer is again a Darth Vader like manipulator, this time it's Dr. Doom (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon), and like most movies, the villain is the most interesting character in the movie. His motivations are clear, and all of his actions relate to his wants as a selfish business mogul. The movie isn't bad, it's just predictable and at times boring. The special effects are solid, though lack any thrills. Perhaps for the inevitable sequel, the movie-makers will give the Fantastic Four more to do than just utter one-liners. If they want to know how it's done, they should go rent The Incredibles."

","When I am in the mood for escapist fun, movies from comic books is one of my favorite genres. Superman, Batman, Spiderman, X-Men, and a few others have all made into superbly entertaining movies. I am not familiar with the Fantastic 4, so I viewed this movie as a neophyte. I enjoyed it very nicely, especially because Jessica Alba is in it. I became a fan of hers in the Dark Angel TV series and, even though she isn't an outstanding actress, she does OK and is just great fun to watch. <br/><br/>So the story here is 5 astronauts are on a mission when some sort of cosmic radiation cloud sweeps over them. At first, after they get back to base, it appears that no harm was done. However, eventually they all begin to change from ""altered DNA"" such that they each develop a different ""fantastic power."" Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) had been on a space walk and thus was most exposed, so he became very heavy and very strong as a man who looks like a collection of small boulders. Sue Storm (Alba) gets the power to become invisible, her brother Johnny can burst into flames and fly by jet propulsion. Reed becomes elastic, can stretch long distances. But the 5th person, Victor Von Doom, becomes the evil villain. So much of the rest of the movie had the Fantastic 4 in battle against Von Doom who wants to eradicate them and be in sole power. <br/><br/>SPOILERS. In a final showdown in the street, the four combine their powers to get Von Doom very hot, then quench him with water, to turn him into an immobile metal man. In the end we see him, a statue of sorts, being loaded into a shipping crate then sailing off to parts unknown, along with many other crates. However, we glimpse a sign of life from his crate, setting up the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>(Note: Kerry Washington who plays Alicia Masters looks so much like star Jerssica Alba, they could be twins.)"

","Far from being anything near fantastic, ""Four"" is mediocre in every way. The acting ranges from great, to OK, to just plain crap. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm give their roles the comic book justice they so rightfully deserve. Watching Evans as the Human Torch makes me want him to meet good old' Spidey some time in a later film (if you don't know they are good friends in the comics.) Also kudos has to be given to Chiklis for wanting a suit rather then CGI, looks a lot better. Jessica Alba just shows up and looks good, not saying that's a bad thing but she wouldn't be my first pick as Sue Storm. But Ioan Gruffudd's Reed Richards needs some work. He plays this role just so completely bland that I want to walk up him during the movie and slap him across the face. There is no emotion on his face...ever. I fight not to fall asleep every time he shows up, but more kudos have to be given to him and his great American accent. Watching the DVD features I found out he has a strong British accent which surprised me. Julian McMahon is alright as Doom, though like Gruffudd I would like to see more in a sequel.<br/><br/>The script feels like it was written by a middle schooler. There is no real plot after everybody receives their powers and has just terrible lines (Call me Doom.) The story is all setup but we never get a compelling story, nothing tangible. Tim Story's direction needs some serious help. I understand that he was picked to show a dysfunctional family, but the action scenes were very choppy and had no style to them. The FX isn't terrible, the Human Torch was nice on the eyes but Story's direction really destroys the impact of the effects. This is a ""B"" grade superhero flick with an ""A"" grade superhero budget. I am saddened to hear everybody who was involved behind the scenes are coming back for the sequel. Maybe this time they will be able to create a better film.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is still somehow enjoyable though, kind of like a bad horror movie. It's not the greatest superhero movie ever made, but were we really expecting that?"

","As one of the precious few that actually saw the bootleg Roger Corman train-wreck from the early 90's, I'm glad to say that the 2005 movie is a vast improvement and is lots of fun. I'm not an expert on these Marvel heroes, but I do know the story and background and I thought they did a nice job and had some fun with it.<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with these characters, you have 5 scientists who all have their DNA altered when a space experiment goes haywire. Reed Richards can now stretch his body to incredible lengths, Sue Storm can become invisible, Johnny Torch (?) can fly and become fire, while poor Ben Grimm turns into a walking rock pile known as the Thing. The 5th scientist becomes evil, and Dr. Doom is born. The metamorphosis of these guys are done with humor and toung in cheek.<br/><br/>The acting in Fantastic Four is really nothing special to say the least and the story is loaded with plot holes, but were not talking Shakespeare here. This is a popcorn film. I think if F4 was done on a more serious level, like the Corman version, this movie would be a disaster. Buts it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's more like the Spider-Man films and not as serious as the X-Men films. For the comic book geek who likes their heroes to stay true to their origins and story lines, they'll probably hate F4. For the fan of a good popcorn film, this film is a good time. (***)"
"MaxBorg89","6","0","1","21 December 2005"," Neither fantastic nor appalling
","Tricky thing, adapting comic-books: you can get a masterpiece like Spider-Man 2 or Batman Begins, but also a load of rubbish like Batman & Robin. Fantastic Four, based on Marvel's oldest creation, falls somewhere in between: it lacks that special something that made Sam Raimi and Chris Nolan's work unmissable, but has enough good material to elevate it above the utter silliness of Joel Schumacher's Bat-flick.<br/><br/>Given the source comic is the most kid-friendly of the Marvel stable, director Tim Story wisely keeps the plot simple: five people doing research in space find themselves exposed to cosmic rays and almost die. Once back on Earth, they discover the radiations altered their DNA, giving them superhuman abilities: Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can stretch any part of his body as if it were rubber; Susan Storm (Jessica Alba) can become invisible and generate force fields; her brother Johnny (Chris Evans) is able to turn himself into a living flame, hence his superhero name Human Torch; Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed's best friend, has had his skin replaced with an exoskeleton made of rock, meaning he has superhuman strength and is substantially invulnerable. Unfortunately, he is also the only one of the four who can't ""turn off"" his power, a discovery that makes him very angry and resentful. This prompts Reed to look for a cure with Susan's help, whereas Johnny just wants to have fun. Soon enough, though, they will have to join forces against the fifth member of the space trip, Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), whose lust for absolute power is making him do increasingly monstrous things.<br/><br/>Well, not so monstrous, perhaps: the PG-rating keeps the violence on a very harmless level, making the movie very similar to the comics in terms of tone, although that doesn't mean the action looks less spectacular than usual. What is less accomplished than usual, on the other hand, is the writing and character development: that the movie spends a lot of time explaining things is expected, almost acceptable actually, as this will make the possible sequel free to plunge straight into the action; even so, however, the writers must think most viewers have a flawed attention span, as they have Reed or Susan repeat the same thing (""The space storm radically altered the structure of our DNA..."" and related gibberish) at least five times in a fifteen-minute time-frame.<br/><br/>Another problem is the leading roles: Gruffudd and Alba do their best, but even that isn't much when their characters are given few relevant things to do or say and the relationship between them is essentially based on embarrassed looks and cheesy dialogue. The whole thing is made more surprising by the fact that one of the film's writers is Mark Frost, who managed to craft intelligent story lines on Twin Peaks but seems incapable of handling a simple romance in this case.<br/><br/>The last significant defect is the villain: a respectable presence on paper, Dr. Doom is robbed of any charm on screen, partly because the script makes him little more than a Green Goblin clone (case in point: the scene where he offs several business partners is taken almost shot for shot from the first Spider-Man), partly because McMahon ends up playing him that way, failing to give the character that original mix of suaveness and amorality he effortlessly masters on Nip/Tuck.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the two people comic-readers love the most happen to be the best thing in the movie as well: the Thing doesn't only look very realistic (the reason being a suit was used instead of CGI), he's also got a solid story arc, ably supported by Chiklis, one of the American small screen's recent revelations (The Shield), while Evans nails the Torch's wisecracking, energetic personality with an ease that is missing in Gruffudd and Alba's performances. Whenever those two are on screen, pulling pranks on each other or delivering their instantly recognizable catchphrases (Ben Grimm's ""It's clobberin' time!"" being particularly delightful to hear), the picture gets back on track, albeit only for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Overall, not incredibly bad but not that memorable either. Here's hoping the next installment will have more speaking in its favor."

","Taking its place in the parade of comic book super heroes turned big budget movie, The Fantastic Four was a comic book waiting to be filmed. It had all the right ingredients: interesting characters that had undergone some kind of change giving them super powers, an evil associate that turns completely on those once considered his friends, romance between characters, dazzling, perhaps over-used CGI effects, lots of destruction, humorous super hero when more than one super hero is used at one time, and the list goes on. While it just doesn't have the heart and tenacity of either of the two Spiderman movies or the visual splendor or acting range of the other super hero ensemble X-Men series, The Fantastic Four is a pretty good film that delivers entertainment if nothing else. It should appease the die-hard Fantastic Four fans with its characterizations being very closely done with the comics in mind and the story following much of the comics as well. Ioan Gruffudd plays Reed Richards and brings stability, believability, and presence to what many think is a somewhat thankless role as Mr. Fantastic ""Stretch."" Gruffudd's stable force helps counteract some of the other acting ranges. Jessica Alba plays Sue Storm. She is pretty to be sure - and probably the weakest of the quartet in terms of acting ability. It seems to be really hurting her huh? Yeah, right! She's blonde, she's curvy, and she can really fill out a skin-tight super hero outfit. Johnny Storm is played by the youthful and enthusiastic Chris Evans. His performance is the lighter side of the four and funny. The scene where is is playing with a doll of the Thing was amusing. And that brings us to the best of the four, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm, the heart and soul of this film. Chiklis gives a lot to this performance and his characterization makes this movie more than just a super hero movie loaded with special effects - which it is but has a bit more to it as well. I really liked the special effects they used with the Thing where director Tim Story(what a great last name for a director!)decided to go with a costume for Grimm rather than make him totally CGI like used in The Hulk. In that film, the Hulk was impersonal and not believable; here, the Thing is very believable and Chiklis is able to act in the suit and show a whole range of emotions. If this process had been used in Ang Lee's mega-disaster, maybe it would have been somewhat decent. OK, I know I am STRETCHING things now. Anyway, The Fantastic Four is a formula super hero movie but an enjoyable one and should spawn many a sequel. And once again, let's give the most credit for this film, Spiderman, the X-Men, and so on where it is due - Thank You so very much Stan Lee!"

The main actors are all good and hard working, but there is no reason to care about the characters they play. The ones that come closest to being meaningful are the bad guy Victor and the ""good"" guy Ben, but in general each of the five (f4 and bad guy) have such trite, myopic, and annoyingly self-absorbed world views that any sympathy you can have for them is atrophied long before the first big boom in the movie.<br/><br/>And just in case you are interested, don't go looking for any beguiling views of Jessica Alba in her form-fitting costume. The entire movie doesn't have even one.

","Year 2000: X-Men comes out, the first major Marvel moovie in a long time. BLAM, it's a hit, we have guys like Magneto and Professor X and Wolverine brought to life, people loved it, and Hugh Jackman's career gets a boost. 2002: X-2 comes out, same thing. In the meantime, we saw Spidey and The Hulk come to life, and we also saw The Punisher ""Punish"" John Travolta. Heh. And people liked these films, and the parade of Marvel Heroes coming to life was extended to The Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>So, what exactly went wrong here? To my eyes, nothing. The characters ARE The Thing, Mr Fantastic, Sue Storm, and The Human Torch. Dr Doom, when in fact he becomes Dr. Doom, IS Dr. Doom. Hey, I believed it. But a lot of people, say they did not. Why? Well, it may be a thing to do with the pacing of the film: To my first viewing, the beginning seemed rushed. They told that part of the story too fast. What the heck DID happen in space? I see that people would get confused if not already familiar with the story. Is that it? I heard that there was an indication that a better Sue Storm could have been cast. Well, either these people are blind, or Jessica Alba really IS invisible. I vote that they are blind. A lot of people did not think Dark Angel was invisible, I certainly did not. And I did not think that The Invisible ""Girl"" would have been better cast. Not being a collector, but being a comic book fan and being familiar with the 4antastic 4, I believed it: I had no trouble assigning The Invisible ""Girl"" to Jessica Alba. So, that will probably get a hostile response, but so what? She was great.<br/><br/>And the same goes with the rest of the cast, down to Stan Lee doing HIS cameo. Chiklis, as far as I am concerned, will forever be The Thing. He's got the look, and he's got the Voice, and IT'S CLOBBERIN TIME. I believed that he stopped a truck, and I believed it was The Brooklyn Bridge, and I SAW Reed Richards stretch down and save a fireman. I SAW Sue Storm throw a shield around a fire, and I believed it, twice. (Thrice, cos I am watching it again as I type this).<br/><br/>And when it came down for us to discover the characters, in this moovie form of the 4-4, I saw many years of Comic Book lore put right in front of my eyes. What was wrong with it? As far as I am concerned, nothing. But some Marvel Purists, will maybe agree with me that the beginning, the origin of the 4-4 was told too fast, and they may also find fault with the ""discovery"" portion of the film which granted, takes a large amount of the film. But to true believers, this is what happened. As far as the story following the comic book, this was closer than The X-Men, it was closer than Spidey's tale told by Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>So, is it the director's fault? Should they have given the task to a veteran? I don't think that was the problem either, on a personal level, I believed the characters, they acted the way I expected them to act. Reed is a geek. Grimm is from The Bronx. Johnny is reckless and insane, and does not do what he is told, and Sue is complicated, and Alba certainly has that down pat, she can't be read in the first half of the film.<br/><br/>The problem, then, if a story suffers, then it suffers in the script, and we had a big Hole between Doom and the 4-4. The way this was told, Richards should have caught on immediately that not all was copacetic with Von Doom. In that regard, Richards was an idiot. But Richards is a dolt when it comes to women, not scientific observation, so he would not have missed what was going on with Von Doom. So: The middle of the story could have been told a bit better, and more developed. I mean, how much of a story do you have with people who have put themselves in confinement? Well, I hope that is not considered a spoiler.<br/><br/>As far as spoiling this moovie for anyone who has not watched it: I will not say that the images in the moovie are well composed, the CGI is there, but not real obvious, and some things that you think are CGI are real and some things that you think are real, are CGI. I will not say to the comic book collector that loves images, that they will get their hearts desire with how this production LOOKS in comparison to what we saw when our first issue of 4-4 was bought in... 1960? Whenever the series came out. No, I will not say that. I will also not say, that maybe this story was told FAST, cos they wanted to get to the sequel FAST, to tell the story that the 4-4 are famous for. Know what I mean? Naw, I won't say that! I will say that I enjoyed this twice in a row (and I believe I already said that) and I think that the Fans, who just want to enjoy this as it is told, will enjoy it, given the chance.<br/><br/>Nuff Sed!"
"stefano73","9","0","1","15 December 2005"," A very good prequel
","Hi, I'm an Italian fan of FF. I read all their adventures,since Lee/Kirby period (I believe that their best adventures are between #45-#99 (""the golden age"")). I think that the true group's psychological profile is best described in that production (maybe only Byrne added the right profile to Sue, who became a wonderful and powerful warrior!). Well, all this considered, I must look at this movie as a very good prequel for the following reasons: 1) the character of Mr.Fantastic does not correspond to the brave scientist that is depicted in the ""golden age"". He looks like a nerd, (maybe, the Reed told in Ultimate FF); in FF2 his profile must become tougher. 2) FF comics are not conceived for pure entertainment: it seems that a lot of people enjoyed the ""gags"" in FF movie like if the F4 were comedians! FF's stories are stories of bravery, of drama, of anguish, of pain. I'm sure that in FF 2 the authors must consider the true nature of the group. 3) in FF movie the special FX are very good. Unfortunately there aren't many (for budget reasons I suppose)! There aren't many struggles and battles (i.e.: like if it were a prequel)!! 4) it was more important to take people to the cinema than making a good plot (imagine to translate in FF2 the Silver Surfer / Galactus Saga (#48) or the first engage with Annhilus (FF annuals) in the Negative Zone!!What a great movie!!). So the director and the author must have preferred to put in the first movie a light plot and many gags between Ben and Johnny rather that a dramatic story. In fact, they did a wonderful prequel!"

","A ride to outer space to witness a cosmic storm to experiment on human DNA goes bad when the storm appears earlier than predicted and has life changing effects on the DNA of the crew. Oh, oh! <br/><br/>Yes, this should have stayed a comic book fantasy or maybe someone else should have put this together. There was something very wrong from the very beginning to the very end. Remember when we used to watch some movies and we would see the mouth move and hear the words a little later on? Well, this wasn't exactly like that, but close enough. The dialogues were all low-key and monotone as though the actors were rehearsing lines instead of being in a movie with the cameras running. Maybe a lot of the dialogue was dubbed in later. Anyway, something was wrong.<br/><br/>The Fantastic Four were: the girl who could become invisible (Alba); the Hulk creature called the Thing(Chiklis); the Plastic Man (Gruffudd); and the Human Torch (Evans). Affected but not one of the good guys was Dr. Doom (McMahon) who interfaced with metals.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects were very good, some were not and it showed. Most of the movie was taken up with the bickering among the Fan-4 and this became most annoying leaving us to wonder when the story would start. Well, there really was no story here and everything was an identity crisis among all.<br/><br/>I don't recall this as a comic book, but I probably would have liked it far better then what I viewed on the DVD. And, the worse thing about all this is that there may be sequels. OMG!"
"patronise","2","0","1","13 December 2005"," A terrible, but bearable film
","The spoiler is just that the heroes beat the villain. But I figure I'd better warn people all the same. So now you can read on without any fear.<br/><br/>Given that Fantastic Four went down to a megre two screens a day after the first week, I had very low expectations for this film when my brother rented it on DVD. Yet I still managed to be disappointed. I was never a fan of the comics. Sure I owned a few copies, but I never read them. The reason? There far better super heroes out there. At least the film conveys this aspect of the comics well. The Invisible Girl is no match for Violet of The Incredibles who shared the same super powers. Sure, The Incredibles came some years after the comics, but Pixars film is far better. Also, her need to control her emotions to channel her powers is just too similar to Storm of the X-Men. But enough about their powers, the characters themselves were just bland. The screenwriter wasn't able to develop a total of five lead characters who all need to discover their powers and deal with them in a substantial way. Instead, the film relies on the characters dialogue to spout about how they feel, rather that show how they develop and adjust in any significant way. Not to mention the actors are bland, unable to inject any charm or compassion into their characters. They seem to be relying on the special effects to convey their characters - and the CGI is second rate to better films such as Spiderman or Sin City. But the biggest grievance I have - and it's a biggie - is that the main appeal of a comic book film adaption is to see the heroes conflict and battle with the villain, and eventually triumph after going through a life changing development that gives them the strength to kick ass. If you're going to deviate from this formula, your name had better be Christopher Nolan, who put off the reveal of Batman until an hour into the film. But this film was not directed by Nolan. The main conflict of the film comes from within the heroes ranks as they argue with one another and deal with their powers in different ways. But an argument between superheroes isn't the most cinematic of events. And then there's the finale - the Fantastic Fours' ONE and ONLY battle with Dr. Doom. They win of course. ON THEIR FIRST BATTLE. It all seems so pointless after all this build up with the heroes inner turmoil and the Dr. Doom rising up to assume his position as the villain that it should end so abruptly. Very disappointing. Of course, the last scene implies that it may not be over for Dr. Doom, but given the box of success (or lack of) and the quality (or lack of) for this film, I doubt we'll be seeing Fantastic Four 2 anytime soon."
"djecatepec","8","0","1","12 December 2005"," Where's Dr. Doom?
","Well, while not truly great it wasn't a total washout either. The Fantastic Four were actually the ""flagship"" for the early Marvel Comics. As such the personalities of their leader, Reed Richards and their arch-nemesis, Dr. Doom, were vital. Unfortunately while Ben Grimm, Johnny and Sue Storm were brilliantly portrayed, Reed Richards ends up an unsympathetic, almost pathetically anemic character and the real Dr. Doom never even makes an appearance. Viktor von Doom was always my favorite Marvel character. Never simply just a villain, always more complex, even misunderstood and more tragic than truly evil. He never lived in the US, never had an American corporation, never employed the other four, never had a ""thing"" for Sue Storm and was NEVER truly defeated by the Four. Stymied, delayed, annoyed, sure but never defeated. Totally without super powers, he was yet Marvel's most intelligent, powerful and dangerous adversary (aside from the omnipotent alien, ""Galacticus."") That is my one real complaint of the movie, the total absence of the real Viktor von Doom!"

Ben Grim says ""I can stand his (Johnny's) blond ambition ...."" but the actor who plays Johnny isn't blond. Obviously casting forgot that Johnny is suppose to be a blond.<br/><br/>The plot line makes no sense. Do you expect Doom to propose to Sue w/o having ANY previous relationship with her? We find this out later when Sue confesses there NEVER was a Doom and Sue. This is the 21st century. A guy like Doom isn't going to propose marriage w/o any previous romantic relationship. Still another flub: Ben breaks out of his hospital room and heads straight for his girlfriend. Why didn't he just call her from the hospital? There are many other goofs.<br/><br/>Character arc? well its more like a straight line to dulls-ville.<br/><br/>About the only thing this movie has going for it is the special effects.

"brad-draper","8","0","4","7 December 2005"," This Film Is A Pleasant Surprise
","The Fantastic Four - A DVD Movie Review<br/><br/>The genre of super heros changed dramatically from the cartoonish 1950's DC ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" 10 cent comics, to the mid 1960's in a more human and realistic tale of real people thrust upon the responsibility of one day being, just regular folk--and then tomorrow--super heros, when Marvel comics created the ""Fantastic Four.""<br/><br/>From the ""Fantastic Four"" many other stories of human emotion were thrust upon the then typically susceptible teenage angst with such other super heros, that didn't want to be imbued with super powers. It was just that destiny bestowed upon these fantasy figures a great responsibility. It started with the ""Fantastic Four"", but then there was ""Spiderman"", the ""X-Men"", ""Hulk"", ""Daredevil"", ""Ironman"", and ""Captain America"" and more. These legends on pulp paper are the stuff of my teenage hero worship.<br/><br/>Recently to my delight, Hollywood has converted many of these Marvel heros of my youth to film. Some of these movies work. Some don't. That works include ""Spiderman"", the ""X-Men"" series, ""Elektra"", and now the original ""Fantastic Four.""<br/><br/>This film is a pleasant surprise. Generally given Luke warm reviews, I found it to be absolutely grounded in the comic book legend, albeit upgraded to today's time. The ""Fantastic Four"" were four people that were, through coincidence thrown together, altered by cosmic rays, to possess diverse but great powers. Although these powers were different, and their personalities clashed in this story (and in the comics too), ultimately they formed that fantasy of super hero story making: The Super Hero Team.<br/><br/>The script is pretty good. The cast is a bit young, except for Ben Grimm, but it works. And the villain in Dr. Doom is not a sissy. Dr. Doom is a really bad, scary, murderous, and powerful guy and like the ""X-Men's"" Magneto he needs to be explored more. It is somewhat refreshing to watch this kind of film and look at good and bad as black and white. A side note is, that a great weakness in the Spiderman movies--is that the bad guy is really a good guy, boo hoo, I feel sorry for him--not! No, in comic book genre, the villain must be totally evil and the hero(s) must triumph over this ultimate evil.<br/><br/>As far as the special effects go, they are really good and some unique. Sue Storm as the Invisible Girl works in invisibility and in her force field (although Jessica Alba is too young for the part but never mind--she is so beautiful), Johnny Storm as the Human Torch scorches in attitude and flame, and the CGI and prosthesis form that builds Ben Grimm's orange rock creature The Thing is outstanding. Reed Richard's Mr. Fantastic's stretching is the hardest effect to do, and in certain scenes it works well but in some it looks kind of cheesy.<br/><br/>Regardless, all in all I really liked this film and recommend it. By the way, the villain, Dr. Doom survives, to suggest menace another day (a necessary comic book commodity), and as this was essentially a super hero ""origin"" film I full expect another ""Fantastic Four"" movie. <br/><br/>The extras on the DVD were average and the DVD transference was a bit dark - not bad but a little muddy. <br/><br/>Now, I am just waiting for an intelligent ""Captain America"" and ""Ironman"" Marvel film to be made.<br/><br/>P.S. The Great Stan Lee, creator of the comic ""Fantastic Four"" did a cameo in ""The Fantastic Four"" as a mailman. Sweet. But you gotta be a comic book geek to get that one."

After seeing Fantastic Four, I thought it was a really great movie, and not just thrown together sloppily like a lot of other recent movies that I've seen. I found that in most of the negative reviews for Fantastic Four, people were complaining about ""not enough action."" But I don't see why they would, because this movie had enough of it as it is...besides if a movie has too much action, and a bad story, then it probably wouldn't be as good.

Now for the record I have nothing against the FF4-they can stop Dr. Doom any day of the week as far as I'm concerned and the action in this movie is actually not as bad as everything else. Here's a tip to directors of superhero movies: comic nerds like to see their heroes fight-not just sit around and do nothing for seventy minutes. This movie is bad at worst and generic at best.

"lemon_magic","6","0","1","8 October 2005"," Solid, well made superhero adventure,but lacks the ""epic"" quality of X-Men or ""Spider-Man""
","To put things in perspective, imagine how you (as a fan of superhero themed movies) would have felt if there had been no ""Spider-Man 1 and 2"" or ""X-Men 1 and 2"", and this movie had come out in the long hiatus following the disastrous, embarrassing bombs that were ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Superman IV: The Quest For Peace"". I am sure that you would have been delighted beyond all reckoning with the quality of the story, acting, and SFX in ""Fantastic Four"". <br/><br/>Seriously, this is a well made movie with excellent acting, a decent story line, and reasonably satisfying sets, costumes and effects. I've followed the comic since its heyday with Lee and Kirby, and even picked up the two ""Ultimate Fantastic Four"" collections (featuring modern day revamps of the characters free of 35+ years of Marvel continuity demands), and I felt that the movie did a respectable job of conveying the characters & family dynamics that are the heart of the FF storyline. So yes, it's a fine movie, and if X-Men and Spidey hadn't set the bar so high, this movie would have set the high water mark for all superhero efforts to follow. It certainly beats the kitty-litter out of ""Catwoman"" and ""Daredevil"". (Although I liked ""Daredevil"" just fine -say 6.5 out of 10.)<br/><br/>How and where the does movie miss the leap to greatness? I think some of the problem lies in the size of the cast of characters and the scale of the story about them. ""Spidey"" is essentially a tight little story about the hero's coming of age, involving a young man, the love of his life, and the supervillian that represents his mirror image. X-Men is about alienation and bigotry, and features half-a-dozen good mutants and half-a-dozen bad ones locked in an ideological struggle for the future of mankind, involving sprawling superhero firefights. But ""FF"" is locked somewhere in between - it's about family and about four people and their nemesis (Doctor Doom). But they don't really have a REASON to be at odds other than the fact that Doom blames the ""FF"" for his problems and wants revenge. Family dramas can be compelling and thrilling, but they are hardly ever grand scale epics, and they also tend to miss the intimacy of a character study of a single hero. <br/><br/>The other problem is that someone already made a ""Fantastic Four"" movie about the power of family, and it was called ""The Incredibles"". Pixar set the bar for that kind of story so high that a live action version of the same story inevitably has a kind of 'me too' quality that keeps it from classic status.<br/><br/>As for the 'live' actors: I see a lot of grief being tossed Ioan Gruffudd's way for his relatively subdued performance as ""Mister Fantastic"", but I would like to point out that this was a DELIBERATE CHOICE of the actor and the director, kept in sync with the idea of an introspective egghead scientist. If you pay attention, Gruffudd is actually an incredibly handsome man who dials his (undoubtedly enormous) ego down to allow the other male actors room to breath and shine on their own merits. I also have to say that the young actor who plays the hothead Human Torch is incredibly appealing on camera ad adds a lot to any scene he is in. The guy from ""The Shield"" also does a good, solid job, especially acting under pounds and pounds of prosthetics and costume <br/><br/>Since I am a straight male, it almost goes without saying that Jessica Alba seriously carbonates my hormones, but the makeup folks does appear to have overdone things a little bit with the skin bronzer. Whatever. <br/><br/>So: a good enjoyable movie, which will go right on my shelf next to ""The Incredibles"" when the DVD price drops under $15. But I will still watch ""The Incredibles"" and ""X-Men"" a lot more often."

","Fantastic four Does what it says on the tin; fantastic four is just that, fantastic! At last a superhero film that doesn't take itself too seriously. The writers, actors and director have realised that superheroes don't exist, not in the sense of flying on flame or going invisible and with this in mind they have made a thoroughly enjoyable film. From the opening, which puts us right into the D.N.A. storm that causes the four to get their powers, we are put in a position where we are not being confused with too much background information. Its just two old friends and a brother and sister doing a project that goes wrong and leaves them with special skills. Then we move swiftly into finding out a bit more about the four as they find out a bit more about their new abilities. This is pure fun as the 'thing' and the 'human torch' bicker like children, playing pranks on each other to paper over the cracks left in their psyche by suddenly being singled out as different, which the torch embraces as much as the thing shuns it. It's actually quite sad when the things wife finally sees him and removes her wedding ring. Set pieces are abundant from the first very public display of the four's powers as they save several members of a fire brigade from impending doom on a bridge. Speaking of doom we arrive at victor Von doom, jealous, angry power-crazed and recently broke billionaire also exposed to a dose of space storm that is slowly turning him into a metal enemy with the power to control electricity. He becomes the protagonist that firstly splits the team and eventually unites them in solidarity to overcome his evil and save the day. I know its pretty simple stuff but it works. Its superheroes verses supervillans, good verses evil, power verses friendship all done with its tongue firmly in its super stretchy cheek. Just watching the thing bound about was entertaining enough and with Jessica Alba for eye-candy who can go wrong. I don't really see how this got so badly slated by critics. Its not as dark as batman, not as confusing as the hulk, equally as good as Spiderman and a lot better than daredevil/Electra etc. suspend your belief, turn off your brain, put your pants on top of your trousers and think four.

They're a family of super-powered people, but they don't go looking for evil, they explore uncharted dimensions and just run across evil giant space bugs and the like. They're Imaginauts. The movie doesn't reflect every core principle of the comics, but it gets several. Johnny's characterization in particular is dead-on.<br/><br/>All the characters are pretty true to their comic-book counterparts, with Doom being the exception. Symbolically he is still a king of sorts, but the businessman Doom will never compare to the Ruler of Latveria Doom, with an army of Doombots, a fervent populace who he protects fiercely, and more fiendish plots than Skeletor and Lex Luthor combined. His comics origin is quite tragic (mother's soul in hell, Doom's hell-machine destroys his face and his pride, his mask is placed on his face while the metal is still molten, lost his only love, etc...) and the Americanized version of Doom is lacking power because of that. Also, the real Doom never needed superpowers to threaten the FF.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie rocks because the characters and situations are true to the comics, only the design elements of the movie are completely its own. I think the movie could have done more, and had more action, but I'm happy with how it turned out. Then again, I enjoyed the Roger Corman version, for what it was.<br/><br/>Make Movies Marvel!"

","There have been a string of movies that have been based on comic books. X-Men, Daredevil, Hellboy and the list is just beginning. Although when I first saw the advertisement for THE FANTASTIC FOUR, I thought that it might be a film worth watching, but upon exiting the cinema after an hour and forty minutes of bizarre temper tantrums, I must have been mistaken.<br/><br/>From the very beginning of the film, I knew it was going to be dull when it decided to have no lead in sequences. It seamed to me as I watched it more and more, that the four super-heroes fought with each other more than the actual villain, Dr Doom. When Dr Doom does decide to wreak havoc in the city, I praised him for doing so, because some action finally entered the film.<br/><br/>After an hour of watching Dr Doom slowly transform into his evil character, it only takes about ten minutes before they've defeated him. Apart from a quickly and ignorantly thought out plot line, the ending does lead the audience on to a possible sequel. Why, it's beyond my comprehension."

","No idea how people can rate this 10/10 with a straight face, pages and pages of studio shills it seems. Anyway, the plot is panfully thin, you could write the entire thing down on the back of postage stamp. Yes it's a superhero movie so it's never going to be deep, but this just seems very shallow compared to X-Men or Spiderman movies. And he Jessica Alba clothes off moment is completely without reason, it's obviously just in to sell a few more tickets.<br/><br/>The characters mostly seem flat, lifeless, cardboard cut-outs of people we know nothing about and so it's hard to care about them. The actors don't seem excited by their characters either, maybe it's me but it seemed like a lot of the time they were just saying their lines instead of acting. And, Dr Doom is especially weak, he is supposed be threatening or scary I thought, this Doom is neither. He tops out at 'some random guy in a bad mood'.<br/><br/>As a pilot of TV series it's OK, as a movie it doesn't cut it. Not a 10, not even close."

","This is a superhero movie. Ideally the focus should be on the conflict between the superhero and the villain, but instead it focused slightly too much on the human flaws.

However with 4 heroes, trying to share 4 experiences at the same time can be a burden for some viewers.<br/><br/>The special effects are good, especially with the human torch, awesome.

"NoArrow","7","0","1","29 August 2005"," Not believable in any way, but fun, and not boring
","Remember the old 30s Marx Bros. comedies? The ones with Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo? Classics, right? Anyone remember the plots of those movies? Probably not...because the plots weren't important. The movies were about showcasing the abilities of the leads, while leaving the plot and conflict in the background.<br/><br/>That's sort of like what the genre of super-hero movies is like, only the main characters' abilities aren't comedic or musical, they are, well, super. The plot doesn't matter, because you have three or four characters on screen all the time with so much energy that they upstage everything else that would be important in another movie. It is only the director and writer's task to make them interesting, and in ""Fantastic Four"", Tim Story mostly succeeds at that.<br/><br/>This film's super-heroes are Mr. Fantastic, who can stretch at enormous lengths (Iaon Gruffud); The Human Torch, who can burn at the heat of the sun (Chris Evans), The Thing, who is very strong and made of rock (Michael Chiklis); and The Invisible Woman, who is self-explanatory (Jessica Alba).<br/><br/>They are transformed after being bombarded with a cosmic radiation storm while in a mission in space. With them is greedy billionaire Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), whose transformation is slower and more mysterious than theirs' (possibly because he is the villain).<br/><br/>When they return to Earth their powers are revealed, and they shack up in Mr. Fantastic's apartment/office to study them. These scenes - the bulk of the movie - play as a sort of super-hero sitcom, which isn't as bad as it sounds, though a better approach would've been welcomed from me.<br/><br/>Since there are so many powers and special effects on display at all times, the scenes never get boring, and the parts are well-played. Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are especially good, they know they're in a comic book movie and I think that brings a sort of irony to their parts.<br/><br/>I could list the movie's flaws, and there are a lot of them...why aren't the four quarantined by the government when their powers surface? Why do they become so used to their powers so quickly? Why is the media's reaction akin to that of a new extreme sport? I mean, one of these characters can burn at the temperature of the Sun...this is a little grand-scale.<br/><br/>But like I said, the plot isn't all-important, and the movie is much more enjoyable if you don't think of these questions. I do have a problem with the structure of the film, though. Doom establishes himself as a major villain far too late in the film, the conflict is underwhelming and his motives are unclear. There is also very, very little action. I mean, you go to a super-hero movie to see the powers, yeah, but you also want to see the powers playing off each other.<br/><br/>But the action near the end is sensational, and the villainous Doom is so deliciously campy when he comes around that it was worth the wait. The movie is enjoyable, if flawed. But enjoyable.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I went to see it the other day... a big comics fan like me has to see Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>In a sense of resembling the comic book Fantastic Four, this movie succeeds. There's really nothing to complain about that part. Everything falls into place, pretty much. A lot of things that were in the original Fantastic Four carried into this film.<br/><br/>Reed & Sue are more of a pair of loverbirds in the comic... in this one the darker side of their relationship is more prominent, though... how Reed is always deep in his work... and how at times Sue feels like she's not taken seriously.<br/><br/>The relationship between Ben & Johnny works as well. Ben was just as pissy as he was supposed to be with Johnny... but I have to say that Johnny was WAY more annoying in this than the original version. :) As for Doom... he went through a few too many changes in my opinion. Originally it was all about who's a better scientist... now, all the soap opera is brought into the picture, and don't think I liked that. But you must admit: the mask is just GREAT! :) Another thing that bugged me: This is the beginning of the Fantastic Four... I feel that ""The Thing"" -issue wasn't taken a close enough look at. I feel that Ben's story and his sadness of his form is something that needs to be taken a good look at. It wasn't... and when I noticed that, I felt a bit disappointed. That ithced me throughout the film. Oh well, you can't get everything I suppose.<br/><br/>Another thing... Jessica Alba. I don't like her. She doesn't even strike me as hot. But in this case she actually delivered! She was the Sue Richards that I've learned to know and love. She worked wonders there, I must say!

The decisions the characters face seem too quickly resolved to be real and the baddies demise is too stereotypical and speedy.

","Honestly, I gotta say it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. Even before it got universally panned across the board by critics I was still thinking ""My God this is going to be the worst movie ever"" just from seeing the previews. Thus it was with some trepidation that I allowed myself to be dragged to the theatre by my friend who wanted to see it. And I gotta say, it's not as bad as I thought it'd be.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it ain't no gem. But it's some mindless entertainment that was actually fairly entertaining. Don't feel like thinking but want to be entertained? See this movie. I stress the ""don't feel like thinking"" part, because I can't say this was even a remotely clever movie. I am a huge fan of the intriguing mysterious thinking film-noir movie for entertainment (i.e Usual Suspects, Memento, Se7en, etc etc etc) but every once in a while you gotta let yourself just go. Hence this movie.<br/><br/>Alright, I in turn have been panning it nonstop. So what did I like? I'm not quite sure exactly, I have a hard time putting my finger on it. I guess it's that the script, while it won't win any awards, was adequate, especially since it didn't force any cheese-ball lines on any of the actors. The actors themselves are probably what did it for me the most. Von Doom is suitably evil though with just a touch of campiness so that it doesn't try to be strictly serious which would've ruined it. Johnny Storm is done well as the comic relief hotshot (har har, I made a funny), Reed Rivers is good as the genius but clueless head scientist, I actually felt pretty sympathetic towards The Thing during most of the movie, and I gotta say Jessica Alba for me was just okay as Sue Storm. Not great, but really she was there for her looks and not much else as it seemed. The dynamics between the actors and their characters worked out well enough to be believable, if barely.<br/><br/>Special effects were alright, plot was alright, dialogue was decent, actors were good, my biggest complaint would be the action scenes, especially the big end fight. I think the director's a little too gung-ho there and it all just kinda mashes together and isn't really remarkable or even very well done. But in the interest of campiness, hey it works.<br/><br/>Overall, if you got some money to burn you could rent it. Better yet borrow it from a friend. But it's not that bad."

","With other comic book films such as Spider-man, X-men and more recently Batman, bringing the comic to life and generating wide appeal and high amounts of entertainment, Fantastic four leaves a lot to be desired. Fantastic four tells the story of five individuals who go on a mission in outer space and after being caught in a storm develop different super-powers. Four of these use their powers to stop the Dr. Doom carrying out his plans and using his power for evil.<br/><br/>The fantastic four does reach a young audience and will generate a lot of money, however it is not really that good a film. Although the film is aimed at the under 12's it does manage to neglect appealing to all other age groups through lack of substance and plot. Fantastic four has its problems, most of which lie with the direction of Tim Story. One thing about the direction I didn't like was the transitions throughout the film are not clear and have an effect on the flow of the film . Also it feels like Story has relied on the big budget CGI's to carry the film rather than making the actors he's got work with a messy script.<br/><br/>The general essence of this film is the characters trying to establish themselves and develop as superheroes and little else is memorable about the plot. One thing I would have liked to have seen is more of a rivalry between the heroes and the villains to develop in this film as the other marvel comics films have been able to manage e.g. X-men, The Punisher, Spider-man. This, however, is possibly due to the short length of the film and having to cram other stuff in. Having said this fantastic four doesn't really have much else in terms of story except the lacklustre romance element with Mr Fantastic and The invisible girl.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon brings a small element of darkness to the film, however, this is only a crumb of what is needed to give this film and the characters some depth and engross and adult audience. I don't think Julian McMahon had much of a chance to act in this film as he does in nip/tuck where he is able to bring some real emotion to the character and the show, this can probably be attributed to the fact in Fantastic Four he had some pretty awful lines to deliver, which ultimately reflect a poor and cheesy writing."

Not unusual for super-hero movies I know, but usually it's half the movie introduction, half the movie story/action.<br/><br/>The fight at the end of the movie really had potential (brilliant scene when Thing and Doom fall through the skylight into the swimming pool), but just as things are getting started they are abruptly ended.

Instead of using computer animation, the Thing was done by having Michael Chiklis in a full-body foam rubber costume. Some comic book purists may bristle at Dr. Doom's original presented here, but the end does set up for a possible sequel, with Dr. Doom in a more proper role.

This film shouts ""Summer-blockbuster-popcorn-eating-inducing"" at every minute, but the fact is, it doesn't try to reach a higher level of complexity...it lacks the pretentiousness of superhero films, which normally try to portray a very deep and existential story behind the superhero, and all the complexity of being one, etc., which normally causes their lack of success near the audience and the critics, because they fail their goals (normally because they end up looking goofy). This one, on the contrary only wants to show the powers of the characters, the fun they have with them, the clumsiness due to their lack of experience with them, all sprinkled up with amazing special fx and a a villain more interested in a personal vendetta than overtaking the world (the people he might hurt are only collateral damage). No existential dramas, only a little bit of romance, but nothing excessive (only in visual terms). Pure and innocent fun and entertainment. If you want to go see a film to pass time, and don't feel like thinking too much go and see it...you'll have a great time, I know I did.

The Fantastic Four goes straight for the intellectually-challenged adolescent - by packing in slapstick, amusing CGIs, moral vacuity, and the sort of plot development that doesn't require sustained attention. Apart from that, it's quite enjoyable. I could easily imagine a 24hr version that you just dipped into for a quick fix inbetween more serious pursuits. Fantastic Four is a straightforward and unashamed waste of talent, like happy hour cheap lager. The nominal story, of several scientists accidentally given super powers after a freak accident, is less important than smiling vacuously all the way through."

","Okay, okay, enough already with the bellyaching about how this movie isn't falling in line with the ""established model"" these days. Yes, BATMAN BEGINS is the best case of having a Phoenix rising from the ashes, after the debacle that was BATMAN AND ROBIN. But between this and the last X-MEN, (not to mention SPIDERMAN 2,) there's just been a bit too much ""extra angst, please, hold the comedy."" With all this brooding darkness clouding up the story lines, it was about high time for a little levity, and besides, FANTASTIC FOUR was the least dreary of the superhero properties Marvel launched to start with.<br/><br/>There are pacing problems, but I believe it has more to do with the attention span of the demographic the producers were aiming for--that infamous ""13-to-17"" year old enclave of teeners and tweeners. You know...screw the story and character development crap; let's start ""blowin' stuff up REEEEEL GOOOOOD!"" Well, sorry, kiddies, but every superhero saga must have a backstory that has to be set up, and fortunately 'F4' takes just enough time to do so before the CGI kicks in.<br/><br/>With that said, on to the performances. As nice as it would've been to have stars that were just a little more memorable in the lead roles, (apparently George Clooney was busy and Anna Paquin was already snatched up for X-MEN 3), Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba do serviceable jobs as Reed Richards and Sue Storm. And of course, in Jessica's case, as the old saying goes, nobody in the audience who is male will be looking at her ""acting skills."" (Which is funny, since Sue spends a good part of the movie invisible.) <br/><br/>Nope, when it comes to personality,the two actors kicking it into overdrive would be Chris Evans as Johnny Storm, aka ""The Human Torch"" and THE SHIELD's figurehead Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/""THE THING."" These guys know they're in a comic book superhero movie, and that their characters need to be larger than life, and therefore pull out all the stops with pretty admirable results. <br/><br/>Chiklis provides the pathos as the big granite guy with the broken marshmallow heart, while Evans heats up his A&F looks and smartass charm to about the same temperature as his character's buff bod when he ""flames on."" Not to mention it will give the female section of the gallery something to squeal over, (and yes, a few males as well!)<br/><br/>If there is a weak link at all in the casting, it would unfortunately be the villain, Victor Von Doom, as portrayed by NIP/TUCK's handsome medical lothario Julian McMahon.<br/><br/>Pre-transformation, he doesn't seem to be playing his character so much as he is riffing on the good/bad doc from his series. Which is okay, since the personalities that comprise the two roles are not that different. But once the mask goes on, you need a villain to be equally as charismatic as the heroes, if not more so, and all he managed to do was help me realize where the inspiration came from for Peter Wyngarde's Klytus make-up, in the FLASH GORDON remake from the Eighties. (Now for a mess of a movie, THERE was a baddie with a dash of panache!)<br/><br/>Well, at least Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay manages not to take TOO many liberties with the original story, and director Tim Story keeps things brisk, if he doesn't manage to best or even equal the likes of predecessors like Christopher Nolan, Sam Raimi or Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>It's a fast-moving, fitfully funny and frenetic summer trifle, fueled with the usual popcorn paradigm in mind. As long as you go in expecting little more than an evening's worth of pleasant entertainment, you'll be fine. For brooding heroes bogged down with enough psychological baggage to give Freud the vapors, have another go at BATMAN BEGINS."

","I have to say Dr Doom was way too weak as a villain, they had the wrong actor for the part, although i do think Julian Mcmoahn is a great actor but he would of been way down my list for Dr Doom.<br/><br/>I mean Dr Doom is one of the best villains ever, he was defeated way way too easy by the group, the Human Torch was great, bit too cocky i think, the Thing was awesome, very well played by the actor too as was Reed Richards, very good acting, i think Jessica Alba was just in it for her beauty really, again i think they could of picked someone better to play this role.<br/><br/>I do want to say the whole cast are good actors i just think Susan Storm & Dr Doom were to weak in the film.<br/><br/>Great effects and an okay movie, the story was a little weak but it is definitely worth watching, no where in the league of Spiderman or X-Men..."

","This movie was great for those who never followed the story of the Fantastic Four, but for fans of the group or comic it was just too elementary. In my opinion, there was no real plot. We got to ""meet"" the group and learn their stories, but nothing much happened after that. I was quite disappointed. The effects were really great, especially on the big screen, but I don't think that's enough to carry a movie. There were a few continuity errors also, but I'm one of the few people who notices these things. However, my kids enjoyed it a lot and as far as summer movies go, it was fun to go see. Also, I got to show my kids the goofy comic-loving mom they don't see a lot of, so I'd say the experience for me made up for what the movie lacked."

When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it was going to be terrible. But it was rather entertaining. If anyone made this movie and wanted to stay close plot. Their is no way of cutting out the cheesiness. The cheesiness is what made me give this 7 out of ten rating. When you see a movie like this you have to go in with an open mind. If you are in to comic books this is a good movie to see. Though I recommend Batman Begins more.

"CrazyBomber","3","0","1","7 August 2005"," Sub-par, even for a ""Marvel"" movie
","Sub-par is a nice way to say what I thought of the film. I don't know the comic, but it shouldn't be required to in order to see the film. Now, I don't know how things usually go, but the plot is pretty much one of the worst I ever seen. There's holes the size of football fields, and some of the worst clichÃ©s I could ever imagine.<br/><br/>So, what was the weakest part? Acting wasn't all that bad, but the plot really didn't help. The action sequences were very few (and that was the only thing that could have saved this movie). The worst of all was the bore. Yes, I saw people sleeping through some of the movie. It was real tedious, in some parts. God, the scientific approach was way too made up to even be slightly believable. I laugh at this movie's weak attempt to merge fiction and reality! I won't spoil it for you, I always try not to. But damn this was a total thumbs down. It's definitely the worst Marvel film I've seen, so far, and that's not an easy thing to judge, since almost all of them are so bad, well all but X-Men.<br/><br/>I would strongly advise directors to take a look at Christopher Nolan's work in Batman Begins. That should set an example for all comic book adaptations. But, instead, it seems it's the exception, one of the few that was actually worth it. I do hope things change in the next few years.<br/><br/>4/10 (should be less, but...)"

There was some good humor here and there. Jessica Alba was in a role that reminded me of her 'Dark Angel' character. I also did like Michael Chickles, then again I have been a fan of his since he was on 'The Commish'. But still, I feel that I wasted my $9 to see it.

"nuttyknatty","5","0","1","4 August 2005"," The Problem with this film is................
","As Fantastic Four is the most ""recent"" film I want to discuss, I figured I'd start here; I only just saw the film a few days ago. I respect all opinions regarding this film, positive or negative, though I have to admit I found it to be perfectly dreadful; it struck me as a case study of how not to make a film of this nature. I am happy many people seem to love the film to the extent that they do, and I am certainly not about to rain on anyone's parade (hopefully!). For context, though, what did I personally get out of the film? Murky, impenetrable photography with no focal depth (at least three times important ""movements"" in the background were out-of-focus blobs); a generally incoherent plot, decipherable only in its broad strokes, with events following each other seemingly randomly; an almost total lack of character development and genuine interpersonal relationship; going along hand-in-hand with the worst kind of pop-psychologizing; migraine-inducing editing during ""explosive"" moments (honestly had to hurry to the pharmacy immediately after the show); an outrageously immoral sensibility (The Torch being condemned for ""saving"" a man who would otherwise have plunged to his death; curiously, when he ""corrects"" his mistake at the end of the film, the film suggests that all of the problems are resolved immediately, not gradually...thus equating The Torch's ""righteous"" immorality with the restoration of social stability); and just a general disinclination to allow me into the hearts of its characters...it seemed to me the film discouraged empathy and promoted instead smug superiority. Yikes...my apologies to the film's most ardent fans. Here's what I want to talk about.<br/><br/>In short, I feel this film presents to its audience little but insensitive nihilism, hopelessness, and despair (curiously, what the film claims to be fighting against!), and is somewhere in or around the top 100 films rated on this web site...an extremely popular film then. What are the three highest rated films released this year? It's not as if the concepts of these films are bad. I forget which Russian author wrote a powerful short shory...Was it Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, or Chekhov?...about a man who was locked away from the world for twenty years. Frank Miller has written powerful material before (though Sin City, the movie, wasn't nearly so dreadful as the other two, mostly because it seemed to be aiming for parody), and Tim Burton's deeply moving Batman Returns accomplished everything which I feel this film failed to.<br/><br/>So, questions I'm interested in. Why are these films successful? What does it say about us, about our contemporary society, that films such as these go over so well? By ""films such as these"" I mean, that encourage shallow feeling, pointless despair and worthlessness toward human life. There are ways of handling dark and disturbing material. The recent War of the Worlds certainly ""plumbed the depths"" of humanity, and I honestly felt the film to be more harrowing and horrifying than the three films above, but it also was simultaneously remarkably honest, ""realistic"", and above all, human.<br/><br/>I encourage everyone, no matter what their feelings on the subject, to please share and express them on this thread. Thank you."
"loafer2","5","0","1","3 August 2005"," Fantastic for the Fanatics only
","This film, in my opinion, just did not make the cut in the ever so trendy current flux of comic book films coming out of Hollywood. While the film was mildly entertaining and witty it was just a mediocre summer action film for the family. The film seemed to try too hard to get the audience involved in the sub-standard plot that was derived from the comic books. There was cliché after cliché involving the heroes that was just a tad too ridiculous to take seriously at all. The villain just wasn't maniacal enough to make it interesting and there wasn't nearly enough heroism. Instead, the heroes were just annoying and selfish. The character development was nil, I felt as though I didn't even know who these people were that turned into these unique individuals with neat powers. It was just thrown together too quickly. If you love the comic books or just like comic book films in general, by all means see this film. Otherwise, don't bother, as the special effects are not enough to save this mediocre film from being a boring and inane film."

","Yet another big screen adaptation of a comic. There must be few franchises left to sell off at this stage. How and ever, this one follows on the heels of the recent Batman Begins, which was an inward looking, pensive and insubstantial work. Fantastic Four on the other hand gives you exactly what you expect; a big, bright movie for your money. Critics have been hard on this movie and so maybe I Dido't expect enough going in to the show. Bar an inexplicable scene where Storm goes naked and invisible on a bridge for a reason that I seemed to miss, I can find little to complain about. Okay, so the humour's not hilarious and the plot's predictable enough but for someone who knows nothing of the comic book, this was a summer blockbuster that didn't leave me feeling deflated! No Oscars I'd say but passes the time amiably!"

","As a kid, years ago, I remember being a fan of ""The Fantastic Four"" comic and the cartoon series. Predictably, I had an affinity for Reed Richards, the cool scientist guy. So for years I had been curious regarding the comic's translation to the big screen. ""The Fantastic Four"" had been swirling in the motion picture winds longer than other Marvel Superheroes including X-Men and Spider-Man. Director Tim Story's retelling of the comic in his movie, ""Fantastic Four"", rekindles fond memories, and updates the tale with a playful feel and edge. In a departure from previous Superhero movies like X-Men and Spider-Man, ""Fantastic Four"" is not high drama, nor an exploration into the nature of hero. ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" are superior movies. This is Superhero lite. This is not a bad thing, only different. Really. Much like one of it's characters, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch), it's all X-Games edge. These are the Gen-X Superheroes. It's all about the rush. Writers Michael France and Mark Frost deliver the difficult Act I narrative of the origins of the Fantastic Four. The story is frenetic, although weak on character development. This pitfall is overcome mostly, by excellent casting. Ioan Gruffdd has the right ""dork"" touch for brilliant scientist Reed Richards. Jessica Alba, though seemingly too young for the role of Sue Storm, is strong and sensible. Chris Evans steals the movie as Extreme Sports Astronaut washout, Johnny Storm. Michael Chiklis elicits pathos as Ben Grimm, who becomes embodied in the rock of the Thing. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom is very cool evil.<br/><br/>Richards and company along with Von Doom, embark on a venture to study the affects of a Radiation Storm passing Earth aboard Von Doom's space station. Due to Reed's miscalculation, the crew is caught unprepared for the storm's early arrival. All five members are exposed to the severe radiation; thus, altering their DNA. My bud Ron, reminded me that Doom in the comics had a different fate. However, this revision actually is more compelling. Back on Earth, Reed, Sue, Johnny, Ben, and Victor develop astonishing powers. Victor takes a decidedly dark turn. Reed's body has amazing stretching ability. Sue can become invisible and project force fields. Johnny can ignite into flames at will. Ben becomes a rock-like monster with incredible strength. Victor transforms into a metal creature able to harness and disperse great energy. So the Fantastic Four must battle the now powerful Dr. Doom (Victor).<br/><br/>In another extreme culture departure as illustrated by Johnny Storm, he embraces his Superhero status like that of being a rock star. It is not a curse. Reed asks Johnny whether there is any higher pursuit than making a lot of money and meeting girls. Johnny says, ""No."" Props for Johnny. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm has the right elements of bravado, and playfulness. That can also be said for rest of the movie. Ioan Gruffud has the canny stiffness that is appropriate for Reed Richards, providing a contrast. Jessica Alba is believable as Sue. She is also very hot. She is even naked in the movie, unfortunately her character is invisible. Michael Chiklis is very sympathetic as the tortured Thing. Julian McMahon revels as the evil Victor Von Doom.<br/><br/>""The Fantastic Four"" is great summer entertainment. There will be sequel. Perhaps, FF2 retains it's extreme sports sensibilities, and focuses a little more on character."

","Not really wanting to see this film as I had heard nothing but bad things about it and already having a lot of my childhood faves destroyed by the Hollywood grinding machine I sat down to watch with every intension of hating it. But to my confession I have to emit that this is a really good fun summer movie worthy everybody viewing and respect. It's got it's down point sure, but I don't want to go into that just yet as I also don't want to give and of the plot away (well what there is of a plot anyway. The best surprise was how each of the actors playing the Fantastic Four really tried there hardest to nail there charters (even with the not so good adjusted back story) Michael Chiklis standing out as The Thing Ben Grim. He just seem to get the guy an example being that he would standing up for the geeky Reed Richards one minute and then be bullying him the next. And I couldn't help but tingle when he used his catch phase (It's clobbering Time). The only charter that was sort of Pete Tong wrong was Dr Doom. For starter's he was American (If you read the comic book you'll that thats just wrong) and his origin was changed. He seemed to go kind of nuts for no real reason and I don't no what he hoped to gain by trying to kill the F4 team. Dr Doom little subplot was lifed straight from spider made (Man looses his company control from the Board of directors, Man kills the Board). I'm going to try and make the few bad point short and sweet. The Effect were pretty thin (No pun intended) When reed stretched his body just has cheep as chips CGI written all over it. And there seem to be big chunks missing from the plot (How did the get back from the mission in space let alone to Quarantine and didn't Dr Doom get stuck in there as well). Enough of downers I'd like to finish on a positive note. Plus point of this film is it's got some good witty humour lifted from the comic book and the main characters interact just like in the book. Everyone seem's to picking on Reed even though he's the leader of the team and on top of that Jonny gives a lot of stick to Ben. Again this ain't the greatest of comic book adaptations nor is it dark like Batman or charter driven like Spider-man and Hulk. But It is Fun, sometimes exciting, Funny, sexy in place's and all round summer fun that even none F4 fans can enjoy. I was determined that I would hate it but I will hold my hand up and say that I was wrong to think so."

","The Fantastic Four (created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby) is the comic book credited with starting the domino effect, which resulted in what Marvel comics is today. Unfortunately, you can't say the same about the film. For those unfamiliar with The Fantastic Four, the back story behind it is that two siblings (Johnny and Sue Storm), a scientist (Reed Richards), and an assistant (Ben) go to outer space and gain superpowers. There superpowers are the result of being struck by a cosmic storm. Reed a/k/a Mr. Fantastic can stretch any body part -insert joke here-, Sue a/k/a The Invisible Woman can become invisible as her superhero name suggests. By the way, there's some great scenes involving the sexy Jessica Alba having to strip down because her cloths don't become invisible. Anyway...Johnny a/k/a The Human Torch can set himself on fire. Ben a/k/a The Thing is the most tragic character. He became famous in the comic book world for being one of the first characters to hate being a superhero.<br/><br/>The film itself has many flaws. It was too short and Dr. Doom doesn't really do anything special. However, the film manages to survive because of Johnny Storm. Chris Evans is great as Johnny and I loved the character. I also felt the character was very funny. If you're a fan of The Human Torch then I feel like you will be very satisfied. Another aspect of the film that works is that the filmmakers captured The Fantastic Four as a family. That is one of the main reasons why The Fantastic Four have been around for so many years. Stan Lee always tried to make the reader relate to something about his characters. With The Fantastic Four we can relate to the fact that they are a family who love each other, but at times could get at each other's throat.<br/><br/>RATING: 3(***) out of (****)"

That having been said, I thought it was as good a movie as could have been made under those circumstances, and look forward to the sequel. Keep in mind that X-Men I, to which this has been unfairly compared, had no such baggage, since the protagonists, being mutants, had had their powers since birth or childhood.<br/><br/>Since everyone knows the plot, such as it is, I'll talk about other points. First, Jessica Alba was miscast. She got the irritating role of the uptight schoolmarm constantly breaking up fights between the 'boys'. And whose idea was it to bleach-blonde the hair of the dark-complexioned Alba? I thought the result looked disastrous.<br/><br/>Michael Chilkis, by contrast, had wanted to play the Thing since childhood, and it's obvious that this Emmy-winning actor gave it everything he had. He manages to pull off the two most touching scenes in the movie, while in heavy makeup/costume to boot.<br/><br/>Finally, I lost count of the number of laws of science this movie violated, but hey, it *is* a comic book!

","I just saw Fantastic Four last night. What can I say? Not bad, not great. As I was leaving the theater I just felt an overwhelming sense of indifference. It wasn't good enough for me to like it, and it wasn't bad enough for me to hate it. I am convinced that Marvel will never let their name be associated with a bad movie, and Fantastic Four wasn't bad, but when compared to all the other Comic-Book movies out there like X-Men, Spider-Man, Batman Begins, the Hulk, DareDevil, etc...it just flat out pales in comparison. I think the main reason for this is because Fantastic Four unlike all other Comic-Book movies features 4 main focal point heroes instead of one, so you end up having all these little quick, generic story lines for each character instead of a long and in-depth look at each individual like we see in Batman Begins. I don't know about you, but when I'm watching a movie about a guy who can turn himself into fire and fly around, I wanna know all there is to know about that person. I wanna know what makes him tick."

","I have a confession to make: I've enjoyed every comic book movie that I've gone to a theatre to see, other than the Batman-movie-that-shall-not-be-named. I loved the X-Men movies, the Spider-Man movies, Hulk, even Daredevil. I can't help it. They're my weak spot. Some people like spaghetti westerns, some people like teen slasher flicks, some people like gross out comedies. I like super hero movies, as long as they're based on super heroes that I grew up on (which is why I've yet to see Hellboy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or Constantine), and as long as they stay true to the essence of the characters. I can't help it. When I see my childhood up on the big screen, I completely mark out and lose all ability to form critical thought. After subsequent viewings, at home, I eventually gain it back. But when I see the characters and powers and comic book nods for the first time, I geek out.<br/><br/>How'd I do with this one? Well, Fantastic Four is a big, dumb, action-adventure, special effects movie with hammy dialogue, a loose plot, and average acting. And... I really liked it. I want to see it again. Go ahead, flame me if you want, I don't care. I had a good time watching it. I liked how they used their powers for different things. It felt like the comic book. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm fought. Reed Richards was really smart with science, but a hopeless dork elsewhere. Susan Storm was protective of her little brother. Doctor Doom wanted to get that damn Richards, and he was from Latveria (or at least his family was). The Baxter Building was there, complete with Stan Lee as Willie freaking Lumpkin! Johnny Storm was brash and cocky, Sue was shy, Ben was lovable and gruff. Things blew up. The Thing said ""It's Clobberin' Time"", and Jessica Alba looked good (another personal weakness of mine). The action was big, as it needed to be. The Fantastic Four the comic was always on the grandest scale in the Marvel Universe. Spider-Man fought weird smaller guys, the FF fought Galactus and Prince Namor and hung out with the Silver Surfer. I was happy.<br/><br/>So, was it a good movie? I dunno. I really couldn't tell you that right now. I have no objectivity. Maybe after a few more viewings I could. All I can say right now is that I enjoyed it, and that there will be repeated viewings for me."
"magichatqueen","9","0","2","29 July 2005"," The best live action film of a cartoon out there
","I'm not a fan of films based on cartoons, especially after the mess that was Spiderman. The Fantastic Four is just that however...FANTASTIC.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film was the chemistry between the four reluctant heroes(the constant squabbling between Ben and Jonny is a hoot)and the special effects are done so well it almost looks natural when you see Reed's arm stretching like a rubber band.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon, who is brilliant in Nip/Tuck, turns in a performance full of understated menace as Victor Von Doom. He is positively creepy, even before the accident, which makes the audience feel he has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br/><br/>The film is also heartrendingly sad at times, when it looks at the tragic plight of Ben Grimm (The Thing) whose girlfriend leaves him when she sees his Thing form, he can't pick up small objects as his hands are too big and he tips the elevator overweight. He becomes bad tempered and miserable after this, but after being tricked back into his normal form by Victor, his selfless nature rises again to do the right thing in the end.<br/><br/>The Fantastic four has everything you'd expect from an action film, and the scriptwriters here have finally found a way to get genuine emotion into a cartoon-based movie."
"apple_man","7","0","1","29 July 2005"," Good superhero film...action, adventure, marvel
","I enjoyed this film, though i agree it lacks something. i think because this was the first in a (hopefully) series of fantastic four films to come, it had to take a little more time to explain and show how these people became what they are.<br/><br/>Now that that is out of the way, it leaves a whole lot of experimenting with the second film which can just cut straight to the action as we have already been shown them as astronauts and the fatal journey into space blah blah blah.<br/><br/>This is a classic comic book, and the film does not let the comics down..you can read all of the reviews in the world but its really down to your own opinion of weather you like this film or not. it carries a good source of action on its back which anyone from children to adults can enjoy.<br/><br/>The actors all became their characters quite well, but if i had to say the worst i would point out Ioan Gruffudd as Mr. Fantastic, as i thought he was a bit wooden through out the film...but maybe thats the way he was intended to come across, as this is just my opinion. And it was nice and refreshing to see Micheal Chiklis as The Thing in a full-on suit instead of being controlled through CGI.<br/><br/>I though the story was a bit thin but it didn't fail to impress me, to be honest the time flew by while watching this film because even though it has its non-action scenes it still has your attention.<br/><br/>This is probably not Marvels best film but it is definitely not its worst. 7/10"
"joker-4","7","0","1","28 July 2005"," Fantastic Visuals; Boring Story
","Let's agree on this first: the FANTASTIC FOUR is a beautiful movie to look at. The visuals and f/x are top-notch. The casting was dead-on. Even the costumes and sets, especially the Thing's makeup, are a fanboy's dream. Mr. Fantastic was a stretching machine moving in positions only seen previously in a comicbook. The Human Torch's flame mode was realistic and exciting. Sue's invisibility and force fields were visually cool and Dr. Doom's cloak and face plate was definitely neo-Goth. Not forgetting the aforementioned Thing, the make-up crew proved that CGI wasn't necessary to pull off the effect.<br/><br/>Now the praise has been administered, there is only one real question that needs to be asked: why couldn't the story have been just as good?<br/><br/>Forget the 40+ years of comicbook history that this film uses as a cornerstone, what makes a good comicbook superhero movie, as both X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN films have financially proved, are characters that the everyday movie-goer can relate to. Michael France and Mark Frost's script tries to display the modern-day, nuclear family set-up that this team shares, unlike their mutant colleagues, however they drastically fail by not allowing proper, natural character building. No chemistry exists between Reed and Sue, which is tragically ironic seeing as how they both play scientists (and Jessica Alba cast as a scientist is truly science- fiction), while Von Doom postures like a whining trust-fund kid. The only true characterization shown revolves around the Thing, coupled with some of the Torch's antics. How can a film that only needs to focus on four central characters  and one villain  fail at this?<br/><br/>Perhaps some of the blame should be portioned out to director Tim Story who, along with editor William Hoy, cuts together the film at such a superhuman speed that there is virtually no sense in the passage of time. The scenes fly together leaping the viewer from New York to outer space to Von Doom's mountain retreat to the Baxter Building all in a single bound that those of us who are not strange visitors from another planet can't focus on the individuals, rather only the events. Events are what drive summertime blockbusters; good characters are what make good films. <br/><br/>One final question. Just because this is a comicbook movie, why cater to the lowest common denominator with dialogue? Johnny Storm is supposed to be a humorous hothead but comes across as the cliché ugly American. Von Doom, who is supposed to be as smart as, if not smarter than, Mr. Fantastic is relegated to base sneers and pining. For that matter, Richards, who is Marvel's answer to Stephen Hawking, comes across as being anything but intelligent. <br/><br/>The Fantastic Four comic paved the way for Marvel superheroes, and their cinematic children. One would think that bringing the grand-daddy of comics to the silver-screen would present an honor. Instead it felt more like a big-budget made-for-television prologue paving the way for a real FF film. Perhaps by 2007. Wouldn't that be ahem Incredible?"

","I am 50+ years old, and i found this movie to be very enjoyable. I didn't know much about the Fantistic Four coming in, but I did read a comic or 2 in my younger years. I didn't remember much of anything but for the basic powers they had. I didn't even know there was that 5th evil guy, probably because I didn't know or remember how the FF got their powers either.<br/><br/>. I've read some of the negative comments. While some may be valid, it sure is picky. It met my three most important rating criteria, 1. It was not boring in any fashion, very enjoyable. 2. I will look forward to a sequel. 3.

","I was not an avid reader of the Fantastic Four comic book, but I was familiar with all of the characters. With that being said, let me review this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome. They spent a whole lot of time building why the characters are the way they are. They clearly anticipate on making this a franchise movie with at least 2 sequels. I think they did an excellent job of setting up a franchise flick worthy of the Spider Man and X-Men counterparts before it. DC Comics really did a number with overseeing this project. That's probably why it is so good.<br/><br/>The cast was absolutely perfect. I can't think of a better casting for this movie. This movie has everything you expect from a comic book movie. Special effects, witty rapport, fast pace camera shots, and a whole lot of stuff blowing up! That's sounds like a hit to me.<br/><br/>What's so amazing about this movie is in like Spiderman 1 you see how they got there super powers. I think this was best to start from the beginning like this so you can build a whole new following around the F4 movies. I can't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>This is clearly one of the best movies in the Summer Box Office of 2005. This is a good fun rock em and sock em movie.<br/><br/>Ladies don't rule this movie out yet. There is a complex love story going on in this movie which I think you will totally relate with. Guys this will make a good date movie.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie was that it ended! But from what I've learned from Screenplays that is the desired result!"
"YankeeEagle5122","5","0","1","27 July 2005"," Fantastic Four-Not Too Good But Not Terrible
","I know it must be a lot harder to make the audience get to know the main characters since there are 5 of them instead of one like in Spiderman. But the creators of the movie took too much time of the movie to try and cover each of the characters. There was not enough action in the movie to compensate for the scenes where they are trying to show how each character is coping with their new powers and how they are handling the situation mentally. I did think it was pretty cool how, unlike in other superhero movies, the heroes cope with being famous. <br/><br/>Here are the pros to the movie. When there was action in the movie, it was well made. The special effects were alright, nothing to rave about but not bad. It was cool to see all of the heroes fighting, using their own unique powers. The characters are well made. They are not your typical superheroes. They all have their own different attitudes which play into the movie nicely. Most of the time, the parts that are intended to be funny are pretty funny. The one-line jokes are pretty good. <br/><br/>Here are the cons to the movie. It's just boring for the most part. Trying to make the character's emotions a big part in the movie leaves less time for action. And well this is an action movie. I was very disappointed in the 'climax' fight with Dr. Doom. I won't give any of the movie away but plain and simple it was way too short. It left me feeling like there was going to be another fight but just like that the movie was over. <br/><br/>I give Fantastic Four a rating of an 5 out of 10. If your looking for a great superhero movie, go see any of the X-Men movies or Spiderman movies."

","Now this movie doesn't exactly make you jump out of your seat in excitement but it doesn't exactly make you want to leave the cinema. Now i have heard some people say that the torch is just as annoying as jar jar but Chrisy Evans does a pretty good job as the torch and he really doesn't appear annoying at all in the movie(except to the thing which will give you a slight laugh). One thing that is a bit annoying is that Julian McMahon's performance as doctor doom at one point the doc is looking for the invisible girl (sue storm) and he says Marco polo just that it sounds so cheesy Dr doom saying Marco polo. The one thing i don't understand is the way some people have responded to the movie (not mentioning any names-comics2film.com) it isn't too serious the movie has its own charm and seriousness think of making a fantastic 4 movie from what the comic book was like in the 60's it would just be cheesy and camp (like a Joel Schumacher version of fantastic four).

","I had the pleasure of seeing this movie and all I could say is good job. All these people were bashing this movie and from what I could tell there's no REAL reason to.<br/><br/>Going into this film I had very little expectations.Reviews were all over the spectrum and the people that liked it loved it and the people that didn't all seem to HATE Jessica Alba. Her performance wasn't nearly as bad as some would have you believe.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story of the Fantastic Four. And being a self confessed Comics geek and a Superhero movie snob my expectations should have been for this movie to really suck. Boy was I wrong. <br/><br/>True, as with ANY movie of this genre ( and there'll be more ) it is very easy to go in with preconceived notions of what to expect, but to flat out say that the movie stinks because of one particular actor or actress is unfair to everyone involved with the production of the movie. Michael Chiklis was awesome as Ben Grimm and gave a very Tragic and heartfelt performance . The scene on the bridge when his fiancé takes off her ring and leaves it on the ground for him to pick up was very powerful and touching. And Reed having to assist his friend in picking up the ring because his own fingers were to large was tremendous.<br/><br/>People have said that the dialog was cheesy, which at points it may have been. But ""it's clobberin' time"" and Flame on"" are FF classics and will sound cheesy no matter when or how they were put into context and there in lies the charm. My only true complaint was the inclusion of Dooms origin with that of the FF, but in this day and age of post 9-11 a maniacal despot wanting to take over the world might be in bad taste. The effects were awesome and I for one am glad they did't go with CGI for the Thing because I don't think they would have been able to portrait an ounce of the emotion Chiklis did with his eyes and body language. In a summer of angst ridden Jedi's and Dark knights Fantastic Four is an awesome movie that the ENTIRE family can enjoy. Its everything a summer movie should be Fun, Action packed and exciting."
"Mr_PCM","8","0","2","27 July 2005"," finally a film that puts the fun back into comic films
","After a succession of dark and/or self-important comic book adaptations, such as batman, sin city, spiderman and the like, fantastic four makes a very refreshing change. It is very bright, lots of colour, and a fun, light-hearted tone, with a plethora of puns and gags which will have you giggling and groaning at the same time.<br/><br/>It also makes a refreshing change to see them (eventually) embracing their powers as gifts, and using them and not being shy about remaining anonymous, as most other superheroes will do. This perhaps makes the four seem more human - the public know exactly who they really are. Anyway, this also gives a touch of grounding in realism  guys that looked like that, with powers like that  we'd know all about them surely? It's not like a pair of glasses each would make them Joe (or Josephine) regular, a la Clark Kent (how did Lois buy that for so many years anyway?) But I digress. Ioan Gruffudd manages a competent if rather textbook American accent, and Jessica Alba fulfils her assigned role by being as hot as ever (though why are female scientists always knockouts? They never were in my school!). The stars of the piece though are Michael Chiklis' heartfelt portrayal of the thing, and Julian McMahon camping it up superbly as the villain. Chris Evans (no, not that one!) rounds out the heroic quartet as the arrogant guy who takes full advantage of his fame, cut straight from the template.<br/><br/>The special effects are superb (although that comes almost as standard nowadays), and all of our heroes get chance to fully show off their powers, even if some of them have been amplified from the original comics.<br/><br/>One criticism of the film is that although running at 1 hour 45 minutes the story was too short in itself, and that most of the film seemed to be all about setting up a series of sequels - as if this was merely the first chapter of the full film. Be that as it may, as a franchise launcher, it has certainly whetted the appetite. A sequel will be eagerly anticipated, and will be expected to improve on its predecessor."

","Fantastic 4 did a good job casting. It was better the movie had actors that not many people know about. Jessica Alba did a good job as the Invisible Woman.<br/><br/>Of course anyone would be scared if they can light themselves on fire or they can stretch any part of their body. Also when Sue Storm (Alba) can turn invisible. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) thinks he can get himself famous because of his powers, and he seems to be comfortable with the way he is. Like 2002's Spider-Man, when Peter gets bit by a spider, the nest day he is swinging all over the city and not even scared, or he doesn't even get checked by a doctor. But in Fantastic 4, three of the characters were nervous about their symptoms.<br/><br/>There are a bit of goofs in the movie. Like when Johnny Storm is skiing with a nurse, he then gets on fire and she doesn't even do anything about it. There were more goofs but none of them ruined my time watching it. I may have to say that Fantastic 4 has no plot, and I understand. It has no real plot, but what matters is if you aren't bored in the theater.<br/><br/>I had a fun time watching Fantastic 4. Out of all the big summer movies in 2005, Fantasitc 4 is one of the movies you'll have the most fun in. There's a lot of action and comedy to keep you awake.

","Fantastic Four - one word...fantastic. Great special affects, good story, great actors and Jessica Alba. She has got to be my new favourite Hollywood honey. She rocks! For the ladies the guy that plays The Human Torch (Chris Evans - not the ginger one) offers a bit of eye candy. Bulging muscles, good one lines and...although I hate to say it he's hugely entertaining!! Julian McMahon of Nip-Tuck fame is excellent as Victor Von Doom (you know he's got to turn out bad with a name like that). Dressed in Ocean's 11 cut suits he slowly loses his marbles until he becomes a fully fledged, iron clad Dr Doom. Ioan Gruffudd puts in a good performance as Mr Fantastic, a very convincing American accent and a calming influence on the others around him. Have to say though that Michael Chiklis as the Thing has to get the gold star. He's glued into a very convincing suit and you can really feel his anguish! The only let down to this film has to be the rubbish story of how Ben Grimm's (The Things altar ego) fiancé dumps him in such a stupid way before he hooks up with a blind women (it's obviously what's inside that counts) by the end of the film. However, it in now way hinders the complete enjoyment this film offers, great story, good humour and amazing affects. Sequels? I think so...it's left open nicely to see the Return of the Fantastic 4. My must see of the week!"
"maskedman66","8","0","1","25 July 2005"," Bigger? Definitely! Better? Not necessarily.
","By now, most have heard of, if not seen, the original unreleased Fantastic Four movie which was made in order to keep the film rights until a ""proper"" movie could be made on a bigger budget.<br/><br/>Twelve years on, it's been made at last, and the FF have finally become a familiar name to non-comics fans, and the movie made it to number one in the nation! However, the general consensus among comics fans seems to be, ""It's good, but...""<br/><br/>Speaking for myself, I do like this movie, and I genuinely hope there will be a sequel, maybe with even more screen time for Stan ""The Man"" Lee as Willie Lumpkin. But I have a warmer feeling for that first film, which I feel got so many things right that the second movie just didn't.<br/><br/>I'll only illustrate my two biggest gripes, the rest being pretty minor:<br/><br/>1) The costume worn by Julian McMahon as Norman Osborn-- sorry, I mean Victor Von Doom. I've tried to get behind the hooded trenchcoat look, but I just can't; though I will own that my opinion of said garment improved when I saw the very ritzy red lining.<br/><br/>In the first FF film, Doom, as played by Joseph Culp, wore the traditional-- and much more impressive-- armor and cloak.<br/><br/>2) I didn't like what they did with Alicia Masters. This has nothing to do with Kerry Washington, who plays her, being black (although that would sorta ruin her stepfather the Puppet Master's scheme to have her infiltrate the FF by disguising her as Susan!). It has to do with them making her into a hippy-dippy, ""goddess""-worshipping flower child with that most un-Alicia-like trait-- an ""edge.""<br/><br/>As portrayed in the comics, Alicia is the softness that counters Ben Grimm's roughness, and this was brought out much better by Kat Green in the original movie. Granted, I do think that Miss Washington is the better actress; on the other hand, Miss Green played ""blind"" more convincingly.<br/><br/>Another thing I've observed is that while the costume worn by Michael Chiklis is obviously more sophisticated in its construction than the one Carl Ciarfalio wore in the first film, Mr. Ciarfalio's nonetheless had a more impressive design.<br/><br/>Overall, the new movie is a good, solid superhero flick, and a whole lot of fun to watch; the showdown between the FF and Doom especially is the stuff that legends are made of.<br/><br/>The main problem lies in the script, particularly in the drastic alteration in the origin of Doctor Doom (mind you, his going along on the space trip with the others does make for an intriguing ""what if?""). Also, what the original ""Fantastic Four"" had which the new movie lacks-- or at least doesn't seem to have as much of-- is an obvious and genuine affection for the source material.<br/><br/>Here are my assessments of the two casts:<br/><br/>REED RICHARDS/MISTER FANTASTIC<br/><br/>Alex Hyde-White > Ioan Gruffudd<br/><br/>Both were great at playing the stalwart scientist, but Mr. Hyde-White was more authoritative, as Reed usually comes off in the comics. Mind you, Mr. Gruffudd deserves major props for delivering a convincing American accent-- no mean feat for a Welshman, I'm told!<br/><br/>SUSAN STORM/THE INVISIBLE WOMAN<br/><br/>Rebecca Staab = Jessica Alba<br/><br/>Frankly, I can't decide. Both did an able job portraying Sue's passion, strength of character, and desire to keep the family together. Miss Staab mainly played Susan's tender side, while Miss Alba played her with more steel, but both were very effective. And Miss Staab looks like Sue Storm.<br/><br/>BEN GRIMM/THE THING<br/><br/>Michael Bailey Smith/Carl Ciafalio < Michael Chiklis<br/><br/>Again, rock-solid performances on both sides, but Mr. Chiklis was a bit more affecting in the way he presented the angst visited upon Ma Grimm's Number One Son. Mind you, as the human-looking Ben Grimm, Mr. Bailey Smith did have one thing that the comics Ben has which Mr. Chiklis didn't: hair.<br/><br/>JOHNNY STORM/THE HUMAN TORCH<br/><br/>Jay Underwood > Chris Evans<br/><br/>Both played insufferable jerks-- which works, because that's what Johnny tends to be-- but Mr. Underwood had a bit more of the youthful exuberance which marks the character, and played a wider range of emotions, diving headfirst into each one. It also helped to have a Human Torch who did not tower over the Thing. As for Mr. Evans, he eventually showed that his version of Johnny gave a toss about anything but himself, but it took a long time.<br/><br/>VICTOR VON DOOM/DOCTOR DOOM<br/><br/>Joseph Culp > Julian McMahon<br/><br/>Some have criticized Mr. Culp's deliberately over-the-top performance, but to me it was total and utter DOOM; look at the King of Latveria in any comic and you'll know what I mean. Mr. McMahon needed to get his teeth into it more; also, his American accent was a little off-putting.<br/><br/>ALICIA MASTERS<br/><br/>Kat Green > Kerry Washington<br/><br/>See above comments.<br/><br/>Here's what I think should happen: twelve years from now, someone will make a third Fantastic Four movie. Third time being the charm, this one will have the heart and soul of the first and the production values and dynamism of the second.<br/><br/>THEN they'll have something!"

He's either more blind than she is or else he's gay.<br/><br/>One thing that I miss from the comics is the ludicrously huge 'mad scientist' laboratories of both Doom and Richards where a the average piece of equipment was the size of a small building and looked like it could blow up a planet or two.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it right up until the final battle with Doom which had no element of suspense whatsoever."

My one complaint was Dr Doom and how the character was poorly developed, unlike the Fantastic Four, we barely seen the powers of Doom. The FX were really good and the scene on the bridge was awesome, even compared to the superior Spiderman and Batman, in which this amount of effects would not have been out of place. The critics panned the effects used for the thing but personally i am happy that it is a man in a suit as apposed to a CGI created blob.<br/><br/>The film does take on the usual ""first in a franchise"" feel of character development over plot but i for one would happily watch a sequel if it plays out with as much fun as this. i wanted o give this film 7.5/10 but could only officially rate it 7/10 as opposed to round up to 8/10 as this is a popcorn flick not a ageless classic!"

But then there was Michael and Ioan who were cast as The Thing and Mr. Fantastic.

No, really out of left field on him, Doom is the one villain that should have stayed true to the comic, after all Doom is the main villain in the Marvel Universe, and this Doom was a complete let down.<br/><br/>I would have to give the actors low marks as well, in my opinion they seemed to just be reading the script, very wooden, and just didn't bring the characters to life, almost like they were cast fast,there was no caring about the characters, no sympathizing with them, even Ben Grimm who as the thing seemed to lose love and gain it back so fast you didn't have to time to feel anything on him being an outcast, the action seemed rushed and bland, and the ending fight, well, seemed like it was just thrown together as well, nothing to make you jump in your seat or want to ""see that part again"".<br/><br/>It's not Catwoman bad, but it's not Spiderman good either, as I said, very middle of the road....wait for the DVD and rent it."

The movie was also quite true to the original, except that they should have casted a woman to play incredible woman instead of ALBA, rest was pretty fun to watch given you have read the original comic series."

","FANTASTIC FOUR (2+ outta 5 stars) I suppose this movie isn't as terrible as it looks on the surface (and believe me, to anyone familiar with the comic book in its heyday, it does *look* terrible) but it's nowhere near as good a movie as it could been. The main problem is that they have a villain, Doctor Doom, but he doesn't have much motivation... and he doesn't even have any kind of evil plan to take over the world or anything. So he becomes the archvillain of the Fantastic Four because... he's kind of a jerk? He's not threatening to blow up the city? Or planning to murder thousands of innocent people? There is some kind of half-baked subplot where he and Reed Richards are both seeking the affections of Sue Storm but there is no real tension there... it's not even believable for a second that Sue could ever have been serious about a vain jackass like Doom... and Doom hardly seems capable of the kind of passion that could make this kind of romantic tug-of-war interesting. Yeah, these three characters are all wash-outs compared to the comic book versions. Fortunately, Mike Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as The Human Torch are pretty faithful to the comic book characters and they have some good on screen chemistry. The Thing's dilemma (he is the only one of the four who takes the form of a ""monster"" and can't turn his power off and on at will) is handled very well... I wish we could have seen even more of his developing relationship with blind girl Alicia. Johnny Storm is a loudmouth, risk-taking fame-seeker and, since everyone else is so deadly-serious all the time, he gets all the best lines. The movie has a few moments... but the story has no real momentum and the big finale is about as senseless a movie fight as you will ever see. And what's with four heroes ganging up on one lousy villain? I thought the Jedis were wimps because they are always ganging up on the bad guys two-on-one... now we have FOUR against one? They just so much less heroic doing that..."
"pekjr4","5","0","1","23 July 2005"," How do you do a sequel to boring?
","I went into this movie with several expectations. 1: a great plot line with some well drawn characters we could care about. 2: excellent action. Duh-- not one, not two, but four superheroes and one of the great comic villains, Doctor Doom? and 3: outstanding visual effects, on a par with Spiderman. Well heck. The characters were okay. I liked Jessica Alba's no nonsense approach to Sue Storm, although she was a bit wooden when needing to be passionate. Ioan Gruffudd was good as Reed Richards. He somehow looks the part. Michael Chiklis performs well and is enjoyable as the Thing. Who is this Chris Evans guy? He was the best thing in the movie. Funny, a great sense of timing, a great sense of expression. He made the most out of his part and you could tell he enjoyed it. However, all the action was in the trailer, and the best performances and lines were too. I could go on and on about the movie's lackluster plot. The need for the characters to acclimatize to new situations was brunted by The Thing's angst over his physical changes, and the changes in his life wrought by his trip into space, disappearing in the matter of a second when his friends needed him to help them fight a boring evil Doom. Did we ever see a vicious plan hatched by Doom to endanger the lives of everyone in the city, or on the planet, or did it just seem like he done before he started? Same thing with the movie. Seemed like it was finished before anything we really could sink our teeth into appeared."

","Fantastic 4 is possibly the best movie based on comics that I have ever seen. It's not so different to this kind of movies, but I think it's more entertaining, amusing, that most of the rest.<br/><br/>Well, I particularly didn't like very much the other super heroes movies, such as X Men, Spiderman, etc., they are good movies, but they never caught my attention, something that Fantastic 4 has.<br/><br/>The movie is well written, the plot is simple, and fast, the plot advances really quickly, so that the action parts are not so disconnected with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>It's really enjoyable, funny and smart, and at the same time, classic in some jokes or deeds, which makes the movie not so elaborated. If we are talking about the actors, well, they are very good, especially Michael Chiklis' part, but anyway, I don't know why having so many blonde actresses they had to find Jessica Alba and make her blond and blue eyes.<br/><br/>Concluding, one more thing I'd like to say is that, you have to see Fantastic 4, no matter if you don't like this sort of movies; it's a totally enjoyable action movie for almost anyone(not just kids)."

","As it was released more or less at the same time that ""Batman Begins"" and ""War of the Worlds"", I expected a bit of effort in this movie, in way to make it, if not interesting, at least entertaining. Well, no. It was neither the one nor the other. It's just a bad tale about five guys who fly out to space (for unimportant and basically unknown reasons, as if we all flew to space to make our picnics every weekend) who, due to an other unexplained failure, inexplicably turn to superheros, or to have superpowers in any case. The jokes are horrible. The plot is nowhere to be seen. The guys are hot (pheeew, one out of fifty!) and so is the girl (two out of fifty, then). The general impression is that someone had the idea of bringing Pixelart's ""The Incredibles"" out to the big screen in flesh and blood, but managed to extraviate the screenplay in the way. There's this fashion of taking superhero/Marvel characters into the theaters, but I have to say, if YOU (general moan) are ever planning to film ""The Watchmen"" or ""V for Vendetta"", please restrict yourselves from doing a big mistake like this movie was. For that's what it is: a mistake."
"crazychap","5","0","1","23 July 2005"," Appealing, but dumb comic-book yarn
","Following the recent wave of comic book films that began with 1978's Superman, Fantastic Four is another product of this fad. It is about a group of scientists going on an experimental voyage, which is standing in the way of a cosmic radiation storm. A few days after the accident, all of them discover that they have powers. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), the leader, has the ability to stretch his body. Sue Storm, has the ability to be invisible (Invisible Woman), Johnny Storm becomes the Flame, and Ben Grimm evolves into a muscular, rock-like creature knows ans the Thing. Together, they have to unite in order to combat Doctor DOOM, who, having witnessed the blast, becomes driven by greed as he discovers his ability to absorb electricity and metals.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining, with very good special effects, adequate doses of humour, and likable lead characters. The action sequences are well-placed and creative. But it is rather unoriginal by anyone's standard, a screenplay that borrows heavily from other previous Marvel films, and is rather dumb in content. This summer blockbuster leaves hardly anything to think about afterwards.<br/><br/>The movie will never bore audiences and manages to stand out a bit from other contemporary releases. Summer 2005 has become a season where dark, violent action movies movies have become predominant-- i.e, Revenge of the Sith, Batman Begins, War of the Worlds--, .But nevertheless it lacks the authenticity of either such co-horts as well as previous comic book movies like the X-Men and Spiderman. Let's hope its sequel improves most of this movie's mistakes.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

","...or at least liked to have seen in the movie <br/><br/>I thought the FF movie was a bit to slow for a comic to film adaptation. Instead of all the endless chatting about pitying regarding The Thing, watching Reed & Sue fumble thru a relationship & seeing Johnny trying to be a big stud. They could've picked up the pace & at the same time keep the story they wanted in tact.<br/><br/>Things should've been more on-the-fly, instead of this endless slow pacing there should've been sequences of them being forced into their superhero roles against low end super powered villains & your common thug. I wouldn't have them attack these situations as a team, mostly as individuals & maybe the occasional duo, fumbling their way into saving the day and learning their powers at the same time.<br/><br/>With this pacing, things wouldn't have gotten so boring for me, Johnny would've learned how fly way ahead of the game & instead of making his ability to fly an (un)exciting moment at the end of the movie they could've instead chose to make it his ability to control what part of him burst into flames (i.e.: saving some hot chick from a deadly fall by shutting off the flames around his arms and catching her) Sue & Reed could've fallen in love when Sue noticed that Reed is a man of action in the heat of an intense situation, instead of the generic walks on the park and discussion of problems.<br/><br/>As for Ben Grimm, it would've just been cool as f/ck to see him get into a super-powered bar room brawl on Clancy Street.<br/><br/>The ending would've pretty much gone the same way, they join together as a team and fight doom, but it would've been a lot more interesting, and the battle would be more complex rather than each doing 1 single power ranger move. It would've been heavier attacks by both Doom & the team with a much more climatic ending."

I thought they were some of the most believable characters I have seen since Spiderman 1&2. <br/><br/>They really worked the dynamics between the five characters, which give it an intelligent edge. The casting was very good and the actors took on their roles well and drew you into the story. The only thing is that it was a little short on story line once the characters we in full flow.

","Okay, this movie is not near as good as Batman Begins or Spider-man 2. But it's still WAY better than most of the flak you're going to get this summer.<br/><br/>Not all comic book movies need to have the depth of Spider-man 2 or the dark seriousness of Batman Begins or even the nobility of Superman. It's okay to take a comic book and give it a light-hearted approach. And if there's a mainstream comic-to-film project in which it's appropriate to take that approach, it would be, in my opinion, the Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Yes, I would have loved to have seen what it would have been like if the director of ""Traffic"" had directed this instead of the director of ""Barbershop,"" but what I must say in Tim Story's defense is that his lighthearted approach allows the audience to do something they couldn't do with Batman Begins: sit back, relax, don't think, and enjoy a fun, often funny, ride.<br/><br/>So is it as good as Batman Begins? No. But is it fair to compare the two to one another in the first place? Also no. Go see this film, you won't have to think, but you'll probably enjoy yourself, and isn't that what movies are generally for?"
"seargent43","Null","0","1","21 July 2005"," Fantastic Flop
","I recently saw Fantastic Four, I went to the movie with little enthusiasm, and my attitude was clearly justified after seeing this movie. First of all, this film is clearly not for anyone over the age of 13, it lacks a coherent story and the acting is two dimensional and awful. The film basically focuses on the events that turn the four characters into a group of superheros. This movie might have nice visual effects but everything else in this film is sorely lacking. Many Marvel comics have become excellent films, this is not one of them. Fantastic Four was expected to be one of big films of this summer movie season. It turned out to be the most disappointing movie I have seen so far. And this is coming from a fan of the comics, it was an absolute pain to see how horrible this film turned out to be, I was almost tempted to leave the theater."
"jeev7882","5","0","1","21 July 2005"," Exactly what it pretends to be: pretty good popcorn entertainment.
","Grade: C+<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is nothing more than it pretends to be: a big, loud, popcorn movie with cool special effects and an incredibly hot Jessica Alba showing off some cleavage. Just a note for my fellow males, you do get to see Ms. Alba in her undergarments, but only for a few seconds. The highest grade a movie with such low aspirations can possible achieve is a B. So, I found Fantastic Four to be entertaining, but not that entertaining. It could have, and should have, been better. It tries to follow the recent successful trend in exploring the origins of a superhero (or heroes in this case), but the problem is that is just keeps exploring for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four comic books because they were very light and fluffy. As far as the movie, it's not quite as lowly as Hulk (another comic book that I wasn't particularly fond of), but no where near the same league as the X-Men films either. The special effects are just okay. The Human Torch looks pretty good, but Mr. Fantastic looked very fake any time he stretched a limb. Visually the movie is very pedestrian. No cool camera angles, action sequences, or visual themes. The script is no work of art, but the poor direction brings the film down even further.<br/><br/>Like I said before, the biggest problem about FF is that it's not really about anything. There's no plot, nothing to keep looking forward to. The entire movie is about the four getting their powers and trying to get rid of them. That should have taken about half-an-hour tops before really diving into some kind of forward moving plot. Only one of the four, Johnny Storm a.k.a. The Human Torch, actually embraces their powers. If you had any of the four's powers, don't you think it would be fun to experiment a little instead of staying cooped up in an apartment all day? The casting was also questionable. Jessica Alba is hot, but I sure don't buy her as an uber-genius scientist. I did not buy her as a blond or a big sister either. She worked as The Invisible Woman, but her acting skills are definitely limited. I also was a little annoyed by Ioan Gruffudd (Reed Richards a.k.a. Mr. Fantastic) even when he was not supposed to be annoying. The other two of the four were casted well. Michael Chiklis was great as Ben Grimm a.k.a. The Thing. His character is the only one with a story worth exploring. He is also the only one we ever feel sorry for because his appearance has permanently changed into a man shaped rock. I think The Thing should have been a lot bigger and more intimidating, but that's something the director probably screwed up. Chris Evans, Johnny Storm, gave the movie some much needed comic relief. The way he took life so casually, trying to hook-up with every hot girl he saw, was a perfect counterbalance to the seriousness projected by all the scientists.<br/><br/>All in all I had fun watching the Fantastic Four. Would I watch it again? Probably not. It's very blah. But, its not so bad watching it once in an air conditioned theater for a couple of hours on a hot summer day."

","In general, a good movie. Not great. Did anyone notice the editing blooper at the end? As Reed Richards is preparing to propose to Sue Storm on the ship, he bends his knee, then he is shown standing, facing her, then they show him down on his knee. I know he is flexible, but...? Someone needs to take the print back to the editing room and trim this mistake. I don't know how to report a blooper, or else I would do it there. Otherwise, an entertaining movie, although the doc doom character was flawed, wrong set up, etc. They took a great comic book character and screwed it up. Why do they do that? Why would Stan Lee allow this, besides the obvious reasons?"
"naberry44","Null","0","1","20 July 2005"," ""Fantastic Four"" more like ""Tawdry Three""
","Ostensibly this ""Fantastic Four"" becomes a ""Tawdry Three""  the good, the bad, and the ugly. If there had been a little more good and a little less bad and ugly, this might have been a great movie. The Good. The potential is staggering. Having stayed relatively true to the original comic book, the script has some really excellent qualities. Screenwriters Mark Frost (""Twin Peaks"") and Michael France (""The Punisher"" and ""Cliffhanger"") have created a competent script that is really fine at times. There is playful banter between the lead characters that is written and performed well, and some pretty exceptional special effects. Two of the five main characters are portrayed by superb actors that capture the true nature if the originals. Of course, it mustn't go unmentioned that the original characters were not that deep to begin with. However, there are two exemplary performances here. Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are nothing short of ""fantastic"" (yeah I really did it) as Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (The Thing) respectively. Both actors capitalize on the strongest parts of the script (the banter between the two superheroes) and do a credible job of drawing believable characterizations. Chiklis has to do most of his acting with his voice (electronically altered) and his eyes. He is very good at creating a character that has the depth and soul while at the same time demonstrating the angst of being thrust into a body made of stone. Evans is excellent in his devil-may-care characterization of Johnny storm. In him we feel every child's dream of becoming the superhero as we experience with him the onset and discovery of his powers. His childlike, Peter Panish, I'll never grow up attitude is infectious and pulls us into the storyline whenever he is the main focus of the film. He is also part of the best special effects offered here. When he totally ""torches out"" it is a joy to behold, and one of the movie's defining moments is when he yells ""flame on!"" while jumping from a skyscraper. If the rest of the movie could have even half kept up with Evans and Chiklis, it would have been a very good movie.unfortunately it didn't.<br/><br/>The Bad. Two more of the five main characters are simply bad, the fifth will be discussed later. As Dr. Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic), Ioan Gruffudd, appears to be a capable actor. Unfortunately, he lacks heart in his underplayed rendition of the ""stretchable"" Dr. Reed. The characterization is low key, because it is the doctor's nature to be low key, but Gruffudd carries it too far and comes off as lummoxy and boring. Doubly unfortunate is that his main screen partner is totally inadequate  to be discussed later. Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom is nothing short of completely disappointing. Being a huge Nip/Tuck fan, this reviewer was looking forward to seeing this accomplished and talented actor on the big screen. With a weakly drawn character, and no true motivation to be so ""bad"", McMahon's performance under whelms even the most faithful fan. Additionally, some of the special effects, while wowing at times, are clichéd in their execution. How many times do we need to see a fire truck teetering on a bridge before it is just too many times? And to exacerbate the situation, they actually have a dog putting his paws over his face, totally cheesy and inappropriate in the context. The script is rampant with unfunny jokes for all the lead characters with Johnny Storm getting the only successful zingers in the whole wash. If the dialog could have been of the caliber that Chiklis and Evans demonstrated it would have been great. Most disturbing is, again, the tremendous unrealized potential.<br/><br/>The Ugly. A lot of the ugliness lies in the casting of Jessica Alba as Sue Storm(The Invisible Woman). This performance brings back horrible memories of actresses who keep getting parts just because they are nice to look at - and she is indeed nice to look at. But there has to be some level headed somebody somewhere who should have looked at the early rushes (or even screen tests) and seen the potential for disaster here. This is a performance of the caliber of the high school actress who never does another play because her first experience was so devastating that she would never walk the lighted boards again. Unfortunately for ""Fantastic Four"" fans, this actress was not deterred. She ruins the movie. She simply cannot act. Her line readings are bad, the chemistry between Sue Storm and the other character is horrible, and her depth is non-existent. No one even cares about the love triangle between Storm, Reed, and Von Doom, because she doesn't have the acting ability to makes us care even a whit about her character. It is impossible to make a successful film that involves a team of four when there is one member who is non-functioning. It makes me sick to think how great this movie could have been, with all its other flaws, by simply casting a Jennifer Love-Hewitt or Scarlett Johansen in this role. Again, we head back to the lack of potential in this film.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The die hard fan must see this movie. Even with all its weaknesses, the fan will enjoy seeing their heroes (with the exception of Sue Storm) come to life on the big screen. For the casual fan or the non fan, don't bother."

Whenever I go to the movie theather to see a movie of this sort based on a comic book I don't really expect to see an Oscar-Winning film, but at least a decent adaptation of the comic book. The movie, although I have little knowledge of the comic book, was weak, not because it wasn't exactly like the comic book because it is expected that a movie will always have little differences here and there for running time's sake, but this film really didn't do justice to the comic book or even to the cartoon series. However, it had its moments, with Chris ""The Human Torch"" Evans, and Michael ""The Thing"" Chiklis providing some laughs, but the other actors, especially the Welsh actor playing Reed Richards, are very dry and wooden. The story is not told well and the only enjoyment you can get out of this movie is the special effects and if you're a man seeing hottie Jessica Alba A.K.A.Invisible Woman on a spandex uniform.

As with Spidey, there are some scenes that are carbon copies of classic comic book poses. Sue Storm has been updated with Jessica Alba from wimpy Donna Reed female in the comics to self empowered modern female although she is still referred to as the Invisible Girl. Fans of Doctor Doom, possibly one of the greatest villains in the Marvel Universe, may be disappointed in his changed origin and current all so typical villainous manner. Unfortunately, he also seems like a clone of the villain in Spidey, another rich industrialist gone bad - hey are there any good rich industrialists out there?!! How about it you left leaning liberal screenwriters? The Thing is played with great empathy by Michael Chiklis, something that the creators of the Hulk seemed to have missed when they turned that movie into the Jennifer Connelly show. Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards is the perfect scientist nerd but, without a doubt, his stretching powers are the most difficult to translate onto the big screen. How many things can you do with a rubber band? The Torch is ably played by Chris Evans with just the right amount of fiery brashness and should appeal to the young male demographic.

"JYHASH","7","0","2","18 July 2005"," Acceptable, but not Memorable
","Well, I broke down and saw the Fantastic Four the other day. Now I'll begin by saying that I am a fan of the comics. I work in a comic shop, I regularly receive ""Marvel Knights 4"" (A fantastic four book) as well as ""Ultimate Fantasitc Four"" (another F4 title). But as a movie goer, I know that I need to keep an open mind when going to see films. Especially films adapted from pre-existing media. So My fiancée and I broke down and went to the theater.<br/><br/>So, all in all I must say there were aspects I was quite glad they touched on and others that I was a bit disappointed about.<br/><br/>The story basically touches on the Fantastic Four's roots. Fleshing out the character development that made Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)< Sue Storm (Invisible Woman), Ben Grimm (The Thing), and Johnny Storm (The Human Torch II) into super heroes. It also shows the emergence of their rogues gallery beginning with Victor VonDoom, who becomes (you guessed it) Dr. Doom. It deals with the science experiment gone awry, the rising popularity of the 4, the downfall of VonDoom and the eventual Final Battle.<br/><br/>I won't ruin the end but I have to say, comparable to battle scenes in the Comic, this one was spot on (albeit short). If anything the movie really touches on the human aspect and problem solving that usually fills the pages of the Fantastic Four Comics. Not all comics are for kids, much less nothing but nonstop actions. They are mediums to tell stories, and usually F4 deals with the issues of Reed and His Gang and how they overcome popularity, bankruptcy, global terrors, etc. The movie captured this aspect perfectly, but the storyline itself is questionable.<br/><br/>As most movies like this do, it tries to squeeze all the best an most popular stories it can into one film. Usually acquired at the expense of comic continuity. And whereas many of us comic fans can say that certain story aspects are out of order, we have to realize that no movie can be completely true to the books all in one sitting. It is nearly impossible for a movie to take another media's concept that has had a history such as F4's and put it into a 3 hour film. it's not do-able. It is the same problem that the movie ""Watchmen"" will be faced with: How can you make a 400 Page Graphic novel into a 3 hour film, and still do the original story justice? It can't really be done. So whereas I do give some ""props"" to the way the story for F4 was handled, I also have the comic geek inside of me saying ""NO NO NO! That's not supposed to happen until much later!"" In any case, the movie does a fine job of rendering the story as believable, and many fans will recognize many aspect of the Four's plight.<br/><br/>Casting wise, I was never too keen on casting Michael Chiklis as the thing. I personally thought he should've been played by Brad Garrett (of Everybody Loves Raymond). He had the size and most definitely the voice that would've been perfect. Plus the fact that the Thing is small in the film and is lacking in his huge eyebrows truly put me off. But after seeing the movie my little nitpickiness became a moot point. Chiklis wasn't at all disappointing and the rest of the cast seemed to do just as well. I know we've all had reservations about Jessica Alba (especially when Naomi Watts would'dve been a lot better) and actors Like Iaon Guffard and Chris Evans who are relatively Unknown. But let's keep in mind everyone has to get their break somewhere and just because unknown names signed on to a product that garners millions of comic fans, we shouldn't hold it against them. The only person in the cast that truly disappointed me was the portrayal of Dr. Doom. by Julian McMahon. Dr.Doom has always been portrayed as a mad doctor, and on top of that a very angry one at that. The voice, I feel, was not creepy and evil enough. It should've been closer to Darth Vader, rather than just regular old Julian McMahon. It took me out of the moment, and was a very unfortunate choice.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give the movie a 7 out of 10. Not just for effort, but also for the fact that that it was miles away from the Corman film of the same name. Jeez, have you seen that ""movie""? Wow. Anyway, the film is well put together. The casting is odd but by far not abominable as many people on the Message Boards have stated. And as for the comic fans, don't bash it because you feel it's your job. Try it, you might like it."

","Every once in a while, and with comics-based movies in particular, fandom-at-large makes a unilateral decision to hate a film that won't be released for months. Science has yet to explain how this phenomenon occurs, although we're pretty sure that Harry Knowles is involved. Such a case is Fantastic Four. For several months now, Internet fandom has been condemning it sight unseen, holding it up as an example of how a comics film should not be made, all based on a few promotional images.<br/><br/>Well, the movie is actually out now, and guess what? It's not bad at all. It is, in fact, pretty good. It's not brilliant film-making, and it won't be making any ""ten best of the year"" lists, but it really doesn't set out to do so. The only job this project had was to bring a classic, fun, somewhat goofy superhero comic to the screen, and the translation is more or less perfect. Anyone who feels that the four central characters are lacking anything is reading way too much into the comics.<br/><br/>It is, of course, going to be compared to the great superhero films like Superman, Spider-Man, and X2. However, the one movie this compares most closely to is probably Ghostbusters. While rarely outright comedy, it keeps a light tone, and chooses to focus on character-based moments rather than action. Anyone expecting two hours of The Thing kicking holy butt is going to be disappointed. This is a movie based, almost to a fault, on the tone of the classic Lee/Kirby comics of the sixties. The group squabbles amongst themselves, struggles to find their identities, copes with sudden celebrity, and does the right thing for no reason other than that it's the right thing.<br/><br/>What works here is that Michael France, Mark Frost and Tim Story know these characters. From the first moment they're on screen, anybody who's a fan will recognize them. They've been perfectly captured, and many of the moments from the classic issues that made these characters who they are are transcribed almost exactly.<br/><br/>While the film-makers are slavishly faithful to the heroes, the villain took a bit more rejiggering. I believe they've done a decent job of making Doctor Doom fit into the story more naturally, but it will probably be the hardest pill for fans to swallow. His transition from self-obsessed corporate raider and jilted lover to straight-out supervillain is a bit rocky, and could have used a bit more work.<br/><br/>Speaking of rocky, The Thing's look has been the subject of much disdain. The issue of bodysuit vs CGI probably isn't going away anytime soon, but I have to champion the suit. It looks decent enough, and Chiklis' ability to perform through it is impressive. A CGI character would have robbed us of his physical performance, and the other actors' ability to play off of him. The interactions between Chiklis and Chris Evans as Johnny Storm are particularly good.<br/><br/>In the end, this is not a movie that will challenge anyone's preconceptions of what a comics translation ought to be, and it isn't on the artistic level of Donner's Superman or Raimi's Spider-Man 2. It's a light, fun and very entertaining adaptation of a light, fun, very entertaining comic. I'd call that a success."

","It seems that naming a movie 'Fantastic Four' just provokes trouble, especially when it fails to be as, well... fantastic as everyone would hope it to be. But Fantastic Four really isn't as bad as most people would have you think. True, it certainly isn't one of the best superhero movies out, (it was certainly bad timing to be released short weeks after the superb Batman Begins) or even one of the best Marvel movies, but Fantastic Four is still solid entertainment, which, fortunately, is all it set out to be. <br/><br/>Director Tim Story shows a rare bit of logic (unseen in last year's atrocious 'Taxi') in recognizing the fact that the origins and powers of the heroes are too far-fetched to be taken seriously enough to play the movie in a darker, more serious manner, such as the X-Men and Spider-Man films. Instead, Story is content to make the movie fun. And herein lies his strength - the movie is fun. But it's when Story aims for the emotional impact that we recall how inept a director he has been in the past, and long to see how much better a more talented director would have made the film. Moments such as the rocky disfigured Thing being ostracized by society are often laughable rather than heartbreaking, if it wasn't for the strength of Michael Chiklis' performance. He makes us really feel Ben Grimm's pain, despite only being able to express it with his eyes, covered by his heavy latex suit, and his strong (no pun intended) performance rises above the mediocre script.<br/><br/>As is the case for the Thing, the spirit of the original characters is successfully brought to life by the cast. Ioan Gruffudd is an admittably obscure choice for Mr. Fantastic, when one reflects that actors such as George Clooney were considered, but he proves to be wise casting, capturing Reed Richard's sense of disconnection from reality, so concerned is he with the 'greater good' of mankind. He comes off as a believable man of science, and not a parody of one. <br/><br/>The casting of the simply gorgeous Jessica Alba clad in spandex will draw many male fans, but her performance is competent enough as well. Alba brings out the uncertain side in Sue, unsure whether to discipline her hotheaded brother in a motherly fashion, or act just as immature as him. (as she does during the inevitable romantic subplot, which is handled surprisingly tastefully, mainly due to the quirkiness of the very different characters of Reed and Sue playing off each other) As said brother, Chris Evans plays Johnny Storm as well as the script would allow, but the character comes off as disappointingly shallow - a typical immature hothead whose only objective is to have a good time. Another character who would benefit from more development is the villainous Victor Von Doom, whose backstory is changed from that of the comics to strangely resemble that of the Green Goblin from Spider-Man, right down to losing his business enterprise, and donning a mask from a personal collection. It's clear that Von Doom has always been a horrible person, but we are given no explanation as to why. However, Julian McMahon is suitably menacing, especially during the sequence of discovering his powers for the first time. While he may not be given a very developed character, McMahon plays the part for all it's worth, reeking cold, suave hatred and ego - a capable villain to counterbalance the varied powers of the four heroes.<br/><br/>Overall, Fantastic Four serves it's purpose, which was to be entertaining. It doesn't strive to be particularly profound, or express truths of human nature. (as the X-Men films do) But with a mediocre screenplay, and a director who proves decent at providing entertainment, but struggles to capture the dramatic moments, the film leaves much to be desired. There's a consistent sense of ""what if...?"" throughout, as if a better version of the film is just in sight, but not quite achieved. Perhaps with a more capable director and a slightly touched up script, Fantastic Four could have lived up to it's name. As it is, the ""Fun Four"" proves an equally effective alliteration, and one which, given the final outcome, is more accurate.<br/><br/>-7/10"
"Killa_Cam","6","0","1","18 July 2005"," Fantastic or...
","I think there are basically two kinds of comic book movies. I love comic book movies, which actually have meaning. Daredevil, Spider-man 1 & 2 & Batman Begins are {meaningful}, intelligent pictures, which are self-sufficient even apart from their comic book origins. They are actually a kind of comic book based movies, that I like. Yet, we have another type of comic book movies: more cartooned, more ""comic"" to say so: Hellboy, Sin City, Punisher... Fantastic Four definitely belongs to the second group of films, yet I liked it way better than the three above-mentioned movies in this {cartooned} group. The acting in Fantastic Four is great. Especially Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans & Julian McMahon are doing an awesome job. Unfortunately the characters are too undeveloped to make the best out of their talent. The visuals are great, but we do have major problems with the direction of Tim Story, as well as with the story itself. While during the first half of the movie I was sitting & thinking like ""Wow! I'm sure gonna buy this movie"", in the second half I was like ""Hmm... Not a bad movie to see one time"" The film seems too rushed, characters are not well written & some supposed plot twists are rather questionable & primitive at best. Unbelievably, but the involvement of Chris Columbus in the project is felt throughout the movie. The production seems childish at times, though the humor is very good. Did I enjoy the movie? Kinda yes. Eye-catching visuals, funny jokes & charismatic actors work well. Will I put Fantastic Four on the shelf together with my licensed copies of Daredevil, Spider-man, Spider-man 2 &, soon, Batman Begins? Definitely NOT!"
"dbborroughs","5","0","2","17 July 2005"," Too much talk in this less than fantastic movie (some non specific thoughts)
","I've seen the new Fantastic Four movie and all I can say is that there are things that are right and things that are not. It doesn't suck, but it is rather dull... at times. It could have been sooooo much better.<br/><br/>Its the origin plus a battle with a Victor von Doom, who goes into space with them and who may or may not have been effected by the same storm (There's a line late in the movie saying that Doom used a machine built by Reed to get his powers.) Its the story of how they deal with their powers and how Doom tries to kill them so he can begin to take over the world. Its a reasonable rewrite of the origin story with the addition of, and complete rethink of the Doom character. (I don't think Doom really works) Mostly the movie is okay, just. The film suffers the fate of most first super hero movies, its too damn talky and not enough action. In first films the plot has to go from explaining where their characters came from into an adventure, unfortunately the adventure is either given too little time by being squashed at the end, or it just gets lost. Here its a bit of both.<br/><br/>Actually here the plot is a re-tread of the first Spiderman film, with only one action sequence actually fitting logically into the plot, thats the bridge rescue. This is the FF in action from the comics and a nice piece of film making. (Never mind that there would be all sorts of real world problems as the result of it...or actually any of the other battles. This is the first film in a while where the destruction would most likely bring fear and lawsuits, not toy deals. New Yorkers would be suing their butts off, this is not Spidey saving a trainload of people) If you think about it its the only time in the film where the action actually makes sense. The long final battle with Doom makes almost no sense plot-wise since the twists to get there seem forced.<br/><br/>The action sequences are spectacular and well done. The film gets that right. The problem is that there are very few real exciting pieces. Mostly we have talk, lots of talk and that kills the film. The talk is not as awful as I thought it would be, but its still not all that great. The problem is that there is too much. In the comic you've always had a nice mix of action and talk. Here its mostly talk. Space sequence(which really isn't action as such), bridge sequence, final sequence and I think one other, not including the bits of in fighting) Its doesn't suck but its not what it should have/could have been. Yea the action is nice on the big screen but you'll not be able to zap through the dull parts. I'd wait for DVD."

"xjuggernaughtx","7","0","1","16 July 2005"," Flawed, but better than I expected
","When I saw the trailers for this film, I cringed. Reed Richards seemed more like a scientist that Jeff Goldbloom would play. Doom look kinda dumb, and then there's Jessica Alba. I really only went to see it because my friend wanted to see it for his birthday. Now I'm a big comic book fan so I know my Fantastic Four. I don't expect them to do everything just like the comic, but I like a certain continuity. I think the comic movies that fail are the ones that stray too far from the source material. You have almost fifty years of character development, why start from scratch again?<br/><br/>This is where the Fantastic Four succeeds and fails. Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm are terrific. Both very true to their comic book counterparts and both scripted well in the film. They even got their rather competitive opposing nature down well. They rarely get along, but help each other when it counts.<br/><br/>The conflict of the team itself is done well, too. The Fantastic Four is a team of strong, conflicting opinions. This was mirrored in the film. I almost always enjoyed their back and forth interaction.<br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Reed Richards is just not Reed. This is forgivable in the film, and doesn't really cause any problems, but it just sort of aggravates me. Reed comes off like a bumbling loser, and worse, is constantly making mistakes. This is Reed Richards. The world's most brilliant man by leaps and bounds. I know that his mistake in the shielding caused the mutation of the Fantastic Four in the comic, and if that was Reed's only failing in the film, it would see realistic. Instead, he pretty much blunders through everything. He just doesn't seem very bright.<br/><br/>The really unforgivable misstep, however, is Doctor Doom. Doom is a tyrant. A strong Leader. A feared man all over the planet. Well, not in this film. He's more of a chauvinistic yuppie. He is far too tame to be Doom, and comes across really as Lex Luthor. He really just seemed kinda bored by the whole ordeal. Doom is one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, and he came across as a second rate Spiderman villain. <br/><br/>This is why you shouldn't stray to far from the tree when making comic book movies. Doom is a rich, interesting, complicated character. He has majesty and honor, villainy and cunning. The movies Doom just seems like he is going through the motions.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy watching this film. I would probably like to have the DVD, especially because it felt like there were scenes missing. I remember a few times when it seemed like the film kind of jumped awkwardly. Good effects, generally good story and acting, some flaws. It's worth your time, but don't expect perfection. I rank it in line with the first X-men movie. A good start. Let's hope for a better sequel."
"logicman001","7","0","1","15 July 2005"," Truly Fantastic... Mostly
","This was a truly fun movie. ""The Fantastic Four"" is a comic about a family coping with strange powers and fighting the evil monsters and other wacky phenomena that endanger the lives of people on Earth, This movie understood the characters, it understood how they react with each other and with strife. While the movie was one long origin story and nothing more, it did set up for the surely to be fantastic sequel. I give this movie a 7 because it was enjoyable and fun, because it held true to the comic (which I grew up on and still avidly read today), and because it could have been better. 9 and 10 ratings I hold for movies like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" and ""The Seventh Seal"" (respectively). I preivously said I hated this movie, but I've now learned never to judge so quickly. The sequel will be so great it may be the best MARVEL movie, but right now that is reserved for ""Hulk"".<br/><br/>And yes, the MPAA has a thing about ratings, not quite understanding what is really appropriate for 13 year olds, and this movie SHOULD have been PG to be a really good movie, but overall it seems the PG-13 movie was based mostly on the violence, which wasn't that bad. ""Doctor Who"" is a children's show, and to some people it's worse than this movie.<br/><br/>And so, ""Fantastic 4"" is true to its comic ""The Fantastic Four"" (I wish it had ""The"" in the title), and is a fun movie, and don't come in expecting a serious movie like Hulk or X-Men, this movie is supposed to be fun. FF 4-EVER!"
"keitharan","7","0","1","15 July 2005"," Exceeded my low expectations, walked out pleasantly surprised
","Hmm, should I see this film or not? <br/><br/>After reading some IMDb reviews, and low user rating of 6.1, I figured FanFour was just another summer '05 dud... probably not a limp strip of emulsion the likes of Daredevil, just the latest weak link in the recent flaccid chain of Hollywood efforts. One more film dumbed down and numbed up just enough to get parents to fork over $20 to their kids, waiting on its real payday in the video market. One reviewer put it squarely between Daredevil and Spiderman. So, I decided NOT to see FanFour. <br/><br/>Then I had a really bad day at work and decided a little escapism, even if it was mediocre, was in order. My choice was between the less than bewitching Bewitched, and not-so-Fantastic Four. FanFour began at a more convenient time, clinching the deal.<br/><br/>As it turns out, I guess I am a bit more forgiving than the the average IMDb user. I enjoyed it. Yes, FanFour is between Daredevil and Spiderman, but notably closer to Spiderman. Spidey, XMen & X2, these are classics, as is the recent Batman Begins. These movies give the genre credibility, and share some common threads: all have adult appeal; all make the best of special effects; all did not lose sight of the fact that those effects needed to be built around a movie, not the other way around. (for you producers / directors out there who seem lost sight of this, movies are cinematic stories built first around a plot, carried off by a script. Remember this and you might live to film another day ) <br/><br/>FanFour had likable characters, reasonably well developed, though not the depth of Toby Maguire as Spiderman, or Christian Bale in Batman Begins. Then again, you've got four superheros, so just imagine the competition for face time on the widescreen. When it comes to character development, the FanFour do approach those other DNA mutants, the X Men. FanFour superpowers are in the same genetic phylum, but it's hard to beat the superstar cast of X Men, with super cool, yet deeply flawed personalities like Jackman's Wolverine. Nonetheless, FanFour hold their own. <br/><br/>The plot is standard predictable fare, a tried and true formula that will only fail if you fill it full of holes, or carry it out with a bad script, or bad acting. But FanFour had a decent script, trying a bit too hard for that Schwarzeneggarian one-liner, but only at a couple moments by Michael Chiklis' character ""Ben Grimm, AKA the Thing."" And this is a minor footnote, fully forgivable because Chiklis is a fine actor and makes the Thing a completely endearing character, especially at one moment when he gives a look with his eyes, much like Puss & Boots in Shrek 2, and you just want to give the big boulder a hug. Borrowing ""Clobberin' time"", from previous incarnations of the Fantastic Four, brought cheers from my theater audience, and some one-liners were worthy, working well as a counterbalance within the playfully antagonistic relationship between The Thing and Chris Evans', The Human Torch, AKA Johnny Storm. This sort of plot/character development , much like that between XMen's Wolverine and Cyclops, adds depth and brought an enjoyable dimension to FanFour. <br/><br/>As Johnny Storm, Evans is playfully devilish. A thrill-seeking adrenaline junkie, terribly likable and charismatic, and the human link between the characters in the movie and the world at large, including the audience inside the theater. No doubt all the young girls have noted his superhero sex appeal, unless they find themselves attracted to The Thing due to an Elektra complex and a daddy who looks like a large pinkish turd. <br/><br/>Jessica Alba as the Invisible Woman does a fine job, and there is a great strip scene that you will see, but you won't see, if you see what I mean. And it's no stretch to enjoy Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, rubber man / scientific genius leader of the Fan Four. He's given the job of a dry scientist, strong of mind, weak on emotion, and he does it well. But his warm looks and gentle persona draw you to him, and this works well to build tension throughout the movie as you wonder if a spark will be ignited between his character and Jessica Storm.<br/><br/>One last note about Julian McMahon as the villainous Doom. This guy gives me the creeps as the shallow, morally challenged doctor on Nip/Tuck, and that quality translates well to the big screen. A good bad guy is a good thing.<br/><br/>This was a good movie, though it could have benefited from a little refining of the script, and about 15 more minutes of movie, the extra time devoted to character & plot development. While I was hesitant to walk into the theater before the movie, I walked out pleasantly surprised. If they do a sequel I am interested enough to see how they will develop the characters, including a love interest for the Thing, and for me that says it all."

I thought the special effects were top notch and the acting was very good. I have to say that I didn't buy the blind lady falling in love with The Thing. (the man that looks like the hulk except stony).<br/><br/>This is a great family film because it isn't too violent and it doesn't have that much language. So, if you only watch the movies that get excellent reviews, you are going to miss out on this action-packed adventure.<br/><br/>I don't think this film deserves a 6.1 user rating.

"a_ngox","6","0","1","15 July 2005"," Very entertaining..
","Seems like the superheroes movie becomes the trend for the past five years. There are a lot of movies taken from the comic books, such as the Spiderman, the Batman, etc. However, do not expect the same things from those movies I have mentioned before. Fantastic Four does not emphasize on the same points as Spiderman or Batman. It rather goes with its own side of strengths, which I should say is really entertaining. I enjoyed this movie from the beginning until the end of the movie, although it would be better if Tim (the director) does not rush the ending.<br/><br/>Based on its visual and sound effect, I only give this movie an average credits. There are few scenes where you see the degradation of one subject to another, and makes it look unreal. And somehow I noticed that the voices of the actresses or actors are not strong enough, thus sometimes the audience was kind of lost.<br/><br/>Fantastic Four is a story of four people who went to the outer space in order to conduct a research, and become mutants after got hit by sort of cosmic storm. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is the Mr. Fantastic (for all of you who read the comic before), who is a genius scientist. After he got dumped by NASA for certain reason, he and his partner, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), went to Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahoon) to get funding on his research. There they meet Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) who is an employee of Victor and also Reed's ex-girlfriend. Things get really hilarious when Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) appeared in this movie. He is the brother of Sue who later on will possess fire as his mutation and call himself the Human Torch. These five people got different mutation caused by the storm. Reed becomes a rubber-man, Sue got her to be invincible, Ben becomes a stone-monster, and Victor becomes a metal-alloy man.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoy this movie. It is not as heavy or serious as Spiderman or Batman, but it can bring you a nice Saturday night. Enjoy it!"
"meger_7","7","0","1","15 July 2005"," A 'fantastic' ride plagued by doom?
","You would think by now we have seen all we can see when it comes to graphic novels in film, but it's clear we haven't with the release of THE FANTASTIC FOUR, the new Marvel gem. And, unlike many of its predecessor's, this one focuses on more than one star, four to be exact, which is four times the fun if you ask me. Unfortunately, not everyone feels the same way I do, as some critics are bombing on this film for its lack of a good script and experienced directing. But, to me that's a cheap way of saying this film has no life, but this is just another example of critics taking a film like this too seriously. I realize the bar is set fairly high on films of this genre, given the recent success of SPIDER-MAN, X-MEN and BATMAN, but I think sometimes you have to check your expectations at the door, which is what I did for THE FANTASTIC FOUR. This film may not have the highly developed story, but it has the one thing that all movies of this genre need, character. And it's that character that leads to enjoyment, which is really all any of us want when going to watch one of these films.<br/><br/>The premise behind the story in this one focuses a group of individuals who, while on a relatively routine space mission, experience a freak cosmic storm that in turn changes their DNA forever. The trip was supposed to become the legacy of a selfish industrial scientist by the name of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), later to be known as Dr. Doom. But, when the storm ruins his plans, he decides to create his own storm, using his newly developed powers. Attempting to stop Dr. Doom was of course the rest of the group, part of freak accident in space: Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), a highly intelligent scientist, later to be dubbed 'Mr. Fantastic'; Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), a hotshot pilot discharged from the military due to misconduct, also known as 'The Human Torch'; Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny's sister and also scientist, dubbed 'The Invisible Woman'; and finally Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed's right hand man later dubbed 'The Thing.' As the freshly named ""Fantastic Four"" plan their next move, they all begin to learn how to best use their powers individually, which eventually becomes an asset when they are forced to work together to end the madness Dr. Doom has unleashed on the city of New York.<br/><br/>There's no doubt when the producers came up with the idea to put FANTASTIC FOUR onto the big screen, they wanted to get the true meaning of ""fantastic"" out of the cast. And I think for the most part they did just that, which a few exceptions. I can't imagine picking a cast that would look better than this one, with Young Hollywood heartthrobs Jessica Alba (SIN CITY, HONEY) and Chris Evans leading the pack. Following them was of course Julian McMahon, who many of us know from one of cable TV's hottest shows, NIP/TUCK. And it was Julian McMahon that out shined the rest of this cast, if you ask me. In fact, I'll even go as far to say that there should have been more of McMahon's Dr. Doom in the story, because without Doom, this movie would have literary been lost in space. Yeah, sure, the story probably centered more on the struggles of Michael Chiklis' (TV's THE SHIELD) character, The Thing, but that's part of the reason why there should have been more Doom. So, I'm not sure where the franchise will go from here, but if Doom isn't involved in some capacity, it might not get very far.<br/><br/>Any ordinary film based from a graphic novel is going to contain some pretty wild special effects and FANTASTIC FOUR did not disappoint. Some are saying the story gets in the way of the action taking place and I can just about get on board with that, because several times I felt lost within the story. But, I don't think it was enough to deter me from enjoying the film that director Tim Story (BARBERSHOP, TAXI) was trying to show. If anything, there wasn't enough ""show and tell"" of the special powers each of the characters possessed. And the only saving grace to that was Dr. Doom and his powers, which seemed to be invincible.<br/><br/>FANTASTIC FOUR may not be the best comic-based film of recent memory, but who cares? With a balanced enough story to go along with a good looking cast that seems to mesh well, what else do you need? I think if you try to pick this film apart, you will, but what's the point when the true idea of FANTASTIC FOUR is to simply entertain? Because in the end that's exactly what it did, taking you on a roller coaster ride that didn't stop until the dramatic ending, leaving you wanting more.<br/><br/>B+"

Good cast, lots of fun -worth seeing! Stan Lee has a speaking role in this film, just a cameo appearance, but plays a part nonetheless. One should have an open mind going into this, it is a comic book movie and the story is not meant to be highly realistic. I really felt that the acting made the flick, there is very good chemistry between the cast members. I actually felt rather emotional at parts and really felt a sense for what the characters were going through. This is one movie that I will buy when it is released on DVD. This summer, the comic book movie genre is cleaning up! ""Batman Begins"" and ""F4"" were both great! I can't wait for ""X3,"" ""Superman,"" ""Ghostrider"" and ""Spider-Man 3."" -and probably many more. Comic book movies are really pulling in the numbers and I anticipate there will be at least one sequel to the Fantastic 4."
"axopnk","4","0","1","13 July 2005"," Not bad but not great
","I have to agree with someone else who posted the board that this movie was not as good as X-men or Spider man but it wasn't as bad as the hulk, daredevil, punisher etc. The Good: First of all the good points of this movie is that the human torch and the thing were portrayed perfectly down to their comic versions. Human torch is cocky/funny(which is why he kinda gets along with spider-man in the comics) type. The Thing was also well portrayed down to the suit they used (why didn't they use that for the the hulk?). The Bad: The first person i'd have to comment on is mr. fantastic. Now the person who played as mr.fantastic did a good job as the character. In the comics mr.fantastic was more of a scientist than a fighter which is the problem. Mr.Fantastics power sucks period. It's not very cool, it's not very effective, and it doesn't have that ""whoa"" type of deal like looking at superman or spider man. Second person was invisible women. I have no problems with Jessica Alba at all, shes attractive and a pretty good actress. The problem is her age. Sue Storm is supposed to be older than her brother (human torch) but Alba looks younger than Johnny! I think the director or casting crew could have gotten someone more older and a little more well known (gwenth or someone else) but hey, invisible womens powers were pretty good and you can't beat alba stripping down to bra and panties The Ugly: The major problems of this film is first the forced love story and dialogue. The love story felt really artificial and planned, with no type of emotional attachment nor development. I don't think anyone cared that much about Mr. Fantastic getting with invisible women. Secondly is the use of powers. I know someone is probably asking ""how can you fit all of those powers onto one screen though?"" well take a good look at x-men and there's your answer. We don't really get a good feel of all of there powers until the end of the film which seems really rushed. It seems that the director/writer couldn't think of a intelligent way to get all of their powers to be ""special"" in one way or another to stop doom. Finally is Dr. Doom. Yeash. He did not seem very menacing and seemed to have no purpose at all at the end of the movie except blow stuff up. He was also supposed to be very intelligent, but man the actor who played him had horrible lines ""sue lets not fight"" ""i'll get to you in a second"" horrible. overall a good film, definite rental and possible buy but don't except to be knocked out like batman begins."

","If FANTASTIC FOUR had come out a few years ago, my vote might be 7 stars instead of 6 - maybe even 8. It was fun and exciting in the way many summer movies can be. But it came out this summer, after SPIDER-MAN and SPIDER-MAN 2; and right after BATMAN BEGINS. Before these movies, I believed that no one had really done the kind of translation of a comic book to big screen that I believed was possible. Even SUPERMAN, while really great for it's time, had some real flaws. But with the 3 movies stated above, my expectations weren't just met, they were exceeded.<br/><br/>Because FANTASTIC FOUR has to follow a couple of benchmarks, and share the summer with the best BATMAN story ever filmed (who knew we needed another one?), it unfortunately doesn't look quite as good as it might have. On the other hand, knowing what preceded it should have better equipped the filmmakers.<br/><br/>For example, the first rule of my New Standard in filming comic book stories, is having a terrific script, with a strong ending...which I realize every movie should, but especially with this genre often does not. The second rule is getting the casting perfect. And the third might be balancing the origin plot (if that's what you're doing), which has to be exposition, with engaging storytelling that has enough action to feel like the genre.<br/><br/>The cast was good, (and when is Michael Chiklis less than great!), but needed to be just the right fit for these characters. I mean, SPIDER-MAN 2 cast the brilliant Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, and BATMAN BEGINS had so many heavy hitters in the cast I won't take the space to list them. Needless to say, when you follow a movie that has Michael Caine as Alfred (!), you better get your own casting perfect. With FOUR, it never felt quite right. I know Alba was the popular choice for Sue Storm, but I never believed she was Sue. And that's a problem. The same goes for Reed Richards. He was fine, but it didn't seem like the actor really embodied the character. Conversely, I didn't think Tobey Maguire could do Peter Parker before I saw SP1, but he completely owned that character.<br/><br/>The other issue for FOUR was the script. It felt incomplete. Sure, origin stories are very difficult, but Sam Raimi showed everyone how to do it right. Of course, he only had one hero, to be fair; here we have 4 times the origin plot.<br/><br/>*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD *** But the big problem for me was the type of ending we got on this one: It is completely internal in nature. By that I mean the threat does not extend beyond our heroes to the 'real' world. In fact, there's a scene in the middle of the picture that feels much more exciting because the threat extends to 'normal' people, the innocent bystanders, as it were. In this kind of story telling, this early in the character's movie development, the world (or city or loved ones) have to be at great risk for the heroes to really have a victory. After all, the super heroes will surely be OK (at least that's what we feel) so the threat needs to extend beyond them. It never really did, and the ending felt anti-climactic. In line with this, the revealing of the villain in his 'super' form took so long, that the movie was almost over by the time we finally got to see him in costume. That might be a pacing problem, or unfamiliarity by the filmmakers with the genre, I'm not sure. But it peaked in the middle and never got better. Even THE INCREDIBLES understood when to reveal the villain, and what had to be at stake for a proper hero ending.<br/><br/>*** END OF SPOILERS *** I could really knit pick and ask why Johnny Storm wasn't blonde (or Sue for that matter, although at least she had some sort of dye job going on). But I think the bigger issue was really choice of cast, and overall story developments (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>So did I have fun? Well, sure. If you don't know the Fantastic Four from the books, you'll probably have fun. But I feel we still haven't seen a definitive version of this classic comic story on screen. It just didn't quite seem like the Four I remember."
"InvisibleSwordsman","6","0","1","13 July 2005"," Not fantastic - but not terrible, either.
","The advance buzz on ""Fantastic Four"" had me wondering whether this was going to be a repeat of the ""Punisher"" fiasco - that is, a big budget remake that was just as bad as the low budget schlock version. As it turns out, ""Fantastic Four"" isn't nearly that bad, though it pales by comparison to the best films of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>The film often more closely resembles an 80s Ivan Reitman effects comedy than it does an adventure foil - except that it's not especially funny. Of the cast, Micahel Chiklis as The Thing fares best. Director Tim Story never seems to entirely get a handle on the material, and seems a bit over his head.<br/><br/>All in all, though, ""Fantastic Four"" is a reasonably entertaining diversion, as long as you're not comparing it to ""Spider-MAn"", ""X-Men"" or ""Batman Begins"". This is closer to ""Batman Forever""."

But I don't really remember at this point. I think they did great picking the characters, they did a really good job, I also liked that it wasn't all love and romance like some of the movies are nowadays even if they're superhero movies...

"nobbytatoes","5","0","1","13 July 2005"," another comic book movie
","when they started to make the movie versions of comic books, i was all for it; but now over the idea. the first lot of comic book movies were done very well; spiderman, X-men, and lately Sin City, but all the others are so lacking in substance, which is the case for Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of the book or series, though i think Doctor Doom is the best villain ever. Julian McMahon played him very good, but his acting was not as great as on Nip/Tuck.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, Gruffud, Alba, Evans and Chiklis were no where on the same level as McMahon. Gruffud seemed miss casts as Mr. Fantastic, over exaggerating all his arm movements and twitches. Alba played Sue OK, but didn't seem comfortable in some scenes. Evans was so obnoxious, that his comic relief wasn't funny. Chiklis was OK as the Thing, but couldn't believe the scenes where he was trying to come to grips with his looks.<br/><br/>The only time this movie had an emotional kick to it was when they were emotionally fighting with another; with Doom trying to play them against another. But the amount of bad one liners, bad action sequences and hurried end covered the emotional core between all the characters.<br/><br/>The special effects were another flaw of this movie too. The effects for the human torch didn't seem believable; it didn't look like fire. When the invisible girl disappeared, keeping her outline so you could still 'see' her wasn't a good idea. When Mr. Fantastic stretched it also didn't seem real. though the up side was how they made the thing with a suit. He actually seemed like a rock and looked like he was indestructible. Though the best was the make-up for Dr. Doom. That was just wonderful. The metallic hand had to be the best effect in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't bad, but its nothing spectacular. This is just a little bit of escapism that will entertain for two hours."
"ThorBloodEagle","6","0","2","12 July 2005"," Oh Stan Lee when will you learn?
","It seems Stan Lee hasn't figured out that he has to find good writers before he makes his comics into a movie. As with The Hulk and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with both of the Spiderman movies, I left the theatre disappointed, but at the same time wanting more. <br/><br/>The movie itself was terrible, the writing was bad, the acting was bad, the plot (or almost lack there of) was bad... I could go on for a while, but I think I'll stop there. <br/><br/>Almost nothing happened the entire movie. It was as if the point of this movie wasn't to make a cool movie but rather lead up to a second one. It didn't seem like they cared if this movie was any good as long as it was good enough to make people want to see the second one. And I am sad too say, I want to see the second one. This was one big advertisement for Fantastic 4 2 (wow that looks weird). <br/><br/>Anyway, I don't want to bash the movie completely so I will leave my comments at ""I was highly disappointed"". However, I cannot say that all is lost as there is no way the second one will be worse, it can only get better. So things are looking up (only a little though). <br/><br/>In summary, I give this movie a 6 out of ten. This is based on my scale where a 5 is tolerable and a rating any lower is how badly you want the movie to end while watching it (4 being ""I'm going to go to the washroom and hopefully it will be better or over when I get back"" 3 being ""ok time to wrap it up"", 2 being oh god just finish the freakin' movie, 1 being ""shoot me. shoot me now, right in the head, oh god, please shoot me"".) <br/><br/>So I say, go see this movie if you intend on seeing the second one, but my recommendation is to rent it when it comes out."

","The movie had great special effects, and some very talented actors, but the plot was lacking. Whith characters with this many powers, they took too long for them to figure out that they had them, and then acted like they did not know how to use them in the least. There were so many things that they could have done to make this a great film, but they just did not do it. I am not sure if they just tried too hard to show the history, or to give some background for the plot. I was just let down.<br/><br/>The Villain was not anywhere near as strong as he was in the comic books. (For those who care about the comic books)He was tough, but no where near the magnitude of what his strengths could have been.<br/><br/>If I had the choice of waiting for the video, or paying 7 bucks to see it again, I know that I would wait.

The film is cheesy at times but so is the story of the Fantastic Four so you get what you paid for. Could have had alittle more something something in it, but it didn't and it still works just fine.

Should have just gone with the Mole Man and his giant subterranean monster in this film and left Doom for a sequel. I realize the thought was that Doom would've made a more exciting villain but if the end result is to dumb down the original, why bother?

"missnobody717","5","0","1","8 July 2005"," The title of this movie should read: Chris Evans is HOT.
","I just saw this movie at a sneak preview last night. As far as comicbook movies go, this one was pretty shallow.<br/><br/>(Keep in mind that I don't read the comics, so I'm coming from the point of view of the audience segment not already familiar with the back story. And obviously the creators are looking to broaden their audience to include people like me as opposed to specifically addressing comic fans, so all you nerds getting your light sabers in a twist because there was some nuance I didn't catch, get a grip.) This movie had the feel of those movie sequels where all the returning characters mail it in with glib remarks instead of conveying any depth of emotion or intimacy, because you were supposed to ""gotten"" that in the previous movies.<br/><br/>In this movie, all these characters know each other, worked with each other, and in a couple cases, are related to each other and dated each other. So where's the chemistry? Sue and Reed act more like lab partners than pining lovers. Sue and Johnny are brother and sister, and you're supposed to get that connection because she tells him to grow up, and he jokes that he's going to be ""scarred for life"" when she strips to her underwear to be invisible. ClichÃ©d but still doesn't work. First of all, she's not hideous, sister or not. Second of all, she's in her underwear, not a gangbang video. What's the big deal?<br/><br/>Another thing is, except for Reed, I never got any impression that any of the other scientists were, well, smart. Much less brilliant. Where was the technobabble, the certifications and qualifications, the science talk? So, as far as comic book movies go, I'd say this one is the most mediocre. The acting is only okay, the character development is only okay, the action is only okay, the spec effects are only okay, and I get the impression that most of the connection made with the audience is through comic book references so that comicon nerds can feel comfortable that the characters are being represented accurately.<br/><br/>There is one saving grace to this movie, which I mentioned in the summary. Chris Evans is hot! Smoking hot! Get it? Get it? He's smoking hot because he catches fire, and also because he's a fine piece of man meat! Which you get to see, a LOT, because his clothes keep burning off! Because he's smoking hot!! Ha ha! Not only does it make for a continually amusing double entendre, (at least it did for me) it also makes for continually appreciable gratuitous semi-nudity. Whenever Chris Evans isn't running around in a skintight jumpsuit, he's running around half or mostly naked. In a movie world where Bo and Luke Duke got recast with Stiffler and Jackass, it's extremely refreshing to see that some directors still care enough about their female audience to include attractive actors and gratuitous male nudity. Thank you, Tim Story. It made your movie watchable.<br/><br/>(And thank YOU, Chris Evans. Keep up the good work!)"
"samseescinema","5","0","1","10 July 2005"," Story is proving himself to be a disappointing director
","Fantastic Four Reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>Rating: 2 out of 4<br/><br/>Director: Tim Story Cast: Michael Chiklis, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon, Ioan Gruffudd Screenplay: Michael France, Mark Frost, MPAA Classification: PG-13 (sequences of intense action, and some suggestive content)<br/><br/>There's so much giddy energy injected into Fantastic Four that it's difficult not to like. Despite so many missteps and problems, the film still manages to endear its audiences to the comic book hokey-ness that's absent from many of the new comic book to film adaptations. Point in fact, Batman Begins dropped the cartoon corniness for an affective grim surrealism. But Fantastic Four embraces the cheesy dialogue bubbles and uses them both to the film's advantage and to its disadvantage.<br/><br/>What's most frustrating when watching Fantastic Four is its absurd sense of pacing. For 90 minutes, director Tim Story develops his characters without much concern for the audience's excitement. We're treated to a single fight sequence in that entire 90 minute segment. Albeit, the sequence is amazing, but still, a bit more action couldn't hurt.<br/><br/>The film opens with failed corporate businessman Richard Reed (Ioan Gruffud) and his bodyguard Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) heading up to the top story of the Von Doom building in New York City. There they pitch their idea to Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), the richest businessman in the world. Their theory one of a radioactive wave from space causing Earth's planetary evolution. Six weeks from now, another one of the waves will enter Earth's orbit. Reed would like to take a shuttle up to von Doom's space station and use its uniquely powerful shields to study the wave. Seeing it as a grand financial opportunity, von Doom bites and soon enough Reed and Doom's team are scooting around Victor's space station. The team includes Ben Grimm, Susan Storm (Jessica Alba), Victor's head of Genetic research and love interest, her brother Johnny (Chris Evans), a lover of extreme sports and former NASA pilot, Victor, and Richard. All is going well until unexplainable the wave closes in much faster than expected, catching the entire team by surprise. Not able to get the shields up in time, all the team members are exposed to the wave and consequently have their DNA strangely altered. Gradually, all their newfound superpowers are revealed. Reed is now Mr. Fantastic, with a rubber body. Susan is now The Invisible Girl, who also has the power of conjuring up strong force fields. Johnny is now The Human Torch, having the power to engulf himself in flames and somehow fly. Ben is now The Thing, made entirely out of rock. Lastly, Victor von Doom is secretly and slowly changing into a man made entirely of steel stronger than diamonds. When the former four decide to try and reverse the changes, Victor decides to use his power to take over the world. As if his name didn't give it away.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the desperately slow pace of the film puts a hamper on what could have been an epic comic book adventure. The screenplay strives to build three-dimensional characters, but leaves the dialogue to material we expect only from the little white dialogue bubbles in the comics. These work fine for comic books, but put to the actors the lines come out cheesy and ineffective. But the blame can't be dumped on the acting. Although none of the five main actors put up performances any more than acceptable, the material they have to work with is surely flawed. <br/><br/>However, when we do finally get to the action, it's simply stunning. Staying true to the long running comic book series, the film's action sequences utilize all the different abilities of the Fantastic Four. The action isn't minced into half-second shots as it was in the upcoming The Island and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but given large scope, allowing us to witness it in all its glistening entirety. But the CGI work, although abundant, is hit and miss in quality. Some of the earlier shots, a space-ship docking shot in particular, are strangely poor. But work with Alba's invisibility and force-fields are quite eye-widening. There's a great scene where the four are dukin' it out with Doom on the streets of New York; Johnny lights himself to the point of ""Supernova"", creating a boiling hot explosion contained by a half-spherical semi-transparent force-field of Susan Storm. In scenes like these, where there's this great mix of beautiful art design and clever action choreography, Fantastic Four finally finds its feet. <br/><br/>It's a shame that throughout the rest of the film, the disappointing Dr. Doom and his evil scheming are little more than backdrops to the corny, one-dimensional character development Tim Story tries to create. Some of this lack of comic book violence can be attributed to the film's apparent ""lightness."" It's rumored that an early version of the screenplay would have garnered a PG rating. And today, a PG rating is almost as suicidal as an NC-17. PG-13 reigns king over the summer box office. But even with a PG-13 rating, Fantastic Four still feels somehow light. Dr. Doom isn't all that scary, about on par with Spiderman's Green Goblin. And substituting for action sequences are lame extreme sports endeavors with Johnny Storm. Johnny's one of the more entertaining aspects of the film, but snowboarding and motorcycles rarely live up to superpower combat on the city's streets. <br/><br/>I feel let down by Fantastic Four. Tim Story is proving himself to be a disappointing director, coming off of Taxi last year and following it up with this high-profile letdown. The film leaves much open-ended material for a sequel. So lets hope another screenwriter and a drastically different director get behind the helm of our next adventure with the Fantastic Four."

I saw it expecting nothing outstanding from it because with all due respect the F4 have never been the coolest team and I've always thought of them as somewhat tacky actually. That's sort of just what they are, so I wasn't expecting a different spin on the X-Men films, I was expecting a light-hearted origin story basically, and that's what I got. I was never bored, even when there was very little action going on the 4 were still using their powers and it was cool to watch. In fact, this movie was supposed to be comical in a way, and it really was. You saw them come to grips with their powers as they have difficulty getting along with one another, but in the end they come together like a family and cover each other's backs when duty called for it. If there wasn't enough action for some viewers, it can at least be said that this was certainly an entertaining movie, and I'm curious to see future films and how some villains are revamped to be more suitable for the big screen."

","Now I must say that Tim Story did a fairly good job of translating the original comic book into a movie. The casting was done very well, with maybe the exception of Jessica Alba. Chris Evans, Mike Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffudd were excellent choices for the heroes.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie and aren't a big FF fan, then I have some advice. You shouldn't go into it looking for an average or cliché superhero movie. Of course, the movie will have the cliché elements of cheesy catchphrases (thanks to Stan Lee), but it's Marvel! This movie can be compared most to Spider Man; you have five characters not interested in superpowers and then they get them by accident. But, unlike Spider Man, they spend a good part of their time trying to find a ""cure"" for their powers. Does this take away from the movie experience? Only if you're looking for an action superhero movie with lots of fight scenes and mindless ""clobbering."" No, my friends, because this movie actually has a story. The emotional center is Ben Grimm/The Thing, and you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. These are four good friends that want to be friends (well, for the most part). Grimm WANTS to be cured and is an emotional wreck.<br/><br/>I'll try not to spoil much, but go into this movie without great expectations and you should come out fairly pleased. I would give the movie a 7.8, because of some logistical things (you'll know when you see it), but I still loved it. If you're a big FF fan like myself, I can say that you won't be disappointed (much)."

","I'm giving this movie a high rating because I really enjoyed it.

It's a weak storyline, but still there.<br/><br/>Now Marvel has always had their heroes being struggling, not enjoying the superhero business and the storyline has followed through here with the ""Thing"" who looses his fiancé because of his transformation. The others are having problems between themselves (old feelings coming back yadda yadda) My only real advice here is that if you want a dark ""thinking"" movie, go see Batman Begins, however if you want a fun summer movie that focuses on action and some interestingly placed comedy then Fantastic Four is for you.<br/><br/>Hopefully if they make a sequel, now that they have the basics (introducion of powers, etc.) covered they can make a movie more friendly to critics."

Also, FF was made on a very short time line, with an unheralded director, and a B-list cast. In spite of these limitations, the movie I saw was very enjoyable, and it moved quickly.<br/><br/>***********spoilers********************<br/><br/>Now, this is far from the ideal FF movie. The problem is, how to use cinema shorthand to tell a story that has been 44 years in developing. Thus, we get a wife for Ben, whose only purpose is to demonstrate how tragic the Thing's transformation is. Doom has been included in the space flight in order to give him 1) reason to hate the FF, and 2) cause for homicidal insanity. Of course, what makes Doom in the comics so evil is the fact that he is perfectly sane, but cripplingly arrogant and proud, with blind lust for power. If the franchise goes for one or two more movies, the ending of ""FF"" indicates that we may next see Doom in a form much closer to his comic self. Man, would it be great to see Ben and Johnny wading into an army of Doom-bots!<br/><br/>Yet, we need to acknowledge what ""FF"" gets right. The costumes, the powers, the banter between the team members, and 4/5 of the cast are all about as good as one could hope for. Johnny is just perfect! Updating him to an extreme sports junkie is a great way to bring out his impulsive, fearless nature. The Torch is my absolute favorite part of ""FF"". Also, the scenes of Ben trying to live in a world too fragile for him are great! His interplay with Johnny is dead-on, and not overdone. Reed comes off too wimpy in the beginning, but he has the dedication and concern for others that makes him a strong heroic figure. The scenes of him working around the clock in his lab, complete with 2 days beard, are taken directly from numerous FF stories. His tussle with Ben is priceless, he really is Mr. Fantastic. Sue is radically changed, like Doom. Alba's casting is, for me, the weakest part of the movie. She was obviously cast for her name recognition and her ability to look quite fetching in a suit of unstable molecules. On the plus side, her Sue is a strong character, and she assumes the leadership role early on, when Reed is just befuddled. She is simply too young for this role.<br/><br/>**************end spoilers************************ <br/><br/>Another IMDb user commented that what is missing is the sense of wonder in the FF books, the feeling that we were going somewhere we had never been before. Fantastic Four, the comic, embraces the wonders of technology as a way to better ourselves, a force for good in the world. That kind of innocent optimism is somewhat out of style now.<br/><br/>When I heard all the negatives prior to release, I lowered my expectations for the ""FF"". I am a total Marvel freak, I started reading the comics in 1966, and I have all the action figures. I realize that big-budget movies involve compromise, and ""FF"" is not immune. The producers, in an attempt to draw the teen target audience, included some gags and music that will not age well. ""FF"" lacks the timeless quality of ""Spider-man"", the master template for good superhero movies. The changes to Doom especially have upset many of the comics fans. Yet, would this movie ever have been made without these concessions? The Fantastic Four is not a pop culture icon like Batman or Spider-man, recognizable to all but the extreme media-deprived. Overall, though, ""FF"" is a good summer movie, just not the best possible FF adaptation. I can live with that."

","I'm in my mid-fifties and a huge fan of comic book movies. I love it when Hollywood brings my favorite comic book heroes to life on the big screen using state of the art technology to convince me of their reality.<br/><br/>F4 succeeds in the CGI and effects department. I was somewhat concerned when I learned that ""The Thing"" would be done with a prosthetic suit instead of CGI, but I think it was pulled off nicely due, in no small part, to Michael Chiklis' characterization.<br/><br/>Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richarsds was visually acceptable, but was a bit of a milquetoast compared to the character in the comic book.<br/><br/>Jessica Alba as Sue Storm I found to be more than acceptable. Perhaps a bit too buff compared to the comic's character, I nonetheless found Alba's interpretation of Sue Storm to be exotic and endearing. If a franchise develops, I hope Alba returns as The Invisible Girl.<br/><br/>Chris Evans may have been born to play Johnny Storm. He was perfect as the 'cocky young guy' and brings to mind Chris O'Donnell's performance as ""Robin"" in the Batman franchise. Evans obviously had a lot of fun playing the character and should definitely be tapped to return if a franchise develops.<br/><br/>Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom was respectable, and I would not balk should he return in the role. However...<br/><br/>Where this film fell short for me was the story itself. The first part of the film did well in presenting the basic facts of how the Fantastic Four gained their abilities. And I even understand that for a 'first of the franchise' type of film that certain elements of each of the characters had to be presented in a way that remained true to the comic. Still, though, when the film reached it's grand finale battle with Dr. Doom, I found myself thinking ""Is that it?"" And it was...the end of the film, and I felt let down.<br/><br/>While I felt that all of the basics of the story had been presented and the SFX were on mark, the story fell short of creating a truly ominous villain in the character of Dr. Doom. This was not the actor's fault. The blame is squarely on the director and screenwriter. Dr. Doom was far too easy to thwart! Whenever Victor Von Doom was on the screen there was no sense of foreboding and evil. In the comics I remember Dr. Doom as a nearly omnipotent force of evil. In this film Dr. Doom is just a man with a few quirks. And he was far, far, far too easy to thwart! Without a truly ominous and evil Dr. Doom the characters of the Fantastic Four had no credible foil to play against, and thus their characterizations were diminished.<br/><br/>Still, though certainly not a high-water mark in the genre, Fantastic Four is solid entertainment and a lot of fun. But, should the franchise continue, I think the director would be wise to first become a TRUE fan of the original comic, second watch and study every film by Sam Peckinpah, Steven Spielberg and John Frankenheimer, and third forget about ratings, the 'kiddies' and family fare, but instead make a film that tells a knuckle-whitening story as do the comics.<br/><br/>There have been many films where it is easy to say that the SFX did not serve the story. In this film the story did not serve the SFX.<br/><br/>5 stars out of 10 for SFX, and Jessica Alba. Add two stars for Michael Chiklis as ""The Thing"". Verdict: 7 out of 10 stars."

","I'm a pretty battle hardened movie goer, especially when it comes to Sci-fi, and this movie really isn't as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. One review said it was 'Catwoman bad'; I read that a few days ago reading and I got worried! Well much to my surprise, it was actually a pretty decent comic book movie. It wasn't Spidey 2 or X2 quality, but it was certainly not Catwoman bad or Daredevil bad or even Hulk bad. Here's what I liked: The Thing - Mike Chiklis really brought this character to life. From the moment he became 'Thing', and you heard his voice, he owned the role. Almost like Hugh did with Wolverine. Human Torch - this kid was pretty funny and provided much of the comic relief. The actor actually had good timing and deadpan. His taunting relationship with 'Thing' was just like the comics, they're always fighting. Doom - he was pretty cool too, a little to cliché, but OK, I'll roll with it. They got his look dead-on though. Straight out the comic book. Here's what as OK: Invisible Girl - yeah, she's hot. but unfortunately she wasn't as convincing as Thing and Torch. Some of her dialogue was really bad. But she's real cute. The Special effects - not bad but not amazing either. You could tell that there were budget constraints that limited some of the effects. The story - pretty true to the comic but unfortunately it had some ridiculous scenarios to bring it down. What I didn't like: Mr. Fantastic - I thought he was miscast and not very convincing. A pretty mediocre genius if you ask me, and really unconfident. Jeff Goldbloom may have been a better choice for this role. Overall a really decent comic movie!"

","Although I thoroughly enjoyed ""Fantastic Four"" and found it quite entertaining, it is definitely not spectacular. The movie begins with Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), the brilliant, yet out of luck (and money), scientist, and his best friend, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis-The Shield), astronaut and pilot. Their dream: to study the effects of a cosmic storm on human DNA in order to learn more about the basic make-up of human beings, and possibly find cures for the world's most destructive diseases. However, Reed must seek funding from former MIT rival (and current industrial millionaire) Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon-Nip/ Tuck and Charmed), who is also ""dating"" Reed's former love, the brilliant and beautiful Susan Storm (Jessica Alba-Honey). Also on the trip is Sue's younger brother, hothead pilot Johnny Storm (Chris Evans-Cellular and The Perfect Score), who also happens to be a self-centered attention-seeker (and really hot... no pun intended). But as they near the completion of their mission, it becomes apparent that Reed has miscalculated the speed of the storm, and the crew has minutes to get Ben back into the ship and activate the shields. This they fail to do, and Ben, Reed, Sue, and Johnny are all exposed to mutating radiation. When they wake up in quarantine days later, they find they have transformed into superheroes. Reed, the leader of the group, has become ""Mr. Fantastic"", with the ability to stretch and contort his limbs like rubber. Sue, now ""The Invisible Girl"", has the ability to become invisible, as well as bend and deflect light. Ben (who has gone through the most dramatic change) becomes a big rock-like... thing with superhuman strength, and is aptly named ""The Thing"". Finally, Johnny has become ""The Human Torch"", and can engulf himself in flames and reach dizzying heat (like the heat of a supernova). The four team together to form ""The Fantastic Four"", and battle the evil Victor, now Dr. Doom, who was also transformed by the storm into a metallic villain. Will the superheroes defeat the bad-guy? You figure it out. However, the ending does leave room for a sequel... because in Hollywood, there's always gotta be a sequel (just look at Garfield 2 and Cheaper By the Dozen 2). All in all, a good, highly entertaining movie, which, although it fails to thoroughly impress, at least made me want to write a review."
"bek-12","7","0","2","9 July 2005"," Another lost opportunity....
","Okay, I saw this movie tonight and it was fairly enjoyable, but nowhere near great. (I'd like to give it a 6.5/10, but since we have to choose whole numbers, I went ahead and gave it a 7.) Marvel is blowing it big time. With every mediocre movie, they are further ""expending"" their most valuable characters. They've now used up X-Men, the Hulk, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher, Man-Thing, Spider-Man, and more to come, like Ghost Rider. With the exceptions of X-Men and Spider-Man, the movies ranged from absolutely terrible (Man-Thing) to various shades of okay/decent (Punisher, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra). Avi Arad of Marvel just doesn't seem to be getting it--once these characters are used, they're done for at least several years! Not every mediocre comic book movie gets revitalized like the Batman franchise. More likely, they'll fade away and be forgotten, and the more often it happens, the less Hollywood will want to create comic book movies. Marvel should know this! So why are they letting mediocre and little known directors/talent work on their their flagship characters? Where is Stone, Cameron, Howard, Spielberg, Singer (okay, he did do two X-Men movies) and the other A-list talent that should be spearheading the biggest comic book movies? And why the heck would Marvel put a great brand like Fantastic Four in the hands of a guy that did ""Barbershop"" and not much else? Sadly, I just don't get it.<br/><br/>So from all that, I'm sure you can tell I wasn't overly impressed. It was an okay action flick and decent special effects. The acting seemed wooden at times, and some scenes were either edited heavily or just didn't make much sense. The actors gave it a valiant try, but at least two of them weren't even close to up to snuff. The writing was cheesy and not nearly serious enough for the epic this movie should have been. And of course, we had the obligatory change of events from the comic to the screen. You know what I mean--when the Hollywood writer/director decides that the comic story was ""silly"" and adds his own ideas into the character's origin, thus alienating many comic readers by ignoring comic book cannon. This doesn't bother me IF the change is really necessary or adds to the story, but too often it's an arbitrary change (i.e. changing the Hulk's name from ""David"" to ""Bruce"" in the TV show) that really adds nothing to the story. Also, a few cheesy lines are fine, but this movie went overboard. My personal (un)favorite for ""Absolute Worst Line in this Movie(tm)"" was the Johnny Storm one-liner: ""You're Hot"", ""Why thank you--so are you!"" Ugh. How lame.<br/><br/>I do admit that Chris Evans, who I wasn't familiar with until now, did an excellent job as the Human Torch, but it wasn't enough to turn this movie around.<br/><br/>If I had to briefly describe the movie's faults, I'd say it's a combination of mediocre acting and mediocre writing/directing. Avi, please start demanding top talent for your movies. I promise you it will pay off!"

","I'm amazed at all the bashing this movie is receiving. Some people say that movie company posted some ringer comments. That may be true, but from what I read, it looks to me like the competition has posted some ringers of their own to bash it.<br/><br/>Reading a lot of the comments, I get the feeling people are expecting too much from this movie. Batman Begins is a different order of movie. I expected serious and dark there. Here I was looking for and found light and fun. I enjoyed both movies. Obviously Batman Begins was the better movie but it was not light fare either.<br/><br/>A little less of Johnny Storm might have improved this a bit. But in general Chris Evans did a very nice job of portraying this character. He was annoying but he was meant to be. I enjoyed the way he enjoyed his talent.<br/><br/>Michael Chiklis did a great job as the Thing. The one that gave me the most trouble is Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom. IT didn't come across well.<br/><br/>In summary, my wife and I went out to see a light, fun movie and got exactly what we were looking for. If that is what you want, I recommend it. If you are looking for the next Best Film or Best Action film, stay home because there is nothing for you in the theaters now and, I suspect, there never will be."

","It's just one thing, Vik Mackey as THE THING. He talked just like Vik Mackey which was really cool. There was no character development AT ALL. The entire traffic scene in which pure carnage was unleashed, was ALL THE FAULT of The Thing. He should have let that guy JUMP to his death. And then there is Dr. Doom, or shall I say, Doctor Van Doom. What kind of weirdo CEO has the last name of DOOM? I guess a Marvel Comic Book character does, that's who!! And what was the deal with the Invisible Girl? She has a force field that bent light? That was odd. This movie was so so. What you see is what you get. Tedd Gilbert's wife is expecting a child.

","There are your good, bad and average comic books. Just like your good, bad and average movies. I have been reading the Fantastic Four since the beginning (actually since Spiderman, so I missed the first few issues), and while this movie is not great, it does evoke a lot of the confused spirit of the first few years of the comic book. Let's face it: there is nothing wrong with this movie a better director could not have fixed. But for what it is, it does it pretty well. I had a feeling as I left the theater that the producers decided to go a different way with this movie (as opposed to the great Spiderman and X-Men films). To make a light, carefree presentation that does not violate the inherent intent of the book; and speaking as one who has loved and followed the book since the early 1960's, I think that was accomplished. If they were trying to give the public a presentation of a typical average, dopey comic book, I think they were successful. Not every comic book movie has to be a great movie (think Batman Begins, or Spiderman 2), and there is room for a basic entertaining movie that is faithful to the core material that comes off slight."

"Aaron1375","8","0","4","9 July 2005"," Not fantastic, but a pretty good movie nonetheless.
","This movie was rather good and it was a bit light and not as serious as say ""Batman Begins"". Hey these are the Fantastic Four though and not the Dark Knight, their name suggests they are going to be a bit less serious. Could have been more action, but it had its comic moments that made up for the lack of action. All the Fantastic Four actors were great so now it is time for my number one major gripe of the film. Doctor Doom was portrayed completely wrong, I did not let it ruin the film for me, but I really did not think the actor was right and I also don't think it would have been all that hard to get his origin correct. He never had any powers in the comic book, he was simply a brilliant scientist and dabbler in magic who blamed Reed for an accident that left him permanently scarred. He created a powerful armor to combat the Fantastic Four and is one of the best Marvel villains there is even fighting the likes of Spider-man. Here he also comes into contact with the cosmic rays and the armor he built in the comic just starts to form on him. They make mention of his homeland, but I am not sure if he is the leader. To tell ya the truth I feel Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been the perfect Doom, but then I am not a movie maker so what do I know. Other than that for the most part I liked the movie. People have been complaining about the effects, but I thought they were pretty good, not top notch, but then this movie was not given an unlimited budget. Probably had something to do with the fact the Hulk underachieved, I doubt they were going to give this movie over a 150 million budget when the slightly more known Hulk didn't pull in all that much. Five or six years ago though, had this movie come out the effects would have been considered top notch, just not by todays standards. The Thing was great, it did look like rock, and all the others had their powers working good too. The fight with Doom could have been a bit longer, but this is an origin tale so they have to establish characters first. So in the end do not expect to be blown out of the water, but do expect a more basic summer popcorn flick."

","This was a good time at the movies. I wished the exciting bits could have been more exciting, but I have even less imagination than the screen writers, so I don't know how. All the Fantastic Four characters were well written, but developing four superheroes and a villain must be technically demanding. I wished for more from each of them, especially, Jessica Alba. This is the second time that she played a character who could have been naked and was not. That gripes my ass. What gripes it even more is gratuitous negritude, apparently, Hollywood's compulsory theme. Movies of this era will seem deformed, ridiculous, and antiquated. I want the people of the future to know that were those of us here in the past who realized that the trend was desperate and stupid.

After being on these boards and hearing this movie being bashed left and right, I was expecting it to be horrible or at least okay, nothing special. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had a lot of humor in it, which seemed to keep me and the rest of the audience entertained. Although Doom might have been weak at times, or at least not up to the comics, I was impressed about how well Gruffudd, Alba, Evans and Chiklis were together as the Fantastic Four. Good altogether ""chemistry"" or whatever you wanna call it between them. Sometimes at each others throats then friends the next. This is no masterpiece of a movie, but a good summer blockbuster."

"moonstarly","7","0","2","9 July 2005"," No ""Batman Begins""... but mostly solid stuff
","Well, I just returned from watching ""Fantastic Four""... and I think the mixed reviews it's been getting are pretty justified. For those of you who aren't aware, ""Four"" is about four (duh) friends whose genetic material is changed by a radioactive cloud on a trip to outer space, and their subsequent evolution into the well-known superhero team. Sounds like a fairly interesting story, right? It would be, but ""Fantastic Four"" falls short in the one area that gave ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman Begins"" such high praise-- character depth. Unlike many reviewers, I don't think the problem lies with the actors; the script was terrible. The screenwriter's one-liners and dumb jokes seem more fitting for a bland teen movie, and there is hardly any room for growth.<br/><br/>In fact, the acting is fairly good. Chris Evans (as Johnny Storm) is probably the funniest part of the movie; all of the good dialogue went to him, and his antics are, for the most part, in line with what I think the comic's creators had in mind. Michael Chiklis (as Ben Grimm) deserves a lot of praise not only for getting into that Thing suit every day, but for giving the gentle giant a depth that none of the other characters reaches. Ioan Gruffudd's Reed Richards is appropriately stiff, painfully geeky, and as a result isn't very likable, but he's a fine young actor, and I give him props for remaining true to the character. Jessica Alba's interpretation of Sue Storm was less than satisfying; however, her lines were by far the worst. Julian McMahon played a pretty flat, one-sided Victor Von Doom, but with a self-explanatory name like that, the creators were already condemning him to the one-sided evil villain subgroup.<br/><br/>Otherwise, if you're looking for something entertaining to watch on a hot summer's day (or want a good smash-em-up superhero film to take the kids to that isn't as dark as the newest ""Batman"" installment), ""Fantastic Four"" delivers. If you're looking for an interesting movie that will make you think, I'd advise you to look elsewhere."

We have to sit through this movie and see his progression into evil, and then we experience the disappointing villain and ending which is essential in every comic book movie.<br/><br/>I'm sure the pre-teens will love this movie. There is some funny moments and there is some annoying moments with Johnny Storm (unless you're 8 years old). <br/><br/>If you're a comic-book fan then this is a rental that will keep you entertained.

There had to have been some major editing around one of the climactic scenes (when Reed, Sue, and Johnny first see Ben as the Thing), because none of it made any narrative or emotional sense. That scene was just badly done. But I'm just glad this wasn't so bad (like the Hulk) that any hope of sequels was destroyed. This could be a fun series with this cast.

Pilot Ben Grimm is turned into a super-strong rock creature calling himself Thing. Together, they use their unique powers to explore the strange aspects of the world, and to foil the evil plans of Doctor Doom.<br/><br/>Who would have thought making a marvel comic book movie colorful and filled with humor? 'Fantastic 4', the latest addition in the comic book to movie adaptation, is one of the better ones of the genre. It's much more splashy and light then the darker ones, like Batman Begins, and it has more humor then it has any right to. The actors have a lot of charisma, and fit their roles well. Chris Evans plays his role with ease, as the only one excited about having these powers, and using them to get money and babes. The film's entertaining enough to keep out attention: fast, sleek and, yes, even vivid at times.<br/><br/>My few problems with the film are as follows: It's cheesy at times, and there's a lapse of time when they have no villain at all, and they're just trying to get a deeper understanding of their powers, which eventually runs a little thin. But there's enough positive points to outshine the negative points. So, if you walk into the theater expecting 'SpiderMan2', you might be a little disappointed. But if you walk in going with the film's silly charm, you'll be surprised.

","The Fantastic Four is pure dumb fun, a light summer confection. It is not in the same league as the aforementioned Spiderman, the first two Batman movies or the recently released Batman Begins. Nonetheless, it can be enjoyed for what it is--a family friendly popcorn flick.<br/><br/>The film starts somewhat slowly. It could almost be forgiven if it were due to exposition, however, this was not the case. Instead we were introduced to main characters with but sketchy information about their pasts together. It is a movie that requires that work your imagination a bit to fill in the blanks. Then, shortly after the catastrophic event that changes these characters for life, we are given a quick cut that feels like someone forgot a reel. One minute we are in outer space, and in the next we are back on earth in a hospital setting. It is jarring. Happily, things pick up form there and fun ensues.<br/><br/>The portrayals of the Human Torch and The Thing are the best parts of the film. The two of them provide the majority of the humor and action for the final two thirds of the film. Other half of the quartet don't quite click as well. Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic and Sue Storm, The Invisible Girl, don't quite have the chemistry. The romance between them seems a bit forced. Only the quickly unfolding relationship between Ben Grimm (The Thing) and the blind Alicia appears more unlikely. This is the first of a three movie deal--an origin film. Hopefully, they will do more in the other two films. The pieces are here to build a very good film franchise.<br/><br/>I'm ready for the next one."
