"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","399","445","23 November 2003"," A timeless classic
","Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.<br/><br/>Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.<br/><br/>Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Home Alone (1990) Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>It might be dumb and corny, but I've actually liked this highly entertaining flick. The plot's unbelievable, but who cares: it's funny! Macaulay Culkin plays 8 year-old Kevin, a misunderstood kid who lives in a big ass house with his family. They're about to leave for Paris, where they're gonna spend Christmas. About 20 people are running around the house, frenetically preparing for the trip. Kevin's mad at everyone, because no one pays attention to him, unless it's to yell at him. Hence, Kevin goes to sleep wishing that his whole family would disappear, and the next morning, they do! The thing is that they somehow woke up late, left home in a hurry, and hey, they forget Lil Kev! At first, he's happy as a monkey, but after a while, things get messy. Two dumbass robbers are planning to rob his house, but Kev ain't gonna let them!<br/><br/>Okay, I know, this is one stupid story, but it's developed into a wonderful family film, as enjoyable as it is warmhearted. Mac Culkin is awesome in the lead. He really carries the film: he's got style, he's funny and he's even a good actor! Too bad his personal life screwed up, because he had the talent to become a grown-up movie star. The idiotic criminals are also really cool, because they cast good actors instead of some Ernest-style lame-o over-actors. Oscar-winner Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (the narrator on The Wonder Years) are hilarious, but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters. Pesci plays an aggressive thug, and anyone who's seen him in a Scorsese film knows how good he is at it. Stern plays a total dufus, and he's also really convincing at it. The film's humor might seem dumb, but hey, it's funny. John Hughes' screenplay has Kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human Wile E. Coyotes, and like the cartoon, it made me laugh. The gags might be old, but they're played with inventiveness, and the acting is always right. I just love this film, and you will too if you look beyond the fact that it's a family film."
"MovieAddict2016","10","141","172","18 February 2003"," Heartwarming Holiday family classic.
","'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).<br/><br/>One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!<br/><br/>Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.<br/><br/>John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).<br/><br/>As for the acting.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.<br/><br/>John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.<br/><br/>And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.<br/><br/>Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars -"

","The overwhelming success of 'Home Alone' (it spawned two sequels), is enough to guarantee that most people will love this story of a family that departs for Paris on the Christmas holidays, mistakenly leaving an eight-year old boy to fend for himself. And fend he does, when burglars threaten to break in unless he can rig enough booby-traps to keep them out.<br/><br/>That's the simple plot in a nutshell. Macaulay Culkin seems to have no problem carrying most of the film with a wide variety of looks, gestures and expressions--but for my money it's Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci who get the main laughs as the bumbling burglars intent on outwitting the kid's traps.<br/><br/>
Others in the cast don't have as much to do but do well enough by their roles, particularly Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents who only discover on the plane that Kevin is missing. The laughs are steady, the color photography is great and the slight story is probably every boy's fantasy of what it might be like to be left home alone. Add to that the holiday flavor of Christmas and a pleasant musical score by John Williams and you have the makings of a classic. <br/><br/>The proof is in the pudding--they must have done something right!!"

","""Home Alone"" is a hilarious film about a young boy (Macaulay Culkin) who is accidently left home during the Christmas holidays after the rest of his family goes to Europe.  At first Culkin loves the situation, but soon he is scared to death when he learns that burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are targeting his house.  However, Culkin is pretty smart for an eight-year-old and he has plans for them when they attack.  Chris Columbus' direction is smart and so is the over-achieving screenplay.  This film has a little bit of something for everyone and the fact that the backdrop is the Christmas holidays, only makes it that much more special.  All the performers do well and in the end the film also does.  4 stars out of 5."

","In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.<br/><br/>There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.<br/><br/>But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.<br/><br/>Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.<br/><br/>Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.<br/><br/>There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.<br/><br/>Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone."
"Quinoa1984","9","49","65","4 November 2000"," A well done family comedy
","This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges.  Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.  B+"

","My all time favorite film. Macaulay Culkin did superbly as a child actor, but as he grew up, he simply disappeared into oblivion. His last good film being Ritchie Rich (1994), live-action film adaptation of the Harvey Comics comic book character Richie Rich.<br/><br/>So from his highest grossing film Home Alone to Richie Rich is only a 4 year reign. <br/><br/>In this film we have the pairing of two talented actors in Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern(I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS GUY ACTS & HIS SENSE OF HUMOR!!!). They are a pair of burglars Harry Lyme (Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Stern), specializing in housebreaking when the occupants are off on holiday. This time its on Christmas. The McCallister's have planned a trip to Paris. Meanwhile Harry has his sights set on the McCallister House.<br/><br/>However things don't necessarily go as planned... Kevin has been forgotten at home and the McCallister's realize this too late. <br/><br/>Now Kevin is all alone against a duo of hardened(?), professional(?) crooks. 2 vs. 1 is not a fair fight(or so you think...).<br/><br/>What happens next is why this film has become the most grossing American comedy film of 1990. I WON'T reveal what happens next, so either go see it at a Cinema you like or watch it on DVD/CABLE or ONLINE or buy the DVD either at a DVD store or online. <br/><br/>This film has a decent sequel: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York which follows the further mishaps in the life of Kevin.<br/><br/>Other Macaulay Culkin films worth seeing/having: Uncle Buck, The Good Son, My Girl, Getting Even with Dad, and Richie Rich."
"lilballa08","10","38","51","22 August 2006"," Hilarious movie with a tight cast!!!
","There is no film to put beside Home Alone by way of comparison. It is a film genre of it's own. I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Hughes chuckling. This was the intent, it was meant to upset the status quo and in ""politically correct"" times that we live in, isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as ""Clockwork Orange"" talked about ""ultraviolence"" this movie is all about ultra-bad pranks. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Home Alone is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre, John includes the always discussed paint can scene. No reason for this scene, except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget, and using Hughe's stock cast, this is a movie simply about a young kid whose parents forget him while they go on vacation. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses. Not a movie to buy for Mom on Mother's Day... but worth seeing just to say you did."

","Home alone review<br/><br/>Home alone is a warm, family comedy film made in 1990, it was written and produced by John Hughes and was directed by Chris Columbus. The main part of Kevin McCallister is played by Macaulay Culkin, his parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara and the villains (the wet bandits) are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The signature tune is made by John Williams, musician of 'Star Wars', 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings'. 20th Century Fox bought the plan for home alone from Warner Bros and upped the budget for the movie by $4 million, it turned out as a bargain for 20th Century Fox because it raked in $476,684,675 at the box office; and as of 2009, home alone was the highest grossing comedy of all time! The McCallisters go to Paris for Christmas, however their eight-year-old son Kevin is left behind after sleeping in and not being awoken but being forgotten...bad parenting! In the mother's defence, she moves Heaven and Earth attempting to get back to her son. At first, Kev loves being alone by himself in his house, eating junk food, jumping on beds, watching scary movies, going through his brothers personal belongings, without anyone telling to do otherwise. But eventually, the young boy has to fight for himself and his home as two wannabe robbers plan to raid his house. He does this while helping repair the broken family of a man who once scared the life out of him, can an eight-year-old really manage to do this? Mend, cook, clean and kick butt? After writing my Hobbit review I re-read my previous reviews, and of course I came across my Home Alone 2 review. It stated that the home alone's were really good Christmas films, and conveniently my parents had bought me the box set the previous day...good parenting! So I decided to do some Christmassy things (decorated the cake that my Grandad baked and put up my tree) whilst watching it. This movie is just as good as it's sequel, which means this film has to be quality because number two had an automatic advantage due to the fact it was in New York. This film is the first of it's kind, an individual, not repetitive, a breath of fresh air which I pointed out it's sequel review; John Hughes must have been just as tired as me with boring ol' movies that are remade every year, he must have had to rack his brains for a while in order to think up a plot like that, it's pure random gold! Anyway, I love this film, the plot is magic, the actors are magic, the music is magic and I think it well deserves to be the highest grossing comedy of all time! I think that's why it's follow-up had to be something special, in order to not be one of the biggest movie let downs of all time, and that's why three and four were. So, Well done John Hughes and Chris Columbus (for one and two, not three and four because they were a massive let down.) RATING: 8.3/10<br/><br/>Best parts: Kevin's initial reaction to being left alone The booby trap fight The ending (oh, how cute!?)"
"Toronto85","8","9","10","17 December 2012"," Home Alone
","An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. <br/><br/>Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.<br/><br/>The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the ""Wet Bandits"". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.<br/><br/>All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Atreyu_II","7","33","46","20 August 2007"," Surreal and hilarious
","""Home Alone"" is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.<br/><br/>The plot is quite original and surreal: a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. <br/><br/>Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" (performed by Brenda Lee), ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"", ""White Christmas"", ""Carol of the Bells"", ""Oh Holly Night"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and some brilliant instrumental musics.<br/><br/>Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the ""wet bandits"" Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected ""surprises"". Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>The ""wet bandits"" were nicknamed like that by Marv because their ""calling card"" (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both ""wet bandits"" are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.<br/><br/>The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.<br/><br/>The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film ""Angels with Filthy Souls"" are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.<br/><br/>Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».<br/><br/>The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. <br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the ""wet bandits"" and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski, the «Polka King of the Midwest»."

"Jerique","8","7","8","7 April 2011"," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Home Alone is a nostalgic film for me, having watched it religiously when I was a young kid growing up. Roger Ebert gave this film a 2.5 out of 4. He calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premise.<br/><br/>Home Alone plays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life. Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten at home in Chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to Paris. Soon after, Kevin is visited by home invaders Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) and it's up to him to stop them.<br/><br/>Ebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the McCallister's tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what Kevin does. While this is not far from the true, you're supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching this.<br/><br/>I enjoy Home Alone because an 8-year old handles two grown up burglars. I don't enjoy watching people getting hurt, but I think in this case, there is an exception. The moral of the story is that even when you're young, you can still be responsible and handle your home from being invaded. It shows that it's wrong to rob people and that even children can be heroes.<br/><br/>However, I find that the sequel is much better than this and it's due to the far superior story setup. Kevin being left home alone was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up story.<br/><br/>To review this film without the mention of Macaulay's acting is a crime. Macaulay portrays Kevin with amazing talent and it's great for the simple fact that the 90s weren't really big for their child actors as far as I can remember. Macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared, showing emotion, and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief, too. He was a great actor and I was sad to only see a few of his films before he retired.<br/><br/>Another great point about Home Alone being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary John Williams. He gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember Home Alone as being a classic film and never forget Macaulay's performance. Somewhere in My Memory has always been a favourite track of mine by Williams and it's just a great piece of music on top of a great film.<br/><br/>This film is a classic for me, and I would never say that this isn't a wonderful film, despite being a tad bit unrealistic. But, the fact is, most films exaggerate and force you to suspend disbelief. Don't allow for this film not to be a favourite because you don't think this sort of thing could happen."

It is a classic for me, certainly a child hood favourite!<br/><br/>The story is a very simple one; Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is accidentally left at Home over the Christmas as his whole family fly to Paris. They board the plane without realising that they have left one of their Children home alone! Two small time robbers are also in the area, looking to break into houses, they target the McCallister household as they believe they are all away for the Christmas holidays. It is now up to Kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks, some of which are absolutely brilliant! <br/><br/>The two Robbers; Marv & Harry, played by Daniel Stern & Joe Pesci, give fantastic performances. They portray the classic dumb & dumber routine. Harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader & Marv plays the really stupid, gullible one who falls for much more simple traps. The on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic, it comes across very realistic and hilarious.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin was 9 or 10 when Home Alone was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance. The Home Alone films are pretty much all he has been known for, which is a shame really, he had a few other films but none are as well-known and successful as these. <br/><br/>Of course this isn't the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios, but who cares. It's fun! It's Christmassy & It's got great characters with some truly hilarious moments.<br/><br/>Overall, Home Alone is a very fun movie; I have the relation to it as it was always on at Christmas when I was a child. But even if this isn't the case, I'm sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child!<br/><br/>8/10"

","I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 (C H R I S T M A S ) MOVIES AND SPECIALS.<br/><br/>BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY Christmas MOVIES AS I CAN. <br/><br/>Maybe the most successful ""Christmas Movie"" of all time and it's easy to understand why. The film made Macaulay Culkin a household name and the biggest child star since Shirley Temple. <br/><br/>In this film a child get left behind on accident in his Chicago home while his family has flown off for Christmas.<br/><br/>This film takes place in Chicago, the McCallister family is preparing for a Christmas vacation in Paris. On the night before their departure, the entire family gathers at Peter and Kate's home, where their son, Kevin, is ridiculed by his siblings and cousins. After a scuffle with his older brother, Buzz, Kevin is sent to the third floor of the house, where he wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to power lines, which causes the alarm clocks to reset; consequently, the family oversleeps. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport in time to catch their flight, Kevin is accidentally left behind.<br/><br/>Later, Kevin wakes up to find the house empty and, thinking his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his new-found freedom. However, Kevin's joy turns to fear as he encounters his next door neighbor, ""Old Man"" Marley, who is rumored to have murdered his family with a snow shovel in 1958; he also encounters the ""Wet Bandits"", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin initially manages to keep them away by making the house look as if the family is home, but they eventually realize the deception.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best Christmas movies however at first it is a little slow on the set-up."

","If you like a really good family film at Christmas, then there's a big difference, there is no family in this film (or at least for most of it). The McCallister family are preparing a Christmas holiday to Paris. The night before they leave the youngest child of the family causes trouble and is sent to bed early. He wishes that the family would disappear. The next morning, the family leave and realise when they are in Paris that they have forgot one thing, Kevin (Golden Globe nominated Macaulay Culkin)! Kevin now has all the fun that he wants. Only problem is that two crooks Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are trying to get into the large house to loot it. This is just wonderful for goofy live action gags, kids entertainment and Christmas fun. Also starring John Heard as Peter McCallister, Roberts Blossom as Marley and Catherine O'Hara as Kate McCallister. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Music for John Williams and Best Song for ""Somewhere in My Memory"", it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!"

","My favorite movie is 'Home alone'. I think that this movie is interesting. Because Kevin is intelligent about science. If I defend my house, I can not defend my house as him. My most interest scene is Kevin fight thief, I think. This scene is laughed scene. I really like this scene. And I also like Kevin's intelligent. Because I don't have his intelligent idea. By the way, There is a sequel in this movie. I think that interesting movie is a sequel. I also like these movies sequel. But I have not remind this movie scene. I remind only scene is happy end. This movie is representing family is important, I think. Also, Kevin is lonesome."

","Home Alone has a rather thin plot but makes up for it with all that cartoon-like violence. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances and are the best thing in this movie. Macaulay Culkin is an okay actor, nothing special, but okay. Home Alone is best watched during the holidays. That is when it can be most enjoyed."

","I had often heard people talking about this film, sometimes described as a bad one, sometimes described as a kind of must-see. So I watched it this year and am, actually, positively surprised or at least it wasn't as bad as I sometimes heard. Poor little Kevin is left alone at his home, his family have forgotten him on flight to Paris to celebrate Christmas. But while enjoying the being all alone, some shrewd burglars make his street unsafe...<br/><br/>Yes, it is sometimes chaotic and illogical and reminds, as some critics say, in cartoons that wouldn't work in a real film. Yet, Kevin acts like a creative and inventive boy to defend his family's house. It is funny and you should have seen it once."

","Home Alone is a familiar movie from childhood. I was surprised how good that still is. I last saw this movie about 15 years ago. Home Alone is still as fun as it was then before unlike some other movies of childhood.
A main character is Kevin MacCallister (Culkin) who is a wild boy of a large family. He is accidentally left home when the rest of the family has gone to Paris for the christmas vacation. Two other important characters are Harry (Pesci) and Marv (Stern) who are criminals. The are going to rob valuable goods of houses which are empty during Christmas. They don't know Kevin is still at home. Kevin protects home from the burglars while these try to rob his family's house too. Movie contains some emotional moments along comedic scenes.
Culkin, Pesci and Stern are very good in this movie. I think this is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen.

","This has got to be one of the best Christmas movies ever made. The story is simple yet unique. The acting is not academy award worthy, but Macaulay Cullkin has just enough charisma to carry the film, and of course Joe Pesci is great. Then you add John Williams score, and the whole thing gets elevated to another level. It has aged a little, but it is still enjoyable to watch today. If you're looking for a movie to put you in the holiday spirit, look no further than Home Alone.<br/><br/>The sequel is pretty good too. A lot of rehashing, but it's still a good companion piece."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","29","56","3 October 2006"," That Face Helped Make This A Big Hit
","This an absurd storyline. Hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults, for some reason. Also, we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to France before finding out one of their kids was left at home??! I don't think so. I know a lot of big families and this would never-in-a-million years happen.<br/><br/>However, it's just a movie, and it isn't real and you can't take any of it seriously. Thus, the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that follow....and there are plenty of those!<br/><br/>A share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to God, who made Maccaulay Culkin's face. Without it, I doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was, but Culkin's ""cuteness"" helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs. He turned out to be a fine child actor.<br/><br/>The two guys (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever, although slapstick ""rules"" in this film.<br/><br/>There are some really nice messages in here, such as ""families suck,"" says the kid. Oh, well, some think this film did, too. I am not a big fan of it, but I did enjoy it along with most other people. I thought the sequel was better, though."

","Everyone knows this Christmas Classic, the original Home Alone tells a story about a kid who gets left home accidentally by his family who leave to go on holiday.<br/><br/>Of course, Macaulay Culkin (McCallister) decides that he wants to make the most out of this opportunity and does the stuff his family never lets him do.
However, this all changes with his chance run-in with the ""Wet Bandits"", two burglars that are out on Christmas robbing houses.<br/><br/>Joe Pesci makes this movie great with his original personality, Daniel Stern adds the humour to the dynamic duo.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely recommended for a family."

"bayardhiler","10","5","7","17 December 2013"," Never Gets Old
","When it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year, there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isn't Christmas. One of those is 1990's ""Home Alone"". Written and produced by the late, great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister (Played by Macaulay Culkin, arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple) who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large, extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role). On the eve of the big family vacation, Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom (The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know, his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage, his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is, except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says, is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.<br/><br/>But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves) are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do, Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away, but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure, the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot (Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps).<br/><br/>But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely, a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse, Old Man Marley (the late, great character actor Robert Blossom). John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary, it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course, who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness, we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy (Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!). ""Home Alone"" is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it, it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in, the 90's, a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever, much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu, I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family, make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!"
"Big Movie Fan","Null","5","7","17 November 2002"," Fantastic Fun-Filled Film
","If you don't like Home Alone then you're either a robot or a zombie. Home Alone was one of the best comedies of 1990.<br/><br/>Macauley Culkin plays Kevin McAllister who as the title suggests, is left home alone when his family goes on a trip. At first, he enjoys life as he gets the run of the house but soon starts to miss his family. Then things get worse as two bumbling burglars played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci target his house...<br/><br/>Although I was an adult when I watched this film, I could still see why Kevin McAllister appealed to kids around the world. What child hasn't wished they could spend some time alone in their house free to stay up and do what they want? There are some fun scenes throughout especially one when the pizza delivery man comes calling.<br/><br/>The burglars are very well played by Daniel Sterns and Joe Pesci (both as clumsy as each other). At first, Kevin fools them making them believe he is not home alone but they soon become wise to his act and break in...that is when the fun starts as Kevin uses dozens of household items to fight them. Everything from irons (which he uses to hit their heads) to christmas decorations with sharp ends which Daniel Sterns steps on.<br/><br/>It's hard not to thoroughly enjoy a film like this, especially as it appeals to all of us (adults and children) who have wished we could just have the house to ourself and do what we please. This is a great film which I thoroughly recommend and it was followed by two great sequels."

Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious as Harry and Marv. The greatest comedy duo of the early 1990's. Kevin's traps are awesome and funny. I laugh when Harry and Marv get hit. Kevin's the smartest 8-year-old kid and he always win by beating up Harry and Marv. Everyone needed a good laugh and I'm one of them. There are touching moments and hilarious moments."

"hellraiser7","10","3","4","28 November 2019"," Home for the Holidays
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time as well as one of my favorite Christmas films.<br/><br/>It's also another one of my childhood gems, it's was just so much fun for so many reasons but also heartfelt at the same time. I really like the plotline as it's sort of a wishfulment fantasy being the man or woman of the house and just having complete freedom to do whatever you want and make your own rules.<br/><br/>There is so much to like, from the production value, which is great, really like how the traps were set up and conducted. Even the music is great, from some soundtrack bits but it's really the score by one of my favorite composers John Williams which makes it the most memorable. From that theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, as it has both a Christmas tune but at the same time a sense of foreboding as it reminds us as fun and cheerful as the film is there is still trouble in paradise. But another tune which is ""All of my Memories"" is just beautiful and perfectly reflects the theme of the film.<br/><br/>I really like the characters, from the Wet Bandits Harry and Marv played well by Joe Pechi and Daniel Stern. Both your classic comic duo much like Abbot and Costello and any other you can think about, both are so much fun as both are pretty much numb skulls.<br/><br/>Well Harry is more the smart one of the bunch as it seems like he the only one that really supplies the brain power of their schemes. However, this guy is no genius as his Achilles heel is that he's arrogant thinking he's so clever and listens too much to his own greed which we know both these things can make people stupid or do some stupid crap.<br/><br/>Marv is pretty much Harry's flunky as he's dumb. But what makes him really funny is how he's a bit of a man child sometimes, like having these delusions of grangur in being one of the most famous criminals in history by leaving the water running as their calling card as ""The Wet Bandits"", despite the fact he clearly needs a reality check as he's just increased their chances of getting caught and identified. But I really love some of his lines, he's got some great lines, one of my favorites ""he sounded like a snake"" I know a small line but it's funny on two counts.<br/><br/>But of course, my favorite character is the main protagonist Kevin McCallister played well by Macaulay Culkin. I really like that he's not some stereotypical annoying all smiles kid. Kevin really felt like a real kid whom is a relatable character as some of what he's gone though is some of the things that we may have experienced a time or two in our lives when we were kids.<br/><br/>It's interesting what kind of household he lives in which must be the busiest household I've ever seen as it seems populated with twenty plus people. I remember whenever I watch the film, I always wonder who that person or the other in the family is. I honestly wouldn't mind if they made some sort of TV program (on a premium channel) called ""The McCallister's"" where we could see Kevin and the rest of the family years later, get to know the rest of them and see what shanagans they get into. If not there's always a licensed comic book, follow up; and if one or both these happened it would be the true third sequel. Well, it's a nice thought anyway.<br/><br/>Alright back to Kevin, he's charismatic, has some of the best lines in the film. My favorite from him is ""This is it, don't get scared now"" yeah that's the kind of line I use whenever there is a final battle in certain Horror movies or survival horror video games. The film is almost at times like a one man play sometimes as in most scenes Kevin has only himself to talk to, but he does it so well because he's got a lot of interesting things to say.<br/><br/>I really love how smart he is, this guy you could say could almost be a genius as he's a tactician, from building those elaborate traps. However, he is still naive like a child which increases the relatability factor as we've been through that. Like one of my favorite scenes is seeing Kevin dig though Buzz's trunk and he first looks though a Playboy magazine and says one really funny line that cracked me up ""No clothes on anyone sickening"", yeah that what most of us and myself felt at Kevin's age.<br/><br/>However, the one thing about him that makes him the most enduring is he is highly sympathetic. He has a big family but he is the only one that is the most underappreciated, doesn't really get much attention nor help when he needs and asks for it, none of the breaks and for some fraked up reason seems to be the target of ridicule for most family members, seriously what the frak is everyone's problem.<br/><br/>Like in one scene he is trying to ask some people to help him pack a suitcase as he's never done it before, which is understandable because he's still really little which means there are a lot of things, he's never done himself before. But of course no one is or wants to help him do it, seriously not one member could take five to ten minutes of their life to show/help him pack, it wouldn't of killed them instead they act like they have more important things to do which they don't.<br/><br/>The worst of all is Buzz, this is a guy you sort of love to hate as he's kind of funny or even just plain hate as he really presses a wrong button with you. What I really don't like about the guy is that he's is just so full of crap; from that story he tells both Kevin and another brother about a neighbor you just see as he's telling that he has a crap eating grin on his face, so you know the story is bull crap just to get cheap amusement. And another which was eating Kevin's Cheese Pizza on purpose and insulting Kevin once more, thinking he's so funny which pushes Kevin over the edge.<br/><br/>I really love that Kevin retaliated, I'd do the same thing any bully that ever takes away my Cheese Pizza or even video game playing are going to meet Goku and Vegetta (my left and right fists); I know that sounds bold but human right need to be defended.<br/><br/>Sadly, Kevin unfortunately get punished for something that wasn't his fault, let alone doesn't even have dinner. But the last part of that scene are really sad when instead of the mom talking and exercising understanding with Kevin to hear what really happened, she just retorts in a mocking and insulting tone, which I thought was uncool, I guess she forgot the old saying ""if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all"" At that moment I just knew that was the final straw and Karma was about to come down on the family hard.<br/><br/>There are so many great and memorable scenes and moments throughout the film, so there is hardly a dull moment.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes no doubt is when Kevin is watching a gangster pic and of course he's eating probably the biggest ice cream sundae I've ever seen, man I can never eat that many scoops. That film he watches is great, I honestly thought that was a real movie but no it's not. This is something as kids we always dreamed about which was to see Rated R films without restrictions.<br/><br/>I just love the exaggerated nature of the film as we see the lead gangster Johnny solve his dilemma with a Tommy Gun (yeah that does work every time in those pics) and he just says one of my favorite movie quotes that cracked me up, ""Keep the change you filthy animal."" But I really like Kevin's reaction to that film as he's closing his eyes despite the fact there is no gore or squib effects. But for a kid his age that would be considered graphically violent and not something he's totally used to seeing. And this joke with the gangster movie gets funnier as we see it used in two different scenes in two different ways.<br/><br/>And of course, there is the famous big battle near the end of the film which is in my book one of my favorite battles of all time. It's basically a home invasion battle which I think is cool because it's sort of like a strategy game battle, since the battle takes place on your own turf it makes you the general, giving you plenty of opportunities to tactically take out invaders whichever area they occupy. But of course, it's pretty much a slap stick/ physical comedy fest as we see the Wet Bandits constantly getting hurt by Kevin's traps and miraculously surviving, this was just hilarity at it's best, it made me laugh till it hurt.<br/><br/>I'll just say a couple of my favorites as I don't want to give too much away, from the first scene seeing Kevin use the BB gun on both robbers, it's just funny how Harry reacts to the pain and he is just saying a bunch of gibberish in frustration.<br/><br/>Another of course is the nail trap, it's funny because of just the delayed reaction as it pain doesn't even register until a little latter and I just laughed along the way.<br/><br/>However, despite all the fun of the film this film has heart as the revolving theme is about appreciating family. There is one scene I found sad when Kevin is looking at a family whom is home for the holiday's enjoying Christmas, he has a sad look on his face, which I'll admit put a tear in my eye. That scene shows what Kevin truly wanted which was simply to have Christmas with his family. Or even some bits with the family feeling guilt over the loss of Kevin from the mom evaluating her own parenting and a member or two not enjoying their time in Paris as they know in their hearts it's not a real vacation as their family is incomplete.<br/><br/>This just makes the pay off even sweeter, I'll just say both Kevin and the Macalister's get what they want for Christmas. No one is ever alone for the holidays as long as there are still people that love you.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","Home alone is a classic comedy and adventure movie which was made in 1990. It stars Macaulay Culkin (Kevin), who played Kevin. The movie does a great job showing some themes like broken family. Kevin is left alone by himself not on purpose, but he has to take responsibility. He is brave and doesn't fear anyone. Also, the movie raises a variety of scary moments. Strange noises play an important role, those normally scare children, but for Kevin it didn't scare him, when the bad guys were trying to kidnap him. He set traps for them meaning he was not scared of anyone. His ingenuity, approach to problems, kept the movie entertaining, and always kept me to my seat, wondering what would happen next. I would rate this a 4 out of 5, this is one of my favorite movies."

","Home Alone directed by Chris Columbus is easily the best Christmas comedy ever made. Growing up with this film means there's definitely a sentimental love for it. But upon recent viewing I can really see why this movie has been loved for decades. The writing, casting and direction is prefect. Home Alone is such a well made film. The performances are some of the best in the genre. The script is so compelling with its successful humour and authentic line delivery. One thing that makes this movie so memorable is the outstanding score by John Williams. He captures everything from the Christmas spirit to moments of serious tension. This movie also contains such a deep message around family with necessary character arcs, which are able to relate to both adults and children. Home Alone will forever be a Christmas classic so therefore I give it a 9."

It's amazing how such a young actor can carry a movie with such seemingly effortless style and boundless enthusiasm. The movie works on so many levels.

"dbdumonteil","Null","9","18","10 June 2002"," an average conventional comedy
","The first time I saw this film was when I was a child and it pleased me a lot because I only saw its comic side. I saw it recently and it disappointed me although the story is original: during Christmas holidays, the McCallister family decided to celebrate Christmas at Paris, unfortunately they forgot one of their children. First of all, Kevin is elated but he realizes that two thieves want to burgle his house. In order to get rid of them, he puts in several traps; the thieves are under arrested and Kevin finds again his family. If I had to choose one adjective to judge this film, it would be the term: conventional. Several sides of the film are showing it. For example, Kevin's family seem to ignore and despise him and consequently he feels rejected and outraged and ,at the end, his family and especially his mother discovers how much she loves him, moreover, they say that Kevin's neighbour is a killer and he's got a wicked reputation but Kevin finds out that he's not a murderer and he had an unhappy life. Not only is the film conventional but the screenplay is sometimes predictable : when Kevin finds out that is ""home alone"" he wants to have fun as much as he can, and finer feelings are often put forward . Nevertheless, Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, the two thieves are very entertaining and the sequence where they have to endure Kevin's traps is very funny. At last, I think that this film was especially made for children and young teenagers and it was useless to make it follow by two poor sequels."
"jhclues","6","5","9","18 December 2001"," An Anomaly of the Genre
","Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.<br/><br/>	This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.<br/><br/>	The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...<br/><br/>	Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.<br/><br/>	Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.<br/><br/>	The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10."

","This is just one movie that I cannot stand.  I am not wild about movies that are mainly about kids who get the best of adults, and this definitely fits the bill as one of those movies.  What really gets me, is this kid would not have gotten into all the trouble he did if he wasn't such a brat.  The family is trying to organize this big trip with all these other relatives, and all the their younger son can do is whine and complain.  ""I don't want to sleep with that kid"", ""I have to have my pizza a certain way"", stuff like that...and he is supposed to be the kid we are pulling for?  We get to see him left alone and do all the things kids do when they are left alone. Watch black and white old movies.  Yes, and this kid is such a wimp that a black and white mobster pick scares him.  Though he uses it so wisely later in the movie (yeah right, that would work).  This kid somehow outsmarts the two thieves even though earlier one of them is smart enough to impersonate a police officer and check all the security of the houses in the neighborhood. I guess his intelligence went down a notch or two.  Then there are the many clever traps that usually consist of someone getting hit in the groin area...ha ha ha!  It is always so funny to see someone get hit there and writhe in agony.  All in all this is just one bad movie that I did not care for at all.  I just wish the kid got into some kind of trouble for all the problems he caused."
"ReelCheese","4","14","36","11 August 2006"," Does It Deserve Its Popularity?
","Everybody tries hard, but ""Home Alone"" doesn't work nearly as well as its popularity suggests. Macaulay Culkin became a household name starring as Kevin McCallister, a precocious eight-year-old accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation. If fending for himself weren't enough, Kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have targeted the family home.<br/><br/>I first saw ""Home Alone"" when I was 10 years old. I didn't find it at all funny then, and its genius still eludes me. The alleged ""humor"" that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps Kevin sets up to stop the bad guys. Among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a red-hot doorknob. Looks painful, but hardly funny. The film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old Road Runner cartoon, but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote, something is lost.<br/><br/>Yet ""Home Alone"" isn't a total disaster. The performances are great and the story is at times quite charming, particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man. Interestingly, the sequel -- ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" -- marked a notable improvement."

","Review:
'Home Alone' is a comedy film directed by Chris Columbus.
If you were to ask a room full of people what movie they watch the most around the Holiday's, the majority would say 'Home Alone'. This is such a fun tale from writer John Hughes, and it brings some suspense to Christmas while keeping it child friendly.
The story follows eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but he soon has to contend with two burglars: Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), who are known as the ""Wet Bandits"".
Macaulay Culkin is a standout in this movie not only because he is in almost every scene, but his acting was very good. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy after all. He really holds his own among all the adults in the film and it isn't slim picks when you have Joe Pesci, John Heard and Catherine O'Hara.
It's quite unrealistic about how dumb the burglars are, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are a great comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.
Overall, aside from its unrealistic plot, the movie is fun and very entertaining. It's a movie my family watches multiple times throughout the year and it never gets old.
4.5/5"

The story is about young boy. His name is Kevin. He is small but he is big trouble-maker. In this film he did a lot of crazy, good and bad things, which you will see when you watch this great film. I think the main character (Kevin) was created for this role! He was really good actor. In this film you can see how Kevin did a traps for two guys, who want to rob his house. It is really entertaining. In film there are some stunts, which are real. There were no stunt-man or stunt-woman. The characters perfomed stunts themselves. ThatÂ´s crazy! Characters: Kevin are brave, impressive and wily and bandits are thoughtless, bad, sharp. And one interesting thing about this film is that at the end one of the guys tries to bit Kevin to his forefinger and he bit him for real and after shooting Kevin has a real scar.

","Like many other people of my vintage, HOME ALONE has been a staple of the holidays for as long as I can remember. The story is essentially a kid's fantasy: not just staying home alone and getting to play by one's own rules for a while, but also inflicting comical pain upon very obvious bad guys. The Christmas-y mise en scene and clever use of low camera angles complete this nostalgic, feel-good comedy's sense of festive atmosphere.<br/><br/>As an adult, the contrivances that cause the plot to occur are more apparent, of course. And the slapstick climax is shockingly violent-- it never occurred to me just how brain-damaged or DEAD the Wet Bandits would be. However, none of these things bother me in the least. Maybe it's nostalgia. Maybe the movie's strengths are so potent as to cancel anything else out. I don't know.

Traps to make the Looney Tunes proud.<br/><br/>And it works, it really works. But I would argue that the reason this film has stayed with people and the reason we still watch it, is because the director Chris Columbus injected in so much Christmas spirit that you'll be stuffed to the brim with it. This is a colourful movie with beautiful sets and enough Christmas lights to provide for an international airfield. It has Christmas songs, Christmas classics on TV. It has a great tree, great morals, and it's just to very Christmassy.<br/><br/>At the center of this is Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin. A wide-eyes, precocious little brat that manages to pull off the almost impossible feat of acting realistically childlike - you know, like a sociopathic, greedy little monster - but still coming off as sympathetic. And sure, in his heart he's a good kid, but the reason we like him is because he's so cheerfully blood hungry. And because he honestly and purely loves Christmas.<br/><br/>Is it an odd movie when you think about it? Yeah, a bit. Is it a bit painful to watch all those traps as an adult with a working knowledge of physics? Yes, oh very much so. Is it still a ton of fun? Absolutely."

","This film was definitely loved when it came out, and now it's seen as a Christmas classic. Do I agree with that? Well, yes, in different ways then others see it. I saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset. It's a decent movie, but it's not great. You see, when I say it's a ""Christmas classic"" I don't mean it's a great movie. My reason for my usage of the term ""Christmas classic"" is because there aren't many great Christmas movies out there. Besides Elf, and Christmas Story, there aren't a lot of great Christmas movies.<br/><br/>It certainly is a good movie to watch around Christmas, but it does have its flaws and problems. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this movie, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, but the rest of the actors aren't too good. The story has a lot of flaws. First of all, why doesn't Kevin go to a friends' house? Surely not everyone he knows has gone to Paris or something. He lives in a suburban neighbourhood in Chicago with a BUNCH of people, and he can't go to a friends' house? All these flaws I can kinda look past, but I can't pretend they're not there. This film is good, but not great."

","This is a very enjoyable Christmas movie, suitable for the entire family. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are excellent as the bungling burglars. All of the actors in Kevin's ""family"" are very good. Uncle Frank is an annoying jerk (as he is supposed to be as his part is written) so the actor turns in a good performance causing the audience to truly dislike him, as intended. I do have some issues with the story line of this movie though. Kevin is portrayed as a troublemaker which he is most definitely NOT! BUZZ is the troublemaker! (Well played by Devin Ratray, the audience is EXPECTED to dislike Buzz). The way Buzz treats Kevin is deplorable. Buzz is the true BRAT! Buzz is the instigator of all of the ""troubles"" yet he gets away with it and the relatively innocent Kevin gets all the blame. Buzz is the one who should be punished, not Kevin! This shows bad parenting on the part of Kevin's parents, they punish the wrong son! A good parent would realize that Buzz is the instigator. This bad parenting sends a wrong message. I DESPISE Buzz!

At the beginning of the film, his parents stand idly by while his uncle, brother and cousins verbally abuse him, angrily calling him a ""little jerk"" and a ""disease"" for doing nothing that was even that bad. This will not sit well with modern audiences, who will rightly say that if someone called their child that, they would bi*chslap them and kick them out of their house. The issue was not even addressed in the movie, the parents did nothing to defend him, and thus verbal abuse of small children was normalized, given that it's such a popular movie.

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","22 December 2017"," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","I know this is a ""triple F"" and ""triple C"": feel-good fun family and classic Christmas comedy... so you'll forgive me to be a triple ass and introduce this review with a downer opening. Here it goes.<br/><br/>We're in 2017, John Candy is comedy legend (sadly of the dead sort) since the mid-90's, John Hughes died in the same untimely fashion eight years ago, followed by Robert ""Old Man Marley"" Blossoms two years later and John Heard, the father with such a lovable face, has died this summer. Sorry to go on this eulogy but even Roger Ebert and Gene SIskel who gave two thumbs down to the movie because of its implausible narrative and sadistic treatment of the villains, are also gone. This is just to show how this 1990 classic is already surrounded by an aura of nostalgic sadness.<br/><br/>Of course, Chris Columbus, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are alive and much alive but look at Macaulay Culkin, another sad example of the devastating effects of child stardom, although he's probably richer than I but he didn't exactly follow the 'Natalie Portman' path, not even the Anna Chlumsky one. <br/><br/>Whenever I see him on the screen, I can't help but think of how this cute little face has turned to, but there are so many sad things about the lives that contributed to the movie that it almost plays like a sort of shelter for laughs, a time capsule for December 1990 or the whole early 90's, where we can comfortably enjoy Christmas in the lovable and cozy McCallister house and forget about the real stuff, the time of a movie.It's funny that there's so much escapism in such an enclosed movie.<br/><br/>Besides, watching ""Home Alone"" again in 2017 allows us to appreciate a time where even a good old-fashioned comedy could hit the box-office jackpot and be the highest grossing movie. No superheroes, no Transformers, no magical superpowers, the (r)evolution was on march, sure, but it didn't take much at that time to draw audience to the theaters, what counted was a simple concept and an appealing main character. The concept here is simply terrific: what would happen if a boy was left alone in his home? and during Christmas holidays at that, and when the kid is played by such an adorable and talented kid as Macaulay Culkin, half the work is done. There's also an interesting implication, every kid would love to be alone in such a big home (granted he's got enough to eat or buy food) but how about when it happens at the very time where you count on the presence of adults.... even for selfish reasons.<br/><br/>I concede that John Hughes didn't really try to make an existential plot out of the concept, and picked the easy way, which was a confrontation between the boys and bad guys... but what bad guys! <br/><br/>As Hitchcock said, a film is as good as the villain and Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern form a very interesting variation of 'Laurel and Hardy', 'George and Lenny', 'George and Junior' or 'Pinky and the Brain', the interaction between the two burglars while not reinventing the wheel, is the perfect foil to little Kevin's quick wits, agility and ability to come up with the most ingenuous devices in order to 'defend his home'. I think it's safe to consider that the film was already a winner once they got the concept, the kid and the villain. The rest was just a sort of icing on the cake, what kind of booby traps to install in the house, how to make it 'impossible' for the parents to reach their kid or for him to get help, and of course the 'spirit'... otherwise it wouldn't be a Christmas movie.<br/><br/>So of course, it's going to be implausible, with such a title as ""Home Alone"", you either have a comedy or a horror/thriller and if the movie had to be 'realistic', it wouldn't have taken more than three hours (movie time) to get Kevin out of the house and arrest the burglars. But we wouldn't have a movie either, we wouldn't have the 'Playboy' scene, the after-shave moment inspiring the iconic recreation of the 'Edvard Munch' painting with Kevin's trademark scream, whose only match was Marvin's shrill arachnophobia reaction. The film is a Christmas classic because it has filled that over-the-top category, if you want a movie that recreates the fun of Christmas in a realistic way, you have the no-less iconic ""A Christmas Story"", but the concept of ""Home Alone"" could only work with that level of slapstick. AndCulkin's performance is so good it even conveys a sort of edgy attitude, he's not your typical kid either, but he's still convincing enough as a kid.<br/><br/>It's not just a matter of suspension of disbelief, but of ""let it go"" for the sake of innocent fun, of course, watching this right now reveals some baffling contrivances we couldn't spot where the film came out, yes, we know the supposedly shovel murderer isn't a bad guy, we know Kevin relies a lot on the assistance of luck and perfect timing, we know it will all come down to the powerful family reunion and Catherine O'Hara provides the emotional arc of the film. Yes, it's true Marv and Harry aren't so bad they really deserve all the hurtful stuff that happen to them, and Kevin's scream can get annoying at times, but the film is closer to a live-action cartoon than a realistic comedy.<br/><br/>And there is no way for ""Home Alone"" not to make it in any Top 10 of classic Xmas movies, but maybe I'm biased because it was totally the kind of movies we used to watch countless times as kids to the point I always identified Tchaikovski's ""Nutcracker"" music as the 'Home Alone' theme."
"The-Last-Prydonian","8","1","1","18 December 2017"," Nostalgic fun although your enjoyment on this this might depend on how far you're willing to suspend disbelief
","It's safe to say I think that Home Alone, along with movies like The Goonies and Ghostbusters is going to be on of those for people of a certain generation as a must go to when it comes to sheer nostalgia. It's notable that it catapulted then 10 year old MacCaulay Culkin to international stardom, and brings back fond memories for people like myself who remember going to see it at the cinema as a kid. As it comes that bit closer to hitting the thirty year anniversary of it's release, it's still lost none of it's appeal and has thus far stood the test of time. All this said, and in all fairness I can't say it's a brilliant movie and given it's premise, your enjoyment of it will probably depend on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief. This is after all about a an eight year old named Kevin who's criticised by the fellow childhood members of his family for not being able to pack his own suitcase (their family is travelling to Paris for Xmas) and yet proves remarkably resourceful when fending off the movies antagonists; the burglars Harry and Marv played with hilarious brilliance by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. <br/><br/>Written by John Hughes who sadly passed away several years ago (as incidentally did actor John Heard who plays Kevin's father in the movie), he makes good use of it's basic premise, with young Kevin attempting to temporarily adjust to finding himself on his own and without any parental supervision. Fun moments include him being questioned by a suspicious checkout operator while he's grocery shopping, and tricking Harry and Marv in to thinking his house is still operating by constructing a fake party using cardboard cutouts. It's certainly one of Hughes most inventive movies as a writer, despite how far fetched it is. The now legendary final act is a masterclass of slapstick comedy and you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself rolling on the floor with laughter.<br/><br/>Of course with this being a Hughes movie, or just any family comedy of this nature there's going to be some life lessons learned for our plucky young hero by the end of it. Thankfully however it's beautifully handled and while predictably sentimental, it never becomes cringe-inducing. MacCaulay Culkin brings innocent charm to the role of Kevin, and displays natural comic timing. He also handles the transition from obnoxious brat to lovable sympathetic young scamp effectively well. The rest of the supporting cast which includes Catherine O'Hara, the late Roberts Blossom and the late great John Candy (making a relatively brief appearance) are all on top form. No doubt this is a film that will be well remembered for years to come even with it's glaring flaws, you can't deny it's charm and I defy anyone not have a lump in their throat in it's moving final moments."
"Imdbidia","8","1","1","5 January 2017"," A classic that doesn't lose gas
","This has become one of my favorite Christmas films over the years.<br/><br/>This is a classic that has everything to please children and adults: with a killer mix of adventure, comedy, melodrama and embedded moral. The main thing, to me, is that the Christmas spirit is there, so the rest just clicks into the puzzle easily. The movie is predictable, of course, but that is part of the charm you expect from a Christmas story, unless you are watching an horror movie or a proper adult comedy.<br/><br/>I loved Macauly Culkin when he was a child. He is brilliant in this movie. He fuses with his character in a way that is difficult to separate the two, showing the great actor he was even at that age. The Good Son would would highlight his maturity as actor, so he is not a pretty face here. Macauly and his character Kevin looks angelical but is far from being an angel; he has a good heart, has an insight into what is good and bad, is ready to be advised by wise people; at the same time, Kevin is also creatively ruthless with the baddies because, well, they brought it upon them and deserve it. <br/><br/>Despite Kevin being alone, this is a choral movie. It wouldn't have been the success it was if it wasn't because the performances of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, who are brilliant as the mischievous yet naive baddies. Daniel Stern is especially funny, and has one of the best on-screen yells in movie history. I don't want to forget John Candy's secondary role in this movie, who is deadpan funny in one of those garrulous characters that were one of his trademarks. Roberts Blossom is also great as the lonely grumpy old neighbor. The rest of actors were believable in their respective characters as well.<br/><br/>Home Alone warms my heart and cheers me up every time."

You've probably seen this movie a thousand times by now and there's a big chance you didn't get tired of it.

He wakes up all alone and his mother only discovers she forgot him when she's already on a departed plane. A burglar duo, fully aware of their departure, drops by to steal some valuables and the little boy Kevin as ""new man of the house"" feels responsible and obliged to defend his fortress of solitude.<br/><br/>It has all the cuddly and mellow themes of Christmas, like unconditional love for family and friends, the destructive power of prejudice and fear, values like charity, mercy and generosity. And what's wrong with a little corniness in life?"
"drqshadow-reviews","6","1","1","26 December 2012"," Fluffy Holiday Mayhem With a Warm Heart
","When the action hits its climax, this treads a dangerous line between cartoon violence and the real thing, but a powerful dose of John Hughes sentimentality and a side of Christmas spirit mostly smooth things over. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of ten, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern make up for that as a duo of over- amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child. Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots."
"Hey_Sweden","7","1","1","6 December 2011"," ""You guys give up, or are ya thirsty for more?""
","Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, in his appealing break through lead performance) is frustrated enough with his family to ""wish them away"". And he gets this wish, sort of, when the entire family - parents, siblings, aunt & uncle & cousins included - is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to Paris that they leave him behind. At first, he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence, but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. This he does by staging an elaborate series of booby traps.<br/><br/>""Home Alone"" is a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick. This material is indeed pretty funny, with Pesci and Stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that they're worth; some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical. Some of it may be a bit much, and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie, but it's doubtful many kids watching are going to care that much.<br/><br/>It does, in the end, make a very good case for the need for family, how we're perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted, how to deal with one's fears and do some growing up, and in the case of Old Man Marley (the excellent veteran Roberts Blossom), how it's never too late to mend relationships. The wonderful scene between Culkin and Blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture. Kevin's been administered (erroneous) warnings about the old man's supposedly sordid past, and is understandably afraid of him, and realizes how one shouldn't be too quick to believe that sort of thing.<br/><br/>Lovely funny woman Catherine O'Hara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything that's humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake. It's truly a treat to see her reunited with 'SCTV' co-star John Candy, who's as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star Gus Polinski. John Williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song (both Oscar nominated, with song lyrics by Leslie Bricusse).<br/><br/>Good fun overall, with a bright wrap- up, it's not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago, and it continues to entertain today.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","Having just watched this for the first time in ages and at the cinema for the first time since its release I am reminded of what a fun film this is. It works very well as a feel good Christmas movie and as a live action update of a loony tunes cartoon. My feeling s about this film have not really changed at all in the eighteen years since its release. It is a small idea with a huge pay off. When Kevin (a never bettered Macualay Culkin) is left home alone over Christmas when his family leave for a trip to Paris and accidentally forget him, he is left to fend for himself as a pair of burglars tries to invade his home. For a child actor Culkin does a remarkable job practically carrying the movie on his own, appearing in pretty much every scene. The burglars are fended of in a string of comedy sequences that a very funny and aided no end by Joe Pesci playing the leader of the pair Harry. There is a convenient sub plot where Kevin finds friendship from the unlikely source of the neighbourhood old man all the kids are scared of. All in all this is a movie to be enjoyed at all times and that is guaranteed to make one feel better."
"ooohhhmmyyyy","8","1","1","6 December 2008"," A family comedy without the family
","This movie tells a child's fantasy about having no family. Lot of kids wish they could have the whole house to themselves so they can do whatever they want and not be told what not to do or told what to do. Even I remember wishing the same. I envied Kevin but couldn't understand why he wanted his family back. They were all mean to him. Now I understand. Kevin does indeed do things his would never be able to do with his family around but then he starts to miss them when he sees Harry and Marv (two burglars) want to rob his house. They have already hit the other houses on the block and now they want to hit his. Now he has to do everything he can to keep them away by pretending people are home. But he can't even go to the police because he thinks he has actually made them disappeared and he would get in trouble with the police for making them go away. But what he didn't know is they all got up in a hurry because they all slept in and went to Paris and they took the shuttle in, not their cars. <br/><br/>It's obvious Kevin a pain to his family and his parents don't listen, his siblings are mean to him, Buzz likes to play mean tricks on him. It's obvious Uncle Frank doesn't like him because he calls him names, won't let him watch a movie with the other kids, pulls his pants down in a deleted scene and didn't care he was left home alone. ""If it makes you feel any better, I forgot my reading glasses.""<br/><br/>What's funny is Harry poses as a police officer and there he sees Kevin who is helpless and a trouble maker to the family. But when the family is away, he sees Kevin isn't as helpless and he is capable of what he didn't know what he was capable of. <br/><br/>Kevin is obviously very bright and smarter than other kids his age despite not knowing how to pack a suitcase or tie his shoes. What kind of eight year old knows how to set all those traps and come up with a plan to catch those bad guys and figure out their moves? <br/><br/>With his family away, Kevin grows up a little by concurring his fear of the basement, and showing his family he can take care of himself and what he is capable of and he isn't as helpless as they thought he was."

","This is the best Christmas film of all time in this writer's opinion. The film undoubtedly has faults like any film and the fundamental basics are at times a little embarrassing as far as acting and continuity are concerned.<br/><br/>However this film as good as it is has a personal value to me as a person. I watch this film once every year in the weeks leading up to Christmas because i used to watch it every day of December up to the 25th when i was a child so there may be a considerable amount of bias in this review and for that i apologise.<br/><br/>The basic plot is frankly classic and as soon as you see the plot unfolding it is impossible not to be entertained.The over the top acting is at times good and at times bad but it is all tongue in cheek. The two criminals (Joe Pecsi and Daniel Stern) make up for little Macaulay Culkin who is good in his own way i suppose and while not as hilarious as his co stars of previous mention, he does have his moments.Then of course everybody's favourite part of the film, the pranks. Obviously it is why every child of the last 20 years of the existence of our universe loves the film. The fact that an 8 year old child could out wit and over come two adults for such a long period of time simply does not come to mind because how well the events of the film are set up. It seems like in reality this helpless rude and ignorant brat could not make toast for himself but com on...WHO CARES!!??<br/><br/>I not to go to much into the story on the off chance that you are reading this without having watched the film.

","First off, I would like to say that John Hughes has fallen in ability since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  This movie is a shining example of that. My sister saw it when it was first released in 1990 and told me that ""it sucked"", she was in third grade.  I didn't see it until last week and can almost agree with that, but not totally.  As far as so-called 'Holiday movies' go, Die Hard and Gremlins will remain my pop culture mainstay.<br/><br/>Home Alone racks up plot holes faster than the Wet Bandits fall down.  They are so dumb that they make the Three Stooges look like the Untouchables.  To think that Joe Pesci belittles himself into a role like this is beyond my belief.  Being outsmarted by an eight-year-old is not the best thing to include on his film resume.  The film would have ended a good 30 minutes earlier if Kevin had acted like a normal kid and don't the smart thing instead of being a defensive snot.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus has always had a fascination with kiddie comedies and this is not his best effort.  Thankfully he is not so much in the pursuit of money (as with Harry Potter) as he is with the pursuit of political correctness. It's not surprising that the script it Hughes' work, there are so many of his little touches throughout.<br/><br/>If I can say one good thing about this movie, it's the music.  John Williams KNOWS how to write music and this movie is a perfect example.  The film certainly has a nice Christmas ring that contrasts with the ever cloudy skies.<br/><br/>Overall, there are good movies for the holidays and good movies for kids.

This movie is charming, memorable, indeed touching, and perfectly paced so that the hilariously extreme violence that is its trademark (a really fresh perspective on slapstick, in my opinion) starts late and builds to an actual climax.  By contrast, most of the movies in this genre drag on and on with no real development and little cohesion, and could end at almost any arbitrary moment, i.e. ""Baby Geniuses"", ""Mouse Hunt"", ""Look Who's Talking Too"".

However, this movie is not a classic. If it wasn't for the ridiculously crazy climax this movie would have been better. Of course the climax is the part that made everybody laugh out loud, when the kid takes on those inept burglars by setting up booby traps that are just too far-fetched to be believable. This part still makes me laugh, but I just can't believe that an 8-year-old could dream up of stuff like that. And writer-producer John Hughes would inject this style of slapstick humor into alot of his following movies (including ""Baby's Day Out"", ""Curly Sue"", and of course the two ""Home Alone"" sequels). The slapstick violence is at times a bit too much, but it doesn't go too far (though the first sequel ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" did get more violent in its slapstick comedy). Director Chris Columbus had his first smash hit with ""Home Alone"". He followed this with ""Home Alone 2"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and most recently ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". Columbus knows that he can work beautifully with kids, and ""Home Alone"" is where he got his start. He makes Culkin look as good as he is. The supporting cast is fine (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard are good as Culkin's parents; Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are wonderfully bumbling as the clumsy burglars), and Hughes script has some wonderfully heartfelt touches. ""Home Alone"" may not be the best comedy movie ever made, but it's still a good one. I'll take ""Home Alone"" over Hughes idiotic ""Baby's Day Out"" anytime.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","This movie got me laughing. The boy really messes up the burglars. The sequel Home Alone 2 is much worse because the tricks he uses there would kill the bandits in real life, so I did not enjoy it. Anyway this one gets my vote as 8/10."
"Brian-272","8","1","1","26 December 2000"," A holiday classic!
","This film is one of the all-time great holiday films, probably ranking a distant second behind A Christmas Story. I remember when ten years ago I saw Home Alone at the theater I said you have a instant classic. I guess my prediction was right, I know when I hear many people talk about a film for years that the popularity is overwhelming and also it must have sent a good message to people. Home Alone continues to get many airings just the other day I watched this classic on HBO. The ingredients for success in the form of the writing from John Hughes really made this film so enjoyable, and you know how good John Hughes delivers a sweet and likeable film. The story is crazy but also funny as Macaulay Culkin as a precarious 8-year-old who accidentally is left behind by his vacationing family, in the meantime Culkin must battle a twosome of goofy and inept burglars wonderfully depicted by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. I must say that Joe Pesci is a great actor not only is he seriously funny but he is just plain and simply the best at anything he does! Qualify Pesci as a very underrated actor. And Culkin enjoys the adventure of a lifetime filled with many laughs and giggles to crack you up! It just goes to show you many times an individual can have the most fun when left alone. No matter how many times you have seen Home Alone watch this classic every holiday season it's a film to enjoy for a lifetime."
"wisewebwoman","4","13","39","8 February 2004"," An insult both for a child and adult viewer.
","I had never seen this and got the opportunity recently when the child in my life begged to rent it as she had heard wonderful things about it.<br/><br/>I expected fluff, a simplistic plot and two hours of enduring the smarmy child actor Macauley Culkin. Not too bad a trade off so that the child would enjoy a movie she wanted to see.<br/><br/>Oh dear. Halfway through it I looked at her and said what would you rate this one out of 10? 5, was the response. We are expected to believe that an 8 year old who cannot tie his own shoelaces comes up with incredible booby traps for some burglars who want to rob the house (rigging lines between trees, heating up door knobs to name very few out of many). One with a master's in engineering would not be able to figure out most of them.<br/><br/>But the very worst features were these dim-bulb parents who sit in first class while their children go unsupervised in economy on a flight to Paris (9 hours, people!)who cannot fire up a brain cell between them in Paris to get the police, Children's Aid, emergency services (they never have friends and relatives in Hollywoodland)to go to the house and get the child.<br/><br/>How hard is it to count your children when you have only three??? The child has not been streetproofed and does not know to call 911 either. And on and on.<br/><br/>It is one of the most appalling movies I have ever seen. At the end the child and I agreed, 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>The old man (Roberts Blossom) was sweet and Catherine O'Hara, whom I normally admire, is right up there with horror moms of all time."
"Susikovski","2","10","29","16 May 2005"," Calling this sadistic trash a Family Movie is sick
","Okay, I can understand the basic setting here. A kid is left alone in a big home and gets to do what he wants, and beats up some bad guys though they're twice his size. I admit there's good potential for fantasy and storytelling here.<br/><br/>But instead of being clever or funny, the movie is just plain obnoxious and idiotic. The kid is not cute but simply totally irritating. What's worse, most of the supposedly funny scenes in the film are based on him screaming and the burglars getting injured in all possible ways. I have no problem with cartoon violence existing, but this film stretched the limits in a sick and disgusting way. The problem is that Home Alone arrogantly combines cartoon violence with a high level of cinema realism, showing how emotionally detached movies in general have become. People who have no trouble enjoying this are the kind of people who used to get their kicks out of torturing animals or beating up their classmates when they were kids. More disturbingly, the same mentality shows through when footage of actual combat violence in faraway countries is shown in live TV. They're not my race or faith, they're not on my side, so it's not for real, see! Or, they're just criminals, so breaking their balls must be funny, right! I'll rather show my own kids some actual action movies with realistic violence than this kind of twisted ""Family movie"" comedy cruelty."
"lee_eisenberg","5","5","12","16 January 2006"," Why Daniel Stern preferred this one to the sequel.
","When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis & Clark College in September, 2004, about his USO tour in Iraq, he said that while ""Home Alone"" had a bunch of silly gags, at least it only had them once; the sequel just repeated everything. When you think about it, that makes sense. This movie was funny the first time (I certainly loved it when I saw it in the theaters), but not much after that. <br/><br/>I gotta ask: what happened to John Hughes? In the '80s, he made movies like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles""; in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads (think ""Home Alone"" and ""Baby's Day Out""). Oh well, life goes on. And for the record, Daniel Stern also said that when he was in Iraq, some Iraqi children recognized him from this movie; that made him understand the reach of American culture."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","5","12","8 October 2005"," Cute... but not much else
","This is an odd one; I can't tell you how many times I've seen this film, yet every time is like the first. It just makes no lasting impression, and I'm always left feeling kind of cheated. The real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the film(not the only funny, mind you) are the scenes of Kevin scaring off the burglars and the finale(which I won't write here, in case anyone reading this review hasn't seen the film yet). That's it. The rest of the film, sure, there are funny scenes, lines and such... but no real entertainment. The scenes of Kevin by himself, in the house, doing adult stuff are cute, but once you're over the age of ten, you won't really find them entertaining or funny... maybe you won't even see the charm I'm certain I must have seen in the scenes when I was younger. So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film. That's just not enough. The plot is decent, but derivative and unoriginal. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is fine, but no one is particularly impressive. John Williams' score is pretty good. What really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun, and OK as long as it's against criminals. This is a film for children; is it really a good idea to show violence like that? To make it fun... and OK? I recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it... and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor. 6/10"
"guyfromjerzee","5","3","6","24 December 2006"," Now that I'm an adult....
","...I decided to give ""Home Alone"" another look. This used to be one of my favorite movies....when I was about 7 years old. I remember receiving the tape of this movie for Christmas and watching it about 100 times. When you're a kid, a film of this sort is a barrel of laughs. As an adult...it's pretty dull. Not to mention the film hasn't stood the test of time. Macaulay Culkin was an adorable kid, but that's just the point. He was one of those cutesie only-in-the-movies-type kids that got famous for smiling into the camera and belting out semi-witty one-liners. It bothers me every time I watch Culkin's character speak his thoughts out loud, when he's all alone. Having shot a couple student films, that has always been one of my pet peeves. Most non-actors assume that acting is all about talking, and they feel the need to verbalize everything they're feeling, rather than expressing them in facial expressions and body language--like everyday people do! Luckily, Culkin has matured since then, and is now a much better actor. The climax of the movie involving the bumbling burglars still makes me laugh, though, for the most part. It's just weirder now to see the foul-mouthed Joe Pesci in a family film. I still find the interactions between Pesci and Daniel Stern mildly amusing. But all in all, unlike a film like ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Home Alone"" is not a film the adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. I'm sure the kids won't mind Culkin's hammy acting and the constant use of low-brow humor."

"crash21","2","3","7","9 December 2016"," Just plain stupid
","First off, wouldn't the family have realized they still hadn't given out an airplane ticket to someone, wouldn't that mean something to them right there in the beginning? This movie is centered all around the pathetic Christmas miracle theory.<br/><br/>I have to ask when they realize that the kid has been left home alone by himself, why don't the parents just call the house, a friend neighbor, or even the police to go pick him up? They could even give the cops instructions to use a door-ram on an outside door to get in to the house and secure the kid. When the kid realizes that he has been left home alone, he could go straight to a friend neighbor, call local police, or even call 911.<br/><br/>I also love the scenarios the kid supposedly comes up with by himself; first with the gangster movie scene to scare off the pizza delivery, I would hope if the delivery person had actually believed the scenario, that it would be immediately reported to the cops.<br/><br/>Then the whole scenario when he realizes the two criminals are going to be trying to rob the house, he comes up with a plan to take them out in a couple hours, the plan nearly kills the criminals and almost burns down the house. After all of this is finished, the kid finally calls the police. If he knew this from the beginning he would have never logically done anything but first call a reliable emergency number.<br/><br/>Once the criminals are taken out, he's still home alone and quickly cleans up the stuff that took the criminals out? Then his mom arrives, along with his whole family arriving shortly after. The family is suddenly all together again, was this a Christmas miracle?<br/><br/>I will admit, the movie is fun before you're even a teenager, but when you look at it later on, you'll realize it's nothing but a pathetic joke. Logically, it nearly tells kids to do things dangerously while teaching them not to use things that are truly secure like the emergency system."

I can understand that it symbolises the pre-Christmas stress but they call him names (not just the kids either) and don't seem to care whether he is fed or not. The parents fail to see that the other kids are bullying him. They stupidly don't even notice he's not with them for a while, they're a shame to the name of parenting. It leaves you feeling like he'd be better off alone (he certainly can handle himself).<br/><br/>Also perhaps it's just me but the robbers are too dim-witted for my taste although maybe it adds to the comedy.<br/><br/>I recommend you see Home Alone 3 if your not keen on this one."

","Home Alone(1990) is a mediocre movie with an uneasy amount of cartoonish violence.  The problem with the film is the characters do things that most people would not normally do.  Joe Pesci is wasted in this movie as he gives the only interesting performance of the entire movie.  One sad thing about this movie is that this may be the only film that Macaulay Culkin will be known mainly for.  Its a fine film for the holidays but not as an overall viewing experience."

","Interestingly, Joe Pesci appeared here and in Goodfellas simultaneously. In this movie, he's also a bad guy, but his language is nothing worse than you would hear from Fred Fiintstone. The sequence with Pesci and Daniel Stern being outwitted by young Culkin is hilarious. Film critics have bashed this movie for being too violent. I disagree. The movie is cartonish, but cartoons tend to be violent, and are fun to watch for this reason. The high point of the movie is the exchange between Culkin and forbidding neighbor Roberts Blossom. Overall, a fun, heartwarming movie."

There are typical jokes, working by violence, but they work. Burglars are falling, taking many types of damage and show sometimes fun and sometimes strange behavior.<br/><br/>In second, this is about Christmas.

","I watch this movie when it's not even winter or Christmas, it's just such an enjoyable film to watch and if you don't at least appreciate it you do not understand the art of film. The highest grossing movie of 1990, and at the time the third highest grossing movie of all time, this movie had a lot of potential. But it was slammed by critics, although audiences seemed to enjoy it, and those exact same critics hating on it back then call it a ""Christmas classic"" nowadays.<br/><br/>If you didn't know and have been living under a rock for a large percentage of your life, Home Alone is a story about a kid who hates his parents and always thinks they're out to get him and make him seem like the bad guy when he's really not. We see Kevin get discriminated by his family and everyone else around him and can't stand seeing him get tortured by his family. This movie is so damn quotable, nearly every line Kevin says I say on a daily basis, ""When I grow up and get married I'm living alone, you hear me?! I'm living alone, I'm living alone!!""
Kevin wishes his family would disappear and we're sort of on the same path as him, the next day he sleeps in and completely forgets the family's trip to France which leads to, ""I made my family disappear"". What is so terrific about Joe Pesci's performance were his restrictions, he wasn't in a Martin Scorsese movie where he could say all the swear words under the blue moon, he was in a family movie which meant he could not swear and the exact same year Home Alone came out 2 months after Goodfellas, which shows how diverse Joe Pesci is.<br/><br/>Is there anything I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said?

Thing is when the day comes and a head count is done young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten about. While it does strain on what is plausible, it still works due to mother Kate (Catherine O'Hara) putting everything aside to get home to Kevin.<br/><br/>In what is also a fairly thin plot I forgive, because of the two thieves Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) who call themselves The Wet Bandits are great! They try to get into the McAllister home to rob it while they are away on vacation. Kevin though, has some ideas and traps of his own to deal with this pair. Pesci and Stern work great together and they really add a lot of humour and comic soul to the film. With the addition of Culkin's at times chaotic energy and John Hughes' script there are laughs to be had in this Christmas film. Directed by Chris Columbus.

","My sister made a good point about this movie the last time we watched it together. She said, ""I don't know why people think this is a Christmas movie, there is hardly anything related to Christmas in it."" After hearing this, I realized that she was correct.<br/><br/>Home Alone is a holiday classic, but not because it has the typical Christmas traits you would expect. It is a classic because it has aged well and it's a universally loved family movie set in winter. With that said, It is misleading to call it a Christmas movie. Sure, there is references to the holidays here and there, but does that make it a Christmas film? No, not really.<br/><br/>This is an example of how family movies should be made. I'll go as far as saying that Home Alone is one of the greatest family movies of all time. If you still haven't seen this one in 2019, you should."

","Over the years, this kind of became the comedic equivalent of eggnog, gingerbread and the Nutcracker. It's tedious during any other time of the year, but it works perfectly well come late December. This was the one and probably the last time that anyone fancied Macaulay Culkin as an actor, who developed from Michael Jackson's homebuddy to a thespian has-been with alcoholic issues and managed to emerge from it only a short while ago. However, it's a pleasure to watch him in his acting prime (however sad that may sound). Here he's the cute little Kevin who gets left behind at home when his family goes on a Christmas trip to Paris. Two burglars eventually notice that he's all alone in the big house and they decide to have a go at it. They're taken by surprise when they run straight into the trap of the sadistic kid who turns their effort into a hilarious near-death experience. The comedies nowadays don't really reach the quality level like this one. It doesn't insult my inteligence and the message isn't ironic or too tacky, apart from the over-the-top Christmas decor that looks as if the Rockefeller Christmas tree exploded inside. The pranks Kevin pulls on them are plain silly and the huge family looks like an embodiment of a Norman Rockwell painting, exaggerated to borderline cult. This movie spawned numerous sequels but it's only the two with Culking that are really fun to watch. the plot is simple, the pranks are silly and the whole thing works just because the context of it is undemanding. Just like Culkin's one-character hit, this is a one-time movie and that's why it's likable and so enduring. That's unlikely to change any time soon."

","'Home Alone' is about a boy, living in a big house together with quite a view family. It's almost Christmas and the family is preparing to go on a holiday to France! Everyone is busy picking his clothes. The next morning they are leaving to go to the airport. In all hustle and bustle, they forgot Kevin. He's home alone now... Two thieves are making plans to break into the house, where Kevin is still spending his holiday. Is Kevin too clever for the two thieves?<br/><br/>This film is absolutely my all-time favorite Christmas story. The main characters and places were chosen well and everything is fitting great. There are very much funny moments in the film and the pace is perfect, nor too fast neither too slow. I watch this movie every year with Christmas and I'm still not losing my focus while watching it. The film creates a nice Christmas feeling. Maybe it's not the best plot, but it's hilarious and I recommend you to watch it with the whole family.<br/><br/>Compared to the other 'Home Alone' films, I think part one and two are the best.

","""I don't want any family. Families suck!"" Producer Mark Levinson said that once in a while, every kid thinks that if they could get rid of their parents and vice versa, life would be great. Chris Columbus's 1990 hit Christmas film, Home Alone, shapes that wish into a clever tale with the addition of burglars. Left home alone, Kevin, the eight-year old victim of sibling bullying, becomes the man of the deserted household, and like a responsible child, enjoys everything once forbidden by his parents, washes the clothes, shops for milk and dinner, and defends the house, with all the wild resourcefulness a child can muster, against a pair of burglars who are fishing for ""Silver Tuna"" homes during the holidays. Home Alone is a well- written tale with clever booby traps, comical, lumbering burglars and strong family values.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film is not completely laudable in both content and quality. Due to Kevin's deterring, but simple snares, mildly-strong language is steadily and sporadically spouted out by the angry bandits with Kevin rejoining every so often to discourage them. Also, Kevin, his siblings and other family members repeatedly name-call each other near the beginning. A classic for (most) ages, the entertaining plot held me on the edge of my seat, while keeping me laughing and wincing at the asinine sufferings of the bandits. But however well-written the script and storyline was, I downright detested the unpleasant acting, chiefly of Kevin and his family. Although a couple veteran actors made appearances in it, even their performances were particularly rotten. Excepting Joe Pesci's convincing performance as Harry Lime, the dreadful awkwardness of blank and unemotional neophyte actors constantly diverted my attention away from the themes of the film. <br/><br/>I've mentioned theme and plot frequently. Written by John Hughes, the characters of the film, though some appear useless to the film's plot, fit flawlessly into the importance of the film. For instance, Old Man Marley seems to be just another object of dread and fright for Kevin, but throughout the course of the film, we learn the truth about him along with many life-lessons exchanged between them. Although slightly overused by family movies, the positive elements in this film are quite strong and emphasized, significantly engulfing the expletives and violence, hence earning my high content rating. When they discover the loss of their child, Kevin's mother, Kate (Catherine O'Hara), expresses her remorse and love as she sacrifices all her possessions and sleep while she attempts to return alone to their home in Chicago with caring donors providing transportation for every leg. Scored by John Williams, Home Alone's memorable ""Somewhere in My Memory"" yet again illustrates these ideals. While not the best acted or produced Christmas flick, the superb plot, humor, lessons and implications make Home Alone an engaging, heart-felt annual tradition."

Home alone, Kevin must make it on his own for several days and protect the house from a pair of crazy burglars.<br/><br/>This movie started out frantically, with Kevin's dysfunctional family scrambling to ready their trip to Paris while giving off a vibe of overzealous humor and corny personalities. But, the film picks up for the better when Kevin found out he was left home alone and, as a result, we get to see his resourceful survival tactics and his plans to deal with the burglars. Culkin did a good job playing Kevin, giving off that innocent but intelligent characteristic.<br/><br/>What I've found surprising was that this manic comedy also has some heartwarming moments about the Christmas spirit, family and faith. The subplot of Kevin's old, reclusive neighbor gives the film a good balance of drama and actually also gives some meaning to the overall Christmas theme of the story.<br/><br/>The plot features some heartwarming moments and some off-the-chart humor featuring fast-talking loudmouth Joe Pesci and accident-prone Daniel Stern as the burglars, who gave us a good dose of slapstick comedy.

","A great 4 out of 5 star movie, the 1990 classic Christmas movie called Home Alone. Overall, it's a great movie to watch with the family every Christmas.The reason I rate this movie a 4 out of 5 is because the movie keeps you on your feet towards the end and it also shows life lessons that you have to go through later in life (probably not the part where you have to defend yourself from the wet bandits). This movie shows how it feels being home alone for a couple of days. It's fun at first, but then some of us begin to miss the family. It shows that you need to be brave and be responsible which, Kevin shows a lot of it in this movie. Kevin didn't get along with his parents or siblings in the beginning of the movie. All the other kids there always made fun of him and picked on him. Kevin didn't get his cheese pizza because his brother Buzz took it, and that's the only kind of pizza Kevin ate. Kevin got angry and hit the other kid and got in trouble and, his punishment was being locked into the attic for the night. The next morning the family woke up late to go to their plane because they were leaving for vacation. They hurried and got into their taxi forgetting Kevin in the attic as he was still sleeping. Kevin woke up wishing his family wasn't there from the previous day and came to see he was home alone. Kevin was so happy that his family wasn't there he was jumping on the bed eating all the junk food he had making the place a mess. I like where Kevin had a huge fear of the wood burner as it opened and closed, thinking it was a monster. But as Kevin was home alone he had to face his fears and later in the movie he was no longer scared. My favorite part in the movie is when he has to defend his house from being robbed from the ""wet bandits"". He has to set up a bunch of booby traps and make sure his house doesn't get robbed. The only thing that strikes me is that these two men, otherwise known as the ""wet bandits"" run into these traps that Kevin lays out throughout the house. If any ordinary person was to run into these traps like they did, they would be pretty severely hurt. It is a children's movie and it is entertaining. The mother realizes that they left Kevin behind as they are already on the plane leaving and she goes through many obstacles to make sure she gets back to Kevin. After two days of Kevin being home alone his family finally comes back. Now Kevin feels a part of the family and they actually all missed him and gave him hugs. I believe the theme of this movie is that no matter what your family is important. You may go through rough patches, but they raised you and there all you got in the long run. This movie shows bravery, responsibility, and really shows that family is important. This movie is great and should be watched 10 years from now, and it's a great classic and reminds me how close this movie brought me and my family too."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","7","0","0","15 December 2015"," Holiday slapstick fun
","Ahh, Christmas. An abandoned child brutally assaults, almost murders two nasty burglars and subjects them to all kinds of elaborate slapstick glory. Such is the joy of Chris Columbis's Home Alone, a seminal holiday classic that contains no message, very little arc, and all the booby trapped hilarity that's more demented than my dad's endless cackling when he sees it on TV for the zillionth time. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy the film, and re watch it whenever I get the chance. It's just pretty demented. Macauley Culkin (back when he was a cute kid before he grew up and looked like something that Dr. Frankenstein made using Steve Buscemi's DNA) plays feisty little Kevin, accidentally left behind at home when his massive dysfunctional family heads off for Christmas vacation. Feeling a bit blue after harsh words with several of his clan, he sets out to live life on his own over the break, which includes shoplifting a toothbrush, eating copious amounts of junk food and the classic prank pizza delivery (ya dirty animal). Things get weird when two scruffy, relentlessly dumb burglars (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) set their sights on his home. He takes the phrase 'holding down the fort' terrifyingly seriously, and devises a onslaught of evil traps, gags and medieval style defense tricks that would make the Huns proud. Seriously, I wouldn't wish that tarantula misfortune on anybody. Pesci is grinning glee as the smarter of the two (which isn't saying much) and Stern plays up the banter as the colossal idiot. Catherine O Hara and John Heard play his neurotic parents, John Candy has a puzzling cameo as the undisputed polka king of the Midwest, and Roberts Blossom plays a menacing show shoveller who figures in the plot. Quite the holiday romp. I'm not including the sequels in this series, but I will say: the second one is fun, but stales a bit as it's essentially just a retread of this just in NY and wayy more implausible. I really love the third which is probably my favourite of the series (come fight me). Avoid the 4th and 5th like the plague unless you want to see French Stewart and Malcolm McDowell embarrass their careers terrifically."

","Christmas is coming, therefore remembering and reviewing some classic seasonal movies is imperative. The first one shall be Home Alone, the classic comedy for all family that made Macaulay Culkin a superstar in the age of 10. The movie even got two Oscar nominations (music song and score) as well as two golden globes nominations (best comedy movie and best performance by Macaulay Culkin). As probably everyone already knows this movie is about an 8-year old who must protect his home from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation. The fact that he manages to bring terror to the burglars is of course completely unrealistic but no one cares since this is an absolutely hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one). There are some classic scenes that will have you rolling on the floor laughing even if you remember them, so it's strongly suggested as it's a classic Christmas comedy indeed."

","That cover shot of young McCaulay Culkin's goofy face has put me off watching this festive movie for years but in mid December on a rainy, cold afternoon and having watched most of the best of the Christmas-themed movies around, I turned to this at last. And sure, Culkin gets more screen close-ups than Greta Garbo ever did, either due to the director wishing to emphasise his ""cuteness"" or maybe in some way to cover up his inexperience at acting, but the movie is so fun that you get used to it as it rolls entertainingly along.<br/><br/>Seems to me that young Kevin gets the best Christmas present ever when, as he thinks, he makes his horrible family disappear over the holidays, but when house burglar Joe Pesci and his hapless accomplice determine to loot Culkin's parents' house, the fun and games commence as the kid fights back, plus of course there's time for a big dollop of Yuletide sentimentality as the youngster makes friends at last with the sinister-seeming old man next door, sorting out the latter's family problems in the process.<br/><br/>The movie's really fun as you warm to the initially brattish Kevin and have to admire his methods of keeping the baddies at bay, firstly with his automated mannequin show and then of course when he seemingly booby-traps the whole house to repel the invaders. Pesci is very good, offering us a family-entertainment version of the psychos he plays for Scorcese, with nary a cuss-word in sight but it's the kid's movie with young McCaulay's acting improving as the movie progresses which almost makes me think the film was shot in chronological order.<br/><br/>I have to admit that before watching, I expected this to be an indigestible slice of over- sentimental nonsense, but instead was well-entertained by a clever and funny family feature which rightly deserves its reputation as a latter-day Christmas dare I say classic."

It just looks like Christmas with all of the lights, decorations and even the songs. It really gets you in the holiday spirit and just gives you that heartwarming feeling of Christmas.<br/><br/>The slapstick comedy doesn't totally hold up for me. I don't find myself laughing at it as much, but I know kids like that stuff and even some adults, so if you like it, then that's totally fine.<br/><br/>I have seen a couple of the original trailers for this movie and based on that, the film doesn't look like anything special or anything that good. It mostly focuses on the slapstick and doesn't look too promising, but Home Alone is so much more than that and I think that's the main reason why it was such a huge box office hit since it wasn't a major success with critics.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Home Alone is a great Christmas film that is a prime example of not judging a book by its cover. It's nicely shot, well- acted and just gives you that warm feeling you get with the Christmas holidays."

","John Hughes and Chris Columbus teamed together to bring us one of the biggest box office smashes of 1990...a little thing called Home Alone. A comedy that not only made a lot of money but made a genuine movie star out of the young actor playing the lead role.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin lights up the screen as a young man named Kevin McAllister, a young boy who actually gets left behind when his family goes out of town for Christmas. Surprisingly, Kevin's realization that his family got a plane without him sits pretty well with him and he settles into the ultimate kid's fantasy of having the whole house to himself. Unfortunately, playtime is cut short when a couple of bumbling thieves (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) somehow get wind of the fact that Kevin is alone in the house, setting in motion a cartoon-like, cat and mouse game between good kid and the bad crooks that puts the best Tom and Jerry cartoons to shame.<br/><br/>The film's enjoyment lies in the viewer's complete acceptance of the premise as a fantasy. Yes, Kevin is part of a very large family, but there is NO way any family would get on a plane to leave the country without double and triple checking to make sure that all the kids are present and there is also NO way that two grown men couldn't overpower a child if they wanted to. If you can check these two large lapses in cinematic logic at the door, the film can be enjoyable. Yes, the cartoon-violence that occurs between Kevin and the crooks is a little over the top, but it is what makes the film so funny.<br/><br/>Culkin charms in the title role and Pesci and Stern work well together as Kevin's bumbling tormentors. Mention should also be made of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents, who are very funny in the opening scenes. Chris Columbus' direction seems to be based on Warner Brothers cartoons, but who doesn't like Warner Brothers cartoons? So check your brain at the door and you'll see why this film was one of the biggest hits of 1990."

","Home Alone, is known worldwide, we all know the story and we all know at least one line from the movie, and it was only lately that i decided it deserved to be re watched, and so i did and i found that the film was great but it did have some errors which i will discuss in this review. Anyway to start this short review, lets have a look at the story, we have Kevin McCallister, the child of (even though they never say) rich couple who are going on a vacation to Paris, in the madness of trying to get out of the house, the leave Kevin behind. Then we have some burglars who want to rob the place, and Kevin must defend his house. Now, i found this to be believable but some of the things that happen throughout the story are strange, such as (i think) we sometimes see the world as Kevin sees it such as the Oven(?) downstairs and Old Man Marley at the grocery store. These were just some unusual points in the movie, which is nor a good or bad thing. You could say the whole movie is about growing up and becoming more selfless rather than being selfish, and this is a good message to tell, it also seems to make an entertaining movie. Onto directing, what can i say Chris Columbus is a good director when it comes to kids films, he is definitely a safe choice. Now i think i will mention a few mistakes in the movie i noticed such as- Buzz could not have seen Old Man Marley from where he was standing, as the curtains were half closed and Old Man Marley was on the far right, not in the middle of the window, therefore Buzz could never had seen him. Also one other thing, was the church scene sort of like in Kevin's mind showing Old Man Marley coming from the dark, scary side over to Kevin's light, nice side, just what i saw in the lighting. Anyway to sum up the film i personally think it is one of the best kids films out there and is a must watch for everybody. Home Alone gets a 7/10."

","Home Alone will stand the test of time, methinks. Watching it tonight, I just find it too much fun. Culkin is certainly a bona fide star here, the groundwork laid in his wonderful work opposite John Candy in the John Hughes-directed, Uncle Buck. The plot—as if you didn't know it, right?—has 8-year old Culkin (quite wise beyond his years, if a bit precocious and, at times, mischievous) left accidentally alone while his parents and family go to Paris by plane to visit the father's brother for the Christmas Holidays. He must fend off two cartoonish, oafish burglars (calling themselves the ""wet bandits""!!!) robbing rich suburban houses on his block, their eyes mainly focused on thieving from his family's home. Pesci and Stern are positively hilarious as the not-so-bright thieves, winding up punished by Culkin's vast array of traps laid at the house they so desperately want to rob. There's a lot more to the film than just seeing the bandits fall prey to violent traps set by an intelligent kid; touched on is Culkin's loneliness without his family, dealing with a scary neighbor (Roberts Blossom, who is simply delightful) that has more to him than meets the eye, and a mother's devoted trip back home to her son. Of course, generations of fans will remember Culkin applying aftershave and shrieking and the ""Filthy Animal"" footage scaring both Stern and a pizza delivery boy.<br/><br/>The visual silhouette trick where Culkin fools Pesci and Stern into believing there was a party taking place is brilliant. Terrific casting, with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents, and even the smaller parts (the aforementioned Blossom and John Candy as the leader of a Polka band who offers a rented van ride to O'Hara he and his traveling buddies use to get to a gig in Milwaukee, passing through Chicago on the way), only enhance the whole experience.<br/><br/>While the Raison d'être might seem to be Culkin outsmarting dim-witted, numskull burglars—using violence from a Loony Tunes cartoon to do so—there's plenty more to enjoy here. Personally, I think Culkin as the anchor is one of the chief reasons this film remains so timeless and specialit's the perfect example of just-right casting.<br/><br/>""This is my house. I have to defend it."" <br/><br/>After building up some good will throughout, credibility does go out the window, but this final stand between Culkin and the bandits is so highly memorable, I think it's excusable. Plus, despite what we know would *really* happen if these two actually were shot by bb's from a bb gun, slip on purposely icy steps, get hit in the head with a crowbar, touch a doorknob heated extremely, stepped on a long nail, received an iron to the forehead, tripped (and landed on) hotwheels, get a blow torch flame to the top of the head (!!!), step barefoot first onto ornaments (Yikes!), and take a shot to the face by loaded paint cans(!), part of the fun is to suspend disbelief and take it all in stride. Stern's reaction to the spider (and the iron stamp on his face) is priceless. As is Pesci covered in feathers. Stern trying to hit the spider and instead crushing Pesci's chest only adds to the outrageousness of the final minutes.<br/><br/>While I loved and anticipated the finale as a child, with all its Three Stooges violence, I think as an adult, the film prior to this leaves a great deal more of an impression. There's a lot of heart here, accompanying the pain of picking the wrong house to rob and the wrong kid to antagonize. After Blossom bops the bandits in the heads with an ice shovel, the film pretty much tells you it's only a movie. Culkin re-uniting with his parents is the heart-warming ending you could only expect; include especially Blossom re-uniting with his estranged son's family, and there's much to find beyond just two nitwits enduring bodily injury most normal folks would never recover from."

","Home Alone is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. It's a fun and very sweet movie that I always enjoy to watch at Christmas time, a simple story that is consistently funny and contains enough spirit to keep the whole family entertained.<br/><br/>The film lacks depth. I felt Kevin's relationship with his family members could have been established much better before he was left home alone, so that we could fully understand why he was happy to be on his own at first, and be able to feel for the character when he begins to realise how much he misses his family. The last twenty minutes of the film are way too frantic, though it may be fun to watch Pesci and Stern fall over and get hurt, it becomes overly slapstick and completely drops the sentimentality and Christmas atmosphere that it was establishing very well previously. It should not have thrown hat all away.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific, particularly Macaulay Culkin, a very charismatic and natural young actor, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, too funny characters that you love to hate, their on screen chemistry is fantastic. Roberts Blossom's performance is very passionate, in an inspired way, his story is the heart and soul of the movie. <br/><br/>It's a charming, harmless film that you can appreciate for what it is. It certainly has its imperfections, but Home Alone mostly makes up for that by being entertaining, and will bring a smile to the whole family. <br/><br/>Kevin is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a vacation to France during Christmas.

","John Hughe's 1990 classic story, ""Home Alone"" directed by Chris Columbus -- Not only did this slapstick family comedy single-handedly launch the career of it's childhood star Macaulay Culkin, it also holds the distinction of being one of the highest grossing Christmas film of all time with over 475 million in box office revenue worldwide. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy, frustrated with his family, who wishes he didn't have one. We as the audiences don't blame him, as most of the family member's really do treat him horrible: mostly the Uncle and brother Buzz. The family is made out of mother Catherine O'Hara, father John Heard, Devin Ratray and Roberts Blossom in other family roles. When he wakes up on Christmas morning the next day, he discovers he's been accidentally left home alone after his entire family flies to Paris on vacation, and forgets about him. It's does feed the same story as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", in a very odd way, when it applies to both the main character and the supporting cast, where both sides wish that the main character never existed and when they are apart they realize they really do love each other and want to be together for Christmas. At first, he's relishing the time with himself. I'm surprise that the pizza guy didn't call the cops in one of Kevin's pranks, but the closing it get to Christmas, the more he miss his family and matured. Matters are complicated when two bumbling burglars attempt to rob the large house Kevin is home alone in played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci known as the Wet Bandits. The two adult idiots quickly get outsmarted by a kid is always fun in a sick demonic way and protected his home. Kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a series of booby traps and tricks. Now, it's a race between time, as the parents rushing home to rejoin Kevin, and the Bandits trying to hurt him. I wonder what would happen if Kevin accidentally kills them. Would he be charge for man slaughter? Parents should still watch the movie, just in case if the movie has way too much violence and swearing in the movie. The characters in the movie are presented as cartoon-like. But the fact remains the actors are real people and not animated images, and the visual effects are done with a very high degree of realism. It's a bit disturbing. That the protagonist is himself a victum of child abuse is a bit disturbing in itself. The violence he inflicts on others is only an acting out of the resentment and rage he fosters towards his parents. So there might be something wrong with Kevin, indeed. Still, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear. I love the planning song. The slapstick might be cruel, but in heart, the movie does have a Christmas theme with the story of Kevin and his snow- shovel carrying neighbor. It's truly a XMAS movie indeed."

","Spending Christmas in sunny Australia threw my Christmas spirit array, and I needed something to make it feel more Christmassy. Home alone was the perfect film to do this. Watched by families every year, the film never fails to bring a smile to the face and a Christmas feeling in your heart.<br/><br/>Released in 1990, the film is still a classic. However what I hadn't remembered was how slow the film is to get going. The vast majority of the film seems to concentrate on Kevin's adventures in the house but that's not why kids watch it, they want to see the bad guys meet their comic demise. It just felt a little dragged out before the action finally began. <br/><br/>Likewise as much of a legend as Macaulay Culkin is, he just wasn't as good as I remembered. When he was trying to act sad, it just felt a bit wooden. He really came to life when he used comedy or was setting up the traps against the bad guys. In comparison to his family though, he was superb. The other group of actors were just slightly too dull for me and I didn't particularly enjoy their scenes.<br/><br/>For me the two robbers were the highlight of the film. Two actors have never been picked so perfectly. Their timing, their facial expressions, their tone was just fantastic and even in my 20s, I still laughed out loud at their performances. The film is pretty basic but that's all it needs to be. The stunts are fun and childish and didn't need to use any special effects to make them any better. It's simple but just right. <br/><br/>A fantastic film that will never lose its charm, it's a Christmas must-see, every year."
"StevePulaski","8","0","0","17 November 2011"," Some of the best childhood escapism ever put on film
","Home Alone is often compared to something it was never trying to be; plausible. It is a very fictitious film. One only a child might like. Parents will be divided. I can see some laughing, some cringing, and some sleeping. Young children will appreciate it, the current generation of teens might, and those who grew up with it will continue to watch the constant reruns on Television during the Christmas season.<br/><br/>While the concept is implausible, the story is simple. Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is accidentally left home alone by his forgetful family during a hectic morning rush to get to the airport for their family vacation. Kevin enjoys having the house to himself after wishing he didn't have a family the night before. But then, he becomes the target for two bumbling criminals named Harry and Marv (Pesci and Stern).<br/><br/>Kevin creates many booby traps throughout the whole film. He uses them to his advantage so that the criminals can suffer many, many obnoxious blows to the head. Some funny, some not. It's all up to the film's way of timing it. Some traps can be hysterical, while others become very redundant. I can see how plausibility clouds the viewers' enjoyment to the film because you know that no eight year old would be able to concoct if he was fed cough syrup to help him stay asleep during a cold.<br/><br/>But Home Alone ultimately accomplishes one crucial element; giving cute and inspired scenes for the purpose of childhood escapism. Children love watching unrealistic things happening on screen. Especially when the protagonist is right around their age. This film is ideal for children of that age because it will tickle them that someone of their age can create such things like that. Then they will try and find one of their friends at school who can do the same sort of thing.<br/><br/>It's delightful and cheery, but very dopey and slapsticky. I mentioned the jokes don't always work, but many times they certainly do. After all, there is something that tickles my happy place when I see someone of such a young age outsmart two criminals. There's something lying in that premise that brings out the child in me.<br/><br/>This was of course produced by the teenager-whisper John Hughes himself. It seems after a very successful run of high school films he wanted to calm his brain and do one about a child. It's strange to watch a John Hughes film that occupies little to no coming of age elements, but still, Kevin is a bit too young to be truly finding his self-worth and purpose on Earth.<br/><br/>Macaulay Culkin is a delightful young actor, but sadly hasn't gone on to do very many things in recent years unlike his two brothers Kieran and Rory, respectively. Culkin did however play a paraplegic in the Christian-satire Saved! which I instantly fell in love with. Here he's a lot younger and livelier, and you just knew he would go on to play the cute, ""innocent"" young boy in many other films while he was still a cute, ""innocent"" young boy.<br/><br/>Home Alone will also resurrect memories from your youth when you were left home alone for the very first time. The house seems so much bigger, emptier, and more silent than it ever has before. It's the strangest feeling that only weakens over time.<br/><br/>Like I said before, a person's generation and age will factor in greatly when judging if they like or dislike this film. Personally, it still holds up today. It's fresh, entertaining, and satisfying, but can be redundant at points. Home Alone was a cute concept, but the sequel treatment was anything but left alone. Still, as long as there are still devoted supporters of this cherished film, I can say that the repeated airings on popular cable networks will not cease in the immediate future.<br/><br/>Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern.

","Home Alone will long be remembered as a seasonal, workable hit comedy that will stand the test of time. The huge hit of 1990 - amazing to think it is nearly 21 years old - spawned 3 sequels that came nowhere near mastering the original, but John Hughes is in top form here and delivers a worldwide global hit. It was the movie that made Macaulay Culkin an overnight star, and thankfully for him his cutesy acting is pitched perfectly well. It would be easy to side with Joe Pesci and Stern as the bad guys when faced with an obnoxious smart ass kid, but Culkin shows us his vulnerability through the loneliness of being left at home, and it is this that works well.

This is a good movie.<br/><br/>As a child, it was scary and funny anc clever and cute. As an adult, I'm noticing how timeless it is. Even the setting makes it difficult to tell it's 20 years old.

Now I find myself wishing I could have that lifestyle! Before, I don't think I even noticed.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the people who created this movie were forward-thinking. They pushed the envelope as far as characterization and dialogue. Kevin is a character you just don't see everyday. The supporting characters are all A+. Everyone seems to just ""fit"" their roles. Beyond that, the plot is clever and the setting is very realistic (notice the details in the house decorating next time you see it, no corners were left unturned it seems.)

"DavidSim240183","8","0","0","12 October 2007"," An interesting idea amusingly played out
","Home Alone was the top money-spinner of 1990 and thrust Chris Columbus to the A-list of Hollywood's filmmakers. I'm not exactly an enormous fan of Columbus because there is something sickeningly twee that seems to infect just about everything he gets his hands on. Home Alone is one of his more successful endeavours, although I tend to think that's more to John Hughes' screenplay which is full of tiny amusements rather than anything on Columbus' part.<br/><br/>After all, this is not the first time Hughes has tackled the nightmares of holiday travel. He previously directed the quite wonderful Thanksgiving comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. He got a tremendous amount of mileage from what could have been a thinly plotted scenario, and enlivened the film through rich, nuanced performances from Steve Martin and John Candy. A film of equal heart and humour. A true, comedy classic.<br/><br/>Home Alone is not quite as successful. If it had been directed by the sure hand of John Hughes instead of the simplistically banal hand of Chris Columbus, it might have elevated the film's premise to classic status. Instead, its a film of amusing diversions and interesting ideas trying to get out. But when they do, Home Alone is a very good film indeed.<br/><br/>We really don't need to go into specifics about the plot. Home Alone had such an impact on people the world over its entered the English language. Indeed its the intriguing concept at the heart of the film that drew so many people to it in the first place. An eight year old boy, Kevin McCallister is left at home by his neglectful parents during the Christmas holidays.<br/><br/>While they're in Paris, Kevin has free reign of the McCallister house. That must be the dream of any child. The freedom to do whatever they want. Whenever they want. No parents to hold them back. Or discipline them when they step out of line. The whole film rests on little Macaulay Culkin's shoulders. And he does quite well too.<br/><br/>I don't think Culkin is all that much of an actor. After all he peaked at a very young age, and his career went into steady decline after that. But his obnoxious precocity wasn't quite as pronounced here. There was still a little bit of innocence left in the boy, which is what gives the film its conviction. Without it, Home Alone wouldn't work.<br/><br/>Which is exactly the reason why Home Alone 2 didn't work. By that time, Culkin was 12 years old and his child-like innocence had long since left him. His ego had thoroughly taken over, and the film seemed a much more calculated attempt on Columbus' part to replicate the things that made the first film work so well.<br/><br/>Hughes' quite well written screenplay puts Kevin through his paces. I enjoyed watching the shifts in little Kevin's emotions. First off is Kevin's astonishment. He wished for his family to disappear, and so they did. Well they've only gone on holiday, but to a child's mind it could seem like wish fulfilment. This leads to unbridled joy at living life on his own terms.<br/><br/>But gradually the reality of his situation begins to sink in. This leads to loneliness, fear, and eventually horror when the McCallister mansion is targeted by two dimwitted burglars, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern).<br/><br/>The point where Kevin must defend his home by outfitting it with booby traps from top to bottom provides one of the best sustained 15 minutes of comedy you'll ever see. I did find it hard to swallow that Kevin could come up with so many different booby traps from blowtorches to tripwires and even Micro Machines. Especially with only an hour to work with. But Columbus directs these scenes with such breathless energy it will have you laughing harder than anything else in the film.<br/><br/>There are some smaller pleasures to be found elsewhere. The film adds an external character of a snow shoveller Kevin believes to be a mass murderer. But in a nicely written scene, he turns out to be a lonely man estranged from his family. I like this scene because it very nicely sums up Kevin's predicament. What started out as an answer to his prayers is beginning to feel more and more like a punishment. Being alone can be fun for awhile. But eventually we want it to end. Its a very overlooked scene.<br/><br/>I also liked the scenes with Kevin's mother, played by Catherine O'Hara. Her desperately trying to get home to Kevin is pleasantly reminiscent of Planes, Trains & Automobiles. All the more so because she even ends up travelling with John Candy along the way. He plays a character not all that far removed from Del Griffith, and the interplay between the two feels natural and warm. Like PTA, Candy proves to be O'Hara's ticket home.<br/><br/>Home Alone has its flaws here and there. But it is a reasonably polished film, and it makes you laugh at all of the right moments. It's not quite the holiday classic Planes, Trains & Automobiles was, but you're bound to find something fun about it, and kids will most definitely love it. Since they're the intended target audience, Home Alone has accomplished what it set out to do. You really couldn't ask for anything more."

","I wouldn't say this is the best movie i ever seen but I must say it is one funny movie. The second one was pretty good as well but the third and fourth ones were just a little kids movies. The first movie of Home Alone I think is the best Home Alone movie and it is exactly what I'll never get sick of it even though I've been watching it over and over again. The funny thing about this movie is that there is so many people in the McCallister family and Kevin is the only one who causes trouble. And when he wakes up the next morning of their vacation in France he finds that his family has left him Home Alone. I really like the two idiots Harry and Marv and they are the guys that makes this movie so good. And of course the guy who people thinks is a shovel slayer and Kevin always screams when he sees him but eventually him and the shovel slayer make friends. I like the part when he has to make a battle plan to defeat the two idiots who were going to break in his house one night and the battle plan music is very good and catchy. I think this movie deserves to be a quite good movie for 1990 and I always thought this movie was made in 2000 because it is so good. This deserves at least a 6."

","My Take: Not a holiday classic in the lines of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but a mild classic all its own. <br/><br/>Ever since I watched it since I was a kid until now, that I'm a big movie fan, ""Home Alone"" is still a very hilarious and effective comedy. It may not just be up there among the highest-grossing films of all time, but also among the funniest films ever. It's fast with the laughs, yet still not ignoring the family values, which the film must have. The story is very memorable and fresh, and always worth a look. Little Macaulay Culkin delivers all he can in his performance as Kevin. While Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastically appealing as the two burglars who gets into sticky situations when they underestimate the power of a little eight-year old.<br/><br/>For those who haven't watched it yet (which is very doubtful), goo watch it now. For those who've seen it several times (like me), go watch it again, this time, with the entire family. Honestly it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"gavin6942","7","0","0","25 December 2006"," A Hughes-Columbus Christmas Classic
","After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.<br/><br/>This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer (""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"") and Chris Columbus as director (""Adventures in Babysitting""). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.<br/><br/>This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Uncle Buck"", this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While ""Saved"" and ""Party Monster"" are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of ""Home Alone"".<br/><br/>What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The ""Scream"" joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the ""keep the change you filthy animal"" joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with ""Die Hard"" this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen ""Home Alone"" you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it."

","John Hughes has really produced some great films throughout the 80's without a doubt, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink etc. But in 1990 he really cracked it in Home Alone. Home Alone the original is without a doubt a must watch film for all audiences.<br/><br/>As always Hughes creates a situation for the film that is a crowd pleaser, in this case an 8 year old left home alone at Christmas while his mother and family hope to get back home in time for Christmas, meanwhile young Kevin McAllister is left to defend his home against two idiotic robbers with a house full of surprises.<br/><br/>This film is certainly a Christmas film, but it's what Hughes puts into it that makes it an essential one, the story, structure, the laughs and the joyful Christmas feeling. This film will make you laugh and maybe even cry it has it all in this family pleasing Christmas topper!"

We all felt this when we were 11 years old and the fantasy of leaving our parents behind as we become ingratiated in our own behaviour upon the world is undeniable.<br/><br/>I may be reading too much into a film that is full of the most basic humour in our nature, but if anyone out there is my age, I'm sure they will feel the same way.<br/><br/>In Kevin MacCallister all our childish dreams come true. It's fantasy on the most base level. He takes care of himself, he thwarts the bad guy and he still does it with enough acumen to realise that growing up can' be done on our own. For example Kevin realises that preconceptions can be misjudged when old man Marley comes to his aid just as we're sure that he is also one of the bad guys.<br/><br/>These are exactly the same choices we had to deal with when we were the same age, even if we didn't have to make them with quite the same repercussions.<br/><br/>But all in all, no matter how much you want to read into this film, it will always be a movie when the little man wins.

","Easily the best Christmas movie for kids growing up in the eighties and nineties, and deserves to be mentioned along side the classics from previous decades. For kids, the movie has everything- action, excitement, humour, and for everyone else the story and acting are engaging. The idea of being left Home Alone for a while, especially after your relatives have been so annoying, will appeal to kids as they will have peace to do anything they want and let their imaginations fly. Cue lots of ice cream and sled rides down stairs. The film shows depth by letting us see the initial down side to being alone- the house can be scary when it gets dark, and you know your parents are not there to help. The plot sees the massive Macallister (spelling?) family planning to go on holiday for Christmas. After a pizza incident at the dinner table, young Kevin is sent to bed and locked in. The next morning there is a rush, and the family leave for the airport without Kevin, only realising what has happened when they are on the plane. They try to find a way home, but this is not easy as it's Chritmas. Meanwhile, two crooks plan to rob the Macallister house, knowing it's empty, but soon realise that Kevin is inside. Kevin sees that it is up to him to protect his house, and begins setting up traps for the intruders. What follows is great entertainment. Yes it may be soppy, but it is a family Christmas film. It is much smarter than you may think, probably accounting for much of its great success, and the acting, particularly from Culkin and Pesci, is impressive. The set pieces are ingenious, ensuring that every 10 year old boy will come up with their own ways to stop bad guys. O'Hara is also good while the rest of the cast, in small roles do well. 8 out of 10"

This movie is brilliant and perfect for children older then 8. Any younger, and, well, it's not exactly appropriate for children younger then 8. My favorite scene is -gasp- SPOILER!!!!!!

Surely I can't imagine why after having my hand fried and my head lite up by a flamethrower (I think?), why didn't they just leave? Definitely, their actions went abovr and beyond the call of acting.

","""Home Alone"", directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by '80s golden boy John Hughes, has pleased millions of people, and is a not-unintentional holiday perennial as well, taking place as it does during the Christmas season. It is a film that operates at a level at which any sort of professional criticism is no longer helpful. Youngster is (improbably) left behind after his large family packs up and leaves for the airport to vacation in Paris; he fends off two inept burglars while mom makes her way back home. Macaulay Culkin plays the main character, Kevin, but there really is no character; Culkin succeeds in the role strictly by playing up his inherent precociousness--most often directly to the camera--while we admire his spunk and resourcefulness (both unrealistic for easy laughs). The picture looks immaculate, sparkly and shined to a fare-thee-well. Often times, just the reassurance that what we're watching is a big, expensive bauble made solely for our enjoyment is enough to keep the masses happy. The holiday trimmings trigger nostalgia in adults and joy for children, while the thieves (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, both over-the-top) aren't scary, mean or nasty--just lovable, irascible losers who can't topple our pint-sized hero no matter how hard they try...and oh how the audience wants them to keep trying!

","I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","I never saw this film as a child but now when I finally came to see this from television I couldn't have been more shocked of what I saw. It was only good that nobody got me to watch this for this is a sick movie! You would never guess how much violence this film contains in innocent frames.<br/><br/>Perhaps times have changed in the almost past twenty years but if burglars who shout out lines like ""I gonna kill you"" and ""maybe he committed suicide"" don't sound pretty disgusting for a children's movie then something has gone totally wrong. The burglars also threaten to burn the boys head and bite his fingers off one by one - Is it normal in some places of the Earth to threaten kids with bad things like that? I really hope that people aren't that mean.<br/><br/>Furthermore the injuries made to the burglars are quite lethal too. That they are evil doesn't justify to show stunts where man lands on his head with surely breaking his neck - not even Jackass the series or the movie featured anything that dumb. In one scene the other burglar makes such a scream that it makes many horror films pale.<br/><br/>And no, I am not some superior moral guardian who hates comical violence - I would just rather recommend Jackass the movie for children rather than this. The only audience I truly recommend this are college students who really need to turn their brains off after some really hard work."

Even in Harry Potter, he wheeled it out one more time for old times sake. Oh Christopher, you cracked me up again. The main problem with this movie is that every movie studio in town,from this movie forward, had to make ten movies like this one because of its success. There has been just a barrage of men getting kicked in the nads on screen since. Walt Disney Studios leading the way. Mean spirited comedies have been the norm going on 16 years now.

","While watching Home Alone it became so plainly obvious (to me) to see just why Macaulay Culkin would never, ever survive his transition from being a child star into anything that even resembled that of a successful actor as an adult. Never. And, it's true. He wouldn't. 'Cause, believe me, he didn't.<br/><br/>The writing was so clearly written on the wall for Culkin. And it was quite plainly evident even here in Home Alone. I mean, just like child star Shirley Temple, all of Macaulay's appeal and charm rested solely on the pre-packaged concept of her/him being perceived as that little tyke who was just the sweetest of all the ""cutie-pies"" imaginable.<br/><br/>Like, let's face it, it takes real talent (as well as a certain amount of cuteness, of course) to make it as an adult actor. It does. And talent is something that Culkin seemed to possess so very-very little of (and it showed) once he had grown out of that darling, little ""baby"" phase of his.<br/><br/>So, unless you're a child, yourself, or an adult who's easily amused by implausible nonsense, then Home Alone's story is just gonna leave you mighty high and dry - 'Cause, hey, other than being completely childish, there sure ain't much joy, merriment, or laughter going on in this one.

The layered screenplay puts everything in its perfectly imperfect place during the impeccable set-up, allowing for the forgetting of a child to become wholly believable and entirely empathetic, and the wonderfully ostentatious performances place everything in a state of heightened reality ripe for rib-tickling laughter and heart-warming sentiment.

","Some movies are made strictly for adults. Others will bore the heck out of us ""seasoned"" viewers and appeal only to children. Luckily, this movie is made for everyone!<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Home Alone"" sees young Kevin McCalister (Macaulay Culkin) waking up a few days before Christmas in a completely empty house, his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas. While the family tries to get back home, Kevin must outwit a pair of two-bit thieves (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) who want nothing more than to loot his home.<br/><br/>What really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor. One could literally sit down with the entire family (from young to old) and watch this movie, and everyone would be laughing all the way through. From young Kevin's attempts at ""holding down the fort"", to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors, this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the TV is turned off.<br/><br/>Thus, I highly recommend ""Home Alone"" to quite literally anyone, especially during the Christmas season. If you have a list of ""Must-See"" holiday movies, this one should be right next to Frosty, ""Wonderful Life"", and claymation Rudolph!"
"oshima-76157","Null","1","2","11 November 2016"," Best Christmas movie
","A quarter of decade was gone, Home Alone still hold sentiments of many people. Released on November 10 1990 as a Christmas family comedy movie, it is a unique and gripping blend for these genres. Home Alone is directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, centered around an eight-year-old defending his house for burglars. The first two Home Alone grossed over $835 million worldwide and made a star out of Macauley Culkin as Kevin McAllister.<br/><br/>It all started when Kevin McAllister who was a naughty, mischievous kid, was punished by his mother (Catherine O'Hara) on the day before their family's vacation to Paris. And as his wish not having family came true, Kevin was left behind in the chaos of waking late and a rush to the airport. At first, he was very cheerful and got into his sibling's things he shouldn't and did everything he wanted. But when the burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) began invading his house, he had to become more mature to protect the place like ""a real man"". Kevin outwitted and set bobby traps to cope with the burglars before his mom came rushing back from France.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good movie, albeit unrealistic. The plot is enjoyable, not too deep and suitable for all ages. It makes you laugh with the methods Kevin used to fight off and how the burglars got hit although many people adopt a view that there was a certain amount of overacting. In fact, this is the main reason why I think Home Alone draws attention and reaps applause. Pesci and Stern handled theirs characters very well, they fit the molds of the bumbling oafs. Likewise, a perfect and charming performance by Macauley Culkin makes it stand our among holiday movies. <br/><br/>Home Alone is not a story about Christmas, it is about a little kid met obstacles when he was at home alone. But Home Alone with stunning decorations, joyful sounds, festive atmosphere coveys a message: Christmas is the season of spending time with family. It is one of the best movies to watch with your family on Christmas."

","It was my favorite movie as a kid, it featured my very first crush, and while there have been many copycats, there will only ever be one Home Alone. I highly doubt that anyone reading a movie review blog hasn't seen this film by now, but those select few...The film centers on Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) a bratty kid, whose extended family is preparing for Christmas in Paris. During dinner, Kevin starts a fight with his older brother, Buzz, and is sent to sleep alone in the attic. An overnight power failure leaves the family rushing to catch their flight and Kevin gets left home alone. At the same time, a pair of idiotic home invaders working his neighborhood and want to rob his house. Kevin sees himself as the man of the house now and knows its his job to defend it. As his parents rush to get back to him, Kevin prepares for war! Home Alone is the epitome of a family film and is what all family films aspire to be. These films all claim to be fun for the whole family, but lets face it, they're geared toward children. Most of the time you take the family to see them and twenty minutes in you're on your phone or falling asleep, but not here. The chemistry between Joe Pesci and Macaulay Culkin is fantastic. We all know Pesci for his mobster roles, so it's easy to forget that he got his start as a comedic actor, and it is actually what he does best. Paired with a great cast, a legendary director, and a terrific story, this is simply the best family feature film I have ever seen. Home Alone has something for everyone. It will make you laugh, cry, and beg for more, and that's why there are five god awful sequels and a whole bunch of other films trying to duplicate the magic of this film, but as I said earlier there will only ever be one Home Alone and it is an absolute must see movie!"

","Christmas staple for anyone born in the mid/late-'80s. The McCallisters, an upper-class Chicago family, rushes to the airport for a holiday in Paris, accidentally forgetting the runt: eight-year-old Culkin. The real fun (and danger) comes when the youngster decides that he's ""the man of the house"" and challenges two dim-witted burglars Pesci and Stern with a funhouse of traps (some slapstick, others legitimately harmful). Writer/producer Hughes and director Columbus do a pretty good job of working around the incompetency of the whole fiasco—but a lot of things in the film comes together so well thanks to an underrated supporting cast, particularly Bamman, Blossom, Heard and O'Hara.

","I have a friend who I once saw call the Holiday Season, the Home Alone Season. It's amazing to think how this movie was made many years ago, but is widely remembered and still regularly watched. It seems like almost all of us have seen Home Alone, and it seems like most people have seen it more than once. For one, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside of the Holiday Season, just how you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside of the Holiday Season even though you could. I mean this movie just gives you the Christmas spirit when it's around. I watched this movie around 6 months ago, and it just didn't seem as enjoyable as it used to seem, and I just thought it's best if I wait until the Holiday Season to see it, even though you can probably find it on TV all year round, and during the Holiday Season it will be on ABC Family. It's just better to get into the Christmas Spirit when Christmas is around. Anyway, I just left a review on the 2nd Home Alone movie. I prefer the 2nd one over this as I feel like the 2nd one is more funny and we see Kevin in a more exciting place than home, as in the 2nd movie he's in NYC. In this movie, he's home alone in his quiet neighborhood where most of the other neighbors seem gone and a neighborhood that's being burglarized at the same time by Marv and Harry. However, while watching this movie I noticed there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax of the movie. Kevin is also somewhat of a brat, especially during the beginning of the movie like the way a kid who is supposed to be 8 talks to his Mom. This movie shows family time as showing a rich family inviting their extended family over and all trying to leave for Paris. So, we remember the opening scene showing a family that is in a hurry all around the house and Kevin feeling ditched by his family and being a brat about that. While this movie has it's flaws it is still somewhat enjoyable, I mean we've all seen it and I think a lot of us are tired of it because we've seen it many times and basically know what's going to happen. Also, I'm surprised this movie has done so well as a movie. One similar movie I prefer over Home Alone is Blank Check. I think Blank Check has more of a plot than Home Alone. By all means, this movie is still good and entertaining. I'll want to watch this movie again during the Holiday Season just to get myself into the Christmas Spirit. I give this movie an 8/10."

The rest of the movie is a pretty nice and touching Christmas tale that covers the areas of family and togetherness. The acting is fairly decent in this film and the characters are pretty likable.

","this is a classic Christmas movie. the plot, cast, and the acting are all top notch. the story is about young kevin who gets left behind when his family leaves for Paris. while alone, he must fend off two bumbling burglars while his family is on a desperate race against time to return home. the acting by young mac is exceptional. his performance is one of the reasons this movie was a huge hit way back in 1990. i also love home alone 2 but i think 3 and 4 are crap. 1 and 2 are the best. the new DVD is great. it is packed with tons of special features including 15 deleted scenes/alternate takes, games, a making of featurette, how to burglar proof your home featurette and more. the deleted scenes are hilarious. one of them is an alternate take when uncle frank is passing out shrimps and buzz takes a tray full. if you're a fan of this movie you should get this DVD. it's great. since i bought this DVD i have watched it numerous times. you will not be disappointed with this DVD. i also wish they would release a new DVD of the sequel."

"DrEbert","9","1","2","24 February 2008"," Quite simply one of the greatest family comedies ever made
","Roger Ebert gave ""Home Alone"" a mere 2-1/2 stars, which is the same rating he gave ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" another one of my childhood favorites. (For comparison, he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" and ""Superman III."") The reasoning he gave for giving ""Home Alone"" that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie, but then didn't like the burglar/booby traps plot in the second half. At first, I was going to say that Roger Ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child, but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>I watched ""Home Alone"" today after many years and I still loved it and I still laughed, even though I had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all. As a kid, I remember always wanting to get to the ""cool"" stuff when watching this movie, the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or booby-trapping the house. I'd fast-forward through much of the first half (even though I liked it). This time around, I had a new-found appreciation for the beginning half, where we get to see how an 8-year-old copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared. I still LOVE the second half of the movie, but I saw the first half in a new light this time.<br/><br/>I think the reason why that happened is the same reason why Roger Ebert didn't like the second half of the movie. As an adult, one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid, to remember the dreams of being grown-up and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement. That's what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults; kids relate to it and adults reminisce about it.<br/><br/>The second half is for the kids (and for the inner child). Sure, it's pretty outrageous to see an 8-year-old devise clever booby-traps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order. Ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesn't have the budget for his fancy booby-trapping. Maybe, but that's not the point. Adults watch and say, ""Man, this can never happen."" But kids say, ""Man! I wish I could do that!"" It is, after all, one reason why we go to the movies: to see things that can only happen in the movies. As a kid, words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8-year-old take on two adult burglars and pummel them (especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say, ""Kids are stupid""). It is a child's fantasy come true.<br/><br/>That is why this movie was so popular when it came out, why it stayed #1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks. It's also why every family movie from the 1990's tried (and failed) to imitate it. Kids love it because it's a dream come true and parents love it because it's a dream remembered.<br/><br/>(By the way, parents, I should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and, unless you want your house booby-trapped, I'd advise that you let them know not to do that. Also, there's one scene where our hero celebrates his new-found freedom by watching a gangster movie, where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun, a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom. Older kids and adults will laugh at the scene (because it's way over the top), but little kids may actually get scared. Just a caution.)<br/><br/>Macauly Culkin is great as our hero, Kevin. He was a pretty talented child star and it's too bad his career never really went anywhere. Our two burglars are Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, who are the Pinky and The Brain of breaking and entering. I think Stern's character, Marv, was supposed to be the funnier one, but I personally liked Pesci's character, Harry, more. One thing I love is the way he's muttering nonsense under his breath every time he gets caught in a booby-trap, since he can't curse in a family movie. (Actually, true story, he had to do that because he had just finished filming his Oscar-winning and totally awesome role in ""Goodfellas"" as a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, homicidal maniac of a gangster and so he was quite prone to cursing.)<br/><br/>What can I say? I LOVE this movie! It makes me a kid again."

"inspectors71","Null","1","2","21 December 2005"," Child Abuse
","This megahit that made Macaulay Culkin a household name--and still causes me to wince when I'm in the presence of gallon paint cans--is a tightly plotted and very funny tribute to upper middle class child abuse. Chris Columbus helms this ruthlessly crafty comedy, and from the moment the house lights go down, it's pedal to the metal.<br/><br/>What makes this movie ultimately work is the room-temperature-IQ criminals Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They're so good you stop listening to the little voice in your head that keeps saying that Culkin's character, Kevin, is the victim of child abuse and neglect.<br/><br/>If you don't stop listening to that voice, you'll probably leave the movie with a damp face from laughing so hard and a sour taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>Home Alone is a giant, cruel joke.

","Home Alone is underrated according to the IMDb. It only has a 6.4 out of ten. It deserves to at least be a 7. This is a great family movie, but there are many adults and teens out there who also love it. It isn't a dark movie, but it isn't all fluffy like some of the movies released today that are considered family movies. It is also one of the best Christmas movies ever made, and is still the last great Christmas movie released to this day.<br/><br/>There are three sequels; Home Alone 2 is pretty good, Home Alone 3 is bad, but Home Alone 4 is a made for TV flop, so I won't say anything else. I'm not sure why, but it seems like many kids prefer the 2nd and 3rd Home Alone movies over the first one. I don't see their reasons for that.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for kids, and many kids can relate to it. I'm sure every kid out there has wished they could be alone and away from their family, but what kid would know what to do if two burglars were after him.

Kevin feels the family does not notice that things just don't seem right until the night before the family was leaving for Paris that things go down hill. The next day when leaving for Paris they do something that no family would ever do like leave your child at home and be 1,000 miles away. What happens next while his family tries getting back will make you wonder can Kevin prove to his parents anything is possible to protect himself being alone.

"mcfly-31","Null","1","2","7 November 2000"," where Hughes went wrong
","Too bad for John Hughes, my favorite writer of the 80s.  His first offering of the 90s was this blockbuster, not a bad film, but one that started him on an unfortunate trend.  The storyline is ingenuis if you're trying to lure kids to see it, and releasing it during the holiday season made it an easy option for parents who wanted something PG rated for the little ones.  It concerns Culkin being left behind by his family during a mad dash to the airport.  When he awakens to an empty house, he stays unrealisticly calm. Most kids would probably be scared on their own, but he's unphased and makes the best of it, eating junk, jumping on his folks bed and staying up late watching R rated films.  His family finally notices him missing halfway to Paris and mom O'Hara takes the rest of the films running time to get back to him.  In the middle of living it up, Culkin discovers that a pair of hairbrained burglars plan on robbing his house.  He's ready for them, arming the entire home with an array of painful traps and devices.  Up until this point the film was slightly amusing, as Culkin, though not a great kid actor, was cute to watch go thru his little adventures.  But Hughes, writing genius that he is, waited till the end to hatch his goldmine idea that he knew kids would eat up.  Youngsters,  most of which who don't understand prolonged pain and find it funny, lapped up the cartoonish injuries heaped upon Pesci and Stern.  Watching as an adult, though, it just makes you uncomfortable, watching men scream in pain scene after scene. Hughes tries to cancel out the violence with a sappy happy ending, but it does nothing to erase the damage done by the unpleasantness.  And as said earlier, because of the 800 million dollar success of the film, Hughes would mire himself in a clone mode for the entire decade of the nineties! Constantly remaking this formula with even worse results each time.  It all went to show that even your best success cannot be the best thing for you, and all we can hope is that real John Hughes who we loved in the 80s will come home again."

","I first saw this movie when I took three of my friends to it for my 10th birthday.  I thought it was really funny when the burglars, Marv and Harry fell into every booby trap that Kevin had set up.  Kevin was the youngest kid in his family (not including cousins, aunts, uncles, or grandparents). His older brother Buzz would always pick on him and his Uncle Frank was just a jerk.  That night, Kevin wished for his family to disappear.  By a strange coincidence,or was it just the fact that the family was in a rush and just plain forgot him?, it came true.  Then two burglars come over to rob the place when Kevin sets up his booby traps.  Many of these scenes looked quite painful such as the scene where Kevin shoots Harry in the genitals with a BB gun and when Marv steps on a nail (let's hope he got his tetanus shot).  So for this holiday season, forget about old movies like Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and pop this video into your VCR.

","Home Alone is a simple concept, but one of genius. A small boy (Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin, accidentally left behind by his family as they depart on Christmas vacation, finds himself in the family home which is about to be burgled by a pair of crooks. However, the little lad is full of innovative ideas for fighting off their depredations, and the crooks themselves are woefully inept.<br/><br/>This idea comes out, in practice, as a chunk of set-up and a slushily sentimental coda which bracket the centrepiece - the assault and defence on the McAllister house, which is played as a live action Tom And Jerry cartoon.<br/><br/>Sentimentality is appropriate for a Christmas movie (and in any event it is good to see Catherine O'Hara, often in overstated comedic roles, playing with a softer edge). Besides, a dose of saccharine is a small price to pay for the wildly funny slapstick violence inflicted by Kevin on the hopelessly outclassed Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern). Both actors play with a broadness which is not only just right, but also absolutely necessary. And young Macaulay Culkin's Kevin is an engaging combination of resourcefulness, malice, and vulnerability.<br/><br/>A hugely enjoyable family movie."

The next day Kevin wakes up with his family no where to be found. He believes that his hopes have been answered but soon he's having to deal with a couple burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who have their eyes on his house.<br/><br/>If you were around in 1990 then you will remember the tremendous success that HOME ALONE had with critics, fans and at the box office. To say the film was a landmark would be an understatement because the film was a huge hit and has gained plenty of fans over the years. After twenty-six years I think it's safe to say that the film is a new classic. While the film isn't perfect it's certainly a lot of fun and perfectly captures the manic spirit of Christmas time.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so well is that it's a perfect child fantasy. I'm sure many kids have wished that they were the boss, the keeper of the house and that the adults would just go away. This film works perfectly fulfilling that fantasy but of course there's the more touching moments thrown in for good measure. What makes the film a classic are the battles between the kid and the burglars. Culkin, Pesci and Stern would all become household names after this film and it's easy to see why.<br/><br/>Culkin is absolutely adorable as the brat kid who finds himself home alone and doing battle against his fears as well as the two bad guys. The violence in the film is in the same field as The Three Stooges and it works perfectly well. Not only does the violence work but it's perfectly sold by Pesci and Stern who are terrific and easily steal the film as Harry and Marv. The two of them have perfect chemistry together and they really make for a great comic team.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is very good with the likes of John Heard, Roberts Blossom, Catherine O'Hara and John Candy all doing fine work. Another major plus is the score from John Williams as well as an all-around great charm. The film contains some great laughs throughout and I think after all these years it's fair to call it a classic."

"spenrh","6","1","6","30 November 2018"," Good in parts, but quite implausible
","I enjoyed this movie when I was a kid. It was an original exciting premise, kid home alone struggling to do everything himself but also enjoying such freedom, and him getting the better over 2 bumbling burglars.<br/><br/>There was some amusing humor including the way the neighbor kid (who had a funny scene with the annoyed van driver) got counted as one of the crew so the family got the family count correct. That was the rooting cause of Kevin's family forgetting him, that combined with Kevin remaining asleep on the third floor where he got sent to the previous night due to him pushing his older brother Buzz for eating his cheese pizza. The other kids (Kevin's sister and his cousins) did not respect him, and his Uncle Frank had an intense dislike for him that was never fully explained other than him thinking how he's just a little brat. But the other kids were bratty too, so I'm guessing that Uncle Frank was just another bratty kid in a grownup's body who only wanted to go with popular opinion and dislike him just because the other kids also did.<br/><br/>The scenes of the family rushing through the airport and just barely making the plane were good, and I found it amusing with the kids running down the jetway and one of them calling ""I got the window seat!"" The scenes with Kevin discovering he was alone and smiling ""I made my family disappear"" was where reality really sorta flew out the window. A real 8 year old would've been scared right then, whether he had a fight with his family the previous night or not.<br/><br/>There were still some amusing scenes along the way with Kevin's antics around the house, him thinking the furnace in the basement is a monster, him going through his brother's stash, eating a big bowl of ice cream while watching the Grinch, and then him pretending to be the man of the house and putting on aftershave, thus leading to his famous hands on his cheeks scream. Alot of those are things an 8 year old would enjoy doing while home alone, that is if his family didn't mysteriously disappear without explanation and remain gone for days on end. That, like I said before, would've gotten a real 8 year old frightened. However, you could also view all of this as just the fantasy of an 8 year old, which is why the movie was quite popular at the time, and why I enjoyed it when I was young.<br/><br/>Also amusing was Kevin going grocery shopping with his conversation with the suspicious cashier. Also amusing was the scene of him asking a pharmacist if the toothbrush on sale was approved by the American dental association and not her or her boss knowing. That scene also has one of Kevin's run-ins with the rumored murderer neighbor Marley. This leads to another one of the movie's goofs when Buzz said at the beginning of the movie that Marley was a murderer who just didn't have enough concrete evidence to put him away. Yet later on when Buzz is talking to his and Kevin's sister in Paris about why he's not worried about Kevin being home alone, he says how they live on a street where absolutely nothing dangerous or criminal ever happens. I guess Buzz had forgotten then about Marley.<br/><br/>Other implausibilities include when Kevin's family in Paris discovering Kevin being left home, they cannot find one person they know back home in Chicago who could check on him. And, the police provide being useless too. After one of them is told on the phone by Kevin's mother that her 8 year old son has been abandoned, the officer repeats her request ""you want me, to check on him, to see if he's ok?"" as if it was a weird thing for a mother to ask when her 8 year old has been left alone and defenseless.<br/><br/>Kevin turns out not to be so defenseless though with Burglars Harry and Marv when he rigs a bunch of traps for them and defends his home. That's the most famous part of the movie, and also the most implausible and unrealistic. It never occurred to Kevin to just call the police. I guess that may also be due to the police in their town being useless, such as their reaction to Kevin's mother asking to check up on him. The police in Kevin's town being useless may explain why Kevin never heard from them when he got the pizza guy to think that there was a shooter in the house threatening him and causing him to run to his car all crazy freaked out. And due to the pizza guy's freaked out reaction, he believed that there was a real shooter in the house, he wasn't smart enough to realize that Kevin was only playing a movie with a shooting going on. Normally after something like that, the pizza guy would go to the police and they would then immediately come to the house.<br/><br/>Good movie in parts, but those gosh darn implausibilities."

"thebricks","7","0","4","28 December 2019"," Great movie, but kind of stupid if you watch as an adult
","Very enjoyable movie that plays on every kid's worst fears of getting robbed, especially while you're at home. The real truth is, most robbers will usually run if they see anyone is home. It's not worth the kidnapping and murder charges carrying out the robbery. Also, in a neighborhood like this, someone is most certainly going to be nosy and call the cops if they see anything unusual happen.<br/><br/>I used to think Kevin defending his home as a kid was a matter of life or death. In truth, I didn't realize how much money his mom was paying for that trip. Flying a group of family members to Paris, four in first class at early nineties prices is a ton of cash, plus hotel rooms and excursions. Someone like that would probably use robbery as an excuse to renovate their mansion.<br/><br/>Factoring in how expensive it would have been to fix the house, some estimates put it at $220K, Kevin probably would have been better off opening the door and letting them take what they wanted.<br/><br/>But it's a fun movie for kids, so I'll leave it at that."

","Like a live-action episode of ""Tom & Jerry,"" this yuletide classic has the type of pitch-perfect holiday atmosphere that managed to spellbind an entire generation of children during the yuletide season. The Christmas music is so well-selected and the score so warm and distinctive that revisiting this movie every year feels like having conversations with your own inner child. There isn't much to say about ""Home Alone"" that hasn't been said before, but for the record, my favorite performance here is Catherine O'Hara as Kevin's mom: Her distress and manic energy are palpable, and O'Hara's long career in improvisational comedy helps her dig her claws into a role that could easily have been forgettable in the hands of a lesser actress."

","A Museum of Artistic Accomplishment in Cinema (M.A.A.C.) Review<br/><br/>Home Alone / Director: Chris Columbus / Career Catalog #3 / Review #0001<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>After a series of unforeseeable events, an eight-year-old boy is left alone at Christmas time and must contend with two neighborhood crooks. This ridiculous premise is made quasi-believable by the warmth the writers imbue in their creation and the characterization of childhood innocence star Macaulay Culkin brings to the screen. While his family members are painted with familiar colors, they never devolve into the realm of stereotypes or one-dimensional representations. They function well together and it's easy to imagine they have been interacting with (and getting on the nerves of) each other long before the camera intruded upon their presence. Catherine O'Hara's iconic histrionics over realizing she left one of her children behind are particularly fascinating. Her roundabout road trip to return home provides a good counterpoint to Culkin's main storyline.<br/><br/>Then you have the acerbic wit of Joe Pesci thrown into the mix. It's hard to believe he filmed this role in the same year ""Goodfellas"" was released. The two performances are such polar opposites of each other and yet, when combined, stand as a testament to Pesci's abilities as an actor. His comedic compatibility with Daniel Stern is off the charts and it's hard to see anyone else filling their roles as admirably as they did.<br/><br/>I really like the fact that the filmmakers never took the easy route and wound up exploring more than one fear for our youthful hero. Not only does he have the fear of criminals invading his home (however bungling the burglars might be), he also has to deal with his fear of the basement and his fear of murderous local legend Marley whom he continually runs into over the course of his exploits. It's not just fear that Culkin's character has to tackle, but the day-to-day aspects of living a life on his own. The filmmakers were aware that sometimes the simplest of things can make the funniest of scenes. From torn grocery bags spilling their contents over a suburban sidewalk to the application of aftershave, there are a thousand little details other films would overlook that make this one a memorable experience.<br/><br/>This film has all the magic of the month of December in one place, from hectic holiday travel schedules to the inarguably argumentative confrontations uptight relatives will inevitably share. I can't imagine the holiday season passing without indulging in this yuletide favorite. It just doesn't feel like Christmas until I've had my fill of purposefully cartoonish violence and heartwarming heartland schmaltz.<br/><br/>On a side note, as this is my first cinematic review, I would like to say that it is my firm belief you get out what you are willing to put into a film. No more, no less. Everyone has a different idea of what makes a film important or enjoyable because everyone has a different set of experiences they have lived through which color their perception of what they see and hear. You'll never read the words ""pretentious,"" ""overrated,"" or ""the Emperor's new clothes"" in one of my reviews. Many people misuse the word ""pretentious"" when they actually mean ""snobbish."" Many people misuse ""overrated"" and ""the Emperor's new clothes"" when they actually mean ""I don't like this film and I can't imagine why anyone else would either."" These statements are limited ideological viewpoints which cheapen the medium of cinema as a whole.<br/><br/>Many people forget that critical analysis is nothing more than the opinion of one person. There are no set-in-stone rules for any avenue of art, nor should there be. Creation is as wide and as varied as human imagination itself. Your opinion . . . my opinion . . . anyone's opinion from that of a professional critic to an armchair reviewer should never be accepted as fact or gospel. Good reviewers understand this concept and often provide for interesting reads. Bad reviewers who forget or scoff at this concept become nothing more than parodies that waste time, effort, and space. So I bid you good watching . . . and good reviewing . . . at this joyous time of the year.<br/><br/>Â©2018 berringercrossreviews"

","I don't know why I avoided this film. It's a John Hughes classic film in his style of American suburbia. Macaulay Culkin has the startling role as Kevin McAllister in suburban Chicago town in a beautiful home. He plays the child precociously and with vulnerability at eight years old. After he is banished to the attic, he is forgotten the next day after his parents fly to Paris, France for a family holiday. There were fifteen in all. The scene where they are racing to the plane would be unrealistic today. Kevin believes his family left him alone. With two burglars played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, Kevin learns of their plot to burglarize his home as the silver tuna. Kevin's mother realized that she forgot him at home. Worried and desperate, she would do anything to reunite with them. There are noticeable Chicago actors like Ann Whitney and Alan Wilder in minor roles. Of course, there is John Candy in a small role as well. The cast did an excellent job with their roles. The film wasn't expected to be such a hit at the box office. You can watch this film repeatedly and still enjoy it like other John Hughes films."

","Rising child star Macaulay Culkin first worked with the late screenwriter and producer John Hughes on his 1989 hit 'Uncle Buck' in which he starred alongside the much missed John Candy. Hughes was impressed by the young man's talents and remembered him for when he set about writing his next film which, of course, was 'Home Alone'.<br/><br/>Eight year old Kevin McAllister is constantly the butt of his family's jokes, particularly his eldest brother Buzz ( Devin Ratray ). After getting into a fight with Buzz over a pizza the night before their Christmas vacation, Kevin is sent to his room whereupon he wishes that his family would disappear. That night, a huge storm knocks out the power lines meaning that the McAllister's sleep through their alarm. As they leave for the airport in a tearing hurry, they are unaware that Kevin is still in bed fast asleep. The first the family realise of this is when they are halfway to Paris.<br/><br/>Kevin is initially overjoyed when he realises that he is home alone but when he learns that two burglars, Harry and Marv, also known as 'the wet bandits', are planning to raid his house on Christmas Eve, he wishes his family would come home. In a bid to protect his home from Harry and Marv, Kevin sets about rigging his house with booby traps to outwit the bad guys. Fortunately, a kindly neighbour ( who is wrongly accused of being a murderer ) who Kevin has befriended is also nearby to help...<br/><br/>'Home Alone' is my favourite Christmas romp of all time, excellently delivered by its cast - Devin Ratray as Kevin's troublesome brother Buzz, Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's overwrought parents, Roberts Blossom as Old Man Marley, the old man who came to Kevin's rescue. Full credit however must go to, of course, its star Macaulay Culkin as the cheeky but likable Kevin and the brilliant and underrated Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern ( who in my view was a comedy legend in his own right, as his performances in 'Bushwhacked' and 'City Slickers' will testify ) as the bumbling wet bandits.<br/><br/>Also impressive in the short time they are on screen are John Candy as Gus Polinski 'the polka king' and Macaulay Culkin's brother Kieran Culkin who as Kevin's younger ( and weak bladdered ) cousin Fuller ( was he named that because of his regular consumption of fizzy drinks, do you think? ) had me in stitches, especially in the scene in which he is pinned against the wall by a chair.<br/><br/>In 1992, a sequel - 'Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York' ( which was the last to feature Macaulay Culkin ) - appeared and did just as well commercially as the first film. Video game versions of both films were also released for both the Sega and Nintendo Consoles. In 1998, 'Home Alone 3' appeared, with Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruddit. It was not as popular as the first two movies but was worth watching nonetheless. Unfortunately in 2002, 'Home Alone 4', which had Mark Weinberg inheriting the role of Kevin McAllister, was made. It was a crushing disappointment for fans of 'Home Alone' and is generally regarded by fans as the worst in the series, a view I share wholeheartedly. Surprisingly, ten years later a fifth film entitled 'Home Alone - The Holiday Heist' was made, this time as a televised film rather than a cinematic release. It fared better than its predecessor though in my eyes nothing will come remotely close to equalling the original.<br/><br/>Funniest moment - the fight between Buzz and Kevin over the pizza. I really cannot begin to do the scene justice here but it is a classic moment of comedy, wonderfully delivered by all concerned.<br/><br/>Second funniest moment - Harry and Marv continually falling foul to Kevin's various booby traps, each one being more pain inducing than the last!"

","There are two reasons why ""Home Alone"" was such a big success. The first is that it is about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there is a worldwide conspiracy of silence. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the film way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded.<br/><br/>Moreover, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.<br/><br/>There are some films that work best at Christmas and this is one of them."

","Home Alone (1990): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: MacCauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Candy: Surprisingly entertaining and engaging family holiday comedy that preaches to every kid's rebellion and that is freedom from parents. Plot regards eight year old Kevin accidentally left at home while his family went on a holiday vacation. The house is large allowing lots of room for Kevin to be innovative especially when a couple of criminals sight the house for theft. They are the Wet Bandits and they meet their match when Kevin booby traps the house resulting in slapstick mishaps that is a tad brutal. The booby traps look effective enough for a kid Kevin's age but the slapstick violence should result in discernment from parents. MacCauley Culkin is a find as the mischievous Kevin whose behavior has him wishing that his family was gone. He gets his wish when overlooked for the trip. Culkin is entertaining and full of energy as Kevin celebrates his freedom. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern play the two idiotic thieves who are assaulted with everything but the kitchen sink as they are outwitted by this kid. Catherine O'Hara plays Kevin's frantic mother who desperately tries to get back home to her son. John Candy provides a chuckle as the leader of a polka band that offers O'Hara a ride.

","I know that it's highly unlikely for an 8-year-old boy, no matter how smart, to have singlehandedly pulled off all those burglar traps, but I still love this movie!! As the youngest child in a big family, Kevin is somewhat spoiled and is consequently seen by his siblings as a pain. The night before the family's year-end holiday to Paris, he gets sent up to the attic as punishment for fighting with his siblings. Stung by the seeming injustice of it all, Kevin wishes for his family to disappear. Amid the hustle of getting to the airport, his parents forget about him. Kevin is at first delighted that he got his wish, but soon finds himself having to defend the house against burglars.<br/><br/>Home Alone is so funny and Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is so adorable! It's one of the few movies that made me laugh out loud. The first half was a bit slow, but it was refreshing to see the world through the eyes of an 8-year-old - believing the scary tales spun by an older kid and letting your imagination run wild! The second half where Kevin ordered pizza and played cat and mouse with the burglars was hilarious and just believable. Beyond the humour, I liked the movie for the message that it sent - family is precious! Truly the perfect family movie for the holidays!"

","My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays."

","This year it is already 24 years ago that Chris Columbus' ""Home Alone"" starring Macaulay Culkin was released and the film gets shown pretty much every holiday season here. It also scored 2 Academy Award nominations, probably mostly because it was by far the most commercially successful movie in the United States in 1990. Of course, that is also why so far there have been three sequels, with only the second starring the lead actor and most of the original cast in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". Columbus directed this sequel as well and later worked on ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and several ""Harry Potter"" films.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of ""Home Alone"" is that also all the smaller characters bring quite some charm and fun. Kevin's uncle (especially during his scenes in the plane) is my favorite smaller funny character and Old Man Marley brings the emotional highlights here. That church scene was particularly wonderful. What a shame the actor is not alive anymore. Same goes for the film's writer John Hughes and John Candy, who both died way too early. Mentioning John Hughes, I was a bit surprised that the smoking Santa was not him in a small role. He exactly looked that way. You may have seen some of Hughes' other very known works such as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""101 Dalmatians"" and many more.<br/><br/>Another mention goes out to Joe Pesci, who has had a true career year in 1990. Here he plays the chubby, slightly smarter villain (over Daniel Stern's character) compared to his completely sinister mafiosi gangster turn in ""Goodfellas"", which won him the Oscar that year. Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe in the musical/comedy actor category, but lost to Gerard Depardieu, who won for the only movie from all the nominees which is not considered a classic or close to that description today.<br/><br/>""Home Alone"" runs for roughly 100 minutes and will make you laugh a lot and also touch you. The latter happened for me mostly with the old man with the snow shovel and how meeting Kevin impacts his life. My favorite funny scene was the gangster film playing with the poor pizza guy coming along. I saw it so often already, but it never fails to crack me up. I am not sure if I would call this movie a classic or even an epic, but it is certainly worth a watch. Recommended."

","""Home Alone"" is about a boy name Kevin McCallister who is left behind with his family that they have gone to Paris as he takes care of the house, and deal with some burglars. I grew up with this movie as it is part of my childhood, and it is still fun to watch from being a kid to an adult. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and I do watch it when it comes to the Christmas holidays. John Hughes' script is extremely well written as well as Chris Columbus' direction. John Williams' music is so memorable and beautiful at the same time. The cast in this movie were great, but I give highly praises to Macaulay Culkin for his performance as the main lead. He is star of this whole movie, and fun to watch. Also, I give highly praises to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as Harry and Marv who they are known as the Wet Bandits. The movie is filled with slapstick like ""The Three Stooges,"" when Kevin sets up the traps as both Harry and Marv go through a lot of pain as the movie goes toward the end. The movie is not only funny, but it has a lot of heart to it that is filled with the spirit of Christmas. This is the best of all the ""Home Alone"" movies, and nothing beats them. The only good sequel is the second, which I will get to that later but the third and fourth were terrible; they tried to be fun and entertaining, but they were not and they were not needed to be made. So, anyway, ""Home Alone"" is definitely the one to watch during the Christmas holidays as well as the second, which again, I will get to that later. If you haven't seen the first ""Home Alone"" movie, please feel free to check it out because it is fun, entertaining and it really does have that Christmas feeling. When you finish watching the movie toward the end credits, you come out feeling good at the end of it. ""Home Alone"" is definitely an unforgettable Christmas classic, and I give it a 10 out of 10."

","The basic story seems so simple. Little 8-yr. old Kevin is accidentally left behind when his family jets off to Paris for Christmas. So it's ""riddled"" with continuity errors and plot holes. The garage has a separate entrance but is somehow connected to the main house? (Who cares.) There are so many things going on here. It's an incredibly complex screenplay, which pays homage to so many other movies: The burned brass hand-scar (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") The Three Stooges (impossible stunts and injuries that would have killed any mortal man.) ""Angels with Filthy Souls"" is a parody of ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". Clips from several Christmas movies. Sure it's totally implausible that an 8-year-old boy could actually execute such complicated stunts, but the ""Micro-Machines"" (actually candy) are genius, as is the zip line to the treehouse. It's Maculay Culkin's best performance. John Candy plays a great cameo as the Polka King and the sub-plot of ""Old Man Marley"" and his grandchild add much ""heart"" to the film. There are so many scenes that I love, but the toboggan out the front door and the stinging after shave lotion are the best. I love Buzz's tarantula and the blood-curdling scream (dubbed) from Daniel Stern! (The tarantula on Marv's face is considerably smaller than the one used in other scenes?) A great score by John Williams with some dusty 1950's carols thrown in for good measure. Of course this whole thing could never really happen. The whole movie is a fantasy, but the dream house that the McCallister's ""live"" in is real! Also, magically, most of the mess of the house is cleaned up by the time mom is finally united with Kevin, who is no longer home alone."

","Home Alone is a fun family comedy starring Macauley Culkin as young Kevin, who accidentally gets left behind, when his family and extended family leave on a hasty departure for Paris for the Christmas season. Before this happens, he and his mom (Catherine O'Hara), have an argument and she is terrified when she finds out her little boy has been left behind while in mid-flight.<br/><br/>Home Alone is a little boys journey of being alone at home, learning how to survive in the big world and having to fight off a couple of house robbers (the Wet Bandits). Culkin is brilliant in Home Alone. He sets booby traps, such as shaded mannequins he makes dance on strings behind the picture window curtains to fool the robbers into thinking there is someone home, and continues to set booby traps until ""Old Man"" his next door neighbour, who he initially was very scared of, intervenes.<br/><br/>Home Alone led to four more sequels and three video games. Culkin won several awards including Best Young Actor Starring in a Motion Picture, the American Comedy Award and Funniest Actor in a Motion Picture (Leading Role) in 1991. Cast includes Culkin (Kevin), O'Hara (Kevin's mom Kate), John Heard as Kevin's father Peter, Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Stearn as Marv. Pesci and Stern were the Wet Bandits. Home Alone is pretty much one of the best Christmas movies out there."

I like this movie because there is an important lesson as well as funny scenes in this story. It told us the preciousness of family. This movie is great, but at the last scene of this story, I wonder why he didn't tell his family about what happened. If he had told, he would be praised a lot!!

","Kevin McCallister is one of the most unforgettable, if not the only unforgettable 8 year old character to swoop through Hollywood. When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season.<br/><br/>HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir.<br/><br/>The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN.<br/><br/>Media states that ""Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple"". Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did.<br/><br/>""Tis the season to be jolly"" and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday.<br/><br/>If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store. This isn't a nativity play but it indeed has some Christmas magic if you watch closely. <br/><br/>Happy Viewing dear readers.<br/><br/>Merry Christmas!<br/><br/>TITLE: HOME ALONE DIRECTED BY: CHRIS COLUMBUS STARRING: MACAULAY CULKIN, JOE PESCI, DANIEL STERN AND CATHERINE O'HARA RATED: PG13 RATING: 08/10 RUNTIME: 103 MINUTES"

","When Home Alone released in 1990 I was about 12 so I was the perfect demographic and I loved it. I remember seeing it over and over again in the theatre. It was a HUGE runaway success and made Culkin one of the biggest stars in the world. I've probably seen the movie dozens of times but it has been a few years so I sat down to usher in the Christmas movie season with this one last night. My goodness, what a fantastic movie. I mean everything just works brilliantly for it to be a stone cold classic. Never mind the eventual battle against Marv and Harry which is hilarious with the quintessential gag and trap moments that had me howling out loud, but the overall story is sweet and touching and has so many layers to it. When you think Home Alone, you immediately think of the traps against the burglars but that doesn't even begin until 3/4 of the way through the movie. Everything just fits together perfectly from the cast to the scenery to the story and made me laugh out loud and even cry at the end. While I think it should be geared towards older children just because of some of the thematic elements, this is still a fantastic classic Holiday movie.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why Macaulay Culkin was compared to Shirley Temple. His on screen charisma is inexplicable and palpable. I say inexplicable because he honestly doesn't exactly deliver lines particularly well, even awkward at times but it matters absolutely none because he is perfect and adorable and charismatic. The casting only gets better. Joe Pesci who I always find overly dramatic and hyper is born for the role as the headstrong bossy robber Harry. Watching him get bested and beat up is legendary. Daniel Stern plays Pesci's sidekick and the bumbling robber perfectly. The two of them together could not be a better fit for their respective parts. This was sort of Stern's pinnacle and it is easy to see why. The supporting cast are all just amazing. John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Devin Ratray, and Roberts Blossom all have such important roles and they are so terrific. Some are more subtle than others and they aren't necessary standout roles but they're fun and they work so well in the story. And of course the legendary John Candy makes a fun appearance in the story as well.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus is a legendary director. He goes under-appreciated I think but he has such a bold style and everything is colourful and the setting is always as important as his characters and Home Alone is just a perfect fit for him. Add in the brilliant talent of the amazing late John Hughes and you have an absolute film making power couple. Maybe I'm overstating the film because it certainly isn't an Academy Award quality film and I'm sure it isn't critically acclaimed but it is sweet and so much fun and I forgot how truly great it was. I could have literally put the movie back in and watched it again. Make this part of your holiday routine!! 10/10"

","*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, John Hughes has never written a movie that didn't have a human touch. That's his magic touch, the plots of his movies are not complex but the characters always contain a level that makes them slightly more dimensional then most. Hughes is mostly known for adventures involving teens and adults like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, Planes Trains and Automobiles and The Breakfast Club, films that are simplistic in their plots but wonderful in their humanity.<br/><br/>Those films stayed pretty close to the ground, plot-wise, but Home Alone is a little different. It is not about teenagers, but about a plucky little kid with a story that leans more toward fantasy. This one involves possibly the greatest kid in the history of the world and his adventure foiling two burglars who try to break into his house on Christmas Eve. This is an adventure that The Little Rascals might have gotten involved in decades ago. That's a good thing.<br/><br/>The kid is Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin), a cute 8 year-old whose over-large family is getting ready to take a trip from Chicago to Paris to spend the holiday with relatives. The night before their departure, the power goes out and the family wakes to find that they have only 45 minutes to catch their flight. In the rush to get to the airport, the family inadvertently leave little Kevin behind.<br/><br/>Kevin is an amazing kid. He's resourceful, mature; he remembers to take a bath and even does the laundry. He even goes to the store on funds pilfered from his older brother Buzz. However, he also has free reign of the house, especially his brother's room where he makes use of the bee bee gun. There's no reality to Kevin, but I don't think that was the point. No kid would do many of the things that Kevin would do, and if indeed a kid were this smart, he might even think to call the cops and let them know that he's been left at home by himself. This is a fantasy, so we just have to sit back and enjoy it at that level.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, two separate events are taking place elsewhere. On a plane somewhere over the Atlantic, the realization dawns on Kevin's mother (Catherine O'Hara) that she has left her son behind. As she does her best to get back home, a potential threat is looming for the pint-sized hero in the form of two idiotic burglars Harry (Joe Peschi) and Marv (Daniel Stern) who are taking advantage of the fact that the people on Kevin's street are away for Christmas. Harry sees the McAllister's luxurious house as a gold mine. Kevin finds out their coming and sets up a series of booby traps.<br/><br/>Home Alone is a fun, good-hearted movie. Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes do a nice job of creating a film that is both heartwarming and very funny. The heartwarming stuff comes from a relationship that Kevin develops with the old man next door. They seem to have a mutual problem, but in a touching scene in a church they talk about the meaning of their problem and of the meaning of family.<br/><br/>What makes the film really work is the performance by Macaulay Culkin, a cute kid but not a cloying one. He has pitch-perfect timing in his comedy and there are moments when he hits his mark so perfectly that you wonder if the filmmakers worked with him for days on end or if he really is that good. I like to think he is.<br/><br/>The funny stuff comes in the film's third act as Kevin attempts to defend the house against the burglars using traps that no 8 year-old kid in the world could ever devise. They involve a lot of carpentry, engineering and foreknowledge of where the burglars are going to stand when he springs the traps. It is violence on par with the Road Runner cartoons, or more accurately with the Inspector Clouseu pictures. It is violent, but not bloody or unpleasant.<br/><br/>You have to put that stuff in the back of your mind. Home Alone isn't a perfect movie, but it is a good one. You have to take it at face value. As I said, this is all pure fantasy, and it's a lot of fun."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","2","2 February 2012"," Straining for our fondness and doing its best to try our patience on occasion, the film remains snappy and often funny enough in spite of its shortcomings.
","I didn't think George Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead was the piece I was going to come away from Home Alone thinking about the most. Certainly, in terms of structure, there is that overriding sense of the first two thirds of the film acting as gentle 'filler' to the bigger picture; pleasant foundations easing into a final act arriving with such an explosion that when we watch it all unfold, we observe just how much craft and panache has been put towards it when placed up against mostly everything that preceded it. The respective sequences are, of course, when the undead run amok in what was up to that point a safe haven for the few remaining human beings left in the United States and that moment those two burglars in Chris Columbus' 1990 comedy Home Alone make it to the lead's house so as to ransack it.<br/><br/>Up to these respective points, we could be forgiven for misplacing that said films were necessarily either respective horror or comedy movies at all. In the case of the Romero movie, that was OK: we enjoyed the clash between those indebted to science and those not; between those with trying to learn and understanding beings initially alien to them and those wanting to round them all up and get rid of them as soon as possible. In comparison, the build up to Columbus' explosion of style, craft and third act circumstance into which you genuinely feel the most energy has been pumped contains a scene in which one of those typically overweight American police officers goofily slips on a stretch of ice as he chases after an infant accused of stealing a toothbrush. Ho hum.<br/><br/>In spite of this, Home Alone is a fairly resounding effort on the whole without really ever creeping above a certain threshold of meagerness. It is a child's film, for sure, and one they'll no doubt enjoy watching as the kid protagonist thwarts an array of grownups in both a physical and authoritarian sense. They'll sympathise with the lead and his marginalisation at the hands of uncles and brothers, and they'll respond to his predicament of actually being away from family members and parents whilst having to get by on one's own as the first and foremost source of adventure. Remarkably, the film works as well as it does from an adult perspective; child orientated goals aside, it is made with the best of intentions and competently enough in spite of the fact one can only hold a certain amount of sympathy for a young child wanting all the attention without getting it whilst disparagingly privy to a three storey house in a part of the world which always sees snow at Christmas time and with a family capable of affording expensive holidays to far off locales.<br/><br/>It is Macaulay Culkin playing Kevin McCallister, an infant boy stuck at home at Christmas time with his extended family on the eve of their big holiday away to Paris. Kevin is an outcast, and both frustrates and is frustrated by them. One line, as he stamps up and down on the landing, as he shouts: ""When I grow up and get married, I'll finally be able to live alone!"" captures his forthright but ignorant stance. After wishing them gone and he alone, the following morning sees a mad dash and a miscount resulting in the McCallister's halfway over the Atlantic and Kevin still in an attic convert. Cue a lot of shenanigans; a rush to get home to him and a passable framework to do with the lead's realising family are actually something to cherish. Proper antagonism arrives in the form of two burglars, Marv (Stern) and Harry (Pesci); a couple of crooks whose trademark is to fill the sinks of their victims and leave the taps on to induce flooding – rather humorously, they scope out neighbourhoods in a van kitted out to look like a plumbing company and as they 'toast' crowbars whilst spying the McCallister residence, an amusing cut to inside Kevin's house sees a TV cartoon broadcast depicting The Grinch: they are indeed out to wreck Christmas.<br/><br/>The various strands and subplots just about hang together; Kevin's mother's sub-Planes, Trains & Automobiles trek back home, complete with an eccentric John Candy figure, is kicked around for laughs but just feels like John Hughes paying homage to himself, while Kevin's integration with a road sweep, whose psychosis ends up being a lot more balanced than was initially established, allows Kevin to see things through more grounded eyes. The road-sweep and our lead share a scene in a church which, quite literally, sees the conclusion of Kevin's framework all but verbally confirmed whilst revealing what it is he's come to learn during this experience - the following fifteen minutes a part of the final twenty seeing the film make that aforementioned step up into a final act of second unit genre onslaught when Marv and Harry finally try to rob the McCallister house. Where the narrative is weak with the whole exercise sporadically feeling spineless, its lead carries the film in a surprisingly diligent manner whereas composer Williams finds a delicate place in between unnerving, on account of some theremin riffs during the opening as a small home is dwarfed by the film's ominous ""Home Alone"" title card, to reassuring and quite pleasant with a thoroughly competent score. Columbus keeps the thing cracking along at a brisk old rate, and while the wheels threaten to come off, it is actually somewhat of a relief overall that they do not."

","'Home Alone' is a Christmas classic about a young boy named Kevin McCallister who is accidentally left behind during the chaos on a trip. He then realizes that two burglars are about to break in and so he must defend himself.<br/><br/>Why on earth is this movie so lowly rated!?! 7.3 on IMDb for this film is simply said, not high enough. C'mon this is a Christmas classic and is widely regarded by many as the 2nd greatest X-Mas movie. This film has heart, fun and absurdity.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie 6 years ago, when I was back in the 4th grade, not only did I cry and laugh my head off, but so did EVERYONE in our class. We, as a class, had a blast and even today (when I just watched it) I love the film. <br/><br/>There are so many things I love about this film. I love EVERY single actor, even the little kids who don't get very much screen-time. That's how good the acting is, in particular little Macaulay Culkin, perhaps the greatest kid actor before he became drug addict. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were the perfect burglar pair! That was just perfect! <br/><br/>I loved how this film had heart, like when the band offered to drive Kevin's mom all the way home, saying ""Sure, its Christmas time!"" I also absolutely loved the hell outta Old Man Marley and the character background story they gave him. I also loved how he looks evil but deep down you see him as a nice character. <br/><br/>Perfect film!"

","The kid is fan of kid movies so I think to those movies because I count them as masterworks: they knew how to blend a lot of strong elements and are unique for that: they mix the best holidays (Christmas) and its wonderful spirit, the values of family, the cartoon fun (with the thieves) and a great soundtrack (magical score from John Williams as well as Christmas songs)! <br/><br/>My preference however goes to the first movie: the setting in this huge mansion with snow outside is what everyone can dream for Christmas! And it's true that when you are a kid you fantasize about being home alone. A lot have been said about Culkin but he was truly good for the job: not a spoiled brat but a kind and witty kid. Beyond the cast was really great from the mother to the exceptional Joe Pesci (and don't forget Heather!).<br/><br/>The kid was under the spell right away: as soon as we watched it, he recognized the sound of John Williams (""It's like Harry Potter) and I realize why the pair was chosen on this adaptation.

","Home alone is a movie that is considered a classic. I don't really think of it as a classic. If it weren't for a few things, I think it would be forgettable, but those things make it work. Those things are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Those two made the first film and I guess the sequel fun for me.<br/><br/>Home alone from director Chris Columbus, who is super cheesy, directed this film back in 1990. Everyone of his films is cheesy. Home alone for example, is cheesy. I love you Beth Cooper, the worst film of the year, is very cheesy, The first two Harry Potter films are kind of corny, I mean this guy is the king of cheese. He can't help it for some reason.<br/><br/>Home alone has some very funny moments. That is another reason why I liked it.

So while Kevin is home alone and the mom travels back to try and get him, these two Burgalers try to break into Kevin's house.

"Electrified_Voltage","6","0","1","10 February 2009"," Sometimes funny, but how it turned out to be such an incredibly high grossing film is beyond me
","I was a preschooler when this movie came into theatres and turned out to be a massive box office success, but I never saw it in my childhood. I saw a bit of what I guess was the 1992 sequel, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"", when I was a kid, and was familiar with the ""Screaming Kevin"" doll (a toy which I was never was a big fan of, based on the main character in the first two ""Home Alone"" films, played by Macaulay Culkin), from a very early age. However, believe it or not, it took me a little over eighteen years after the theatrical release of the original ""Home Alone"" for me to get around to seeing it! Yes, this movie is up there on the highest grossing movies of all time lists, but now that I've seen it, I don't know exactly what that was all about.<br/><br/>Kevin McCallister is an eight year old boy in Chicago whose family is preparing for their Christmas vacation in France. On the night before the trip, he is picked on by his siblings, and after a dispute with one of them, he is sent to sleep on the third floor, wishing his family would disappear. The next day, the family leaves in a hurry and Kevin is accidentally left behind! He wakes up to find that his family actually has disappeared, and his parents don't realize they've forgotten their son back at home until one point during their flight! At first, Kevin is happy that the family is gone, but eventually finds that being home alone isn't all that easy. While his mother, Kate, tries desperately to get back home as quickly as possible, which doesn't turn out to be easy, Kevin becomes aware of two burglars who intend to rob the McCallister house! <br/><br/>For a while, early in the film, I didn't find it very funny at all. Before the trip, there's a joke about armpit shaving (jokes like this, along with some language, are the obvious reasons for the PG rating), and one of the McCallister siblings throws up. I did not care for these, and some of the sibling rivalry and insults I found to be a bit much. For a while after Kevin first finds himself home alone, I found the film rather dull, but fortunately, funnier parts come. There are some humorous moments involving Kevin without his family, such as the character at the store, with the question he asks about a certain toothbrush, and I laughed hard during the scenes where he uses the movie to communicate with people at the door, convincing them there are adults inside (they're probably the funniest parts). The McCallister mother can also be somewhat amusing during her attempts to quickly get back home. Casting comedienne Catherine O'Hara in this role definitely helped. The climax can be funny, but gets a little tiresome.<br/><br/>I've definitely seen much worse comedies than this hit holiday film from 1990, and this one is funnier than 1994's ""The Santa Clause"", another PG rated family Christmas movie from the 90's, which I seemed to enjoy as a kid, but not during my last viewing many years later. Despite the absurd plot, ""Home Alone"" does have some good humour, as well as a rather poignant moment in the church which eventually comes, but still, the film is not all it's cracked up to be. It may be slightly above average family fare, and it has appeal, but it's still a little strange, the fact it's among the tops in box office history. I'm sure there are so many movies which have been much more deserving of the success that ""Home Alone"" had at the box office, but unfortunately didn't even come close."

","You get a lot of kids these days fast-forwarding until they see somebody get hurt. I don't know, perhaps they should. That last half hour is one of the coolest bunch of movie sequences ever thrown together. It's all childish as hell but I can't not laugh at the villains walking into a bunch of really obvious traps. The redundant sequels tried to get the same kind of flow between all the physical gags but I think it's safe to say they just sucked. You can't touch the grand finale of ""Home Alone"". However, I think what comes before all of that is pretty enjoyable too, or at least I used to as a kid. Being home alone, able to do whatever you want, it's not too bad of a Christmas present. It gets boring because the set-up takes a bit too long, but I understand they had to have an excuse for that brilliant main event. I'm usually not that excited about a movie aimed towards children, but ""Home Alone"" is just really really cool."

However, the pranks he pulls on the idiodic burglars are what made this movie okay, as well as when he scares away the pizza man by playing the voice of the man in the R rated movie. Who knows? You might love it. Watch it if ya want. I can't do nothing' to stop ya."

","This is a movie you have to watch with your brain in neutral. If you think about it, you'll just go nuts. True, they threw plot logic out the window with this movie. A parent who would leave a child home alone, whether accidentally or not, would probably be visited by social services, be thrown in jail, and have their children taken away from them. (Especially if they do this two years in a row, but that's another movie.) The pranks Kevin pulls on these two stupid criminals should not be tried at home. Setting hair on fire, things of that nature would kill someone in real life. They should put up a disclaimer in this movie warning of the dangers of some of these pranks. Otherwise, it's a laugh a minute fun little romp, especially when it comes time for Kevin to defend his home. (Love the way he played a scene from ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS when he scared off the pizza man and when he scared off the burglars early in the story.) That business with old Mr. Marley (have to see the movie again to be sure I got that name right) was very touching at the end. It showed Kevin wasn't just another dumb, bratty little kid, that he had a heart of gold. Very entertaining. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the ride, and don't think too much."

Pesci has never been funnier as a competitive burglar who can't believe that he is being beaten by a kid. Pesci and Stern end up making complete fools of themselves. Caulkin's parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara. They are both funny as different personality parents, who completely forget their son on a holiday trip. There is also an amusing scene with John Candy as a polka clarinetist. I liked the part where Caulkin helped out his neighbor by advising him to contact his estranged son.

The plot is slightly unrealistic but that adds to the magic of the film. Macaulay Culkin really belies his years and gives an amazing performance as Kevin McAllister, an eight year old boy left Home Alone by his family.

While the family go away for the holidays, Kevin accidentally gets left behind, and he becomes the hero of the film by protecting his house against a couple of idiotic bandits. The film is filled with slapstick humour which will leave you laughing hysterically. There's also some subplots which will leave you nice and warm for the holidays.

","Holidays are all about cheer and joy. They are times to laugh and spend with your family. Home Alone achieves cheer, joy, laughter, except for family.<br/><br/>Home Alone (written by John Hughes, who also did the funny Breakfast Club) is about an 8-year old boy named Kevin who is accidentally left at home when his parents leave for Christmas vacation. Unfortunately for Kevin, he lives in a rich house, which is targeted by two burglars: Marv and Harry. They plan to rob Kevin's house at 9:00 pm, so Kevin has to protect himself, using self-invented traps.<br/><br/>Home Alone is simply full of slapstick humor, with some hidden jokes in between. (One of the funniest parts is the one with the pizza man.) But, John Hughes made one mistake: He forgot to make it realistic. How could Kevin stay asleep, while his whole family is screaming and trying to pack? How could he make so many traps, but not pack a suitcase? How could Marv spend so much time on the floor after tripping, when Harry has grabbed Kevin? How? Well, despite the main flaw, Home Alone makes a fun, heart-warming holiday movie. I would definitely recommend it! Of course, it isn't perfect, but its fun and fun is what holiday movies should be! <br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>Good: Fun, funny and heart-warming, and has nothing to do with Santa (like most Christmas movies do)<br/><br/>Bad: Unrealistic, and it could be funnier<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

There is not much life around us any more, and indeed, all things seemed to have faded into blurry fog and remain loose forms, colored in black and white. Where is the happiness? Where the dreams?

","""Home Alone"" has been one of the most cherished and beloved Christmas movies since its release 14 years ago, and nearly every time it runs on television around the holidays, I feel obligated to watch it, to ""get in the mood"" for the yuletide season. This is a wonderful family comedy that everyone can enjoy, if they open their hearts and minds. Kevin McCallister is ungrateful towards his family, who treats him like he is invisible, and wakes up one morning to discover that he has ""made his family disappear"". Actually, his family unawaringly abandoned him when they hastily left to spend Christmas in Paris. This puts the clever, mischievous, and industrial Kevin in the position of being ""home alone"", and he plans to make the very best of this long desired vacation from his family- in jumping on the bed, watching obscene, violent movies, indulging in rotten food, and riding down the stairs in a sleigh- perhaps every child's dream come true. All is fun and games, that is, until he discovers two ominous crooks by the name of Harry and Marv, who deviously plot to steal from residents of Kevin's neighborhood, including his own house! Now this becomes a matter of out-witting and thwarting the two crooks through a series of clever, contrived traps and gags which will discourage Harry and Marve's criminal efforts and leave them with splitting headaches, sores throughout their bodies, and eventually, a pair of cold, steel handcuffs! This is such a wonderful, delightful premise, perfect for holiday viewing, regardless of age (admittedly, however, this film was better when I was very young, and even inspirational- this is how you stop ""the bad guys""). It also contains some valuable morals, as Keven learns through his experiences and acquaintances in being ""home alone"": never wish for your family to disappear, for once they are gone, you will be praying for their return; don't prejudge others based on their appearances and ""rumors"": Kevin is at first petrified of a man who is believed to be a ""shovel murderer"", yet once he becomes acquainted with him, the man is harmless, genial, and kind; and finally, when you recognize a threat being posed to yourself and others, don't stand around, but take immediate action (of course, one cannot be nearly as devisive as Kevin in ""Home Alone""), but you get the picture. ""Home Alone"" is a wonderful, clever, funny, and entertaining Christmas classic, featuring an enchanting musical score by John Williams, some hilarious, if inane, dialogue, a solid MacCauley Culkin performance (the finest of his career), and some very endearing qualities that always make this the quintessential Christmas watch. ***1/2 out of ****"

With a simple plot, great acting, and slapstick out the wazoo, Home Alone is an indispensable<br/><br/>movie, not to mention the film that launched Macaulay Culkin to stardom. <br/><br/>Like previously stated, the plot is simple. Kevin McAllister (Culkin) is an 8-year old kid, the youngest in a rather large family, and he hates it. For those of us who grew up in huge families, we can identify with Kevin when he shouts,<br/><br/>'When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'M<br/><br/>LIVING ALONE!' That night, after ruining his family's dinner (of course, he was provoked by his older brother), Kevin wishes that his family would disappear. <br/><br/>The next morning, Kevin gets his wish. While he thinks his family has just<br/><br/>completely disappeared, little does he know that they left early for Paris and miscounted (they mistook the next-door neighbor kid as him). Realizing now is his chance to do whatever he wants, Kevin has the time of his life: going through his brother's room, jumping on the bed, watching R-rated movies, the works. <br/><br/>However, Kevin is smarter than he looks, and notices that two moronic burglars (played perfectly by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) have been snooping around<br/><br/>his house. When he overhears them deciding to rob the house on Christmas<br/><br/>Eve, he pulls together some of the most complex and elaborate booby-traps that would be the envy of professional snipers. The audience roots for the endless slapstick, laughing even harder as the burglars get more and more determined<br/><br/>to find Kevin and get rid of him. While this is going on, Kevin's mom (Catherine O'Hara) is trying desperately to get home and make sure her son is OK. <br/><br/>Home Alone is proof that American audiences love to see the bad guys get the<br/><br/>snot kicked out of them. With paint cans in the face, tacks up the foot, broken glass on the floor, heads getting set on fire, and trips galore, we just can't stop laughing. Of course, the moving also has heart, including a sweet reunion with Kevin & his family, plus his friendship to a street shoveler.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone. 10/10."

I know that the garden variety of crooks are usually on the low side on intellectual development, but one time would be enough -- right?

As Kevin lives in the nicest house on the street, the two robbers want to steal from their, they coincedentially find out he's home alone, and still plan to attack the house, but little do they know, what tricks Kevin has up his sleeve!

"mrsjinky2003","10","0","1","19 April 2003"," Love it!
","I loved this film when I first saw it over 10 years ago and I still love it today. This is one of the best Christmas films of all time and I never tire of watching it. The sheer splendour of the McAllister house is something to be marvelled at and one of my favourite scenes is when Kevin thinks he made his family disappear and runs wild through the house in celebration. Katherine O'Hara is the perfect mix of stern diciplinarian and worried parent as Kevin's mother and the late John Candy is great as Gus Polinski. I admit that the rest of the family are just there to make up the numbers but together they covincingly portray the nightmare family that Kevin can't wait to get away from. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern provide many a laugh as the bungling 'Wet Bandits' - although I don't find them as funny now as I did back in the day. Considering this is a kid's film I think it has stood the test of time reasonably well and this is mostly due to the production team as the film hardly looks dated at all. On top of that there is the excellent sound track which just makes the film even better.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I look forward to watching it yet again this Christmas."

"brianlion","7","0","1","10 November 2002"," Holiday Movie With the Usual Touch of Violence And Christmas Cheer
","This movie is part of our staple of movies to watch at Christmas time. It is a OK movie, with enough holiday themes and scenery to keep me satisfied it is a holiday movie. McCauley Culkin does a good job playing off two bumbling, and really dumb burglars. It helps to have a mansion as the backdrop to foiling Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.  Some of the scenes where the 2 bumbling burglars try to eneter the house are charmingly funny. It is annoying that the script could not come up more clever ways for Pesci and Stern to react other than ""Ow!' or ""frism-frasm"". And the kid delivers enough hits that would kill a normal person. But today's movies must add violence as one of the ingredients to a successful movie. Audiences have developed a ""taste"" for it, even if this was made to be a holiday movie to be seen by millions of kids. But, I did enjoy the Christmas touches and the various personality conflicts from the large family. Home Alone 2 is the companion movie of part 1 and follows the same pattern."

"BadWebDiver","9","0","1","30 March 2002"," Great comic revival movie
","This is a great comic story that launched a new child star into the Hollywood stratosphere, and understandably so.<br/><br/>This film does show off Macaulay Culkin's brilliant comic execution. Apparently, it was partly the result of John Hughes being impressed with Macaulay's performance in UNCLE BUCK, and was devised as a vehicle for him. What makes this film superior to its imitators and successors is that Kevin is allowed to show comic skills and still come across as a genuine kid.  For example; he wants to watch adults only movies, but he freaks out when he actually sees them.  He wants to shave like his dad, but howls when he applies after-shave lotion. And so on.  The christmas scene in the church is a nice humanitarian touch that later Hollywood kids movies lacked.  The character isn't just a minature adult in a child's body.  This gives the story a lot more personality and depth than the other films of its kind.<br/><br/>In fact I think Macaulay demonstrated with this film, the interview scene in UNCLE BUCK, The Nutcracker and other performances that he was (and possibly still is) the best comic actor of his generation.  (Well, a tie between him and Joseph Gordon-Levitt at least)."

","This is a great movie. This is easily Culkin's best. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are brilliant and hilarious. In my opinion, this is next to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. What is great about this film is that it has great acting, a reasonable plot, although unrealistic. Some people have said that this movie was too violent. Hello, people! It wouldn't be a damn movie, if Culkin didn't use the traps. Get a clue! <br/><br/> Here is the plot. The McCallister's are going to Paris for their Christmas vacation. At the time their having dinner which is pizza, Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is angry because his brother ate his cheese pizza. Kevin starts throwing a temper tantrum and tackles his brother and makes a huge mess in the kitchen. Soon, he gets into an argument with his mother. He tells her that he never wants to see her again. The next morning, his wish miraculously comes true. After a while, his family is on the plane to Paris. Unfortunately for them, they find out when they're on the plane. At the time being, there are crooks that want to rob the neighborhood. These two people are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. It turns out that they want to rob Kevin's house for the silver doughnut. But Kevin is there which the bandits don't know. Kevin will do all he can to stop the bandits and get arrested.<br/><br/> Home Alone is a great movie. Home Alone 2 is a worthy sequel, but doesn't live up to this one. Home Alone 3 is okay, but could of been a lot better. They didn't have to name it part of the Home Alone series though. I own the first two movie and there both great to watch during the holidays. Home Alone gets a 10/10."

"auntbea64","10","0","1","15 April 2001"," One of the funniest movies of all time!
","This is one of the funniest movies of all time!  Macaulay Culkin's facial expressions are priceless as well as timeless.  It seems that no matter how many times they are seen, they can always bring a smile to the face and laughter throughout a room.  Not to mention that he's just so dang cute! What else can one say.  This movie brings me joy when I am down.  With it's impssible antics and the 50's superhero moments with Jimmy the shop boy, who couldn't love this movie.  My only questions with the movie are how in the heck did he get the sled out the front door, and why does he always run up the stairs and in front of the camera and then turn around and go to the bedroom when he is screaming?  That bothers me and others greatly, but alas, it still does not distract from the movie.  The comedic genious that this represents is amazing, and the acting ability of Culkin rates among the childhood greats.  Well, that is enough for now.  If you have not seen the movie, I encourage you too, and if you have, watch it again, for you will always find something new.  <br/><br/>And always remember the wise words of Kevin...""When I grow up and get married....I'm livin' alone!"""

","A picked-on 8 year old kid (a surprisingly competent performance from Macaulay Culkin before he grew up to be a bigger kid!) is left home-alone by a family taking a Christmas vacation to Paris. Expecting a quiet few days on his own he has to contend with a couple of inept burglars with his own inventive traps & bouts of violence.<br/><br/>A very simple film with a sugary & predictable message at the end. But inspite of the thread-bare plot it is a very enjoyable romp, perhaps because of the rather inventive but uncomplicated writing from John Hughes.<br/><br/>The film only really comes alive during the battle of wits between Culkin & the two robbers (well supported by Pesci & Stern) while the rest of the film just trundles along at a rather predictable pace.<br/><br/>I saw this film back in 91 and found it quite funny (still do in fact). But at that time I hadn't really had much chance to see other Pesci movies of the time.<br/><br/>But now, some 10 years on everytime I see Pesci screaming in agony as he suffers more comic violence from the inventive little brat I keep thinking he's going to go into Goodfellas or Casino mode and pull out a gun along with a hail of abusive language and shoot the kid full of bullets, or put his head in a vice.<br/><br/>But anyway, Home Alone is a good family movie that doesn't stretch the mind and never really offends anyone although perhaps the Tom & Jerry style violence is perhaps a little too strong in places. Its a nicely packaged movie and I have to admit Culkin is very very good here. Best not mention the two limp sequels.<br/><br/>***/*****"

","Home Alone is probably by far the best holiday comedy movie since Peter Billingsly in A Christmas Story, another holiday classic.<br/><br/>The story of Home Alone is about a kid named Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) who with his entire family are, going to France for the holidays. Kevin who is the youngest out of everyone in the house is often called by his brothers and sisters a ""disease.""  Anyway, one night, after his mom orders some pizza, he asks, ""Did anyone order a plain cheese?""  His older brother, Buz replies, ""Yeah, but if you want any, somebody's going to have barf it all up, now it's gone.""  Kevin his angry after discovering that Buz had purposely ate all the cheese pizza and gets into a fight with him.  When it's all over, everyone is mad at Kevin and sent to his room on the top floor for the night.  Later that night before going to sleep he says, ""I wish they would all just disappear.""<br/><br/>Predictably, he wakes up the next morning to find everybody gone, not knowing that they had just left for the trip to France.  So this means party time for Kevin.  However, they're have been a string of burglaries by two partners in crime Harry(Joe Pesci) and Marv(Daniel Stern) (by the way are the best comic pair on screen) have set their sights on Kevin's house.  So this ultimately leads to their final showdown with Kevin setting his house full of traps so they can't get in.  <br/><br/>As I said before Home Alone is a must see holiday classic.  I'm 15 now.  I first saw it when I was 5 in the theater.  I must have laughed myself silly at Kevin's pranks.  Home Alone was followed by a less successful, but just as entertaining sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost In New York and a horrible third entry, Home Alone 3.  <br/><br/>10/10"

Check out My Girl and his pre Home Alone work if you don't see what I mean.
