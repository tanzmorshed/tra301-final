","I often go see advance screenings in my area, especially now that I must officially be on ""the list"" as I am constantly finding tickets in my work inbox. This was the second Apatow production I've seen in advance and just like ""Superbad"", this did not disappoint. At the same time, while many of the cast members may be recognizable, there seems to be something different about this installment than I've seen in the likes of ""40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Superbad"", or ""Knocked Up"".<br/><br/>For starters, there was a definite presence of the ""TV actors on the big screen"" theme here, but I am pleased to report that Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis take to movies like naturals. Like many Apatow productions, Segel penned the script and takes over as lead Peter Bretter, proving yet again that with this crew the writer is best suited for the leading role. Segel delivers a character we all know too well from our own personal experiences and never breaks role from the shocking beginning to appropriate ending. I even give Segel extra credit for not completely victimizing his character and pointing out apparent flaws on both ends of the ending relationship.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell plays Sarah Marshall, the iconic ex of the film, but her role sits on the back burner along with the truly hilarious Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to make way for a leading role in Mila Kunis. From the beginning it is clear that her not-too-smart and shallow role of ""That 70s Show"" didn't follow her to ""Forgetting""'s script. Kunis plays Racheal, a hospitality girl for the hotel that ""Forgetting"" takes place, and subsequently deals with Peter as he tries to get over Sarah Marshall. Her character is intelligent, charismatic, and appreciative of the good in people, a strong juxtaposition to the seemingly selfish starlet Sarah Marshall. Kunis owns the role with pride, even slipping in gestures and glances that didn't seem to initially be in the script. Hopefully this will open her up for more serious roles than ""American Psycho 2"" and the typecasting that often happens with TV actresses like her.<br/><br/>The star of the film, in my opinion, easily has to be Russell Brand, who plays the over-conscious over-sexed rock star Aldous Snow. Snow adds the necessary level of comedy that could have been missing from what is truly a tragic plot. About halfway in the film, I couldn't help but snicker to myself just with the presence that Brand creates (complete with perfect costume choices). The only downfall to a character who is truly the Mercutio of this tragedy is that Brand clearly overshadows Bell's performance as Sarah Marshall, who is ironically the most forgettable character of the film.<br/><br/>The writing flows with well-timed jokes, apathetic digs, and shocking vulgar humor. There is even a few moments where you feel Segel was digging on the cast with jokes involving crime dramas (Segel did time on ""CSI"") and TV actresses in horrible horror movies (Kunis did the atrocious ""American Psycho 2""); not sure if it was intentional, but I caught what I thought was a reference. Just as with most Apatow productions, leave the kids at home. Unlike the rest, however, the crude humor doesn't overflow and turn off most audiences (like I noticed with ""Superbad""). It also doesn't get very heavy in the least (which is what I felt hurt ""Knocked Up""). I think Apatow has found a great balance with this production and Segel's script. I also want to give credit to Nicholas Stoller , who proved that he can be successful as a director after the hit he took from helping write ""Fun with Dick and Jane"".<br/><br/>All in all, this comedy is just another example of a good time for adults. It keeps a consistently flowing script, unlike many recent comedies that seem to lose pace as they close the story. While crude, the jokes are just light enough to appease most adult audiences and the short 100 minute run time will ensure you won't be glancing at your watch waiting for it to end, just laughing hysterically."
"joestank15","8","64","91","13 November 2008"," Funny and sweet without seeming too formulaic
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall - A slacker composer Peter (Jason Segel from ""Knocked Up"") has a breakdown after his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell of ""Heroes""), the star of a hit TV show, dumps him for a British pop star. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.<br/><br/>This was a funny movie! It's a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional ""Scrubs"" style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.<br/><br/>This was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that's a strike against him.<br/><br/>Segel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There's no animosity between the two men. It's nice to have a comedy where we don't have to demonize anyone.<br/><br/>It's a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.<br/><br/>B+"
"rzajac","Null","68","103","16 January 2009"," A miraculous movie!
","I normally do not go out for sappy, romantic roller coaster romantic fare; and Forgetting Sarah Marshall (FSM) pretty much falls under the romantic ""date flick"" rubric.<br/><br/>And I can't, for the life of me, quite figure out why I liked this so much. I guess the filmmakers succeed in making the welter of comic bits, scenes, and images come across like genuine romantic sweet chaos. How they succeeded is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>And maybe that's the point. Some films are good, some are bad, and some are sort of like miracles. Their power is inexplicable; and that's how FSM felt to me.<br/><br/>It was boffo, a bit over-the-top, a tad muddled, a mix of character study, revelation, and farce. And, as things unfolded, by dint of pacing and sheer comic/character acting power, I came to really care about the characters; and I loved it! I glowed through most of FSM.<br/><br/>Here's a way of looking at it: FSM was sort of like Shakespearean romantic farce. Maybe that explains why I liked it; because my mind already has a little engine for processing this kind of narrative stuff, built up from past experiences watching Shakespeare In The Park!<br/><br/>It also comes down to artistic sincerity. Most romance flicks are a little insulting because they're not sincere. There was something, in the end, believable and therefore redeeming about the characters and their silly little Hawaiian comedy of errors and feints.<br/><br/>And that's a miracle, in my book! This is not an ordinary date flick."
"Cognition","8","156","256","7 February 2008"," Same Apatow clan, slightly different take.
","This film was shown at my university tonight and Stoller was there for a Q&A after the screening. The film was the typical Apatow romp that we have seen as of late (Superbad, Knocked up, etc.). There was the usual crude and creative humor as well inappropriate sexuality to make another great Apatow team production. People should not come in with the expectation that this is another romantic comedy reincarnation of ""Knocked Up"". This is more of a typical and organic romantic comedy. The heavy emotional weight and issues in ""Knocked up"" are not present in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining."
"roset3678","8","163","281","27 March 2008"," Apatow's Crew Sets the Comedy Bar for Hollywood
","I'm going to be honest, walking into the advanced screening tonight I was expecting an overly chick flicky somewhat dull comedy. What I got instead was a pretty hilarious movie with just the right amount of romance and a whole lot of vulgar comedy also. I can honestly say this is the funniest movie of 2008 so far. The entire Judd Apatow crew has overall had about 4 or five great comedies in the last 3 years, putting them up with all the other great comedy film makers since 2005. This movie makes me feel like I can now trust any movie they make most the time. When this movie hits theatres in April, GO SEE IT. I promise you won't find a funnier movie out any time soon."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","71","119","21 April 2008"," A romantic comedy that is actually funny? Wow, I didn't think those existed any more
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall, definitely the biggest movie that everyone was looking forward to seeing this year. Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies: 40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life, I have to say he's got talent, the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable, they are real and people you could relate too! For example, Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for, yeah, he's a little bit of a moron, but you know what? You could understand why people liked him, he was pretty cool, even the girlfriend, Sarah, yeah, she was a jerk, but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.<br/><br/>Sarah Marshall: hot actress, beautiful, and a fun person, just broke up with her musician boyfriend, Peter. He's just heartbroken and needs to get away for a while, so he goes to Hawaii, but guess what? Sarah is there with her new rock star boyfriend, Aldous Snow, and things are not seeming to go his way. But when he meets Rachel Jenson, the nice and really pretty hotel clerk, they go out and he ends up realizing that maybe this break up wasn't such a big deal after all.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a funny movie, I guarantee you are going to laugh. I do have one complaint, the male nudity, now it's not that I'm a prude at all, just this was more uncomfortable than funny with Jason exposing all his assets. I don't know, just that type of humor isn't funny with me, male or female, just depending on the joke, but this was more awkward. But I do think this is a fun movie, it has a great story and really makes you laugh and just have a good time with these characters, it's a good recommendation from me.<br/><br/>7/10"
"bwymle","9","154","274","21 February 2008"," You Won't Soon Forget It!
","I know, I went for the obvious.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see an early screening of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" a few days ago and I am more than happy to start spreading some buzz for this film. It was consistently funny and highly quotable with a strong cast and well developed characters. I have been continually impressed with the multi-talented young actors under Judd Apatow's wing and Jason Segel--who, I'll admit has been one of my favorites since ""Freaks and Geeks""--does not disappoint. <br/><br/>There are many familiar faces here from other Apatow projects, but for good reason. Paul Rudd, whom I love equally in comedy and drama (true fans must view ""The Shape of Things"" but be prepared to be uncomfortable), Bill Hadar, and Jonah Hill hit just the right notes in their supporting roles. There's Russell Brand--whom I was unfamiliar with but apparently evokes strong feelings one way or the other across the pond--is hysterical and delivered some of my favorite lines. Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis are sympathetic straight women to the goofy men around them. It was particularly nice to Mila Kunis outside of the 70's Show/Family Guy worlds. And, last, but certainly not least, there's 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer playing an equally lovable and funny newlywed version of Kenneth.<br/><br/>Though I did feel that the film ran a little long, it never once dragged. There were also a few shots that I am sure will not be available until the unrated DVD hits stores because though they are truly hilarious, they are essentially the only thing keeping the film from a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Finally, I will say, that those who liked Knocked Up, Superbad, and 40 Year-Old Virgin, will certainly enjoy this movie. I, personally, would rank it above the other three and will enjoy debating my friends about that come April."
"jackgdemoss","8","16","23","13 July 2018"," 10 Years Later, Jason Segels comedy strikes hot
","It is a travesty that I allowed this movie to simmer 10 years without sitting down to enjoy it. Being a huge How I Met Your Mother fan, and more specifically a Jason Segel fan, this was a treat. Segel's awkward charm is perfect for the narrative, and I hope another film finds space for a character like that sometime soon, though I doubt it."
"rparham","8","40","67","4 December 2008"," You won't want to be Forgetting this comedy
","Prior to the release of The 40 Year Old Virgin, it is likely that few people knew the name Judd Apatow. Now, just three years later, that name has become almost a stamp of comedy quality, with such films as Knocked Up and Superbad following on the heels of The 40 Year Old Virgin. Now, the Apatow steamroller moves forward with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and once again it has mined comedy gold, with lots of laughs, but also, as with many of the previous film's from Apatow's company, a nice streak of sweet romance to go along with the laughs.<br/><br/>Fogetting Sarah Marshall focuses on Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), a Hollywood composer who's girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), is the star of a CSI-style police procedural series. Jason is a bit of a layabout (who also isn't afraid to walk around his apartment naked), and Sarah has decided she has had enough of him, so she is breaks up with Peter, leaving him in a seemingly unending pool of despair.<br/><br/>To try to take his mind of Sarah, he takes an impromptu vacation to Hawaii, but quickly discovers, to his horror, that Sarah is also at the same hotel as him, with her new boyfriend, recently on the wagon British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). However, while doing his best to avoid Sarah, Peter finds himself falling for a hotel staff member, Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>As with such films as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy that isn't afraid to mine the more vulgar for comedy, nor does it shy away from some rather frank nudity, including plenty of footage of star Segel (who is also the screenwriter). The upside is that, unlike many other sophomoric comedies these days, the raunchier material actually produces laughs. Much of the film's best humor comes from Brand's performance as off the wall Snow. The character has lots of great scenes and lines, capitalizing on the characters seeming insatiable libido.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall doesn't just provide lots of laughs, it also features an involving and touching romance between Peter and Rachel. Both Segel and Kunis have a nice chemistry between them that fuels an involving romance. As the film progresses, we can't help but root for the characters to find themselves together in the end.<br/><br/>In addition to the previously mentioned Brand, the cast of Forgetting Sarah Marshall gives us both great laughs and characters we can be involved with. Segel proves to be relatively low on insecurity as he puts himself almost completely on display (literally). His Peter is an character whose rather unassuming nature wins you over. Kristen Bell makes the films titular character at times apparently self-involved, but also someone who has a soft spot for her ex-boyfriend. Kunis' Rachel is a character that is both no-nonsense and full of sweetness.<br/><br/>In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves to be another winner from ""Team Apatow"", and belongs right next to the previous hits from his creative team. If you are looking for both laughs and a dash of romance, look no further than Forgetting Sarah Marshall."
"BlackDog1981","9","105","194","11 April 2008"," Fun Movie!
","I'm not a big fan of Judd Apatow and his recent crop of movies.<br/><br/>That said, I got to see ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" April 11 at a preview screening with some friends, and I was impressed. It's a joke movie, but it has a story that pulls you along, and the jokes are outrageously funny. I nearly died laughing. It doesn't try to push the envelope of ""How immature and disgusting can we be?"", which was what I have come to expect from these sorts of movies. It's just funny actors doing a great job of telling a good story that most adults will relate to in some way. It's honest fun, and I wish there were more comedies like this coming out.<br/><br/>All my friends enjoyed the film, too (aged 20-27). It's a good date movie, though certainly NOT one for the kids or younger teenagers."
"refresh_daemon","8","47","85","11 May 2008"," And you thought *you* were sensitive...
","An amusing and sometimes awkward breakup film, this pic was written by and stars a long-time Apatow cohort, Jason Segel. The pic centers on lost, hypersensitive slacker Peter, who after being broken up with by his TV star girlfriend copes with its end poorly, eventually escaping to Hawaii where he subsequently books himself into a hotel that she is coincidentally staying at.<br/><br/>Immediate warning to those sensitive to full frontal male nudity: it is present and more than once. That out of the way, the pic was pretty affable, containing more than a handful of good laughs as well as more than a lot of generally comically captured sex scenes. Many of the secondary characters also play enjoyably silly roles. And there is a funny musical component to the pic that also includes an amusing rendition of puppet-related works.<br/><br/>I suppose I do have to level a little criticism for the theme being a little slight, but there still is something to be said for healing of personal wounds and learning to ""move on"". Those that have seen other Apatow relationship pics will probably see a number of similarities (slacker dude learns to grow up, gross out comedy, etc), even though Apatow didn't write or direct this piece. The film is also a bit on the long side, like many comedies that come from the Apatow crew and you do notice it. Some judicious trimming and relegating of some scenes (including numerous flashbacks) to DVD extras would've been helpful.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish that more character could be drawn from both Sarah Marshall and Peter's newfound love interest, hotel employee Rachel as they played fairly two-dimensional, but I'm glad that Sarah didn't end up a one-note character as well. I didn't love the conclusion of the breakup story arc because I felt that it was a bit of a cop-out, but it didn't ruin the film. Lastly, Peter was written a little on the edge of believability in terms of being oversensitive, so you really have to buy his character, otherwise the film will break on you.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is a congenial, enjoyable, but rude/crude film with a share of laughs and more Jason Segel than you probably ever wanted to see. Recommended for those who like some story with their laughs and can handle the vulgar, sexual, and nude content. 8/10."
"Pavla_M","1","61","114","9 January 2009"," Forgetting this movie!
","I gave this movie a chance only because it had very good reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought - what an unfunny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a shot because trailers often don't portray the movie very well. What a waste of time... The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that also is pretty passé. I couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Unintelligent comedy for people who are either still in high school or feel that way mentally."

","Maybe this movie would have worked with a better cast. Maybe this comedy would have worked if it has a sense of humor. As it stands, Foregetting Sarah Marshall is a totally forgettable film that will leave you wondering how it ever got made. It is kind of like several comic strips taped together to make a story.<br/><br/>Totally miscast is Jason Segel who makes a poor choice for a leading man. How did he get the part? Oh, he is the screenwriter. Why do we need to see him nude umpteenth times in film...and shots of his ""johnson?"" He is just not a comic. Jason is the weakest link of the movie just as he is on the TV show ""How I Met Your Mother."""

","This movie appeared as its predecessors, knocked up, 40 yr old virgin, to be crude and immature but with occasional funny parts worthy of a Saturday night at home. This was not so, the movie stars an undefined characterless loser with no personality who, i guess is supposed to develop and grow into something more during the movie. Well that doesn't happen. We get to see his sagging penis flashed throughout the movie though (i suppose the writers were so frustrated with their inability to actually develop a worthwhile plot that they thought throwing in full frontal male nudity would make make up for its overall dreary stupidity, it only made it worse). The films continual crude scenes of awkward sex and the general focus on actual intercourse further added to its vitriol and made it seem like it was written by a 13 year old boy. which seems likely. The plot descended into such nothingness, i honestly stopped watching halfway through. I thought Russell brand would make the movie marginally worthwhile, but his personality doesn't even make whimper. All in all, plot= vacuous, acting= bad bad horrible, especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role , and don't , for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord, what a waste of 1 1/2 hours.."

"FakeIDs","4","27","47","31 August 2008"," Maybe One or Two Laughs
","To be honest, I didn't think Forgetting Sarah Marshall was much better or worse than The Heartbreak Kid. I think I laughed during the pediatrician scene and one other part that I can't remember. The characters are just a collection of stereotypes...and they are not even up-to-date stereotypes! Surfers that have smoked themselves into a stupor are way eighties, dudes. I think Paul Rudd, whom I like, knew his character was just another variation of Spicoli and phones it in a little. <br/><br/>A weepy Emo rocker or even an angry white rapper would've been more contemporary than a sex-obsessed British rock star. You would have to go back decades to find a musical artist that even remotely resembles him. They even miss chances to poke fun at real-life personalities. Sarah Marshall could have been one of those boozy ingénues that flash their privates as they get out of limos.<br/><br/>Supporting characters are unnecessarily inserted into the story and eventually forgotten, but they don't even provide an excuse for a clever joke. There is a Christian couple on their honeymoon that are completely pointless and they lead to some of the worst gags in the movie. All you are left with is something that is going to potentially insult a large group of people and you didn't even get a single laugh out of it. Jonah Hill and his infatuation with the rock star goes nowhere and is not particularly funny. The other characters have become all-too-familiar in a romantic comedy. The too-good-to-be-true romantic interest. The henpecked husband and friend of the hero. Et cetera.<br/><br/>There was a stand-up comedian on the talk show circuit a few years back who would make a joke about how people will get tattoos of symbols in foreign languages that have no meaning, like the Japanese kanji for ""water."" They shoehorn the joke into the film by having it spoken by an airhead who is suddenly translating tattoos in other languages. Maybe Carlos Mencia contributed to the movie?<br/><br/>When Judd Apatow produced a good comedy show, ""Freaks & Geeks,"" it was largely ignored by the public and was quickly canceled after one season. When he started appealing to the lowest common denominator, the same people were suddenly his biggest fans and praised him. You start to see why ""That 70's Show"" lasted 8 seasons and why ""Two and a Half Men"" is entering its sixth. Meanwhile, ""Arrested Development"" barely makes it to 3. <br/><br/>Almost every opportunity and set-up the movie has to do something clever, they take the easy and predictable route. I was actually surprised by how many of the jokes were just plain cheesy. The only thing you can say in defense of such a shallow movie is that it is comparatively better than Disaster Movie or Good Luck Chuck, but that should not impress anyone. You would almost have to be trying to make a worse comedy than those. It is like when people orgasm because gas prices fall a little, but they are still paying more than they should. People are becoming conditioned to bad comedy.<br/><br/>And, yes, there is a token ethnic guy."

Don't want to blame the producers/director of the film – they made their money I assume, but it was really awful, even the attempts to slapstick were horrible. All characters are empty jars, it is all quite predictable. Well, thats not unusual in a romantic comedy, but here it is just way too much. In the beginning there is shown the genitals of the main character 3 times - or maybe a dummy of them, and you are asking yourself: why the h... is that necessary? Is that supposed to be funny? The story dabbles on and on, he is left by her, he is a real lame duck, anyhow he manages to get a lot of quite beautiful women in his bed trying to forget his ex with sex - what never works out and what in the meantime is common knowledge to every hillbilly. Nothing will help, so he is going on vacation at a resort in Hawaii - and nice coincidence - accidentally his ex-girlfriend is in the same resort with her really dummy of a rock star-boyfriend and on and on ... horrible.

The acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. For a funny film I cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. Do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. Check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. Come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly."

","I don't get it. I'm SO tired of people telling me these ""Apatow"" movies are funny, then I rent them and they are TOTALLY lame. All of them. This is a prime example. This one is LITERALLY, ""The Emperors New Clothes."" Someone has no clothes= laugh riot. And I have nothing against raunchy humor, but this is just not funny. I appreciate that they tried to have characters, but where are the jokes? It plays like a meandering weak sitcom with occasional nude people and unfunny cursing substituting for laughs. And two hours long????? You've got to be kidding me. Brevity is often best with comedy, but not in the Apatow cannon. ""Knocked-Up,"" another disappointing snooze (that some critic compared""Annie Hall""-- Huh ????) is two hours and fifteen minutes!!!!!! I long for the days when Woody Allen's average length for a comedy was 86 minutes. Stop telling me this junk is funny! You want a funny, raunchy comedy? Rent, ""Animal House."""

","The movie is absolutely hilarious. I loved it. It met and exceeded by (very high) expectations. Jason Segall proved he can hold down a leading role and an extremely funny script. Part of the reason this movie is so funny are the ""funny 'cause it's true"" aspects of Peter's method of dealing with his breakup. Although the honeymooner's plot was a little unnecessary, everything else was great. All the characters were really funny and the dialogue and situations were hilarious. Definitely worth paying for to see in the theaters and watching it with everyone else around you busting out laughing as well is a worthy experience too."

","I thought this movie was really boring and monotoned. It was not funny at all. Mila Kunis was absolutely horrible at her acting. She was really annoying. Her voice was enough to drive someone nuts. I thought this movie had no plot what-so-ever. All there was that happened was lots of sobbing, lots of stalking, and idiocy. Garbage. It tried too hard to be funny. It was a complete waste of time. I thought that it made no sense at all. The ending was sloppy and random. it seem like they tried to rush the ending just to get it over with. I had no idea why and how he even got to send a letter to the girl! The beginning was super dull and showed no relationship value between peter or Sarah Marshall. The acting was super phony. I think that the only reason why it would have good reviews is because of all the excessive sexing and apparently Mila Kunis' tits.. which is not even a real picture of her.. its photo-shopped. so think before you even bother to watch this stupid movie."

","The reviews of this film were good, but not good enough to prevent me from waiting a year or so after its first appearance to rent it on DVD.<br/><br/>I should have waited until it hit Peachtree. What in the universe is happening to Hollywood comedy? Successful TV composer Peter is dumped by his live-in girlfriend, the even more successful TV actress Sarah Marshall. When the traumatized Peter goes to a Hawaiian resort to recover, he finds that Sarah is already there—worse yet, she is with her new boyfriend, the self-important rock star Aldous Snow. <br/><br/>This is where the film—up to this point not a bit funny—comes to a complete stop. Kind-hearted desk clerk Rachel—one sees this romance budding a mile away—takes pity on Peter and lets him have the hotel's best suite for free, enabling him to moon around after Sarah and her new love. Aldous, as it happens, isn't such a bad guy, but Peter resists all of his invitations to get to know him. <br/><br/>And there we sit. A half-hour into the film, there is an astonishing scene where Peter gets drunk in the hotel bar with the guy who plays Kenneth on ""30 Rock"" and a bartender who can name 200 local fish. Rachel enters. Next, Peter is playing piano by himself. <br/><br/>In these few minutes, all narrative stops. The film grinds to a halt. It is painful to watch, and in fact, the discerning viewer—by that I mean myself—at this point stops watching. <br/><br/>The how-to-write-a-great-screenplay teaching business is itself a multi-million dollar industry, but here we see deeply inept writing that has actually made it through what one assumes would be a rigorous vetting process to get to the screen. Although the critical reaction is equally amazing--how did this film get such good reviews?"

"jesse_olson","9","52","106","12 April 2008"," Surprisingly funny
","To be completely honest, I went into this movie expecting to thoroughly trash it as soon as I walked out. I thought it was destined to be another cheesy rom-com with a predictable ending and terrible acting. I was wrong. Little did I know, this was another Judd Apatow produced comedy, and almost everything he's touched over the past three years has turned into pure gold, including ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"". ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is no exception. <br/><br/>Jason Segal of ""How I Met your Mother"" fame, stars as a lovable but lazy music composer for a CSI-esque television drama. After his famous girlfriend (Kristen Bell) dumps him, he decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to deal with it. Little does he know, that his ex-girlfriend is travelling to the same resort as him – with her new overly-flamboyant musician boyfriend in tow (Russell Brand.) Mila Kunis (""That 70's Show"") plays a receptionist at the resort, and proves she can actually play a likable role. Kunis has great chemistry with Segal, and their budding relationship is surprisingly one of the highlights of the movie. <br/><br/>The script, which was also written by Segal, is consistently funny throughout, and really hones in on the hilarious one liners and awkward situational humor that seem to be the strength of most Apatow movies. Segal has definitely elevated himself into a solid comic lead. You can't help but feel bad for the guy as things gradually go from bad to worse for him. That said, Russell Brand, who plays eccentric musician Aldous Snow, steals every scene he's in. He plays a character in which the viewer is supposed to dislike, but it's virtually impossible. Everything he does, from his words, to his facial expressions, to his ridiculous body language, is hilarious. <br/><br/>Now I may only be high on this movie because I had exceptionally low expectations going in, but it's definitely a solid comedy from start to finish. With the exception of having to see Segal's junk at least six or seven times, it was a gem."
"barnabyrudge","5","13","22","23 November 2009"," Very mildly amusing comedy, mainly vulgar and predictable.
","I felt like a Scrooge-like miser while watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Around me in the cinema, people were slapping their thigh and roaring with laughter and wiping tears of mirth from their eye. I wanted to join them, really I did. but I just wasn't ""feeling"" it. The film amused me occasionally; frequently it didn't; and true laugh-out-loud moments could probably be counted on one hand. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very similar experience to watching a Bo Derek movie called ""10"" – it's a little risqué and rude; it's aimed squarely at a specific target audience; and it's not as funny as everyone involved would like you to think. Ten or fifteen years from now, I think this film will be largely forgotten.<br/><br/>TV and movie score composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segal) is dumped by his hot girlfriend, TV actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). He attempts a few relationships with other girls, but each time is more disastrous than the last. Eventually Peter is persuaded by his brother to go on vacation. He chooses Hawaii as there is a resort there which Sarah often spoke highly of. Upon arrival, Peter is shocked to discover that Sarah is taking a vacation there too with her new flame, narcissistic rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The situation looks like it's going to get out of hand until Peter befriends a pretty hotel receptionist named Rachel (Mila Kunis). Gradually he begins to develop feelings for Rachel and realises that there CAN be happiness after Sarah. He even reveals to Rachel his long-secret plan of creating a musical show based on Dracula, performed by a cast of puppets. But the course of true love is never smooth, and Peter suffers various calamities and misadventures before his fate in love is finally decided <br/><br/>Perhaps the chief strength of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is that it is romantic comedy for guys AND girls. There is a certain raunchy, vulgar flavour to the proceedings which tries to tap in to the notion of a ""male sense of humour"". Anyone thinking they're about to watch a chick flick will quickly realise this is not so. The performances are broadly what you would expect – Segal is amusing, the girls are pretty but shallow, and Russell Brand basically plays himself. The Hawaiian locations provide a lush backdrop. There are flashes of male and female nudity, none of them particularly gratuitous but none of them all that necessary either. In the script department, the story proceeds in a fairly predictable manner, with clichéd characters and comic situations which could have been lifted from any TV sitcom. At 110 minutes (or 117 minutes if you're watching the extended version), the film is around ten or fifteen minutes longer than it ought to be, but it doesn't tax the patience to excessive levels. An easy, lazy watch overall but not particularly worthy of the adulation that has been heaped upon it."

"ReleaseTheClarken","9","48","103","13 April 2008"," Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the best comedy of the year so far, and maybe the best movie, period.
","I just went to an advance screening of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and it is just as funny as 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. Jason Segel has crafted a screenplay that could have easily disintegrated into an over-the-top, unbelievable, and lowbrow comedy. Instead, all of its characters are believable and, more importantly, we really care about them and their feelings. <br/><br/>If you cant tell from the other Apatow & Crew movies, these guys can act with the best of them. If there has ever been a time for the Academy Awards to start acknowledging comedies as just as good as Dramas, it is now, in the time of Apatow. Yes the comedy is as filthy as ever, but the acting is just as good as almost any drama out there. I would even say that comedy is harder than Drama in that it is incredibly hard to craft characters that you feel for and believe while still being funny. Apatow and his friends are the kings of it. It was evident in ""Freaks and Geeks"" and it has only gotten better now. <br/><br/>Jason Segel is great and you feel for his character immensely. Kristen Bell plays her part as the heartbreaker ex-girlfriend pitch perfectly. At times her character, without giving too much away, is semi-tragic. Mila Kunis completely makes us forget about her days as the dumb hottie on ""That 70's Show"" and makes us fall in love with her character along with Peter. Russell Brand has the toughest job playing the ridiculous parody of a British rocker. At times he is a bit over-the-top but he gets some of the biggest laughs in the movie while retaining a bit of believability. <br/><br/>The supporting characters are just as good as they have been in every other Apatow movie. Bill Hader, while I liked him more in Superbad, gets some big laughs as the brother who wants Peter to get over Sarah. Jonah Hill gets some huge laughs as the hotel employee who has a man crush on the British rocker. Paul Rudd is one of the best comic minds of our time and he is as funny as ever as Chuck/Kunu the hotel's surf instructor. <br/><br/>The writing and directing are both top-notch as well.<br/><br/>If there is anything bad I can say about it, is that some of the editing jumps around suddenly and sometimes some scenes seem a bit out of place. Also there is a scene where a boom gets in the shot. There are a few continuity issues (towels on shoulders disappearing and drinks in and out of peoples hands) but those are to be expected. <br/><br/>Do not miss this movie it is the best movie so far this year!!!"

","By Bryce VanKooten <br/><br/>The night was quiet, the bold spring sunset had faded from existence and most of us (the chosen few) were freshly done with our final papers, save one man. In that fanciful moment of slow and steady disregard for anything related to planning, an infamous quote was born. While contemplating whether or not to end his spree of embraced laziness that had plagued his journey thus far, one of my college dorm-mate eloquently revealed, ""The key to writing a great paper is hiding poor ideas behind great structure."" It was not until today that I fully realized the truth of those his words. Today I find myself intrigued at that statement and amazed that others, even a team of professionals, have yet to figure it out.<br/><br/>Last night I lost just under two hours of my life. Not to sleep (which I would have traded ten times over), but to a movie entitled, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. As I entered the theater, I was convinced that sitting in the front row would not ruin my experience, that despite my carnal intuition, this movie could not have more needless sex than Jud Apatow's previous films (40 Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, etc). I had been invited for free, how super-bad could it get? Regrettably, only worse from there.<br/><br/>For my sanity (I couldn't be more serious), I'm going to skip over the first half. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because after the remainder, I wanted to donkey punch the crew. There are not words to express the angst and pain i felt for the final 4,500 minutes of this nightmare, although 'angst' and 'pain' seem to work nicely, for now.<br/><br/>For pity's sake, I'll give you the high points...<br/><br/>Okay, that's about it. Now for the the low points.<br/><br/>Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) is busted up pretty bad after his girlfriend and budding TV star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) breaks up with him (he's naked and I can't emphasize enough how not funny this is every time). To reboot, he takes a trip to Hawaii where he meets a fresh-and-fun-brunette-hotel-clerk Rachael (Mila Kunis aka; Family Guy's Meg Griffith), but turns around only moments later to see his newly departed girlfriend has arrived with her new 60's-inspired, rock-star boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russel Brand). Got it? Shenanigans ensue and much 'awkwerdity' is had, all thanks to the seemingly fail-safe-for-a-laugh waiter/hotel helper/Aldous stalker, played by Jonah Hill. The movie consists of jealousy, seduction and a little surfing with the help of a familiar-faced, completely strung out surf instructor, Paul Rudd. After Peter becomes jealous of Sarah and Sarah turning out to be jealous of Peter (what a twist!), the movie ventures into the unknown, never again to let you see the light of day, unless its inside their underwear. Yada, yada, yada, Aldous Snow is funny and the movie continues on -- terrible script in hand, an even worse storyline and (quite literally) one of the most distasteful and incredibly unfunny movies I've seen in the past decade.<br/><br/>I'm guessing, by the end of the film, we're supposed to like Peter Bretter (or at least feel sorry for himwhich we didn't), but in a comedic sense, how can you like, or give any emotion to someone that doesn't entertain you? I suppose he entertained me when he took the lengthy banana out of his Margarita Smoothie and muttered, ""Whoa, look at this guy"" -- that was funny. But outside of the few moments when he was perfectly drunk, it was plain torturous.<br/><br/>It's a pretty simple fact: this movie is tragically made. To call this movie 'amusing' or 'entertaining' without qualification would be like calling an STD necessary. This movie was a complete waste of time and an utter disaster for everyone involved, especially the writer. The movie went nowhere, showed we the viewer nothing and left me saying, 'I fully realize that I have to take a shower when I get home, but I don't even want to look in the mirror'. I'm sorry if you've seen this movie already. I'm not sorry that you now understand what I'm trying to say, but I do apologize that I couldn't have stopped you sooner. My apologies for not being able to grab Andy three years ago, given him a Flux Capacitor and a megaphone and told him to scream his line at the top of his lungs all the way to 2008. All horribly raunchy, 40 Year-Old Virgin had a story, Anchorman remains a recent classic and Superbad was, wellfunny. Plainly speaking, I hope Forgetting Sarah Marshall will be soon forgotten (oh, that was too easy). And judging by the way The Forbidden Kingdom preformed this weekend, Forgetting Sarah Marshall may not be all it was knocked up to be."

Find something else to watch and don't trust the inflated ratings on IMDb. And this minimum review length is lame. How long do you need to read that i thought this movie sucks monkey butts?

","It's no surprise that this film pretty much divides opinion between the young and not-so-young (according to the user ratings) and, to a lesser extent, between women and men. You'd expect it to be a chick flick rom-com (if you forgot that Judd Apatow was involved) but, with its irreverent gross-out comedy and stock of hot females, it's no wonder that it appeals to young men.<br/><br/>Jason Segel stars as Peter, a musician who finds himself dumped by his TV star girlfriend. On the advice of his slightly nerdy friend, Peter decides to fly to Hawaii to forget her, but guess what? She's only there! At the same hotel! Who'd have thought it? Unfortunately, she's there with the man she dumped Peter for, a hairy rock star played by the witless Russell Brand. This being a product of La-La land, it's absolutely impossible for either party to consider changing hotels, so the hapless Peter runs into his ex and her new man everywhere he goes. Luckily for him there's a luscious receptionist on hand to help soothe his pain <br/><br/>The film's amiable enough, but it struggles to find many laughs in such a clichéd situation. Many scenes and situations seem to have been created for no apparent reason: a sub-plot involving a dorky pair of newlyweds goes nowhere and is abruptly dropped, leaving you to wonder why it was included in the first place; Pete's ex's TV programme is dropped while she's on holiday but, after a brief conversation, is also forgotten. Apparently the story is based on the writer's own break up from an actress, so maybe there's some kind of catharsis going on here, but that doesn't excuse a plot that is more merely a collection of incidents than a properly constructed narrative.<br/><br/>Jason Segel makes a likable leading man, although, like most of us, he looks immeasurably better in his clothes than out of them. He just about manages to get the audience on his side, even though his character would no doubt be something of a nightmare to live with and he would be lucky to maintain a meaningful relationship with a woman for five months let alone five years. Kristen Bell as his errant girlfriend looks yummy, but her character is poorly written. Is she a heartless cow, confused, or simply at the end of her tether? Whatever she is, the script treats her with something approaching contempt much of the time. Mila Kunis, as Segel's true love outshines Bell in every department (can she really be the voice of Meg in Family Guy?), but again her character lacks consistency. Russell Brand manages to be marginally less annoying then he normally is, which is probably the biggest compliment he'll ever receive from me.<br/><br/>This isn't a great film by any measure, but its popularity will probably prove enduring enough to ensure it's shown every other day on some second-tier satellite channel."

(Congrats to Jason Segel for having the guts to do so much frontal nudity. The ""dump"" scene just wouldn't have had the same effect without it!) <br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away but, believe me, our hero's predicament doesn't improve at all afterwards either. My wife's comment was best, I think. She said, ""I don't know whether to fall on the floor laughing or cry for that poor guy."" The film manages to make you feel sorry for the guy while laughing your head off at the same time. The film certainly doesn't shy away from adult humor but it is used intelligently -- the film is not just dirty for the sake of being dirty.<br/><br/>This is one film my wife and I will be buying immediately when it hits DVD."

I think writing reviews should be work of pro and amateur film-making related people. So i am not one of them but i tell you i have been raised on Hollywood movies since 12. So i do hold a right to show wrath of my dis-likeness towards a lousy, devastating, lame and pathetic called 'romantic-comedy' movie.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Jason Segel from his How I Met Your Mother days. He was so great in that. Even i am a practically a atheist but i think he's really that gifted when i see him in HIMYM. But hey this is a movie, another script, another thing, so i gotta leave the old Jason there. After watching this movie i only thought one thing why did he wrote this script ? why ? it was the worse night of my whole life.

You ask me what i like than, the day before this movie, i watched Woody Allen's Manhattan and i enjoyed every every piece of , second of that movie. Every joke and everything, the flow of the movie but that's another story.<br/><br/>I also have watched like thousands of Hollywood movies including hundreds of comedy romance ones.

Well, to make a long story short, it turned out exactly the way anyone could have expected despite there being a hint that it might go in a different direction.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't think it's fair or important to really judge the acting performances in this movie because the film I watched before this was The Assassination of Richard Nixon in which the acting was top notch while this peaked at about par for an episode of That 70s show. But what really did bother me was how implausible this whole situation would have been if Peter was an everyman instead of a fairly talented musician with a bit of celebrity status. Segel's personality was not very charming nor could he be physically attractive to beautiful women like Sarah or Rachel unless he had that going for him - and I thought the romance between Scotty and Judy in Vertigo was far fetched because of their huge age difference which now seems reasonable compared. This also had a lot to do with the inadequate development and poor script but put Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn or Luke Wilson in Segel's place and it would be a lot more convincing even playing a relatable regular guy as they did in their movies. I don't know, maybe that was the intention here but I didn't like it.<br/><br/>So those are my three biggest complaints of this truly overrated and just plain bad movie I really wanted to like, so take it for what it's worth. Judging by the amount of laughter, I know many more people at the theater enjoyed it more than I did but I'd be surprised if anybody would say it was that great judging by the long pauses between the few collective laughs. In conclusion, I don't recommend even wasting your time watching the DVD if you have any taste."

","This is a guys take on the romance genre. Peter gets dumped by Sarah, his long time girlfriend. She is an actress on a knock-off CSI show. He is the composer for the same show. Seems she had been having an affair with a rock god named Aldous Snow. Peter enters a deep state of depression. On a whim, and heavily suggested by his brother, Peter flies to Hawaii for a vacation. There he meets Rachel, a beautiful young lady, played by the unequaled Mila Kunis. Side not, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous as they happen to be on vacation at the same hotel. I know! Peter starts to develop feelings for Rachel and Sarah does not make this easy. There is a whole lot of hilarity thrown in. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as well in the small role afforded him here. This is a movie that I watch at least once a year, or when I am feeling really down, because it is that funny and good."

","Blechhhh, I really hated this movie. I love Jason on How I Met Your Mother and I so wanted to like this movie. It just didn't happen for me.<br/><br/>It was laden with base humor (heavy on the base, light on the humor). I so miss movies where there is actually humor instead of relying on nudity, sexually positions and/or drugs for cheap punchlines.<br/><br/>I did think Mila Kunis was beautiful & adorable, however. She was a bright glimmer for me in this movie. Russell Brand had his moments, as well. The only thing that brought a brief smile to my face was when he was describing the horrible cell phone killer movie that Sarah made last.<br/><br/>It seemed the laughter (and little of it) in the theater I was in were mostly men. 2 couples (male/female) behind me that came together and appeared to be 20 somethings, were split. One couple laughed at everything, the other couple at nothing.<br/><br/>Sorry, Jason, I thought it was horrible. All it was missing for me was Will Ferrell to round it out & make it possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>What a disappointment. :("
"tom-456","2","22","47","25 April 2008"," One of the very worst, least funny movies that I've ever seen
","This is without doubt one of the worst and least funny movies that I've ever seen. I have nothing against nudity, male or female, and one of my favorite comedies of all time is the original Harold and Kumar (White Castle), and I mention that just to give you some background. Now that I done that, let me first say that there is nothing whatsoever funny about a penis. If a penis was intrinsically funny, men in locker rooms would all be laughing their heads off. I've been in plenty of locker rooms where there is plenty of penis to be seen, but I've never once seen anyone laughing about it. There just isn't anything funny about a penis. What I've written here is probably ten times as funny as anything in this non-funny movie.<br/><br/>The story is just lame, and is not meaningfully distinct from any one of several similar movies that have been made over the past twenty-five years, most of them being a whole lot funnier than this.<br/><br/>The real test of whether a movie is really funny, is whether the people in the theater are genuinely laughing, or whether a handful of mentally deranged people are letting out the occasional loud shriek every time that someone in the movie says a dirty word. I have nothing against dirty words when they are used in a way that is truly funny, but a dirty word in and of itself is just not funny, any more than a penis in and of itself would be funny.<br/><br/>The first really funny thing in this movie, that made me laugh at all, was just after an hour into the movie, when Peter finally stood up on his surfboard and then something unexpected happened. There was another moderately funny scene shortly after that, when Peter and Sarah were both trying to be as loud as possible while doing it, so that the other one, on the opposite side of the wall, would hear them and be jealous. But that wasn't really all that funny, and this is hardly the first time that I've seen this very joke. Those were the only two moderately funny moments in the entire movie.<br/><br/>I hate movies that are supposed to be funny but that obviously are not, as evidenced by that occasional loud, forced laugh that the same three or four people down toward the front of the theater let go of once every few minutes, usually when there isn't anything that is the least bit funny, unless of course you think that the sight of a penis is funny, or you think that anything that you would not say or want anyone else to say in front of your mother is funny.<br/><br/>This movie is just bad. It isn't the least bit funny. It is just a bad movie. It was a complete waste of time and money. I would not even recommend it for the cost of a DVD rental. The only thing that I can't understand is how on earth this horrible, forgettable movie garnered an 8.2 viewer rating on IMDb. I just can't believe that that many people are that retarded to find anything funny in this movie.<br/><br/>I will never again put any credence in an IMDb viewer rating. The movie that I intend to see next is ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"". I need something to remind me that I really don't have a problem with humor that is in questionable taste, as long as it really is funny. Hey, I even liked Borat. In fact, Borat was hilarious. But this movie was not in the least bit funny. It is a truly forgettable piece of junk."

","A relatively minor Apatow clan release, released in April without the sort of promotion and attention ""Knocked Up"", ""Superbad"", ""Pineapple Express"", etc. received, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a pleasant surprise, a consistently entertaining romantic comedy with several scenes of effective and realistic character-oriented drama.<br/><br/>The film was written by star Jason Segel, who based much of the film on his relationship and breakup with ""Freaks and Geeks"" co-star Linda Cardellini. For a debut screenplay Segel's work is surprisingly strong as he clearly understands where and how to inject just enough dramatic realism into this comedy script. As with most comedies there are naturally several jokes which fall flat, but most of the humor is sharp and effective. Segel even managed to write a good part for annoying nitwit Russell Brand, granted the character is an... annoying nitwit, but a well-written one. Segel's screenplay succeeds mostly as a result of him being able to develop a cast of entertaining and interesting characters whose conversations feel genuine and are never boring.<br/><br/>Director Nicholas Stoller handles the film very well, using the Hawaiian locations to optimal effect and keeping the film moving at a fast pace. The cast is incredible, Mila Kunis in particular is a revelation and anyone used to her from ""That 70's Show"" will be shocked but extremely taken by the depth and range of her performance. Kristen Bell is also much better than expected, and Segel is essentially playing himself yet again. He's good at playing himself.<br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" isn't perfect and several scenes just plain fall flat, but the end result is still an effective and involving romantic comedy/drama that marks a promising writing debut for Jason Segel.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Completely formulaic steaming pile of dog crap. In addition, Jason Segel (who wrote the crappy script) is a terrible lead actor. This dude seems to copy Chandler from ""Friends"" in every role he is in. He also decided to show his dick 3 times in order to get some shock appeal laughs. This can sometimes work, except it better be in the right situation. In ""Sarah Marshall,"" it just comes off as an extremely contrived way to get laughs.<br/><br/>This is a chick flick in every way imaginable, so I can see how females may have a different opinion than I.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities: Kristen Bell is SMOKIN hot, Mila Kunis is pretty hot, and Russel Brand as Alduos Snow in the 2nd half of the movie is actually pretty damn funny. However, none of this will allow me to give this trash above a 1 star. Thats how lame the rest of the movie is."

In hindsight, I try to think of one funny moment in this movie and I honestly can't. Well then; the story line must be good and/or entertaining... nope, not at all. The 2 main characters are undeveloped and unlikeable as well. The main character Peter (Jason Segel) is really good in I love you man, so it was obviously the directer and the story line that sucked. Mila Kunis (Rachel) has some like-ability. I also like the Aldous Snow character, but that can't even come close to making up for this pathetic excuse for a movie. It's not only humorless, but approx 3/4 of this movie are uncomfortable to watch and at no point are they situations that are uncomfortable in a funny way. I don't always dock a movie because of predictability, but from the moment Peter get's to his vacation destination, you know exactly how this movie will play out. Some things in life are unexplainable; for example, the Pyramids and how people got tricked into liking this movie. It's uncompromisable & mind boggling!

The description also describes sitting through this film which is being hailed as the first male romantic comedy. It's a step in unchartered terrain, sure enough when it comes to the clichés that abound in this dreadful film: minorities are delegated to working behind the bar tending or being your waiter at the morning buffet service or to getting humped by the lead in an improbable scene early on. Improbable is the main ingredient in this dud. Peter gets dumped AND winds up in Hawaii at the same expensive resort as Sarah Marshall (the dumper), AND he stays in a $6000/a night suite FOR FREE!

This film is an example of how the industry has become less about ""talent"" and all about who you know... in this case Segel knows Aptow and hence... a dreadful film. It took an hour and a half for a genuine scene to come on the screen. When Sarah explains to Peter why she dumped him it really rang true, but then we're back to more of the same dreck from the first hour and a half.

","What can sometimes redeem a movie that does not necessarily need a craftily inventive plot or a believable story are characters that are memorable for their bizarrely idiosyncratic humor such as characters from some of the other Judd Apatow movies such as McLovin from Superbad (which actually contained a really compelling story) or the characters in Knocked Up. The plastic characters created in this movie were such mundane clichés, lacking personalities and so unmemorably unfunny that they fail to redeem this unrealistic, poorly conjured story.<br/><br/>The main character goes away and happens to find his ex girlfriend randomly in the same hotel in the same spot he decided to travel to. Then there are some love triangles, they both get jealous and feel bad, it just gets ridiculous and uninteresting to the point where you will ignore the story. It is true, we do not go to see these type of movies for the compelling story lines. We go to laugh. The forced raunchy humor has been done in other movies in a more over the top and intelligent way. The humor just wasn't there. One of the biggest laughs and the only innovative scene comes from showing the main characters crown jewels and gratuitously showing them again and again as his girlfriend breaks up with him. It was stupid, it didn't shock, it wasn't funny, i just didn't care. This movie may be comparable to some of those dull forgettable romantic comedies. They, however, actually have some heart and poignancy. This has none.<br/><br/>The movie is memorable for having the worst sex scenes on film. The scenes were meant to be funny but they just seemed stupid.<br/><br/>For all these reasons the movie was an absolute bore to watch. It wasn't that shocking, the humor was done before and was much better, and the story was absolutely terrible. Not the worst movie because it did contain a few forced laughs."

Jason Segel wrote and acted as Peter, a composer, who breaks up with Sarah Marshall, a television crime drama star. To get over it, he goes to Hawaii where Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand) also vacation. What are the odds that they would end up in the same resort? A great cast makes the film worthwhile. I enjoyed seeing Kristin Wiig, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and others. If it doesn't make you want to go to Hawai, nothing will.

"Cinema_Fan","2","18","41","25 April 2008"," Hey, why? Eh!
","Forgiving, for a moment, that this is Mr. Nicholas Stoller's first attempt at directing, we can say, with all honesty, that this attempt is also as easily forgettable. With Jason Segel who on par with Vince Vaughn as to total charisma by-pass, this laid out road map of a movie is at least amusing to the extremes of bewilderment as to ask what was the point? Set in the lush location of Hawaii, this beautiful island is more looking like the flotsam and jetsam of bad scripts, limited efforts' and a weak plot to the point of sheer tedium. <br/><br/>There is a level of predictability in, certain, movies that when having crossed a certain level, usually the lowest, then turns any movie into outright worthlessness, Forgetting Sarah Marshall falls snugly into this description, too. Predictability, here, is the name of the game, added with the dull, and more than often, painful dialogue, this all to obvious direction throughout is seen as lazy or just plain unimaginative. <br/><br/>With little attempt to convey any higher ground of thought to the narrative, this stance leaves nothing but an open road with no turns, twists, slip roads and bends to excite and planning this journey can be so easily done with ones eyes closed, such is the obvious horizons' that this film projects.<br/><br/>Then, apart from the shady editing, being choppy at best, in other places very poor, in particular during the conversation between Aldous Snow and Matthew the Waiter and the demo disc. There is too the gags; simple, cold and listless, with comedy it needs a character, a character with persona, wit and timing, this lifeless, dull and time wasting exercise deals no punches and only solidifies itself in a similar vain to a petrified forest. The only redeeming artifice here is the wit of one Russell Brand, who seems to have the best lines here too, and with this self loving man of free love, and too, the newly-weds of desperation, is the films only real redemption. It really is a pity that this characterisation was not carried off to other members of the cast, otherwise, this may have faired well in the road to recovery, instead it is well worth remembering that it only takes a slight wrong turn and very quickly ends up looking like road kill."

I was expecting something similar from FSM but was hugely disappointed. The film is very slow paced and although I summoned a small smirk here and there, rather than funny the comedy just seemed forced and the characters were just not likable or real.<br/><br/>The only reason to see this film is if you really like Russell Brand who was the only person remotely funny or entertaining and Kristen Bell really looked hot in a bikini.

Christy Lemire, by her opinion of the movie, seemingly falls into this gullible, naive category. She loved it. It is boring humor. They had the name wrong. It should've been ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Remembering Lots of Penis"". Amazingly, a woman sat in front of me with a 12, maybe 14-year old girl who got to watch some fairly aggressive porn. The movie itself, from concept, screenplay and development through it's opening day, national showing, ""Forgetting"" is 'sixth grade' mentality. Promise. Go see just about anything besides this. Oh yeah, there's plenty of breasts in it too. Even if you don't care about a story at all and just want to see the lead's penis and also breasts, still go see something else. That's how pap it is.

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall chronicles the misadventures of Peter Bretter, a musician who composes music scores for TV shows. He works on a show called 'Crime Scene' (which is a satiric takeoff on shows like 'CSI'). The star of the show is a cute blonde named Sarah Marshall, who Peter has been dating for about five years. Sarah shows up one day at his apartment and announces that she's dating a rock star and their relationship is over. From the outset one wonders what Sarah sees in Peter. His apartment is a pigsty, he hates his job and it seems that his muse to create a great musical theater piece has completely left him.<br/><br/>Peter has a stepbrother, Brian, who encourages him to start dating other women (Brian and his wife periodically pop up later in the film via a computer video link but the comic possibilities between Peter and his nutty stepbrother are never developed). Peter still can't get Sarah out of his mind so he decides to take a trip to Hawaii where Sarah liked to vacation. When he arrives at the resort hotel without a reservation, a cute brunette working at the front desk, Rachel, takes a liking to him and lets him stay at their most expensive suite for free. Meanwhile, Peter, discovers to his horror that Sarah is staying at the same hotel with her New-Age, rock star boyfriend.<br/><br/>The first half of 'Act 2' focuses on Peter's inability to stop obsessing over the breakup of his relationship with Sarah. The main bit is Peter continually breaking down and crying whenever memories of Sarah pop up in his mind. In one particularly unfunny scene, Peter gets a call from Rachel from the front desk asking whether he can hear a woman crying in an adjacent room; of course it's Peter who's the one who's been bawling the whole time! Meanwhile, Sarah's boyfriend, Aldous Snow is an affable Brit who's avoided drinking for seven years. He invites Peter to dinner but Peter can't face Sarah with the thought that she's with someone else.<br/><br/>At the midpoint, Peter attempts to 'forget' Sarah Marshall. He goes out on a date with Rachel who turns out to have a shady ex-boyfriend who ends up punching Peter in the face. Despite her attraction to bad boys in the past, she finds the goofy Peter amusing and attractive. Peter receives encouragement from various comic types who work at the hotel or hang out at the beach. A loony surfer instructor teaches Peter how to surf but he clumsily ends up colliding with Aldous while surfing and is knocked out cold.<br/><br/>Peter's relationship with Rachel remains platonic. Soon Sarah is finding out that Aldous is no great catch. He announces he's going on tour and might have herpes. Before you know it, he breaks his vow of abstinence and crudely brags of sexual conquests with other women while drunk. Sarah is no longer ""into"" the boyfriend and wants to start things up with Peter again. They have a brief sexual encounter but Peter realizes he's smitten with Rachel. He confesses to her of his brief fling with Sarah to prove his 'honesty' but Rachel takes it in the wrong way and rejects him. In a last moment of desperation, he tries to prove his love to her by tearing off a topless picture of Rachel pinned on the wall of a bathroom at a local club, only to be mercilessly beaten by the bartender-owner who considers the picture his property and domain.<br/><br/>The beating appears to wake Peter up. He goes home and starts exercising and his muse returns. He's now composing a puppet musical about Dracula. In the best scene of the film, Peter puts his comic musical on before an appreciative audience. One wonders why the Dracula musical couldn't have been developed more and featured as a main part of the plot. Rachel ends up coming to see the musical and they end up reconciling.<br/><br/>Describing the plot of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is difficult precisely because it's so disjointed. One searches in vain for a story arc that builds to a satisfying conclusion. Rather 'Marshall' feels like a series of skits thrown together that for the most part do not pay off. And when Peter, our lovable loser hero, finally redeems himself and turns into a 'mensch' at the climax, we've spent much too much time with him as a surly 'loser'; the transformation into a good guy is undeserved as he is basically quite misanthropic until the last 15 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall could have been a much better comedy. There was the potential for satire, particularly in the CSI takeoffs at the beginning and end of the film that were never developed into something really clever. The same goes for the aforementioned puppet show (the most original moment in the film). Finally, the idea that Sarah would pathetically try and rekindle her romance with Peter after everything he put her through left me feeling unsatisfied. Despite Peter's positive transformation at the end, somehow I would have liked to have seen Sarah go off on her own without feeling the need to hook back up with an ex-boyfriend who treated her so poorly during most of their relationship."

","I remember reading that Forgetting Sarah Marshall was supposed to come out in the summer under the even less imaginative title of Dumped, but they pushed up the release date after lackluster early screenings to avoid it from getting murdered at the box office. Since it's been billed as a ""romantic disaster movie,"" a better title for it might have been The Mangina Syndrome.<br/><br/>Jason Segel plays Peter Bretter, the world's biggest p***y. Sarah Marshall, a made-for-TV actress, dumps him and he cries and cries and cries. When he goes to Hawaii to clear his head, he runs into Sarah and her obnoxious rock star boyfriend, and he runs into them over and over again. Then, he cries some more. A free-spirited young womanwho (as the cliché goes) happens to be better looking than the famous ex-girlfriend even though she is only a hotel conciergeslowly brings Peter out of his shell. He also mingles with the hotel staff and guests, and they are expectedly quirky characters: the comic fatso, the wisecracking doper, the stuffy Christian etc.<br/><br/>Because the writing is not exactly what you would call ""witty"" or ""illuminating,"" the movie needs to be outrageous to be funny and sustain interest, but genuinely over-the-top moments are too scattered over the 112-minute running time. If you're college-aged or older, the rest of the misnamed ""adult"" humor and dialogue should seem very played-out to you. While the main love triangle is being self-consciously telegraphed, the story is padded out with some disconnected tangents involving the supporting characters and these are only mildly amusing.<br/><br/>Three of the main characters work in entertainment so we get some backstage digs at showbiz, including parody segments and musical numbers. These are the same as anything you could see on ""Mad TV."" It would also be easier to swallow these jabs at assembly-line Hollywood products if they weren't taking place during the course of a predictable romantic comedy. A send-up of ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" might've been funny 4 or 5 years ago, which makes you think the script has been sitting on a shelf somewhere.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is adequate. He's like Jason Biggs. Not that good, not that bad. And you don't care about him either way. I'd never heard of Russell Brand before, but he's good as the new boyfriend. Though, I'm not sure what era his character was supposed to be from. He doesn't resemble any of today's popular artists and looks more at home on a VH1 reality show for 80's wash-outs. Paul Rudd should be able to play his character in his sleep by now and it looked a few times during the movie as though he did. Mila Kunis is very loose and charming in front of the camera. Kristen Bell gives a mannered performance, though it's not as forced as her acting on ""Heroes.""<br/><br/>Basically, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a paper-thin excuse for some new gross-out gags and slapstick, but it doesn't even deliver on that promise. If you want to see a gross-out comedy, you probably won't be satisfied. If you want to see a romcom, it adds nothing to an already bloated genre."
"tavm","9","11","24","21 April 2008"," Forgetting Sarah Marshall was another entertaining Judd Apatow comedy
","Having been involved in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I think it's about time to call Judd Apatow the John Hughes of this generation. With a script by star Jason Segel and players like Jack McBrayer, Russell Brand, Apatow regulars Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and leading ladies Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis, Apatow has once again tapped into the public's taste for the raunchy and the romantic to a uniquely captivating effect. Seeing Segel's breakup with Bell while performing full-frontal was a bravely hilarious dare on his part. Seeing McBrayer's strained attempts at satisfying his newlywed other are some of plenty of other highlights for me. One of my favorite scenes comes near the end when we see the results of the ""Dracula"" puppet musical Segal's character created that looked entertaining enough for me to want to see in real life! The heart, laughs, and the painfully realistic depictions of relationships as enacted here provide a wonderful mix that makes this one of the most entertaining comedies I've seen at the movies so far this year. So with all that said, I highly recommend Forgetting Sarah Marshall."

","Freaks and Geeks is probably my favorite TV series of all time, but when I watch movies like this I feel like a freak -- why does everyone think this is so great while I'm cringing and wanting to leave? This thing needed so much rewriting! It felt like a very first draft. I came away thinking that Jason Segel just didn't want to leave his buddies Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd et al, on the cutting room floor. But, alas, he should have.<br/><br/>Because what he ended up with is a movie chock full of awkward scenes and overwrought stereotypes -- the stoned surfer dude, the hen-pecked husband, the religious guy with the horny wife, the massive-but-sensitive Hawaiian guy. (Oddly the one character that could have been the biggest stereotype of all wasn't -- Aldous Snow. He was also the best thing in the movie by far.)<br/><br/>Oh, and one last curmudgeonly rant. The scene in which Rachel gives him the 6k/night room for free. I find this technique so insulting in movies. Either take the time to write a scenario that is likely to happen (6k/night room for free I don't think so) or just have it happen and let us suspend disbelief.

Wow, for the person who said this film would not soon be forgotten, he/she's right. I've never wanted to walk out of a film within the first ten minutes, and that is something I should never forget. But I'm committed to giving films a chance by staying through the whole thing. Oh, I wish I could have my time back.<br/><br/>For anyone who leaves this film thinking it has a great message, reconsider. Though it seems that some characters are upholding strong moral values, it seems that way only because they are in contrast to how extremely terrible the others are.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of the stereotyped characters the writers threw together: A character who believes he has the right to have sex with anything he meets, a character who cheats to get away from a relationship and in the end wants her old relationship back, a character who is supposedly the hero who has sex with one woman and ends up in a compromising situation (her mouth wrapped around you know what trying to stimulate him) with his ex-girlfriend the very next night, the more sane of the morally translucent individuals has sex with the hero after only a few days of getting to know him. And the message the writers crafted about the couple who got married before they had sex was that sex is the reason to get married. The groom felt so much anxiety for not being able to perform in bed that he already felt his marriage was rocky.<br/><br/>Movies like this lead to the degradation of the family unit, cause lost committed values within relationships, and promote sexual promiscuity which spreads STIs.<br/><br/>What a great society to build your personal foundations on! /*sarcasm*/<br/><br/>I did not laugh at or with this movie; more so, I was constantly offended by cheap-rate jokes built by making the audience so uncomfortable they have no escape but to laugh. That is not comedy. It's awkward and shows the writers selling out. By the way, I did not laugh and I already mentioned that, but I'll mention it again.<br/><br/>Way to go filmmakers, you'll get your $$$! But you will never have my respect."

"commandercool88","9","8","18","7 July 2008"," Another winner from Team Apatow.
","'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is almost certainly another classic straight from Apatow's seal of approval. It's brilliant. Gold, yet again. It takes another familiar formula, but 'Sarah Marshall' pulls it off like few could ever dream of. Laugh-out-loud funny, incredibly raunchy, but with a great story to be told. This is a must-see, and I doubt there will be a funnier film this year.<br/><br/>Apatow's acting troupe are clearly set for life. Whether it's a starring role or a small supporting appearance, Apatow has never faltered to remain faithful to his 'family', many of whom have been with him since the short-lived 'Freaks and Geeks'. And this time around, it's Jason Segel who gets the opportunity to showcase his talents by writing and starring in his own vehicle. Segel has absolutely no problems carrying 'Sarah Marshall', and no about qualms baring all. Literally. Segel pushes the envelope for what's allowed in an R-rating, and it's truly unforgettable. Segel, you've got nothing to be shy about.<br/><br/>Apatow, who produces 'Sarah Marshall', continues to set the bar for the sex comedy. Like 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Knocked Up', and 'Superbad', 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' continues to restore the genre to glory by delivering nearly two hours of sustained laughter. It isn't afraid to knock down barriers rarely explored in film, and it's why these films continue to be so fresh and so enjoyable. It takes the basic ingredients and runs with it to new heights. To all those in the Apatow posse, don't stop doing your thing. Please.<br/><br/>Forgetting 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' will be a tough thing to do. A great film, from its penis-flopping beginning to a Dracula musical. What more could you ask for? You won't forget it anytime soon, and why would you want to? With a star-studded cast and near flawless execution, 'Sarah Marshall' is every bit as good as anything we've seen from Apatow in the past, and once again delivers something you do not want to miss. Like the film says, ""God put our mouths on our heads for a reason."" Well... maybe that means something else entirely, but our mouths do get quite a workout.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"Chris Knipp","7","8","18","20 April 2008"," Schlubby meets louche
","The Judd Apatow comedy machine has ground out another one. It's middling, not as sharp and on target as 41 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, or Superbad, but not as tiresome and lame as Dewey Cox and Drillbit Taylor. Again, the--for Apatow--seminal TV series ""Freaks and Geeks"" gets mined. (First-time director Stoller has co-authored some things with Apatow.) ""Freaks"" alumnus Jason Segel wrote and stars as TV composer Peter Bretter, dumped by girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter does the ""music"" (mostly just ominous sounds) for a sleazy crime series featuring Sarah. She's taken up with decadent (but clean and sober) English rock star Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, an outrageous Brit comic whose real life junkie confessions are a hoot. Brand takes us away from Apatow's limited world of fat Jewish boys trying to get laid with hot chicks. His Aldous Snow is a sleazy sex god and recovery guru and when he's on screen, things take a welcome new turn toward wit and absurdity.<br/><br/>But that comes briefly, and later. We begin in Hollywood, where Sarah comes to see the couch potato Peter, who refuses to put on clothes to hear her breaking up speech. Despondent, Peter follows advice from his brother Brian (Bill Hader of Knocked Up and Superbad) and goes to Hawaii, where his waiter is Apatow warhorse Jonah Hill and his reefer-addled surf instructor is ""Friends"" and Apatow alum Paul Rudd. Who should be at Peter's hotel but Sarah and Aldous? With the questionable linchpin of this lame ""surprise,"" comedy, heartbreak, and resolution ensue.<br/><br/>There are no jaw-breaking laughs. In fact the only things that kept me watching were the appeal of Segel--he's a giant, slightly overweight puppy dog--and the louche Brit pungently evoked by Russell Brand. As for the Hawaiian setting, Oahu may have been a fun place to shoot. The Apatow crew probably wanted out of Hollywood. But the Pacific is too soggy and pretty an environment for repartee. For a change, instead of female nakedness (oh, just a few bare breasts), Segel is frontally nude, repeatedly, but just for a split second each time.<br/><br/>Apatow's posse is at home with male adolescence and early--or frozen--schlub-hood. But not with much else; the Apatow-sponsored features haven't managed to match the depth and breadth of their mother lode, ""Freaks and Gesks."" In the TV series, Segel got dumped by none other than Lindsey (Linda Cardellini), the lead character. None of the film comedies have come up with a female as smart, sensible, interesting, and central as Lindsay. Sarah is a pathetic sliver of humanity by comparison. Lindsey went out with Segel's ""Freaks"" persona Nick out of pity, and when he got too intense, she pulled away. His suffering was convincing, a little disturbing even. Her choice was wise. This sequence was less formulaic than Sarah Marshall. Nick, Segel's character in ""Freaks"" is rather arresting.<br/><br/>Peter grows out of Nick but loses rather than gains depth in the updating. The exotic setting obviously doesn't compensate. Segel already had musical ambitions as Nick, who realizes he's no rock star. Peter hates his sellout TV composing and is working on a Dracula puppet opera--an odd curio performed in excerpt toward the end. As before, Segel's appealing as a would-be artist and a basically decent but weak fellow with his heart on his sleeve, but Nick had more emotional conviction than Peter.<br/><br/>Sarah Marshall spends most of its time on well-trodden territory with hits predictable surprises, obtrusive local color, romance opportunities, and obligatory attempts at reconciliation. It does have laughs, but while Peter's new girlfriend Rachel (Mila Kunis) like him is basically a decent person, she mostly comes off as little more than a pretty face, and their relationship is never more than the stuff of sitcoms. In the end it seems that Segel's character lacks the complexity--or the energy--to sustain a whole movie, and he and Sarah are equally forgettable. _________________"

It didn't.<br/><br/>While we don't really mind clichéd characters - after all, paying homage to archetypes makes for perfectly good stories - we truly didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters.

"blende","10","3","5","25 March 2018"," Should be considered a Classic
","Top notch hilarious screenplay, relatable characters, layered story, and a gorgeous tropical backdrop. 
Once every 4-5 years Hollywood makes a comedy that is thouroughly enjoyable upon the first viewing and actually becomes more enjoyable with every viewing. 
Rather than giving an overview of the plot as I'm sure there are many other reviews for that, I'll discuss why I believe Forgetting Sarah Marshall deserves to be considered a classic Hollywood comedy.
The first strength of FSM is in the character depth, complexity, and rawness. 
Jason Segel Portrays a deeply depressed and conflicted man who believes his recent break up (he was dumped) is the reason for his depression, but as the movie progresses, it becomes clear he was already unhappy in the relationship. As fate would have it the ex lovers end up at the same vacation resort and the story unfolds from there. 
The movie is FULL of top notch comedic character actors playing in supporting roles. Highlights include Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and my personal favorite Jack McBrayer. Kristin Bell is solid and Mila Kunis is glowing in her role as the beautiful new potential romantic partner. The casting of Russell Brand as the aloof Brit Rocker is simply stellar. 
The Hawaiin location adds amazing flavor and culture to the backdrop of the film, bringing in some great locals to tie the scenery and story together.
As the film progresses, every actor gets a chance to shine. There are a countless number of classic one liners in the film.
A raw and hilarious beginning, tons of hilarious situations, and a satisfying ending make for a classic comedy worth watching again and again."
"Aomalle27","5","9","23","22 April 2008"," Disappointing...
","It just seems like the effort wasn't there. This is a crew that came out with Superbad, 40 year old virgin, and although I haven't seen it i've heard it was good, Knocked up. The first two films were just laugh-out-loud comedies. Sure there was crude humor, and some childish pranks, but you know what you're getting into when you see the previews. They are films in the mold of the Farelly Brothers, like Kingpin, or something about Mary. These are crudely fashioned moralistic tales, with a lot of raunchy, sometimes gross humor. But the main point is they supply enough gut busting laughs to sustain one through an hour and a half. Sadly this film doesn't accomplish that mundane task. It drags, the leading ladies don't appear all that appealing, and the laughs (when they do come) just don't satisfy. Skip it, and rent a classic like Stir Crazy, or Used Cars, hell even settle for UH1 or Dirty Deeds."

","I can only judge if something is funny or not by how much I laugh and I never really laughed during FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. I think I smiled at one or two parts and said, ""Heh,"" but I never really laughed. If a movie doesn't affect me, I can still rate it highly on other merits such as originality and good writing. There really isn't anything else to recommend this movie, except for a few nice performances from Russell Brand and Mila Kunis. The humor is as broad as any mainstream comedy, but it still doesn't go far enough over the lines of acceptable taste as to be funny. It's not outrageous enough to be funny and it's not nearly smart enough to offer you anything else. A waste of time."

It was also produced by Judd Apatow, who directed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", which is most definitely one of the greatest comedies of all time. So, of course, I went to the theater expecting to laugh my butt off. Needless to say, the movie did not live up to the hype at all. It wasn't a horrible movie, but it definitely wasn't the best either. I must admit it had potential, but I think the ball was dropped on this one.<br/><br/>For one thing, for a comedy, it wasn't that funny. It had it's amusing moments, but only one or two laugh out loud moments. I could see there were a few lines that I think the writers intended to be funny, but they were awkward and fell flat. And there were a few too many melodramatic moments for my liking. It's not really a straight out comedy, it's more like a raunchy chick flick with a few humorous moments.<br/><br/>Another thing, the editing is atrocious. I don't usually notice that sort of thing, but the cuts were so abrupt it was almost a distraction. Obviously, the person working in the editing room either had too much to drink the night before, had no idea what they were doing or perhaps it was a combination of both.<br/><br/>There was also a lot of bad acting. The main characters are mostly TV actors and it was painfully obvious that they aren't ready for the big screen. Jason Segal, who played Peter Bretter, was the biggest offender. Though he's cute, there was no way someone as gorgeous as Kristen Bell would ever give him a second look in real life. The audience was told repeatedly in the movie that Peter was extremely charismatic, charming and funny as heck. The problem is that he was actually none of those. He's actually very average, boring and not very funny. There is also no way that someone like Mila Kunis' character, Rachel, who is also extremely beautiful and has a pretty wild life, would ever fall for him either. The two people who really shine in this movie is Russell Brand as perverted rocker Aldous Snow and Bill Hader, who plays it straight and serious as Peter's step-brother Brian.<br/><br/>And I wasn't the only one who thought this way. The theater was half full and no one except my husband and I laughed throughout the whole film. And we only laughed maybe once or twice.<br/><br/>All in all, it wasn't that great and I regretted having spent nine dollars in order to see it. If you're really interested in watching it, I'd wait until it comes out on DVD and then I'd get it from the Redbox. If you don't watch it with high expectations, then you might enjoy it."

","I think part of the problem with Forgetting Sarah Marshall, like so many movies, is that it only exists to try to outdo the gross-out gags from the last gross-out comedy, but everything that's allowed past the MPAA has already been shown. The current pattern can't sustain itself unless the restrictions on content suddenly disappear, which isn't likely to happen. Most of the jokes don't even have punchlines. They just show you a penis over and over and expect you to laugh at the sight of it. If the sight of a penis is enough to make you laugh, you have access to much more explicit and free content over your Internet connection. We live in the age of ""2 Girls, 1 Cup."" There's not much left that can shock us.<br/><br/>I'll forgive the silly PG-13 sex scenes, even though the movie advertised itself as a wildly raunchy R-rated sex comedy. When characters have sex underneath the sheets, it takes me out of the film because it is something people only seem to do in lame movies. Some people might blame it on American prudishness, but it didn't seem to be a problem in Wedding Crashers or The Last Kiss. People were naked when they were supposed to be naked (and it was almost always the women). It makes me feel like the movie is geared to an audience that is 18 or younger.<br/><br/>On a side note, some of the dialogue sounded like it was taken from somewhere else. I'm pretty sure I heard the joke about God putting a playground next to a sewage system in one of Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up acts. The ""happy tissues, sad tissues"" line was vaguely familiar, too. The rest of the movie is also derivative so it doesn't really matter."

","Movies about a guy and his ex booking hotel rooms next to each other go all the way back to the screwball comedies of the 1930's. It's such an outdated premise today that it mostly shows up on sitcoms, as it did on an old episode of ""Frasier."" The half-hour format is probably the best place for it. When you have such a hackneyed justification for your movie, the material had better be stellar but the writer here is obviously in over his or her head.<br/><br/>You might describe the movie as sitcom-ish, but the jokes are often funnier on some of these sitcoms. This should not be the case. TV writers are up against deadlines. A screenwriter has ample time to work on his or her script before showing it to anyone and turning it into a movie.<br/><br/>One of the ""big"" gag scenes in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a moaning contest between two couples having sex on opposite sides of a wall in adjacent hotel rooms. This is a microcosm for the rest of the movie. You can see the joke coming a mile away because it's been done a million times before, including on the episode of ""Frasier."" <br/><br/>The only difference is that the joke was actually funny on ""Frasier.""<br/><br/>Instead of two couples, it was just Frasier alone in his room trying to make his ex jealous by banging his headboard against the wall and making orgasmic noises. The twist was that the room next door was actually empty and his ex and her new beau walk by the sliding-glass doors of his room and catch him in the act.<br/><br/>The joke was clever and contained more irony than the same joke in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" It also showed Frasier in a self-deprecating light and makes a pompous character that could easily become grating in unskilled hands even more likable. This is an example of how to construct a good joke.<br/><br/>And this is how you construct jokes without any of the real irony or truth that make something funny...<br/><br/>FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL"
"rmax304823","3","5","11","18 February 2009"," Dullish collage of comic incidents.
","This film is reasonably highly rated by users here so I obviously missed something because it seemed patched together out of semi-independent events that were designed to be amusing but, to me, were for the most part pointless and unfunny.<br/><br/>This nebbish who writes the score for a TV crime series (Jason Segel) is dumped by his hoarse-voiced petite blond girl friend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), an actress on the show, and runs away to Hawaii to forget her. However, Bell shows up coincidentally at the same time and hotel, and with her new boyfriend, an English musician, Russell Brand. Segel keeps running into the pair each time he has dinner, drinks, surfs, takes yoga classes, or just walks around. He also meets a handful of weird, vaguely new-agey characters who use words like ""totally"" and say things like, ""There's pain behind those eyes."" In the end, Bell and Brand break up. Bell wants to get it on again with Segel but he rejects her and goes back to Los Angeles. The end.<br/><br/>I think what this film is trying to be is a refurbished ""There's Something About Mary,"" although if you shook its family tree, ""Ten"" might fall out of it. Example: After being jilted, Segel bawls abjectly, like an infant, in a public place, just like the protagonist of ""There's Something About Mary."" But all the incidents take place in an exotic beach setting, as in ""Ten."" The difference is that ""There's Something About Mary"" had a plot that developed, that led somewhere. One incident followed and depended upon some previous incident, and the story thickened. Another example: The TV show that Segel and Bell work for is canceled. And nothing happens. It leads nowhere, a dead end that simply fills up a bit of screen time. The impression left by ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is that of a padded-out episode from a situation comedy.<br/><br/>In ""There's Something About Mary"" we are interested in seeing what devious surprise lurks around the next corner. In ""Ten"", the purpose of the film was to show us that when a middle-aged man tries to overcome his fear of maturity, it can work, though it may involve effort, pain, and humiliation. Here, I couldn't bring myself to be interested in what happened to any of the characters.<br/><br/>It all seemed pointless, unless the point was to cash in on the success of the earlier comedies. There is a five-minute scene in a yoga class. Everyone else in the class is able to assume the positions with ease, but Segel has to struggle to do, say, a tripod handstand, though he succeeds in the end. So? Best performances in the sense that they were least abrasive: Segel and Rand. Segel is flabby and giddy, one foot in some other self-obsessed dimension, like a half-gassed Judge Reinhold. Rand gives us a nicely honed portrait of a hairy, tattooed bloke who is a paragon of good will.<br/><br/>The version I saw was unrated but it's hard to imagine why. It's hardly erotic. There is some male nudity which, I admit, I found gratuitous and objectionable. I wouldn't have found female nudity gratuitous and objectionable though.<br/><br/>I'd advise a pass on this one, despite its overall good ratings. If you are the sort who would find this amusing, then you might want not only to forget Sarah Marshall but to ablate her entirely and go directly to the sources, ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Ten."" Why settle for this pinchbeck ripoff?"

Our daughter and her partner were with us and felt similarly. They are in their mid-30s, and older than the average person who was in the theater. I agree with other comments that the acting was not very good. The sex scenes were hardly a turn-on, but with due respect were probably meant more to be comical. These scenes came across to me as quite flat.

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008). There is something different about Forgetting Sarah Marshall as this romance comedy but in a good way. Jason Segel's Peter Bretter's character is more refined and credible in his comedic performance than Matthew Perry's Oz Oseransky character in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) even as both their character share similar personas. Kristen Bell's inevitably second to Mila Kunis's character (later Best Actress Oscar winner in Black Swan) surprisingly retains a powerful and in ways sympathetic presence almost to the end, which is only saved by the unusual insert sequence with the ending credits. There is something honest and gripping in the script as it presence relational turmoil and regretful mistakes on the part of its characters. The overall movie has a charm, lightness, but doesn't avoid some darker elements as well as a genuinely sensitive and humorous and touching musical rendition of a Dracula character."
"Wuchakk","6","2","3","26 March 2018"," Entertaining romcom marred by incongruent porn-ish elements
","RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Nicholas Stoller, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a romcom starring Jason Segel as Peter, a genial musician from Los Angeles who composes music for a popular detective show, which stars his hottie girlfriend, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). After she breaks up with him he vacations at a resort in Hawaii where, unexpectedly, his ex & her rock star beau (Russell Brand) also happen to be staying. Mila Kunis plays a concierge at the resort who takes interest in Peter. <br/><br/>This is a compelling, amusing romantic comedy with Segel likable as the protagonist and Bell winsome and charismatic as his ex. Brand is great as a Jim Morrison-like rock god who doesn't drink; the way he performs on stage is laugh-out-loud funny (poking fun at rock stars). The resort locations are a highlight and the story is sprinkled with several notable guest stars (Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Da'Vone McDonald, Jonah Hill, etc.).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are several NC-17 (aka porn-ish) scenes that I wasn't expecting since the version I watched was supposedly rated 'R.' I'm talking about several scenes of simulated sex, including one involving fellatio, as well as full-frontal male nudity right out of the gate (Seriously?). I basically ignored these scenes or rolled with them and laughed. I'm sharing this info for those who don't care to see a movie mixed with nigh-porn elements. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, as well as studio work done at Universal City, CA. WRITER: Jason Segel. <br/><br/>GRADE: B but basically ruined (for me) by the porn aspects, so really 'D'"

","Judging by the ratings, I had higher expectations for this movie. It had some funny moments in the beginning. But after a while I got the feeling that it was trying a little too hard to be something it was not. After all, you can only be disgusted and shocked so many times in two hours. The best part about the movie is that almost all the actors (except for the pretty girl from ""That's 70s Show""), were a bunch of unknowns, and that was kind of refreshing.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm not being completely fair. If you loved ""40-year-old Virgin"" and ""Old School"" you'll probably love this movie. But to everyone else I say that unless you have a lot of extra time and money on your hands, do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD to come out."
"tomasvit6","9","1","1","20 September 2019"," Witty romance
","This is Jason Segel's first and pivotal script. I cannot believe I've been dodging ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" for so long. The movie was extremely good and it kept me entertained throughout the whole play. Even now, after it ended, I'm still giggling...<br/><br/>Although the romance wasn't so thrilling and might have seemed a bit shallow, yet Segel managed to express fundamental values that most people share on the philosophy of love. On one side, there is Peter and Rachel who (after the breakups) seeks to find peace of mind and rectify their souls and on the other Sarah and Aldous - the duo of the untamed flame.<br/><br/>Peter and Sarah cannot work because Peter is a man of depth - he lives in music but he doesn't seek attention or worldwide recognition and so he starts living in solitude (might be his source of inspiration). Sarah, on the other hand, is an actress and although it's still a form of art, she doesn't seem to strive for depth, she is attention oriented. Thus, she finds someone who is more like her - Aldous Snow. But from their very first scene, we can tell that the latter couple is destined to burn out eventually. Oh, and lastly, there is Sarah. A character that has morphed through the phase of juvenile maximalism. And oddly is the perfect match for Peter.<br/><br/>In this movie we witness at least three types of love stories that are so conspicuous in our modern society:
1. A story where people fail to maintain their inner connection after outlining the major differences between them.
2. A story where one finds self in another and manages to overcome indifference with the help of mutual harmony.
3. A story where people are forcing their relationship to last, sometimes indefinitely (fear of starting anew).<br/><br/>And even though Segel presents this movie as an artifact for pop culture, I still find it intriguing how he hides these small jewels inside the script. All in all, the movie gives a decent amount of laughs and everyone should surely give it a chance."

Being someone out of love myself, I can sympathize with his character, which goes a long way; I'm guessing the producers felt this would go a long way with the audiences and critics.<br/><br/>However, the plot is utterly fantastical and unrealistic.

","Well, I didn't like it as much as everyone else here, but the movie was pretty good. It's refreshing to see an American film using the comedic value of the ridiculousness of male nudity.

That's just how it is.<br/><br/>The film takes a cute look at American film script staples like betrayal, infidelity, male drama queens, brotherly love, celebrity worship, stupid TV shows, phony, pseudo-spiritual rock stars and vapid actresses, but is detached, ironic and hip enough to make it all work well. Worth the money.<br/><br/>I have to add...Mila Kunis is beautiful. It's hard to tell on ""That 70s Show,"" but in this movie, her eyes and personality shine in a most hypnotic way.<br/><br/>B+.

"Don_of_Man","4","6","15","26 July 2008"," Very poorly written and poorly executed.
","I can see how one or two of the jokes could've potentially been funny, but they must have been extinguished by the limp pacing and some genuinely bad acting. This movie has no energy. I won't go into the plot much because it just a very predictable Hollywood story. It is actually an extremely average romantic comedy in every respect (except for the male-genital exposure) but I had to take a star off of the rating because it is not so good on the technical side. The director, who has no other directing credits, managed to make a movie set in Hawaii with a good-sized budget that looks cheap. I've never noticed things like the direction or the editing in a comedy before but they stand out in a very bad way in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall.""<br/><br/>I probably would have enjoyed it more if the characters had any charm. The movie expects you to feel sympathy for the main character, but it's never earned. He has a cozy job ""composing"" mood music for a TV cop show. In his spare time, he just lounges around doing nothing. His girlfriend is a TV star and he cries (quite literally) like a baby when she dumps him. I think the 40-year-old virgin had more testosterone than Jason Segel's character. Steve Carell was also likable and actually made you root for him. Watching Segel's self-loathing character mope around sadly when you know he's inevitably going to be with the beautiful Mila Kunis becomes tiresome. There are other obnoxious, unfunny characters. These are not people I would want to be stuck on a tropical island with...<br/><br/>...or even spend another 112 minutes with."
"jaredmobarak","7","6","15","18 April 2008"," I'll equalize youForgetting Sarah Marshall
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall had all the potential to fall into one of two camps: unbridled raunchy fun a la 40 Year Old Virgin and Superbad or sentimentality masked as comedy like Knocked Up. I had all the fear that it would hit the latter taking the sensitive guy with the broken heart too far into romance territory, letting the laughs fall by the wayside once the conclusion comes along. Thankfully, though, while the train took some turns down that path, writer/star Jason Segel knew what he was doing and threw in a curveball joke to right the ship at each instance. Rather than attempt to be two kinds of films at once, I believe this was a true hybrid of the two sides of the Apatow machine. You will not be free from laughter for long stretches here as the balance between big laughs and sappy melodrama is always tempered by subtle jabs, fantastic one-liners, and a crew of really likable actors having fun.<br/><br/>This film also shows society a lesson on human anatomy. It is quite interesting how different reactions nudity can elicit depending on the sex of the person exposed. If the audience sees breasts on screen they get quiet as they are watching what is probably a love scene. However, once you get male genitalia in frame, everyoneand I mean everyonecannot stop themselves from laughing. Let's just say there are a lot of laughs of this fashion, so if that may detract you from seeing the film, be warned, but really it is only used to add one more layer of absurdity to seemingly tired situations and in my opinion works brilliantly. One has to respect this clan of artists under Apatow's wing for pushing boundaries and being willing to go for the joke without a second thought. It's one thing to be sexual and explicit just to say you are, it's another to use it in order to enhance the plot and the scene, sticking to your vision and not straying unnecessarily.<br/><br/>What really becomes apparent is how these guys have found a way to understand today's comedy and their ability to turn a common, simple plot structure into something fresh and entertaining. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get away only to find that his safe haven is also where she is with her new boyfriend (wow haven't seen that before), guy falls for new girl while old girl realizes how stupid she was, and the end is the end (not to spoil anything directly, but I'm sure you can figure it out). It is all in the details and the gaps between the lines where the true genius manifests itself. Segel has joined Apatow and Seth Rogen in their ability to make a laugh-a-minute riot with a complete story and not simply a string of gags loosely jumbled together. Don't get me wrong, there are many gags and I'm sure many moments that were thought of previously and added to the script where they fit, but that is the thing, they all fit like a glove. It can't be easy to weave together a Dracula rock opera, complete with huge payoff at the end; a pig roast, (""Don't make me do thisI'm sorry!""); a sexually inexperienced newly wed couple; the wonderful features on new Mac computers; and the secret to good surfing technique, (""No, too much movement, do nothingnow stand""), but Segel deftly does the job.<br/><br/>As for the players, I will admit to knowing little to nothing about all the principals. Segel is great in this role, but that should be no surprise since he wrote the part for himself based on real-life experiences, (if it's true that the breakup scene while naked actually happened to him, kudos for letting a situation like that be permanently etched onto celluloid). As for the women, both Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis do well attempting to break free from their TV show pasts. I'm not a big fan of Bell at all, but she is perfect in this role as the somewhat bitchy celebrity unaware of how vain she is. Maybe my somewhat undeserved hostility towards her made it feel that much more real. As for Kunis, I was completely surprised by how likable she was. Even when she snaps at one point into a curse-laced tirade, she is still the cutest thing in the world. Also, her chemistry with Segel is completely believablethe attraction through minds and sensibilities as the two are kindred souls finding exactly what they need from each other. The real surprise, though, is Brit Russell Brand. This guy owns each of his scenes with a self-effacing role of utter rockstar stupidity, played absolutely straight. He portrays the cool guy swagger to perfection and mixes in the awkward doltish sensibilities most stereotype his kind with. Segel's interaction with him on the ocean is the best example of how out there this guy is, yet when it comes to music he really does know what he is doing (regardless of his laughable songs).<br/><br/>It is not going to be a comedy classic like Virgin, but it also won't be thrown aside as a failed attempt to give a rom-com broad comedic appeal like Knocked Up is with me. Instead it walks the line with a few missteps crossing other both ways. Each time it goes astray, in either direction, it finds it's footing quickly to right the scale. With the help of cameos from Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, and Davon McDonald, one can't languish in the sentimentality for too long because those crazy characters won't let you. Forgetting Sarah Marshall delivers on the Apatow name and shows that Jason Segel shouldn't be relegated to only standing in Seth Rogen's shadow; he may be able to cast his own soon enough."

","Another Judd Apatow produced film-so its another question of why did I bother seeing it when it clear I'm not going to be happy. Okay its not bad but it didn't thrill me.<br/><br/>In a nutshell Peter is a composer for TV series. His girlfriend is Sarah Marshall the hot star of a hot cop show. She dumps him for a Lothario singer and he pines for her. He then goes off to Hawaii and ends up at the same resort that the ex and her new beau end up at. <br/><br/>For me the problem is, as with Knocked Up, I can not understand what the two main characters, here Peter and Sarah, are doing together. Peter is a sweet schulb of a guy and she is twit, a babe but a bit shallow. What are they doing together? Or rather why is she with him in the first place? <br/><br/>I kind of lost respect for the originality for the film when Peter is seen in one of the first scenes sitting on the couch with a huge bowl of cereal letting himself go until Sarah calls, he then goes and straightens himself out. But its been done before, why are we doing it again? Give the filmmakers points for showing Peter naked a couple of times (in places he really would be naked-which made sense to me but cause much of the audience to laugh around me, I'm guessing from nervousness) but take a good many away from not being creative enough to stay out of the cliché rut. I did like the final bits of the film which actually seemed to have real characters and situations but I getting to that point was a chore. Its clear that the creative team can make a winning romantic film as evidenced from several of the final scenes, but for me it was too little too late.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary. As for me I must learn to stay away from anything Judd Apatow touches."

","Honestly, I did not think Judd Apatow had it in him to be involved in another comedy that would be good. So far, everything he has been involved in has been immensely funny (The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad). Forgetting Sarah Marshall can be added to that list, because this is one hilarious movie. Jason Segel is very, very good as Peter, who decides to vacation in Hawaii to forget about Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) who recently dumped him for Aldous Snow (a quirky Russell Brand). Unfortunately for him, Sarah and Aldous are holidaying at the same resort as he is. Luckily for him, he meets Rachel (a gorgeous and talented Mila Kunis) and they hit it off.<br/><br/>What sounds like an average romantic comedy is turned into a smart, well-paced, always funny and just plain excellent mid-year movie. It is easily one of this years best and I wish there were more comedies like this. The supporting cast were consistently funny. Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill, Apatow regulars, are gold. The movie is very quotable and most importantly, believable. The relationships all break off and build in a slow and effective way, so we are allowed to time to understand and feel sympathy for the various characters. The jokes rarely missed, for those who like their jokes raunchy, this is your movie! Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the movies I listed earlier.

","I sit before this computer awestruck, currently experiencing what I call ""Cinematic Grandeur"" running through my very veins. I have felt the once-in-a-blue-moon feeling of wanting to see a movie the second it was over. No, not Juno, not Crash, not The Matrix, not one of them life-altering Oscar flicks. No, this is simply a potty-mouthed laugh attack. <br/><br/>And it's brilliant.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall (A Judd Apatow Production), details the life of Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, How I Met Your Mother) following a break-off of a five year love-a-thon with TV celeb Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell, Heroes). Broken-hearted and crying like a schoolgirl, Peter resorts to a trip to Hawaii to calm his state of panic, only to find everyone's favorite celebrity ex and her newest boytoy, British rock sensation Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The heartbreak continues despite being surrounded by the most beautiful part of the country, until encouraged by friends to secure a hot date with the lovely receptionist Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis, That 70's Show). What follows is a laugh riot featuring great cameos and one liners that'll leave you in stitches.<br/><br/>It should be noted right away, though the plot sounds quasi-cliché, it feels anything but. Snappy one-liners and cut-away jokes make for brilliant surprises in the plot, and the timing of said jokes is phenomenal. What I refer to as ""Family Guy Syndrome"", aka the ability to drag on a joke way too long, is gone completely from FSM. Just when one of the jokes seems tedious, it's over and the plot advances. The writing is top-notch, brilliantly funny, and delivered solidly by the four main leads. <br/><br/>The aforementioned leads carry the plot like a sloth carries moss. Segel's moments of sheer embarrassment are to die for, and I mean embarrassment. Full frontal embarrassment. Meanwhile Brand attempts to steal the show as the British music idol who's borderline straight-edge and consistently delivers comedy gold. Kunis and Bell each act out their respective girly parts well, and you manage to find yourself caring about each character despite the way you want to hate Marshall.<br/><br/>Perhaps most intriguing is the ability of actor cameos to bring a smile to your face, whether's it's Jonah Hill (of Accepted and Superbad fame) as a waiter obsessed with the career of Snow, Paul Rudd (star of previous Apatow projects, 40-Year-Old-Virgin and Knocked Up) as a dim bulb surf instructor or even Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) making a great cameo while the credits roll. All the bit parts are played competently and each manages to steal the scene when they're on screen. If anything, all the comedy belongs to the background players while the big four advance the plot. Oh, and did I mention Jack McBrayer (30 Rock's Kenneth) plays quite a part himself?<br/><br/>When push comes to shove, I don't how much more praise I can lay on this movie. It's heartfelt, hilarious, and dare I say it, near-perfect. I'd love to say it's perfect, simply because I can't find any flaws, but I'm hesitant to dish out that scary ten out of ten. That said, FSM is the funniest movie I've seen in years. Better than Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, Knocked Up, Superbad, if you name it, this movie's likely funnier. Led by strong acting, snappy writing, and an all out fantastic showing by everyone involved, it seems Judd Apatow has once again struck comedy gold. My only question is, how does he outdo this one?"

","I am really dumbfounded how so many people find this movie so funny. It does have its funny moments. However, the plots sucks big time. It is patterned after B-movie comedies of the late 40s and 50s except for the sex in it. It is really a dumb and senseless plot. Is this what comedy has come to in the current age? It seems like movies today are either grossly violent or just plainly uninspired. There have been a few exceptions, of course, like Juno.<br/><br/>Even the male nudity doesn't score here although some reviewers think that this a great new trend. Oh, save me from this insipidity.

We've just seen the initiating breakup scene, where Sarah (Kristen Bell) arrives to Peter's apartment to give him the bad news, and he starts crying standing there and running around in the altogether. In the next few weeks Peter thrashes about having bouts of depressionpersonally I don't see getting all broken up over this little Superficial Sarahand meaningless sex, which, again, doesn't have to be anywhere near that explicit to get the point across.<br/><br/>Indeed, if there's one main objection I want to make covering the entire film, it's that writer and/or director seem to want to make physically explicit every conceivable interaction among the charactersespecially scenes that might otherwise be humorous in subtlety and implication.

The rest of the cast and the movie in general was total trash.

","I am excited about the new crop of American comedies that have been emerging lately. This Rogan/Apatow crew has consistently brought audiences modern stories full of honest characters (""Knocked Up"" being the exception) and jokes that have not been dragged through movie mud over and over again.<br/><br/>At first, I was unsure of where the comedy was going with this one. It starts off a little shaky, but then finds its groove and carries the audience laughing all the way through the credits.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: A guy gets dumped. Her tries to et over her, and winds up running into her. Her falls in love with another woman, and the ex now wants him back. Easy enough, right? <br/><br/>But with the dead on humor (some raunchy, some just genuinely hilarious), this movie shines as a comic tour-De-force for all involved. The jokes are timely but not dated (whereas ""Knocked Up"" lacked credibility with its Hot-Girl-Loves-Slob routine and its dated references to movie lines and TV shows.) This one is funnier than ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" but not quite better than ""Superbad."" All in all, these original comedies are fresh, exciting and genuine to the core.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"MartianOctocretr5","8","4","9","26 April 2008"," Much better than expected
","Although the movie has some of sophomoric humor you would expect from this kind of premise and this group of movie makers, it actually surprises you with some stylish humor in its design that bears some (dare I say it?) originality.<br/><br/>First, it's written with more attention to character study than is customary in these types of comedies. The writer gave them depth, and concocted them with strategic flaws, quirks, strengths, etc., so that their contrasting personalities would collide and bounce off each other with humorous results. The rock star new boyfriend (Russell Brand) of Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) in most movies like this would usually be a worn-out cliché of a dim-witted guy with slow mumbling speech who thinks the world owes him something. If anything, the film actually takes pokes at how these clichés have been so over-used. Brand takes this surprisingly amiable guy, who befriends his potential rival Brian, and runs with it. He gets some of the best laugh lines, too.<br/><br/>Bell, as the titular Sarah Marshall, is excellent. She, too, could have been a stock foul-mouthed, self satisfying, worthless bimbo type who spends hours in front of the mirror. Although the selfishness is there, it's at a believable level, and there are even fleeting moments when a good side to Sarah is shown. Mila Kunis plays Rachel, Peter's new girl friend, who works at a resort hotel in Hawaii, where all the action takes place. Either Kunis has improved immensely since her sitcom ""70's Show"" days, or else her role here as Rachel just gave her a more rounded character to work with: she is fabulous in this film.<br/><br/>Only Jason Segel (as the broken hearted Peter) is weak in his role; ironic, since he is the writer of the script. It's obvious his intent is to reverse typical gender personality types for the comic effect. Peter is clingy, explosively emotive, cries, and can't let go of the broken relationship. This all works for funny moments, but Segel's performance has a feel of ""Look how fully I am!"" It's more over done than comic exaggeration needs to be. Also, someone tell Mr. Segel we really don't need to see his full frontal poses: he plays them as a joke, OK, but they evoke barf bag reactions, not laughs.<br/><br/>This film falls into the trap of throwing in some mindless stuff, but overall, it's a surprising treat that's fun to watch."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with my girlfriend. Segal has the hurt puppy dog character down pat and he put it to good use in a movie that revolves around it.<br/><br/>I am a huge Kristen Bell fan and she certainly brought her A game. Kunis, also smokin hot, really knocked her role out of the park as well.<br/><br/>Why no 9 or 10 star rating? The overused male full frontal nudity. It's become a disappointing trend in recent movies. You really don't need that sort of shock comedy with material this strong. Plus it's a bit annoying to have two absolutely gorgeous women as Bell and Kunis and the best we get is a bathroom photo and some bikini time. Seriously disappointed in that. I'm sure your target audience is males in the 18-40 category. Think about it! You don't have to go all porkys on us, but a few T & A shots of these two girls would have gotten you those two extra stars. Much like the birthing shot in Knocked up. Yeah it gets people talking, but it detracts from solid comedy material in my mind.<br/><br/>But barring that this was a really funny movie that we enjoyed watching.<br/><br/>Mike"
"atliel","8","4","9","20 April 2008"," A Comedy That Does It's Job....Making You Laugh
","I've read some critics complaining about the plot of the film but still agreeing that it's funny. Did I miss something here? Isn't that the point of a comedy? To laugh? If it did its job then it's good! Right? Well, I enjoyed it for all its silliness but even more so because it's easy to relate to. What's great is that none of the characters are card board cut-outs (clichés). As much as you would like to hate Sarah Marshall and her boyfriend there are moments where you sympathize or side with them, not because they're great people (you'll still side with the protagonist) but simply because you get them. You know where they're coming from and this adds a level of complexity missing from too many comedies who run with an overdone Hollywood formula and don't take any risks.<br/><br/>It's an interesting thing to have a particular type of comedy become known solely for its creators: ""from the guys who brought you Superbad or Knocked Up or""...you get the point. It's almost like owning your own sub-genre and this wouldn't be very far fetched considering that the Apatow crowd do follow certain conventions that have become expected within their brand of comedy. For example dirty high school humor from guys who seem trapped between adolescence and adulthood but who, for the most part, are pretty decent people who just want to have fun without the complexities of old age. But those complexities always catch up to them and in the end they confront these problems as mature adults and become wiser for it. I bet most critics never thought of applying film theory to these films but there you have it."

","There is some clever stuff in this, brought down by uninspired attempts at comedy. So if it's just laughs that you're looking for, they're all rehashed here with familiar faces to deliver them, better reach for Superbad again or the recent Bridesmaids.<br/><br/>But the film deserves a few words on the structure, it's an excellent design. The protagonist is a guy who's been living beneath the image of his girlfriend, a TV actress for a CSI-type show. He is comfortable that way, as we learn it's the only thing that makes him get up from the couch and clean up his place, preserve some semblance of order. His job is to score the episodes for the show, he does this by literally working on the synthesizer beneath her giant projected image. She dumbs him, he tears the image in a fit of frenzy. Slinks depressed again back into the couch.<br/><br/>He gets up from the couch for a trip to Hawaii, once more something he has picked up from his girlfriend. There he learns how to pick himself up again, on a surf board, or up in front of an audience to play the piano. His dream, sidetracked by slovenly routine and a passionless job, is to orchestrate a rock opera about Dracula, a man who was doomed to love eternally in his head.<br/><br/>It's meant to be a dark, emotional piece, yet playing one of the songs for an audience of disinterested tourists, it elicits hearty laughs. Turns out that what he was writing all this time, funneling his own important self into the thing, was after all a comedy and not a drama. So the circumstances around him open up the self-pitying work into selfless entertainment.<br/><br/>Eventually he stages his vision, we can tell this much early on, and it's an uproar. It's an opera with muppets, with himself in control of the protagonist. He plays his own strings, finds a love that does not merely give him a reason to get up from the couch but inspires creative passion out of him.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, it's really potent stuff the way it's structured. One of the best for the year, as far as layering a lesson about the mechanisms that control life within a fiction that is transformed with that life is concerned.<br/><br/>So I doubly lament that it's an Apatow production, a middling one at that. Paul Rudd plays the goofy stoner surfer. Jonah Hill plays the bumbling waiter with aspirations of a music career. It's miserable stuff I tell you, every attempt at a laugh. Our entry in Hawaii is completely touristy, the shiny plastic of a postcard, like the real place I suppose has turned by now, one big holiday resort for people who can afford it. <br/><br/>Which is all highly ironic, given how the whole thing is not meant to be a drama. But we don't make the discovery with the protagonist for this to matter deeply, it's a dumb comedy from the get go. If you're patient enough or don't mind, you can watch just so you can imagine a better film out of it."

","This has jokes that often work. It has a genuine pathos that is surprisingly rare and is now the trademark of Apatow productions. <br/><br/>It has Hawaii and two women, one pretty the other a beauty. It has a deftly comic foil in the ""other boyfriend."" It has some frontal male nudity that probably should be commended simply because its avoidance is ridiculous. Here, in fact, we have it twice and though it is meant to punch up those scenes, I found that it actually was dramatically integrated.<br/><br/>But because I am a narrative folding nut, I'll point out the three inner performance folds. The girlfriend is a TeeVee star on a show for which our hero writes music. Her inner role reflects on her outer one.<br/><br/>The other boyfriend is a British rock star, whose onstage persona is mirrored in his character in the film. And the thing ends with the hero's play within the play. In this case it is an extremely clever musical comedy derived from Dracula and performed by a mix of puppets, humans in costume and the participating puppetmasters. It is really quite wonderful by itself and after the story ends, it is clear how the whole project grew out of it. The integration of the idea of a love that ""smothers"" is brilliant.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Ah, Judd Apatow and his band of hilarious misfits. FSM features the lowest amount of Apatow regular cast members (3, I believe) of all those movies, but is no less funny than the likes of Knocked Up and Walk Hard. What you have with FSM and all the other Apatow joints is a constant theme of vulgar yet lovable humor, and a beautiful underlying romance. These themes are consistent in The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Walk Hard, and to an extent, Anchorman. What is truly great about all these films is that they bring a different thing to the table each time. They are NOT carbon copies of each other, which is absolutely excellent.<br/><br/>The plot of FSM, as with the other Apatow movies, is straightforward, but evolves as the movie goes on: Peter (Jason Segel) is broken up with by his beautiful TV star girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell), and decides to take a vacation away from Los Angeles to get his mind off Sarah...of course, who should be vacationing at the same place as him but Sarah herself?<br/><br/>One thing that is very important to remember is that though we call these movies ""Apatow"" movies, more often than not, Judd Apatow does not write or direct the movie. This is true with Superbad, Anchorman, Walk Hard (he wrote, not directed it), and this film. The lead actor Jason Segel is behind the script, and it proves to be among the best of the bunch. The dialog is witty, sharp, vulgar, and just plain irresistible. Segel's ability to charm the audience is also no less prevalent. He's a lovable leading man, and I would love to see him do this again. The audience is going to love Peter all throughout the film, and Segel gives far and away the best show of his career, out doing his work in Knocked Up and How I Met Your Mother. The other Apatow cronies that show up in FSM are Jonah Hill (who seems to be in pretty much every single one of them) and Paul Rudd. One could consider supporting performer Bill Hader a member of the group, and if you include him and his great performance as Peter's brother, you get 4. The film also features cameos from William Baldwin and Jason Bateman.<br/><br/>The main supporting cast, always integral to the plot, is great. First you have Sarah Marshall, played by Kristen Bell. Bell, despite playing one of the most unlikable characters of recent memory, managed to make me feel for Sarah at some points, without completely stealing attention from Segel and the actual love interest of the film. Good job by the TV veteran Bell. You've also got British comedian Russell Brand nearly stealing the show as well as he steals Sarah from Peter in the film. He's one of the best parts of the movie and couldn't have been funnier. He also holds one of the funniest lines in the film, opposite Jonah Hill. Lastly, but surely not not least, is another TV star, Mila Kunis. Famous for her roles as Jackie on That 70's Show and Meg Griffin of Family Guy, Kunis creates yet another memorable character, Rachel Jansen, that is tailored perfectly to her talents. I absolutely LOVED her character. She brought out the best in Peter and the chemistry between her and Segel is wonderful.<br/><br/>I'd say that this would have to be the cleanest and least vulgar of the Apatow 'R' rated comedies as far as dialog goes...however, the now infamous nude scenes of Jason Segel hold nothing back. Director Nicholas Stoller does a great job of using Segel's manhood to his advantage (wow, that sounds wrong). I wonder how awkward the cast and crew felt around Segel when those scenes were being shot. I really loved this movie, though it sort of falters towards the end, but the ending more than makes up for it (it's absolutely adorable).<br/><br/>FSM is yet another winning Apatow movie that is lovable, vulgar, and absolutely adorable. Jason Segel gives one of the better comedic performances of recent memory in a movie that should be a bright spot on his career and on the careers of everyone involved. I really think you should see this film if you get the chance."

But my main point of interest was how well this film emotionally connected with its audience. The nakedness of Siegel during the break-up (which was strange and comical while also saddening), the wonderfully casted and beautiful Mila Kunis, and the script all come together to stretch out a sad yet hopeful hand that sweeps the audience up and never lets them back down even after the movie is over.

Some characters are annoyingly unbelievable, like the smoking hot receptionist who just happens to be the nicest, most down-to-earth girl and falls in love with an unattractive slob such as the main character.<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm not asking for much when it comes to comedies, but when a movie gets as much praise as this one, I'm hoping for a little better entertainment. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" does have some good scenes, but all in all it is slightly amusing at best. If you liked ""Knocked Up"", you're gonna love this. If like me, you can't understand the buzz, wait for the movie to come out on DVD and rent it when nothing else is available."
"McGrit","Null","5","14","28 April 2008"," Nothing Really Special
","When one of the preeminent film critics of our time labels this film one of the 50 greatest comedies of all-time; your expectations can't help but be high. Maybe high expectations were a problem because I found the movie to be very ordinary at best. Richard Roeper is well respected and usually right on the mark but his sense of humor must be very different from mine. There are some humorous moments but nothing that warrants high praise. It's warm hearted but borderlines on watching someone else's vacation home movies. Mila Kunis is phenomenal (truly deserving of that high praise) but EVERY other supporting character is more annoying then they are endearing or funny. Forgetting Sarah Marshall contains many chuckles but no laugh out loud moments. Sorry to say, nothing really special at all."
"marcyu","4","3","7","28 January 2009"," Too Raunchy
","I liked 40-Year-Old Virgin a lot, even though Steve Carrell is usually a bit too odd for me. And Knocked Up was one of my favorites of that year, in spite of those crazy sex scenes. But this movie really pushes the envelope too far. To be fair, the funny moments in this movie were very good, and it was thoroughly enjoyable during those times. However, the balance of romance and gross overboard nastiness was not well-balanced this time, in my opinion. I think that most good movies are kept from being great by editing too much of it away. In the case of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the director, Nicholas Stoller, could probably have used Apatow's eye in the cutting room."
"moutonbear25","7","3","7","20 April 2008"," Forgettable Sarah Marshall
","The writer/star of FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, Jason Segel, is the kind of artist who isn't afraid to let it all hang out there for everyone to see and subsequently appreciate or pick apart. He writes his pain on to the screen and isn't afraid to get naked on the path to true understanding. In the writer's world, naked is a fairly obvious metaphor for vulnerability but here it just means nude. And so, as Segal's penis flaps back and forth against his painfully pale body, moments before Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) breaks up with him, the Judd Apatow movie machine unleashes its latest raw comedy from the mind of the modern male.<br/><br/>This particular male is Peter Bretter (Segel), a slob who can barely pick up after himself but somehow manages to maintain a serious relationship with a gorgeous actress girlfriend and holds down a job as a composer for schlock television. He's not unattractive nor without his charms but he does raise the question as to how he ever managed to get himself this well positioned. He also has no trouble at all finding numerous beautiful women to help him take his mind off Sarah. And while forgetting Sarah Marshall proves much more complicated than Peter had hoped - it doesn't help that they have found themselves both at the same Hawaiian resort  he can at least have the last laugh by vilifying her as a horrible human being before the credits role. Without giving too much away, he will have the option, as the sympathetic character, to walk away happy but Sarah, as the heartbreaker, has been doomed since Hester Prynne was sent to prison with that darn scarlet letter across her chest.<br/><br/>If I were Apatow, I would be a little tired of hearing my name being attached to all of these projects. If anything, he should make sure to have a firmer hand in the process in the future. FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not without the hilarity and genuine character development that his past productions have captured so poignantly but its bizarre subplots and many rushed moments make it somewhat forgettable."

I felt sorry for Peter (Jason) that the writer made him strip thrice that too fr no apparent reason, but then I found out that he himself wrote the movie. I guess he had 3 extra scenes with frontal nudity written and when he cud not get the actresses to do those what other option he had. For me the second couple of Mila Kunis and Russell Brand did a much better job. Mila was pretty and Brand at times funny and adorable. But the lead couple was disappointing. The story is plain and simple and cud have been packaged in an hour rather than dragging it fr almost 2 hours.

"nunyerbiz","6","4","11","27 April 2008"," A movie with a good heart... but just too scatter-shot to recommend
","The premise should be familiar to anyone reading this, but just for the sake of being thorough: A television music composer, Peter Bretter (Segal) gets dumped by his longtime TV star girlfriend (Kristin Bell). This break-up is completely unexpected to Peter and in an effort to get over his failed relationship, he inexplicably winds up vacationing in the same Hawaiin resort as his ex and her new love interest. All is not lost for Peter, as an attractive employee at the resort might just be just what he needed.<br/><br/>Typical of most movies from the Apatow stable, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is somewhat crippled by a script that just can't decide what it wants to do... and ultimately throws everything up on the screen hoping that it all sticks. There is a story here that just about anybody who has ever been dumped can easily relate to, it's just too bad that the gloriously simple premise is under-minded by pointless cameos and subplots and general meanderings that hurt the pace while returning far few laughs. Even setting aside the Apatow stable of recurring actors, there are still a lot of scenes that just don't really go anywhere apart from giving Segal somebody new to talk to.. a bartender here, a chef there... Sometimes these scenes lead to a laugh and sometimes they don't... but they always succeed in making the movie feel somewhat aimless and confused. A few seconds later, and Peter is back in his room crying over Sarah. The editing and pacing is just all over the map.<br/><br/>First time screenwriter and leading man Segal does an admirable job when he sticks to the basics of his universal premise. Granted, the setup is nothing short of dumbfounding... As somehow he winds up at the same resort as his ex, and for reasons that nobody will ever properly explain, manages to score the best room in the place for free... but that is all a minor nitpick once the movie gets rolling. When the wheels really come off the train is when the usual stable of Apatow cronies elbow their way into unwarranted screen time. Paul Rudd and Johan Hill do little to justify their presence. I have nothing against those two in particular, and they have both done great work in other works from the Apatow posse... but here, they just distract from what could have been a much more well honed piece of work.<br/><br/>When the movie stays on point, you have a pretty respectable romantic comedy / breakup movie. Segal isn't going to be quitting his sitcom actor day job anytime soon, but he acquits himself pretty well in the leading role. His character is generally pathetic and self-loathing, but always in a ""lovable loser"" type of way that manages to keep the audience rooting for him despite the mess that he should only blame on himself. Kristen Bell frequently rises above the material, especially later in the film, giving what could be a typical ""cheating ex"" cliché of a character some decent depth. Mila Kunis is also surprising as the new love interest for Peter, as she shows some true chops that should make you forget about any ""That 70's Show"" typecasting. Last but not least is Russell Brand as ""the other man"". His character was so ripe for overdone parody, it's a credit to Brand that he pulled it off with such wonderful subtlety. With the few exceptions when he is actually performing his ""music"", he steals many scenes without ever appearing to try.<br/><br/>Overall, there is an enjoyable movie wedged in here... It's just too bad that it's so scatter-shot in it's execution. A solid 20 minutes of runtime could have gone to the cutting room floor and the pacing in general could have been much tighter. I had a good enough time seeing this one, as it did feature a decent chunk of legitimate laughs. It's just too bad that the days of a concise, character-driven comedy seem to be a thing of the past. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a lot going for it, but ultimately it's bloated running time and odd pacing make it a less enjoyable viewing than it could have been.<br/><br/>3/5"

","Forgetting Sara Marshall was one of the funniest movie I have ever seen. It was a very fun movie to watch from beginning to end. I thought that from the start of this movie it had you laughing till the very end. It starts out with the boyfriend getting dumped. Then he plans to take a trip to get over his ex girlfriend. When he gets to the place he sees his ex girlfriend. Then the fun begins. They try to make each other very jealous. I loved how the whole movie pretty much took place in Hawaii. It was very raunchy and had some great funny sex scenes. They talked a lot about sex pretty much the whole movie also. For the girls who go to see this movie they had a guy that showed his penis. The girls never showed their breasts besides for on pictures. I think that many teenagers and adults would enjoy this movie. besides for raunchy and many sex scenes it had some good messages. I didn't think that this movie would have a lot of meaning but it did. I loved the story behind this movie. The acting was very good and they were cool to watch. The visuals all mostly took place in Hawaii. The romance in it was good. In my opinion this didn't really copy off of any other movies. It was pretty original. They had many flashbacks of Sara Marshall and her ex boyfriend. Overall this was a fun and enjoyable movie. It's well worth your money."

This is not a bad film either, just that we have rest our faculties. I was reluctant halfway through the film to complete this, yet I did make it to the end, coz I just wanted to see a light hearted comedy after watching those big great films. Now, even this mind needs some rest and this film gave me the much needed respite.<br/><br/>In many terms, if I look at this from a critical perspective it is very average, be it dialogue acting or the whole theme of getting to a girlfriend, we saw this in When Harry Met Sally, and so many other films just that here, we have a different backdrop. Sarah is a TV actor and the guy Peter is trying hard to forgetting his ex girlfriend Sarah Marshall. <br/><br/>So most of things happen for our peace here, he gets a place to stay, falls in love with a different woman, and sticks on to her. And even before this, he tries one night stands. All is so easy in this guys life it seems. So that's how easily this movie was made and yet it was made likable. May be Hawaii, the backdrop of this movie was got me into it more than anything else. And this film displays may romantic traditions of Hawaii and I loved them.<br/><br/>Thanks guys, for making an average movie as this, coz at times, we need average stuff to find our self back.

"pyrocitor","7","2","4","16 March 2009"," All of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of memorable laughs
","While the melding of genuine human interplay, romantic comedy tropes and obnoxious male directed humour has seldom proved an easy course to navigate, with many such efforts leaning too strongly on one aspect at the risk of compromising the others, recent comedy superstar Judd Apatow proved particularly deft at manoeuvring the balance between them. Striking a particular chord of vulgar, bawdy humour and sweet sentiment, the unusual balance has recently become almost a subgenre in itself, permeating the recent comedy mainstream. As such, Forgetting Sarah Marshall (which Apatow produced) aims to keep a good thing going, striving for the same unique hybrid which past hits such as Knocked Up and Superbad championed. However, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, try as it might, cannot help but pale in the shadow of its predecessors, offering all of the heart of typical Apatow fare at the expense of exceptional laughs. <br/><br/>Which is not to say the film has nothing to offer comedically, but rather than the memorable factor of it is essentially reduced to two bookending setpieces: the much hyped naked break-up which proves the catalyst setting the plot in motion, and an inspired climax far too good to give away but which proves the indisputable high point of the film. It is the content in the middle which lags, with well intentioned gags such as mopey protagonist Peter (Segel) attempting to overcome his sorrows post break-up through a series of one night stands (though an exceptionally funny montage sequence proves a standout), and eventually fleeing to Hawaii only to find his celebrity ex-girlfriend (Bell) also vacationing there with her new beau (Brand). While the premise offers a tantalising wealth of comedic potential, the execution is less satisfying, with many gags being overly drawn out or overdone to the point of the comedy waning, despite the occasional standout laugh. <br/><br/>It hardly helps when the film becomes drenched in sentiment and a groan-worthy moral of striving for one's dreams being battered over the audiences' collective heads and falls prey to the typical Apatow pitfall of feeling 10-20 minutes overlong. Similarly, director Nicholas Stoller never appears to have an entirely firm grasp of how to treat his protagonist, both at times milking pathos and viewer sympathies from Peter's predicament while otherwise portraying him as weak and pathetic and extracting cruel laughs from his moping, making it more difficult to empathise with the protagonist. Granted, such a dualistic approach does accurately convey the mix of of sympathy and annoyance towards those struggling after a break-up, but a more balanced and cohesive portrayal would have made empathy with the protagonist all the more possible and appealing. However, such a double-edged complaint also mirrors one of the film's foremost strength: the authenticity and credibility of its human interactions. Scripted by star Jason Segel, the characters and their interaction with one another ring laudably true, making the film easily a sufficiently charming and amusing way to spend the time, if not as riotously funny as it feels it should be. <br/><br/>One of the later performers to join the pantheon of ""flawed, schlubbish yet earnestly lovable"" Apatow heroes, Jason Segel easily exudes easily enough charm to carry the occasionally shaky film, delivering a performance which feels both honest and irreverently silly enough to easily justify his upgrading to leading man. Mila Kunis similarly boasts a unique charm which manages to encompass being both abrasive and tender, making the romantic tension between her and Segel all the more fresh and enticing. Kristen Bell, despite struggling with an underwritten character as Peter's actress ex-girlfriend manages to bring a refreshing honesty to her performance, thankfully defying an easy stereotype to fall into. Similarly, Russell Brant raises several laughs as her spacey, pretentious new age rocker boyfriend, an essential spark of vibrant comedic life which always serves to benefit the picture. The same goes for Apatow stalwarts Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, both making hilarious use of minuscule supporting parts as an obsessive waiter and brain-dead surfing instructor respectively. <br/><br/>Occasionally clunky and overly syrupy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall remains sweet and likable enough throughout to make it worth its while, though it suffers by comparison to its superior Apatow production predecessors. Nonetheless, what it lacks in belly laughs, the film makes up for in heart, making it an enjoyable if slightly forgetful film worth seeing for any fans of the genre.<br/><br/>-6.5/10"

I'm with Sarah when she says she just doesn't ""get"" the whole Dracula puppet musical. It's fine I guess. The rest of the movie is funny enough that it isn't a big deal.

"ethanbresnett","7","0","0","3 June 2020"," A very solid comedy!
","There's something really quite lovable about this film. It's nothing revolutionary but it does exactly you want it to do. It's a goofy late night comedy that knows what it is and embraces this fully.<br/><br/>The plot was pretty straight forward. Peter and Sarah break up and in an attempt to clear his head and move on, Peter heads to Hawaii. Unfortunately Sarah happens to be staying at the same resort with her new boyfriend. As you can imagine, hilarity and farce ensues. A very simple premise but executed very well. It never felt overly corny or cliched, although it was highly predictable. Forgetting Sarah Marshall makes for a lovely, bite sized and easy watch.<br/><br/>A lot of this enjoyment is down to the cast and characters. This is the first Segal written film I've seen, and he knows his way around a comedy character that's for sure. His character, Peter, was simply a fun character to spend a couple of hours with. He wasn't overly mopey which could have been draining had that been the direction Segal decided to go down. There wasn't anything too remarkable about Sarah or Rachel (played by Bell and Kunis respectively). They were decent enough characters and both had enough back story and development to make them interesting. One criticism would be of Russel Brand's Aldous Snow, who I was borderline bored of come the end of the film. He's an eclectic character, and thankfully the film toed the line with his inclusion, which could have been too much in my opinion.<br/><br/>The real triumph comes with the supporting cast. So many great comedy actors in this film which I had no idea about. Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig (albeit briefly), Paul Rudd! You'd expect nothing less than excellence from these comedy veterans, and that's what we got. Hill's character was spot on for me, exactly my kind of humour and a real highlight of the film. Bill Hader was also excellent, delivering some fantastic dialogue.<br/><br/>I'd find it hard to believe anybody hating Forgetting Sarah Marshall. It's not a revolutionary comedy, and if you've seen other Apatow productions you'll be familiar with some of the character/comedy styles, but that's by no means a bad thing. I had a blast watching this film, and will definitely be watching it again. A feel good comedy which won't disappoint."

","Simple, but quite funny, and very sweet- Forgetting Sarah Marshall proves itself to be a very relatable and oddly unique comedy that isn't afraid to shy away from more personal elements. Jason Segel, as always, gives a wonderfully heartfelt and funny performance- and the starred supporting cast also gives it their best. Most notably in supporting roles, is Mila Kunis, Paul Rudd, and Russell Brand- who all make the most out of their characters. The film can be a bit hard to watch at times as it deals with awkward situations, some of which may seem a bit predictable. However, most of the time it is able to keep its head, and do so at a decent pace, as well as provide quite a large amount of laughter throughout its interesting storyline. The film does have some surprisingly emotional depth in between the humor, and is my favorite part of the film in general, as it handles its depictions of the issues involved very well. In the end, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is yet another great addition to the comedy genre from 2008, and is quite a loveable film with a lot of humor and a lot of heart.

","Actor Jason Segel managed to get this funny little comedy he had written made by producer Sam Apatow and I am glad he did. Jason plays Peter Pretter a film sound score musician who gets dumped by his popular and beautiful Blonde TV drama soapie girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell). He is totally devastated and tries to cope by going out with his brother and having indiscriminate sex with a few women but still feels in love and attached with Sarah. He eventually decides to get away and go on vacation to Hawai and by total chance books into the same resort as Sarah and her new Boyfriend happen to be holidaying. The accidental discovery occurs at the resort reception and Peter is devastated to see Sarah with her new British Pop Star boyfriend Aldous Snow. The very beautiful resort receptionist Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) witnesses the unfortunate encounter and her heart immediately goes out to Peter and she books him into the resorts top suite for free and gets the resort staff to treat him really well.<br/><br/>The friendship between Peter and Rachel develops and he begins to discover that his depression and ""Holding of the Torch"" for Sarah is not really worthwhile. He also begins to discover who Sarah Marshall really is and so does Aldous.<br/><br/>There are many funny scenes about couples discovering their sexuality and every almost every character has their redeeming features. There are lots of male full frontal scenes which is a delightful change for us females. I think the film is a really well balanced film about the breaking up and the formation of relationships. I was a bit concerned about the fact that Sarah had been cheating on Peter with Aldous for sometime before she confessed to Peter as Aldous confesses he had genital herpes in one scene and I hope he was just joking for all concerned.<br/><br/>Me and the girls really enjoyed this little film and if that was Jason Segal's real bit then WOOF!!!!!!!!!"

It's not one of those rude crude comedies that rely on nothing but cursing and nudity to make the audience laugh. There was a fine mixture of well placed jokes, that were well performed by funny actors; without being totally random.<br/><br/>The plot was simple, but kept interesting through the humor which consistently helped move along the story. There is also some surprising moments.....that i don't like thinking about.....*shiver* You feel sorry for the main character because of how pitiful he is, yet you can't stop laughing either.<br/><br/>Everyone in this movie was just so cool it made Sarah Marshall seem even more like a bitch.<br/><br/>Yeah this movie was freaking awesome.

","I started watching Judd Apatow films this summer, when it was a rainy day and my friend and I had rented a movie called ''The 40 year Old Virgin'' and I have been watching them since. I even saw ''Step Brothers'', ''You don't mess with the Zohan'' and ''Superbad'' without even knowing Apatow was included in them. Unfortunately, I did not get to see ''Pineapple Express'' this summer, however, my review doesn't focus on these movies, it focuses on the new movie in which Judd Apatow was a producer. I saw it this afternoon, and that movie is called ''Forgetting Sarah Marshall'', and it stars Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a man (Segel) who, after having his heart broken by his girlfriend (Bell), who is a TV star. He sets off to find a relaxing vacation in Hawaïï to forget about her, and is seduced by the charming receptionist (Kunis), only to find out that his ex is also there. I like Apatow comedies, and, while not being directed by him, features his graphic vulgarity style. The actors, particularly Jason Segel, are very good. Mila Kunis is actually good and I can't wait to see her in Max Payne, hitting theaters next week. But Kristen Bell has a little bit of work to do, as she sounds a bit more like a drama actress, but that fact is taken away when you look at her freakin' hot body.<br/><br/>However, this movie has it's flaws too. It reminded me of this summer's Hellboy 2, the Golden Army. Whilst it does have a nice screenplay, the story doesn't captivate all the time and that's bad considering that the classic 40 year old virgin captivated me all along. But still this is a very charming film with potential and it's very good.<br/><br/>So in other words, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is very funny, and I recommend it very much."

","Are those happy tissues or sad tissues? If someone comes up with a line like this, that is enough for me. I was debating with myself if I should watch this movie but it was worth every minute. I am not going to watch a movie expecting them to reinvent the whole genre. <br/><br/>It was a really funny, entertaining movie that had its obvious punch lines, but that did not make this movie less funny. Sometimes you need to watch just that. Especially Russell Brand was the extra joker most movies need. His little comments and his acting had me cracking up. I can not understand why some people on this board have such harsh critics for this movie, it is not that we are expecting another ""meet the parents"", you just can not compare the actors. But it was more than solid, is a great movie to watch with friends or girlfriend/boyfriend."

","Peter (Jason Segel, who also wrote this gem) is a composer of television theme songs. His longtime girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is the star of a crime show that sports his musical compositions. But, horror of horrors, Sarah stuns Peter by breaking up with him and moving out. Since Peter was completely in love with Sarah, who did little things like buy him a tupperware container to keep his cereal from getting stale, his heartache is acute. Needing a change, Peter decides to head for Hawaii and clear his head. Yet, when he arrives at a posh hotel and is greeted by a lovely hotel employee, Rachel (Mila Kunis), Pete soon discovers that Sarah is also a guest, along with her new love interest, Brit musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)! Now, how in the heck is Peter supposed to ""get over"" Sarah when he meets her everywhere, in the restaurants or on the beaches? Trying hard, Peter takes up surfing with a local stonehead (Paul Rudd) and even works himself into a few dates with the lovely Rachel. But, will his heart heal? Forget about the typical romcom rules and just enjoy this ""male"" take on the ups and downs of love. Segel should receive much praise for not only starring in this comic winner but writing it as well. Bell is great as the ambitious blonde beauty who is not as empty headed as one might believe and Kunis, with her huge, beautiful eyes, does a fine job as a possible new hearthrob for Peter. Rudd is a hoot as the 24/7 stoner while Brand is likewise hysterical as the full-of-himself rock star. The rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill and Bill Hader, is quite nice as well. As for the Hawaiian setting, it is beautiful to the maximum and worth the ticket or rental price alone. Add on great costumes, amenities, and direction and you have a polished film indeed. The writing is very funny, such as the scene where Peter signs up to help with a luau, not realizing he will asked to ""kill"" the poor pig. However, one caveat is that if you are in search of good, clean fun, this one is not the film for you, as it has many risqué, sexually charged scenes & themes. Nevertheless, for couples on the lookout for a flick to please both genders, here is a terrific choice, for it has plenty of raunchy humor and wistful romance at the same incredible time."
"eve_dolluk","8","3","8","18 May 2008"," Russel Brand = Comedy Genius
","If you are new to Russel Brand then you may have found his performance surprising as Aldous Snow. For me it was the reason I went to watch the film in the first place. Russel has been a comedian presenter in the Uk for a few years now and has been tearing up the screens with his eccentric humour. He basically stole the show and produced the funniest scenes. Overall the film was a good comedy full of silliness and laughs. Definietely not one to take seriously or to try and understand the major plot holes. Usual Apatow Crowd appearing everywhere within the film and they were all great specially Jonah Hill. I have to say that the editing was a bit choppy and at a few points you could tell that scenes were chopped in half and put in different places and times in the film. Having said that i wasn't too bothered as i was too busy laughing. I actually laughed for a full 15 mins at one point as every time i was about to stop another funny thing happened, usually involving Brand.<br/><br/>Storyline - Who cares Acting - Decent Believability - Yeah right !!! Comedy Value - Hilarious<br/><br/>If they made it any differently it wouldn't have been as funny. In fact the last 20 mins faded into insignificance as they tried to tie up the plot with emotional value.<br/><br/>9/10 for a comedy 5/10 if i was to ignore the comedy"

","Forget Sarah Marshall he doesn't, but get over her he does. So we all know the premise from the trailers, right. Guy gets dumped, girl has new (famous and obnoxious) boyfriend, both go on vacation to the same place accidentally. Hilarity ensues. Kinda.<br/><br/>There are some really funny moments in this movie. There are also some that are 'supposed' to be funny, but fail or you've already seen it in the trailer. Of course, some scenes are just too cheesy to be funny, but that is to be expected.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty solid for a comedy. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that is good. It does what it sets out to do. Entertain for a couple of hours and make you laugh. Everything pretty much gets tied up in a nice little package for you even. The story is a little too ironic at times, but it flows nicely. I enjoyed it and would recommend for a date movie..... as long as you both are okay with some very short lived female nudity and some longer lived male nudity.<br/><br/>On the Gargamel scale it gets 1 for story 1 for acting 1 for nudity 0 car chases and I don't remember any gunfire/explosions either... that gives it a 3 (double it to 6 on the IMDb scale) but I'm giving a big 0.5 for style so since there is no 6.5 I'm rounding up to a 7. How's that for favorable math?"

Great acting from all characters and I like how Apatow using some of the same actors in every movie.<br/><br/>It is by far the raunchiest of the Apatow movies. There's lots and lots of sex scenes and some nudity. Knocked up was tame compared to this movie.

It had every bit the heart that Knocked Up was given credit for, with half the annoying stuff (most of which is provided by Ben's friends).

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","8","23 April 2008"," Apatow comedy comes roaring back to new heights
","How is it possible that one man could be behind so many of the decade's best comedies? It seemed like Judd Apatow hit his peak with 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" a film that sky- rocketed both his and actor Steve Carrell's career. But the successes did not come without failures. While last year's ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" continued to redefine comedy, there was also ""Walk Hard"" and ""Drillbit Taylor,"" films that led audiences to believe he was getting stale.<br/><br/>But fear not, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" not only eliminates that trend, it might very well have established an era of comedy in movie history with Judd Apatow as the reigning emperor.<br/><br/>""Sarah Marshall"" is hysterical, gutsy, clever, sweet and real. It hits on all the things that make Apatow comedy successful while conquering new comedic territory. While it's easiest to give Apatow all the credit, however, Jason Segel deserves his encore. The ""How I Met Your Mother"" star has a terrifically written script that is powdered and pampered by Apatow's connections (the ability to put Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill in as small, very funny parts).<br/><br/>What Segel has tapped into about comedy through his writing is that there is no reason to be afraid of what is real. What's real is what is funny and then when you throw in some ridiculous twists through strange or unusually funny characters, you have a great, easily likable comedy. While previous Apatow films push in that direction, ""Sarah Marshall"" seems to hit it the most directly, especially in a film where the plot is essentially about a guy getting over a girl.<br/><br/>In addition to a terrific script, ""Sarah Marshall"" has a wealth of unique, humorous characters and young, sure to bloom after this film, talent. While lead actresses Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis have a solid amount of credits, the exposure from this film might very well shape their careers in the future. Bottom line, there is so much talent and humor here that when you try and recall all the best characters with the best lines, you find yourself forgetting some.<br/><br/>While Judd Apatow will most likely find a share of failures, the amount of great comedies will continue to emerge and the money will likely keep rolling in. Only horrendous reviews could stop someone from going to see something with his name attached to it. This film forecasts a great 2008 for Apatow Productions or at the very least making a profit on ""Step Brothers"" and ""Pineapple Express"""
"Mouldyman","9","3","8","23 April 2008"," A genuine and pleasing rom-com (with sausages)
","I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. You could see the plot coming a mile away but it was executed with such easy panache that you can forget how obvious the plot is, and just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked about the film is they managed the unusual feat of making the whole thing believable. The characters seemed genuine, even the millionaire lothario pop singer, and the action did not seem forced. There was just the right amount of sentiment, it was not gushy, yet there was the feeling the characters really did care for each other. I am not sure if the dialogue had any element of improvisation, but the exchanges, especially at dinner had a sound to them as if they were actually communicating, and not just waiting for their next line.<br/><br/>For me, the two most surprising performances were from Mila Kunis, who not only had a captivatingly cheeky smile, but brought some depth to her character, and Russell Brand, who made his character seem like a nice bloke despite all the very obvious flaws and callous attitude. I do suspect that Russell had an advantage, though, in that I imagine that is how he is normally! <br/><br/>I have seen some criticism of the film for shoddy camera work, but I didn't notice anything amiss, though I admit I was too wrapped up in the film to really notice. Other have commented on the fact that Jason bares all in a few scenes. For me as a bloke it wasn't anything that I don't see every morning, night and several times during the day, so wasn't bothered. You'd have thought from all the fuss, that he was starkers for the whole thing. In actuality it was only a couple of shots. Not really worth all the furore. The girl sitting next to me seemed quite shocked by it though. I think she was a bit excitable.<br/><br/>In summary, I found it a very funny film (after the first ten minutes or so) with a suitable amount of sentiment, and a pleasing feel-good factor. I would recommend."

"zetes","9","3","8","21 April 2008"," A sweet and lovable delight
","Judd Apatow's latest production follows a formula similar to some of his other films, but it still works quite well. What Apatow and his crew bring to the table are more fully developed characters, an emotional core and a refreshingly adult sense of humor. Kids can have their Meet the Spartans; I'm perfectly happy with this. Jason Segel stars and wrote the screenplay. Kristen Bell is the actress who broke up with him. Russell Brand plays her new boyfriend and Mila Kunis the new girl whom Segel meets. Pretty predictable plot-wise, of course, but the laughs are frequent and I actually cared about the characters. It's great to see the film not resort to making Bell and Brand outright villains. They feel like genuine people. The real treat of the film is the wonderful supporting cast and their lovable characters, including Apatow mainstay Paul Rudd as a stoner surf instructor, Jonah Hill as a guy obsessed with Russell Brand's rock star character, Bill Hader as Segel's supportive step-brother and Jack McBrayer as a sexually frustrated newlywed (his wife played by Maria Thayer, who played Tammi Littlenut in Strangers with Candy). It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it's quite satisfying."
"rebelscum97","9","3","8","19 April 2008"," Basically a chick-flick, but the guys have all the 'chick' roles.
","This is by far the funniest movie I've seen in quite some time. Jason Segel and his supporting cast are absolutely hilarious. Although the movie does have a very predictable storyline and ending, it was still a very original film. From the early part of the film, where we get to see full-frontal male nudity, which was so shocking that it was amazingly funny, to the last few jokes that take place during the credits (so don't leave until the final credit has rolled), this movie does not let up. I was laughing so hard during most of this movie and the rest of the audience was also busting a gut every step of the way. Jason Segel plays Peter Bretter, a musician who has a job that one may think is great, but he actually hates it. Meanwhile he dreams of writing a rock-opera with Dracula as the main character. When his television-star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell), dumps him, he takes on all the characteristics one would expect of a girl who just got dumped in every run-of-the-mill chick-flick. His buddy suggests he try to get over her by going on a vacation. He decides to follow this advice, and who does he run in to at the hotel resort, but none other than his ex and her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), a famous musician. Peter does not want to appear weak and run away, so he sticks it out and stays at the hotel regardless. All the while, he goes through bouts of wanting Sarah Marshall back, to wanting to move on, and back and forth again. I started off disliking the character Aldous Snow, whose songs are so lame and chauvinistic, that we are intended to hate him, but at the same time his songs are so lame that they are too funny. In the end I loved this character, who slowly becomes more likable as his down-to-earth side is revealed, and thought his interactions with Segel were among the funniest scenes in the movie. Mila Kunis plays Rachel Jansen, who predictably falls for Peter as she attempts to help him realize that Sarah Marshall may not be the right women for him."

I had low expectations that this would change that, but was pleasantly surprised. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Now the giggle here and there type of laugh, but the all out laughing that made my wife wonder if she should hold my tongue because I'm having a seizure kind of laugh. The best thing about this movie is the story line is just as strong as the comedic tone which is very very rare. This is the first movie in a long time that I highly recommend seeing.

","This is all from our website, mysocialstandards.blogspot.com/ if you want to see more...<br/><br/>All good things come to an end, and because of this, I know it's only a matter of time before these Judd Apatow movies lose their luster. The seemingly endless list of recent successes that he has touched include Superbad, 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Talladega Nights, and Anchorman. When you put those together with his TV successes, you are assembling one ""fairly"" impressive resume. Well, after viewing Sarah Marshall, it looks as if we (thankfully) are going to have to wait a bit longer for that ""end"" to happen.<br/><br/>Director Nicholas Stoller and writer/star, Jason Segel combine to create the perfect romantic comedy that satisfies both the guys and the girls in the audience. The raw comedy may not have been as high as Superbad or the 40-Year Old Virgin, but that doesn't mean that it was lacking as I laughed from beginning to end. As a writer, Segel made the characters extremely likable and easy to relate to. The magic in this movie is that you could sympathize with everybody from Peter (our main character), Sarah (the actress/ex-girlfriend), Rachel (hotel front-desk clerk), and even Aldous (the European rock-star new boyfriend of Sarah who may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but still seems like a cool guy) as they suffer from heartbreak, embarrassment, confusion, awkwardness and grief.<br/><br/>I actually had the chance to partake in a focus group for the previews of Forgetting Sarah Marshall a couple months ago, therefore watching the many forms of the trailers several times (at least I got paid to do it). While some of the previews make the movie look like your classic ""girl breaks up with boy and boy getting back at girl,"" (without getting into too much detail) Segel's script did a nice job of steering clear of that as life rarely allows us to act in such a way. Instead, that is replaced with criss-crossing relationships and complexities that even the best of us can relate with. And other then being forced to look at Jason's prosthetically enhanced 11th appendage about five times too many, I was very happy to be involved in these characters lives for the two hours of this movie, and there is a good chance I will see it again soon.<br/><br/>Writing: Writing a comedic romantic-comedy can't be easy. The genre has been done so many times that usually either a) they are all the same jokes or b) everyone tries to be so original that it just comes off as corny and unrealistic. While not a perfect script, Forgetting Sarah Marshall does well at keeping the characters real, not allowing the story to become too predictable, and including well placed one-liners to keep the audience off-balance.<br/><br/>Verdict: SEE IT TONIGHT. Bring a date. It is worth the price of admissionand an overpriced popcorn and Coke  it's only 25 cents more for the large after all."

It's a very solid film with huge laughs and few weak moments. I fell in love with all of the characters, I cared about them very genuine, lovable and 3D. I was never bored and I was actually in pain from laughing. Russell Brand is particularly good playing the dippy drug addled over sexed rock star, Kristen Bell was perfectly cast as Sarah Marshall and writer/actor Jason Segel was absaloutly wonderful, his performance made the film.

Prompted by his stepbrother (Hader lending able comic support) to vacation in Hawaii to forget his troubles, Peter only finds to his shock and dismay Sarah there with her current beau, deplorable rakish himbo Aldous Snow (riotous Brand, a true comic find this side of Sacha Baron Cohen), and into the arms of the resort's customer service personnel  namely Kunis (a truly good egg and engaging rom- com player). Hitting all its targets (Four words: Dracula musical with puppets) with parts salt and sugar - the winning combo in Hollywood today  Segel proves to have a fine ear for richly veined dialogue and situations in the self-depreciative mode; always a plus.

Let me say that I LOVED this movie, its cast, and the humor in the writing -- and I would pay to see it again and again if I could afford it. That's just how much I loved it.<br/><br/>Sarah Marshall is an actress on a show called ""Crime Scene"" and her boyfriend Peter Bretter writes the music for the show. She breaks up with him within the first five minutes, and he becomes this sad, pathetic, crying mess soon afterward. When he can't get his mind off her, he decides to go to a resort in Hawaii that she had mentioned to him a few times before, unknowingly arriving at the same place that Sarah is with her new boyfriend... and trouble ensues, as with most movies of this particular genre! I figured ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" would be this sappy chick flick peppered with some humor here and there, but I didn't give it nearly enough credit. It's not sappy, and I definitely wouldn't consider it a chick flick; it's got a little something for everyone (unless, of course, you're under 17 -- and I wouldn't recommend taking anyone under that age to see it, either). The humor is somewhat crude at times, but will still make you laugh to exhaustion, though the nudity often caught me off guard, and there are elements of a romance plugged into the plot, which will please the women who see this movie.<br/><br/>Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Bill Hader (probably best known for ""SNL""), and the unknown Russell Brand really came together and pulled off this hilarious movie.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall is equal parts drama as it is comedy. Jason Segel has created a character and a story that are masquerading as typical Hollywood farcical romantic comedy fare but in reality are so honest and relatable that when you walk out the theater door, you can't just brush it off with a gesture of ""that was cute"" or ""if only life were just like that."" Because life IS just like that. And if Sarah Marshall teaches us anything - it's that despite the confusions and frustrations and heartbreak in life - we should all take it a little more lightly, focus on the positive and open ourselves up to new experiences.<br/><br/>Thank god for the return of smart, involving yet fun movies.

","I heard about ""Sarah Marshall"" via preview, probably a day before it came out in theaters. I had also never even heard of Jason Segel, who plays the heartbroken ex boyfriend (it was a double shocker to find he also wrote the script). Nonetheless I did hear that Judd Apatow produced the film, so I decided to give it a try. After two hours in a theater I had the only Romantic Comedy (except for Love Actually, but that doesn't count in my book) that I could place on my list of ""really good movies"" (I use extremely eloquent language in my reviews, so if you are an inexperienced reader, move on to the next of the long line of comments made by wannabe movie producers/ directors/writers/actors/reviewers and those who just have no idea what the difference between Superbad and American Pie is (it's obviously the pie) (last parenthetical usage)). The ability of Apatow and crew to consistently make raunchy movies with poignant messages is unbelievable. As I thought, the plot was extremely run-of-the-mill (boy loses girl, boy finds other girl, boy has chance to get with sorry ex-girl, boy chooses newer girl), but I didn't give a spit (insert an ""h"" instead of the ""p,"" a loophole I found years ago). This movie was filled with character depth only an acclaimed drama, not a teen shock comedy, would have. The tremendously believable acting in this hilarious film was the most surprising aspect, personally, and a breath of fresh air from some of the cartoonishly stupid movies that somehow are produced (e.g. anything those ""Scary Movie"" guys create). The parts where Jason Segel pathetically breaks down crying in a number of awkward circumstances (one being after sex with another woman) had flawless comedic timing, yet dramatic authenticity. A new brand of movies revealed itself to me. Overall, it's a great comedy that is not for the feint of heart (a lot of out-of-shape man penis), and it is a film that can (and should) be enjoyed by any adult... just give it a try."
"Robert_duder","7","3","9","28 April 2008"," Cashing in on success can be dangerous...Sarah Marshall proves it
","Judd Apatow struck gold with the surprisingly witty and hilarious 40 Year Old Virgin and then managed to shock and make me roll in the aisles with Knocked Up but now he's rolling out his punches like everything he does is gold and that just isn't the case. His brand of comedy is pure shock value and you can't always say outrageously stupid, crude and shocking things and expect it to be funny. That being said Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a lot of memorable outrageous stupid lines but that is about as far as it goes. It doesn't have the slapstick lovable qualities that Virgin did and it certainly doesn't have the style or wit that Knocked Up had. It goes for something a little more shocking taking it a step further kind of like what was attempted with Superbad which most people loved and I thought it was just okay but it showed a downgrade in the Apatow comedy bit. I never saw Drillbit Taylor but from what I heard that one continued the downward spiral. I mean Forgetting Sarah Marshall's claim to fame was the fact that star and writer Jason Segel goes full frontal and believe me he does but I didn't find it funny or shocking but rather cheap and stupid. However it would appear as though people bought into it gathering the laughter in the back of the room.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem was the lead cast. Jason Segel was charming and funny as a bit character in Knocked Up but his transition to leading man doesn't quite work. He just doesn't seem to be right for the part and I couldn't help but continually think that Adam Sandler would have made this movie a million times better. He came across as cheesy and fake and it didn't work. Apatow films have this thing about pairing average or less than average looking dudes with beautiful women which I am all for but they have to have personality like Virgin's Steve Carell or Knocked Up's Seth Rogen. Segel can't carry a movie unfortunately. Kristen Bell is good as the love her or hate her former girlfriend and TV Star. She looks beautiful but her performance is kind of shallow which maybe reflects her character but her chemistry with Segel is lacking something. Mila Kunis looks beautiful as the eye candy and new love interest for Segel but her character is rather shallow too and she isn't supposed to be. She just doesn't get a lot of depth and I think she has the talent but they don't give her much and she doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Segel either...coincidence? Or bad lead casting? The supporting cast is good and not so good. I think the use of Jonah Hill who became an instant star following Superbad was a waste. He wasn't funny at all and he was annoying and got in the way. He stuck out like a sore thumb. I adore Paul Rudd's dry comedy and he is terrific in a sadly small role (maybe he should have taken lead.) But he is still funny. Davon McDonald is also quite amusing in a small role as the bartender. However there is an absolute scene stealer...his name is Russell Brand and he's an English comedian and he absolutely steals the show as sleazy but completely lovable rock star Aldous Snow. I mean the guy is kind of a creep and yet he is incredibly cool, and downright hilarious. I could watch this movie again and again JUST for him. He was awesome and had good chemistry with everyone including Kristen Bell. I would honestly recommend this movie just to watch him, he's awesome!! <br/><br/>I didn't dislike Forgetting Sarah Marshall...I just thought it was a very average story with some funny lines but a weak story, an even weaker romance, and tries far too hard to shock you into laughter. I think Apatow needs to take a step back and look at the true talent in his newfound troupe that he likes using (Rogen, Rudd, Segel, Hill) and find out who suits the best role and where. The point is it is pretty dumb and doesn't hold a lot, if any, wit or true comedy. Millions will see it but I foretell a downward spiral when it comes to the Apatow comedies and I think he needs to look for that special spark that endeared him to us in previous good films. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is as average as they come. 7/10"

","FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is the perfect kick off to the summer season of comedies as last summer's wonderfully entertaining KNOCKED UP proved to be. Plus, the film captures what it means to lose someone when you are least expecting it, and how the hurt can propel you on a journey which may eventually bring you someone who will really make you happy. And Jason Segel is a character who the audience immediately likes from the first frame, and you can feel his anger and pain, as he attempts to forget Sarah and drown his sorrows.<br/><br/>The dialog is very ""today"" in what young couples experience and Segel makes for a very entertaining lead with Mila Kunis at his side. Kristen Bell is just another ""Hollywood blonde"" in a sea of young blonde's in Los Angeles and is unremarkable as Sarah Marshall-except of course, to Segel. The rest of the cast adds to the story and the location of Hawaii makes for a romantic background. But it is in the final scenes back in Los Angeles where the film really has magic and Segel creates a wonderful ending in FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL."

","Proper comedians can make us laugh by being funny completely on-the-spot, such as interviews, podcasts etc I'm talking about the likes of Louis CK, Ricky Gervais, Larry David, Bill Burr, Adam Carolla, Patton Oswalt etc. If you ever hear these guys they are completely hilarious with zero effort and zero preparation. Then at the other end of the spectrum you have this rubbish. Give a guy 30 million dollars budget and god knows how many man-hours to make a funny movie and he succeeds in making me laugh a total of about 3 times. It is absolutely pathetic. What is worse is that these movies are cash-cows, is this really the standard of comedy in the year 2013? Crude sexual references and scenes every 2 minutes, none of them funny. The bulk of the script dedicated to couples having bitchy arguments and fake dramatic (teary-eyed) speeches about love. I cannot believe a man actually wrote this, clearly at some point in the process somebody made sure it was loaded up with this female melodrama so it could sell more tickets. Does anyone in the world seriously want to see a couple argue? Christ, give me 1 minute of Bill Burr's podcast over 2 hours of this carp. LAME"
"maximenigma","8","2","5","4 July 2012"," Far better than expected
","I expected this would be another shallow chick flick with recycled jokes and two-dimensional characters. Luckily this movie far exceeded my expectations. It is a funny, fairly original comedy with a decent amount of character development. It especially surprised me how both Sarah and her new boy-friend are portrayed not simply as self-absorbed jerks. In the course of the movie you will probably find Aldous a weird but likable guy, whilst you will understand why Peter's and Sarah's relationship failed. The flashbacks of their relationship are very entertaining because it will certainly remind you of a relationship you or your friends had (or have). Overall, the casting department did a really good job and each of the characters got some good laughs on their side. Jonah Hill's role was a bit superfluous in my opinion, whilst Jack McBrayer really cracked me up by playing just another version of his role in '30 Rock'. Russel Brand's character was my favourite, very well written and played. There are a few sex scenes and vulgar jokes, but they come in small doses such that it won't put people off who do not appreciate this kind of humour. Go watch this for some light and not too brainless entertainment!"

It is nice to see Mila Kunis, but her acting is poor... Paul Rudd, the stoned surfer is really good as well. Apart of that, the rest of the movie could be binned.

This lackluster film, about a TV composer who's dumped by his actress girlfriend, and inexplicably ends up on vacation, not only with his ex-lover, but her new sleazy boyfriend, comes in with a whimper, trots along at a slow shuffle, and over-stays its welcome in the process.<br/><br/>I've got a better name for this film -- Half Baked. It was underwhelming from start to finish. Every joke seemed to be aborted before it really had the chance to get off the ground. I kept waiting for the big payoff, but it never came.

And it's true that there was a bit I laughed at.<br/><br/>But generally speaking, a large part of the movie is devoted to telling the story of a man who is experiencing a great deal of difficulty in dealing with the destructive feelings he is suffering following the breakup of a relationship. Much of the way this is dealt with is actually very truthful and was not, to me, very funny.<br/><br/>But I did enjoy it quite a lot as a drama with humour.

"mcjumic","8","2","5","8 January 2009"," Cut Out the Ending and its Great
","Compared with the 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is both surprising and predictable. What's surprising is how a comedy can be so haunting, for lack of a better word. Visually, this movie is amazing, something that one would never expect from a comedy based on so obvious a premise. The natural scenery and other worldly beauty of the film's female stars give everything a fairy tale quality in the strictest possible sense: seductive and irresistible, but at the same time disturbing. This alone makes for the most effective break up movie I've ever seen (face it, break up movies that don't draw us in inevitably fail to convey the complexity of the situation, see High Fidelity). <br/><br/>What's predictable is how something so stimulating and potentially engaging suddenly deflates into an ending and moral that is neither thought-provoking nor, frankly, good. In fact, it's the ending from Problem Child 2! This should come as no surprise to people familiar with this team's other movies, where humor, wit, and insight inevitably give way to the depressing (unless you're a wholly uncritical person) assurance that the ideological balance has been restored and the unquestionably ""good"" guys have won. Only here, the Apatow ending is shamelessly tacked on to an amazing, and not simply good, movie, and attempts to overwrite the complexity that made the movie so good! What's more, it doesn't really make sense. Turns out the creative nerd is the good guy because in this world, the shameless objectification of attractive women is perfectly acceptable. Sarah turns out to be the wicked witch of the west because she got sick of her dull boyfriend, and is basically punished for being pretty?!?! <br/><br/>Fortunately, as I said, it is tacked on. I plan on re-watching this, only the second time around, I'm going to stop it after he gives Rachel the picture from the bar. That's the real ending to one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Schlubby Peter Bretter (Segel) composes music for a CSI-like TV show that stars his gorgeous girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Bell). Relegated to such indignities as holding her purse during photo shoots, Peter is nevertheless deeply in love. So when she tells him that ""there is someone else,"" he is devastated. The someone else is self-absorbed British rocker Aldous Snow (Brand), who could have been separated at birth from Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>After a tragicomic montage of meaningless sexual encounters, Peter decides that a trip to Hawaii would be just the thing to encourage him to live up to this film's title. But as luck (and movie logic) would have it, Sarah and Aldous are already shacked up at the same hotel when Peter arrives. Amid the chance encounters and amusing awkwardness, Peter meets Rachel (Kunis), a hotel employee who may be a romantic prospect--or just a competent resort worker who his pleasant to her customers.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>If you like movies that begin with a break-up and end with a match-up (and who doesn't?), then this is the film for you. But it is the midsection of the movie, the time spent in Hawaii, that is the most entertaining. The film is a slight variation on the romantic comedy formula: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy and Girl Both Go to Hawaii. Why so far away? Woody Allen could have filmed this story within a few city blocks of his Manhattan apartment.<br/><br/>Here's why: Since fantasy vacations are becoming so expensive, why not let the movies take us to some of these exotic locales. And Hawaii is one of the most stunning, a place where beams of golden sun bathe land and sea and make everyone look good--including the lead actors and lighting directors.<br/><br/>Segel, who also wrote the screenplay, gives an adequate performance as Peter, and provides some of the film's more embarrassing moments with brief(less) episodes of frontal nudity. The two women in his life are appropriately attractive, though it may stretch credibility to believe either would actually be interested in Peter.<br/><br/>Other memorable performances include Brand as the cynical, oversexed rocker, Rudd as a drugged-out surfing instructor, and McBrayer and McDonald as Christian honeymooners who are just realizing that there is a physical aspect to the marriage sacrament. Some of the funniest moments come with send-ups of the police procedural TV genre, featuring hilarious, straight-faced cameos by Baldwin and Bateman."

He is convinced to take a vacation to get away so he can forget about her, and ends up going to the same Hawaiian resort as Sarah and her boyfriend went to.<br/><br/>Mila Kunis plays the role of desk clerk or guest relations person and does the role justice. She has grown up to be a very hot young woman and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie was entertaining and funny and worth watching.

The end result is that Jason Segel in his first main role picture played the character amazingly. This movie is not a romantic comedy, although there is some level of romance, on the whole it is filled with hilarious antics and crude humour, two ingredients found in most top movies. I love 'How I met your mother', and am a fan of Jason Segel in the show but personally I believe he has stepped it up at least 10 notches in this film, I look forward to the next film by these guys and will recommend this film to all."

","The popularity of Judd Apatow and his raunchy but hilarious comedies are on the rise! This is another funny one that is also pretty cute.

One day, his girlfriend announces that she is breaking up with him for a British band vocalist. In attempt to get away from things around the house and himself that reminds him of her, he takes a vacation to Hawaii. Not only does he find Sarah and her boyfriend there, but he began his recovery by forming a relationship with Rachael (Mila Kunis).<br/><br/>The movie is very very funny. The comedy is a little toned down and not as vulgar and explicit as some of his other films but it definitely is not for people who don't like sex orientated comedy. The best aspect about the humor in this movie is that it does not come from only a handful of characters. All of the cast cracks very funny jokes. Like I said before, don't bother with this movie if you're not a fan of these kind of humor.<br/><br/>The plot is very similar to a rom com type film. The best comparison would be The 40 Year Old Virgin. So this movie can appeal to the ladies as well. With that being said, there is one warning. If you wondered why the rating box contain ""Graphic Nudity"" that is from the flashes of male nudity present in this film.<br/><br/>The ending is cute and perfect for the film. It is a nice happy ending for the film. Overall, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another worthy comedy from Judd Apatow.

","Generally American comedy films specialise in ""gross out"" humour, British ones in a more subtle, wordy version. This plays largely to type but with a nice twist, with the twist being British actor Russell Brand who does both.<br/><br/>Producer Judd Apatow specialises in a puerile, obvious humour which was successfully exploited in Knocked Up, The 40 year old virgin,and Superbad,all of which have enjoyed considerable commercial success.Afficiandos will not be disappointed. Mens genitalia are supposed to be funny, and spoof blow job videos hilarious.Yet in this simple romp emerges a comedy which does have its moments.<br/><br/>Anti-hero,and writer, Jason Segel pretty much plays it straight as jilted Peter Bretter to a very pretty, but less than convincing Kristen Bell as Sarah Marshall.However the stand out turn comes from Russell Brand, almost playing himself, as Rock Star Aldous Snow. Brand offers a performance of swagger, style, panache and braggadocio which steals every scene he is in. He has all the best lines and knocks a solid supporting love interest role performance from Mila Kunis as Rachael Jansen solidly into touch.Neatly combining wild excess, with witty wordy observations,Brand romps through the role in the same way that he would through a nunnery!<br/><br/>Some odd editing, and clunky scene changes do not detract from some very good, and funny, set pieces, and the story stops thankfully short of any moralising.The four hander between the ""foursome"" at dinner is by far the stand out scene with brand coming to terms with a particularly offensive ""shirt as gift"" with the memorable cry ""take my eyes but not my shirt"" to an over eager waiter.<br/><br/>Not a ""big screen"" essential by any means,but well worth a look nonetheless."
"Philby-3","7","3","11","3 May 2008"," Apatow lite
","About ten years ago romantic comedy started to merge with raunchy comedy Â– an early example was ""There's Something About Mary"" after which I've never felt quite the same about hair gel. Judd Apatow as writer, producer and director has become a deft exponent of the resulting amalgam, though in this case he and the gang (Nicholas Stoller, director, Jason Segal, writer and lead actor, and others) have not been quite as deft as they were in ""Knocked Up"", which had a semi-serious plot. Here we have Apatow lite. Peter (Jason Segal), a rather ineffectual, self absorbed composer of TV show music whose improbably glamorous girlfriend of five years, the eponymous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), suddenly leaves him for Aldous (Russell Brand), an English rock star with a vast ego and voracious sexual appetite. Peter takes a vacation at the Turtle Bay resort in Oahu, Hawaii and guess who's there too? Yes, it's Sarah and Aldous, noisily in the next suite.<br/><br/>Rachel (Mila Kunis), the gorgeous desk clerk at Turtle Bay, unaccountably takes an interest in Peter, who is overweight, depressed and generally unappetizing. But things bump along from there and there are plenty of funny scenes, before the denouement, which involves a rock opera production of Dracula using puppets.<br/><br/>A number of the actors are from US television and handle the challenge of parodying their TV roles very well, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis in particular. The absurdly pretentious Aldous is given some of the sharper lines, which has the effect of making the rest of the cast look pretty dumb. But the laughs keep coming. Like ""Seinfield"", it is a comedy about nothing (almost) but the lines are good and the scenery is nice. Turtle Beach Resort will be happy. We didn't get to see turtles breeding though, despite them being ""in season"". Apatow and co are entertaining, if somewhat on the slight side, and the raunch is kept under control, despite Apatow's determination to remind us of the importance of the penis."

He starts off by moping about his house and soon his job which leads to his stepbrother suggesting he take a vacation to clear his mind and forget about Sarah. Peter gives in and soon he is in Hawaii for a mini vacation. To make things awkward though, Peter runs into Sarah, who is also vacationing in Hawaii with her new boyfriend which makes Peter even more depressed until he strikes up a relationship with the clerk at the hotel he is staying at named Rachel. Running into each other frequently, Peter tries to forget about Sarah and start things with Rachel, but things may prove to be a tad more difficult as he has a hard time adjusting to the break up and Sarah's new boyfriend. I really wanted to like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and while I didn't hate it, it didn't particularly wow me either. I found little to no humour in the film and when it tried to be funny, I found the jokes to be stale and some of the same material got repeated several times which just got to be tiresome and boring after awhile. I also really couldn't identify, or like any of these characters because most of them got on my nerves with their constant whining and self loathing. I also found the characters to be really into themselves and self indulgent which made it even harder to like them and identify with them and find pleasure in watching them. I guess there were a few moments where the creativity peaked, but mostly the film didn't feel particularly new, or anything worth raving about. The performances while not bad, couldn't really save the film either from just being a mediocre film that could have been a lot better. When you have a comedy that isn't particularly funny, inventive, or when the characters grate on your nerves, you know it isn't going to be a hit movie and Forgetting Sarah Marshall was certainly no hit in my books."

Superbad and Knocked up are sooooo overrated. I cannot believe that people actually thought those movies were funny. I think I'd rather watch a Dane Cook standup routine for 2 hours.

"EUyeshima","6","3","11","23 April 2008"," The Judd Apatow Factory Produces a Genial Though Meandering Break-Up Comedy
","As the latest offering from the prolific Judd Apatow stable, this meandering but amusing 2008 comedy probably had one of the most irritating advertising campaigns ever for a wide release movie as cryptic billboards were posted everywhere with nasty diatribes written to the title character. Having enjoyed Apatow's ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" a lot, I am starting to realize there is a bit more of a potluck feel when Apatow isn't in the director's chair. This time, first-time director Nicholas Stoller is at the helm working from a script written by the film's star, Jason Segel. Granted the comic premise is not as fresh here as in the earlier films, but it is entertaining in a ramshackle sort of way with some moments of surprising nuance. Segel plays Peter Bretter, a typical nice-guy type who writes the music (or more accurately, the sonic tones) of a network TV series that looks very much like ""CSI"". The show stars his hot-babe girlfriend Sarah, and they've been together for five years, an eternity at least by Hollywood standards.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time in setting up the central problem - Sarah abruptly dumps Peter for Brit rock star Aldous Snow, and through the plot's key contrivance, the three of them end up in the same resort in Hawaii. Naturally, Peter is devastated by the break-up, especially when he has to watch Sarah and Aldous in post-coital euphoria in a tropical honeymoon setting. Peter does find solace in the shapely form and understanding heart of Rachel Jansen, the hotel's front desk manager. All of this is fairly by-the-numbers and reminds me of the tropical shenanigans in the inferior remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid"", except Segel as a writer makes all the characters likable to varying degrees. Aldous, as played dexterously by comedian Russell Brand, is a hilarious comic creation, a sexed-up, non-sequitur-spouting cast-off from Spinal Tap. Even Sarah comes across less as a vicious harpy and more as someone who felt she tried to salvage the relationship (although obviously, interpersonal communication must not be one of her strong suits).<br/><br/>As Peter, Segel has a doughy, affable appeal though not particularly arresting for a main character. When he's not being teary-eyed over Sarah or just plain naked, he has a tendency to throw away lines in a casual manner rather than deliver them. Saddled with the toughest part, Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"") acquits herself well enough as Sarah to make her character's fate more of a concern than one would expect. Late of ""That 70's Show"", the saucy Mila Kunis provides a down-to-earth sexiness to Rachel. Of course, several members of the Apatow repertory company are present and accounted for - Bill Hader as Peter's sarcastic brother, Jonah Hill as a waiter with a severe man-crush on Aldous (perhaps a tweak to his role in ""Superbad""), and Paul Rudd as a stoned surfing instructor (Seth Rogen is conspicuously absent). Funny bits are also provided by Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on ""30 Rock"") as a petrified honeymooner and comic Steve Landesberg as a helpful pediatrician. As usual for an Apatow movie, the movie goes on for too long, and the scenes with the competing couples, while funny, play on the predictable side, as does the inevitable ending. It's all funny enough but just not as focused as I wish it could have been."
"superbadmike","10","3","11","21 April 2008"," Is it possible for the Apatow gang to make a bad movie?
","The reason I saw this one was because it was another Apatow movie, and every single one of his movies are on my top ten favorite movies list, superbad being my number1 . FSM was amazingly funny , from the acting to the story. The best performances where definitely from Segel, Brand, Kunis and Belle.They did there parts so well, Segel as the lost puppy Brand as the could't give a damn rocker, Kunis as the flirtatious hottie(seriously is it just me or did she get ten times hotter since that 70s show), and Belle as the bitch ex. The most annoying part, was the part that Johnah Hill played, the waiter. Even thought I loved him in superbad, in this movie he always had the same boring jokes bout how he loves Aldous Snow,the funniest thing he said was when he was making fun of Peter being alone and when he is on the phone withe his friend talking about buying pot. And that was the beginning, so after that it goes down hill for him. The funniest moments where A: When Aldous and Peter are talking about the killer cell phone movie that Sarah played in, it was so funny I missed 3 minutes of dialogue, B: the part when he makes love to plenty of women and C: when Aldous shows Darald how to make love. Al and all it was the best movie of the year so far, great comedy with just the right amount of love( I went to see it with my fiend who thought is was only a love movie, but was completely blown away afterwards). Ohhh ya one more thing Apatow movies seem to be getting a reputation for showing more male nudity then female, superbad, walk hard, and now this all have at least 30 seconds of dicks being shown, and you know what? I think its funnier. Don't forget to catch my next review when I will be talking about Harold and Kumar escape from Guantanamo bay."

","In a hysterical scene, Sarah Marshall (gorgeous Kristen Bell) complains that ex-boyfriend Peter (Jason Segal) can't ""rise' to the occasion in an intimate tryst. In reply Peter (Segal) screams, ""Could it be that you broke my heart into a million pieces?"" I was laughing so hard at this, and at all of Director Nicholas Stoller's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Jason Segal also wrote the screenplay for ""Sarah Marshall"" which is probably the year's funniest movie. Segal is funny as Peter, and his script is smart, hilariously on point, and really very sweet. Segal as Peter also sings in Count Dracula affect a song from his angst ridden rock opera about Dracula, which Peter always envisioned with hand puppets. There is a kabuki-like performance of his play that has got to be one the most inventively funny moments in years. The punch-line for Peter is that he admits someone pointed out that a Dracula rock opera was funny. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a wonderful surprise. Peter Segal is going to be a star. As Peter he plays a sweet vulnerable guy recovering from a break up. He is about as vulnerable as can be with his numerous full frontal scenes in hilarious effect.<br/><br/>Peter's girl friend of 4 years is Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Sarah is a big time TV star on some ""CSI"" clone crime show. Here Billy Baldwin makes a great cameo as her ridiculous detective co-star. Peter writes the musical score for the show. Peter and Sarah are Hollywood's next power couple. However, this is about to end. Sarah breaks up with a literally naked Peter. Sarah pleads with Peter to put some clothes on. Peter asks if he puts some clothes on, will she not break up with him. Sarah reluctantly cops to seeing someone else. Peter discovers from ""Entertainment Tonight"" Sarah's new man is British rock star Aldous Snow (spaced-out cool Russell Brand). Peter's step brother Brian (charmingly geeky Bill Hader) urges Peter to move on. However, even meaningless sex reminds Peter of Sarah, and makes him weep. Dude has it bad. So Peter decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to get away from it all, only to find that he is at the same North Shore hotel as Sarah and Aldous. Rachel (stunning and spirited Mila Kunis) has compassion for Peter, recognizing him from the tabloids. She books him the $30,000 a night suite that Oprah usually gets for freethe only catch is that he has clean up the room. In hysterical scene, Rachel calls Peter in his suite and says that customers are complaining of a woman crying. Peter says he hears it too from the room above his. Rachel reminds him that he is in the penthouse. Predictably Peter falls for free-spirited Rachel, much to the ire of Sarah.<br/><br/>Peter is befriended by an endearing and strange cast of characters at the resort, most of all Aldous (Brand). Brand is classic oblivious rock star, and its caricature of sexuality. Newlywed and very religious Darald (clueless funny Jack McBrayer) is in desperate search of his wife Wyoma's (Maria Thayer) cl------. Aldous instructs Darald in a ridiculous montage on the beach. The genuine Peter admits to Aldous while out surfing together, ""You really are cool"" And Peter's surf instructor Kunu (whacked out Paul Rudd) says ""When life deals you lemons fk it!"" <br/><br/>Mila Kunis is totally charming as Rachel, and completely believable as the woman Peter falls in love with. Kunis and Segal have amazing chemistry. Kristen Bell really has the tougher role, and she is great. Sarah Marshall is beautiful, and a fathomless bitch. To her credit, Bell keeps Sarah light, avoiding the object of audience hatred. Russell Brand is over-the-top genius as Aldous. Ultimately, this is Jason Segal's movieliterally. He wrote the movie, and as Peter he nails a new age James Stewart charm. Segal as Peter is brilliant as the object of humor. Segal is smart and touchingly funny as a guy healing his broken heart.<br/><br/>See ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". It is the funniest movie of the year with a surprisingly sweet romance. Jason Segal is going to be a big star."
"C-Younkin","8","3","11","19 April 2008"," Apatow: King of Comedy
","Jason Segal is a relatively no-name actor whose biggest role so far has been playing a character on the TV show ""How I Met Your Mother."" He's now managed to write his own screenplay, get it sold, and actually get the lead role on top of all that, despite being a no-name. What I'm saying is, it's damn good to be a friend of Judd Apatow. And so far, nepotism seems to be paying off for everyone. No winging it here, Apatow knows some really funny dudes. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Steve Carell, and now add Segal to that list with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", a laugh-out-loud funny movie about breaking up. <br/><br/>He stars as Peter Bretter, a struggling musician whose life is pretty lame, except for the one bright spot of having a gorgeous television star girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Peter continuously finds himself pushed to the background while she lives the perfect life and still, he puts her up on a pedestal. So he is shocked when she dumps him. He takes it hard and after a terrible time of trying to get back on the horse and an on-the-job nervous breakdown, he decides to take a trip to the Oahu beach resort to clear his head. Only horribly enough, Sarah is also vacationing there with her British-rocker boyfriend (Russell Brand). Just as things look there worst, a resort employee named Rachel (Mila Kunis) takes him out for a good time, leading to a flirtation that tempts him to regain some confidence. <br/><br/>Sex and nudity gags are the movie's bread and butter (in fact the film starts off with one of the funniest male nude scenes I've ever seen) and it takes some really good pot-shots at murder mystery shows, but like ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"", the real charm is in the personal journey of the main character(s). A break-up can leave you a sad, pathetic, obsessive shell of a human being and Segal mines the material with a good eye for comedy but also sends Peter on a path toward not only new love, but toward his own self respect. That Peter and Sarah wind up reluctantly together again is another comedic highlight, especially during an awkward dinner scene and an even more awkward sex scene afterwards. The romance also works. Segal does a nice job of playing emotionally scarred and timid while Kunis counteracts it well with energetic positivity. Not to mention she is still ridiculously hot, as is Kristen Bell, who makes Sarah a little more than just a bitchy overachiever. And Brand is hilarious, not just in the heavy British accent he puts on but also in the laid-back and self-involved way he portrays the character. And Jonah Hill pops up every once and a while as a creepy waiter. He's a funny guy, I wonder if he has a screenplay in him as well. <br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is another Apatow movie about learning how to grow up and deal with life's curveballs, and oddly enough, there are a lot more crude gags in that process than you might think. What's interesting and ultimately winning about these movies is how flawlessly they manage to combine the two."
"tieman64","Null","2","6","20 January 2012"," Full frontal buffoonery
","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a sex comedy about a middle aged man who, seeking to get over a broken heart, goes on holiday to Hawaii. Once there he meets his ex girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, the very woman he is trying to forget. Hilarity then ensues...supposedly.<br/><br/>In some circles the film is touted as some kind of modern comedy masterpiece, but it's a slow, formulaic, unfunny film, and its song sequences can't touch ""The Wedding Singer"", the broken-heart film it infrequently seems to be emulating. Nevertheless, some of the film's secondary characters – William Baldwin, Jonah Hill and the always funny Paul Rudd – generate giggles, and the film makes two pretty great uses of male, full-frontal nudity, suggestive here of a kind of vulnerability and emotional nakedness.<br/><br/>See Paul Rudd in ""The Shape of Things"" instead, a recent sex comedy which completely re-writes the rule book.<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing."

","Nicholas Stoller has put together a great comedy, and Jason Segel, who also wrote the script, does a solid job as the main character. He's funny, he's believable and you sympathize with his situation. There are several hysterical moments in this movie, and unless you think nudity is something ugly we need to be protected from, you'll going to have a good time. The movie does what it sets out to do - give you some light entertainment - nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Comedies can something get a bit too silly or ""over the top"", but this on track.

"Mr_PCM","5","2","6","11 April 2009"," An Apatow-shaped hole in the writing credits - and it shows!
","Another entry into the canon of work from Judd Apatow, but the 40-year-old Virgin or Knocked Up this is not.<br/><br/>The presence of Russell Brand merely on the poster would be enough to put most people off seeing this film were it not for the additional presence of the name of Apatow underneath, but it seems that even his magic has gotten waylaid here. The film's premise has mild potential as it sees Jason Segel's Peter Bretter getting dumped by his TV star girlfriend and jetting off to Hawaii to get over her, only to find she is staying at the same hotel with her new boyfriend (Brand). However, what follows is a by-the-numbers plot line that is straight out of the standard Hollywood Rom-com scriptbook. There is little of the originality that made The 40-year-old Virgin such a break-out hit.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is barely a poor man's Steve Carrell or even Seth Rogen, with little of the hangdog likability that either of those had in abundance – to the extent where you wonder what Kristin Bell's Sarah Marshall of the title (herself little more than an identikit blonde) ever saw in him in the first place. Russell Brand is his usual obnoxious self whilst Mila Kunis plays the standard model new girl in Peter's life, but she at least manages to breathe some charm into an otherwise two-dimensional role. Apatow merely produced this film, and the lack of his name in the writing credits has clearly harmed this comedy.<br/><br/>The humour is less painfully funny and more just painful for large parts, while any time that Brand is on the screen is outright nauseating. The story plods along going in no direction in particular, seeming content to just meander and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hawaii, which the entire film feels like an extended advert for the holiday island. There are one or two mildly amusing scenes, generally involving Kunis, but do not expect this to live up to Knocked Up or Superbad; its pales in comparison. Perhaps Apatow has become a victim of his own success, as expectations are very high now, and this certainly did not live up to them. Had expectations not been so high, then possibly the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii and Kunis's charm might have made this film somewhat watchable."
"Mr_Censored","8","2","6","23 March 2009"," ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is anything but forgettable.
","In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" musician Peter Bretter -- played by Jason Segel of ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Freaks & Geeks"" fame -- finds himself at the receiving end of a dumping by way of his TV-star girlfriend, the titular character of Sarah Marshall (Kirsten Bell). It goes without saying that he takes it rough, attempting to heal his wounds by boozing it up day and night, slumming in a string of one-night stands and barely catching a glimpse of daylight. It's not bad enough that every time he turns on the TV or goes to work he has to see her face (he provides the score for her TV show), but when he decides to take off to Hawaii in hopes of fading her from his memory, she happens to be staying at the exact same resort as him, with her new lover, the charismatic rock-star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) in tow. With a little help from a desk-clerk played by Mila Kunis, he starts to come to terms with his predicament, while simultaneously finding new love and a renewed sense of passion for a long in-the-works rock opera about Dracula -- with puppets.<br/><br/>What makes ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" great, and what sets it aside from typical break-up comedy fare is that it's also a movie about finding the drive and ambition within yourself to do what truly makes you happy. It's in the same vein as other Judd Apatow fare such as ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" in that while it's got a filthy mind, it's also got substantial heart. This flick, while being an Apatow production, was actually written by its star, Jason Segel, giving it a very personal feeling. Nothing is overly sugar-coated, as Segel finds himself in awkward moments that are a little too realistic to be works of fiction. The supporting cast -- consisting of Apatow regulars and otherwise -- are as wild as they seem natural at times. Mila Kunis is stunning and sweet as Peter's newfound love-interest, while Kirsten Bell plays the manipulative, confused ex-girlfriend to a T. Russell Brand isn't so much playing the role of the self-absorbed, sex-nuts rocker, as he is playing a character that seems to exist within himself. Other, slightly minor roles from Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill and Jack McBrayer provide some of the more off-color humor of the film. Its a well-rounded film that will speak volumes to many people, regardless of where they are at in their lives. Segel's script keeps things feeling real, playing it close to the chest and not afraid to delve into the most awkward and true-to-life situations. Its ending is a bit clichéd, but would you want it any other way? Overall, you'll leave this one feeling satisfied and with a little left to chew on."
"Blueghost","Null","2","6","8 December 2008"," Universal Pictures message to teenagers;
","""This is how adults in their mid to late 20's behave."" Okay, I know this is another Apatow ""comedy"". Fair enough. But, the target market for this film isn't the adult 20-something crowd. The target market for this movie are adolescent and pre-adolescent males.<br/><br/>Which is amazing, since the film is supposed to be adult in nature, but really dives to the bottom of the cesspool with the sight-gags and some of the other obvious humor.<br/><br/>Having said that, and having thoroughly disapproved of most of this film, I can safely say that I did laugh a few times. I mean, even though this film had the F-bomb being dropped during much of Act I and a good part of Act II (probably rivaling Pacino's use of the word in ""Scarface""), the funniest lines seem to come out of the Aldous Snow character. Lines which, I'll add, didn't contain any cussing.<br/><br/>Look. I swear. Most of us do. But there's a time and place for everything, and even though I worked in production where swearing was taken to a whole new height (above and beyond sailor usage... in the classical sense), I have a hard time believing that the film makers think most of the public uses this kind of language on a habitual basis. But, like I say, the film's marketed towards teenagers, not really adults as such, but persons with teenage sensibilities.<br/><br/>I guess what I mean is that this film could've been a real gem. So much more than popular opinion and some professional critical acclaim. Like Jonathan Winters says, dropping your pants for a laugh only gets you so far. And yet this is what really bothers me; using nudity as a shock comic device really isn't funny. Yet by reading the boards and comments on this film, one would think this kind of humor was comic genius.<br/><br/>But it isn't.<br/><br/>In fact, it's really stupid.<br/><br/>Like I say, I did laugh at the more conventional and intelligent humor (what small portions there were), and therefore concede that this film has some funniness in it, but it's also fairly lame brained. It's like a sexually obsessed child writer was given a breakup story, and asked to write a script about it. The result is this film.<br/><br/>Directorially, it's okay. There's a few mildly inspiring shots. The thing looks professional enough, but also misses a lot of potential. In short the shooting style is good and passing, but it's not comical.<br/><br/>Why this film gets praises is not beyond me. But, however, it is disappointing. Had this film been released in the ""sexually liberated"" 70s, it would've achieved cult-status, but, in my personal opinion, would've been voted out of the theatres via lack of ticket dollars.<br/><br/>Call me a prude, but that's my take."
"jfmvp","9","2","6","4 December 2008"," The Best of the Judd Apatow Bunch
","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is an entertaining film, with brains. Please don't read too much into my title here; I loved ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" and liked ""Superbad"" as well. By a very small margin, I believe ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" surpasses the other three.<br/><br/>There are a few things that stand out to me: (1) the way the differences in philosophy between the main character and Aldous Snow are played out during their surfing interaction. Sure, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is ultimately a comedy, but it's nice to see how intelligent it is during that interaction.<br/><br/>Our main character is the heartbroken man that we've seen many times before -- shattered, and struggling to recover from a break-up. Though he's a cliché, we can still empathize with him. Snow, on the other hand, represents a different mindset and way of looking at the world: he simply can't stay committed to a single woman.<br/><br/>Guys, don't we all feel that way sometimes? I know I have. That scene is excellent because we can understand both perspectives. The loyal lover and the adventurous male driven by sex, not love. It's a very interesting dynamic.<br/><br/>I loved the Aldous character, and Paul Rudd's surfing instructor as well. ""The weather outside is...weather..."" Good stuff. Other funny lines too.<br/><br/>Also, I thought it was refreshing to get the other side of the hated female character. Sarah Marshall is supposed to be the character that the audience despises, because she breaks our lead's heart. But instead of making her one-dimensional and devious, we get to see another side of her near the final act of the film.<br/><br/>Sarah is a human, too. She explains why she's been cheating on her man, and we don't have to forgive her or condone her behavior, but we have to understand her perspective. The main character was a bum at times. Sarah's a hot commodity in general, and internally, she was just looking for a guy who would keep her on her toes. Understandable, I think.<br/><br/>And of course, who could forget that fact that Mila Kunis is so smokin' hot in this movie? Always a plus.<br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" made me laugh, but it also made me respect its maker. This is a film that develops its essential characters, and we should thank Mr. Apatow for that."
"brando647","9","2","6","4 November 2008"," Russell Brand is the Major Highlight
","Jason Segel proves he's more than just a great supporting character actor as he writes and stars in another highlight from producer Judd Apatow's crew. Based on his own break-up experiences, Segel wrote the film around Peter Bretter, a musician who is dumped by his TV star girlfriend (the titular Sarah Marshall). In an effort to pull himself from his miserable situation, Peter vacations to Hawaii and finds himself staying at the same resort as Sarah and her new boyfriend, English glam-rocker Aldous Snow. Through the course of his stay in Hawaii, Peter deals with Sarah's new relationship while meeting the odd locals and, more importantly, the cute hotel clerk.<br/><br/>As with Apatow's ""Knocked Up"", this movie doesn't have as much in-your-face laugh-out-loud moments but it's still got great comedic performances from the entire cast. Seriously though, the funniest part of the whole film was Russell Brand as Aldous Snow. That man was so funny, he stole every scene he was in. I also wish Paul Rudd (as over-backed surf instructor Koonu) and Bill Hader (as Peter's step-brother Brian) had larger parts in the film, as they were hilarious. Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis give great honest performances as the key players, so it all adds up to make the film of my favorite from the Apatow canon.<br/><br/>This movie is great from anyone who has ever found themselves in the same situation as it helps you see it all with a comedic eye. I loved the characters and we're introduced to Russell Brand, whom I hope to see in more Apatow films in the future. The movie did seem to wander aimlessly at points but it never became boring, as there was always something funny around the corner. It feels a bit long in its near two-hour runtime but it doesn't feel wasted. I generally don't go for romantic comedies but this is one of the best I've seen."

Maybe people will enjoy anything that the Apatow group comes out with.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad but I felt that some of the characters were a bit annoying and unnecessary. The story was typical, very typical for these kinds of films. As I said, there were definitely a good amount of funny moments but not enough, I believe, to save it from mediocrity.<br/><br/>See this film or don't see it. I really don't think it'll make much difference either way. Just my thought."
"DICK STEEL","7","2","6","5 September 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","Written by and starring a very naked Jason Segel, I thought this film would be incredibly easy to identify with, given that it dealt with a man who didn't see his breakup with his hot girlfriend coming in close on the horizon, until the very last minute. Starring as musician Peter Bretter, his relationship with the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) came to an unexpected end with her cheating on him and moving on with new beau, rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).<br/><br/>And for the most parts initially, it was easy to identify with, really, what with his failure to accept reality, and his brooding and incessant whining to friends and family, which are primarily set up for laughs. But the best bits of the comedic aspects of the story were included in the trailer, leaving only but the bland and tired one liners in the movie that failed to elicit laughter. You can almost predict how scenes are engineered toward a certain punchline, and that expectation drew away any semblance of a genuine ha-ha. The usual pop cultural references were just there, but gone are the honestly sincere approach at making a mickey out of them.<br/><br/>So what did Forgetting Sarah Marshall really get at? It was actually more of a classic romantic story instead, and brings to the screen very vividly, relationship challenges and issues in today's world, coupled with basic bugbears like Expectations. In a Hawaii getaway, nothing's worse than spending a vacation alone in a romantic location and bumping into your ex with her new beau in tow, living in the, horrors, next room. But Peter's luck took a change with the opportunity presented in a pretty hotel staff Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), who in movie land would be single and available and just about finds him attractive in a certain way too. So here the dynamics get set up as we play observers to two pairs of relationships in parallel - one where sex rules above all, the other just budding with almost everything being fine and dandy.<br/><br/>Until of course one looks back constantly over the shoulder at what was, and almost always start to appreciate things that once were. While it's always easy to do that and mope, it takes a lot of strength to be able to say no, and move on. We take comfort in the things tried and tested and sometimes lack the courage to venture out and take on life's challenges head on, but have to realize that moments that are past should stay buried in the past, and not forgo and give up opportunities to start afresh. And when you do, treasure it, and not be a dick. What I truly enjoyed in the movie, is how perceptions of oneself are likely to be skewed, where in many scenes we may sympathize with certain characters for being receiving the short end of the stick. But like how it takes two hands to clap, we're also presented the larger picture through revealing flashbacks, and realize that hey, sometimes we are selfish to always think about ME, and fail to see things from the other person's perspective, especially of loved ones whom we tend to lapse into taking for granted.<br/><br/>Never mind if supporting cast from the Apatow Clan like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill are here to lend comedic support to the film. Forgetting Sarah Marshall triumphs for its earnest reminder about the basic things that make a relationship, and the easiest ways to break one stemming from complacency and the lack of honesty."

","After chasing this movie I finally got it. FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is not like other romantic moves you've seen, nor like comedies and its far beyond romantic-comedies (as far as I got it). So, you might expect laughs as god as those form $) YEAR OLD VIRGIN or romance and feelings like form KNOCKED UP but you'll get something in between- pulling more towards feelings. A few GOOD laughs, many moments that cause you to grin or just smile but many where you're just amazed by the seriousness of the movie. I mean, the thing was to picture the suffering and love and fun and whatever feeling and it succeeded pretty good. With great acting, a simple story and a variety of situations in which the characters find themselves, the movie offers something in the middle of escape from the real life and the real life itself. What am I saying? Go see thins movie, you'll like it. Bu don't expect too much, just a movie with a few laughs and romance and feeling puring from every angle."

","My wife and I went to the movies in California in search of something to pass the time. We had no idea what Forgetting was about and no way of knowing if it was our type of film. We bought our tickets with the thought in mind we would walk out if it was bad or weird or whatever, just step next door and watch something else. Well the first fifteen minutes of the film were slow I thought and it was hard to see where this was going. All of a sudden it became good, the audience participation is something you seldom see in a film. One spot people were moaning no no don't do it. I will not explain so as to not spoil the event. It has been a long time since I had such a good laugh, thanks to all who made it possible. While everyone acted as though Sarah was the beauty of the film it was Rachel who stole this old mans heart, where did she get those eyes? My advice is go see this and enjoy."

If your looking to see movie that will crack you up go see Forgetting Sarah Marshall. So far, its the best movie I've seen all year.

","This is your typical fun comedy type movie. 
Don't expect great cinema but it was fun to watch.
Highlights were the Mormon couple and all the fun characters in the movie.
The full frontal nudity however, was not needed. No one wants to see a man fully naked. It's not funny, more like embarrassing to watch. 
there's a reason for something called 'tasteful' nudity.
I really liked Mila Kunis. I only know her from her TV show and the character was so annoying I never watched the show.
However, in this movie she comes off as very genuine and funny as well, and does a really great job.
All in all, I'll pack this movie away for a couple of years and dig it out again sometime on a rainy night when I need a laugh."

","Overall its a relaxed, cool movie with subtle comedy. Is a good depiction of what not to do when a girl dumps you. I had few laughs here and there and overall its a nice chilled movie to play on the background when you are spending time with your friends or partner with some popcorn on your lap. <br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was unnecessary nudity. There are movie scenes where nudity is important. It changes the tone of the whole scene and makes it memorable. The scene won't be perfect if the actors were not naked. <br/><br/>On the other end there are scenes were audience can say the director read the script and made notes """" add nude here"" and ""here"" and ""here"" for no apparent reasons. Personally, that's what I felt about those scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, if you wanna watch it alone, its a good one time watch and you can save it in your collection to pop it back up if you are having a party and want the TV on."

","It took me years to 'sneak' up on this film. I am not a fan of Judd Apatow films, and that is what kept me away from this one. But I found it by coincidence on cable TV and it was not as bad as I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Jason Segel as Peter Bretter does make the film. It is the story of a musician who scores the mood soundtrack for the show his 5-year girlfriend, Sarah Marshall stars in. Kristin Bell does a wonderful job as Sarah, who isn't as 'wonderful' as she appears. She is a real piece of work. She dumps longtime steady Peter for a current popular rock musician Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, who she had been seeing for quite some time. Peter has a rough time with the break-up and to try to forget, he ends up in Hawaii where Sarah and Aldous are also 'vacationing'.<br/><br/>The film has some neat funny moments overall, especially with the all supporting cast members like of Bill Hader as the stepbrother, and I even liked Johna Hill's little bits in the film as the die-hard fan of Aldous Snow. But the work of Mila Kunis as Rachel, the Hotel customer-service rep, glues the situations that occur together. I also did like Russell Brand as the famous-rock musician as every time I watch it, it's a natural role for him not unlike who he might be in such a situation. Aldous Snow is so fair, so even-keeled in his portrayal, it's sickening and Russel has it down-pat. Sarah, on the other hand, is a not--for both men in her atmosphere so that when what happens to her happens, it's a wonderful payback moment of the film.<br/><br/>What I could have done without was the bed scenes of the newly married couple played by Maria Thayer and Jack MacBrayer--even though I like both of the actors. I just saw little need for those scenes but really enjoyed Jack talking about it more than seeing it, as those scenes were much more funnier.<br/><br/>This came out to be better than I expected, kinda falls a bit towards the end with the Peter-Sarah-Rachel triangle summary. I find this better to see uncut rather than on regular TV, and the funny moments with some serious ones made me overlook some of the parts I thought dragged it down a bit."

Jason Segal is good, he nailed the comedy and even some more dramatic scenes, had both down. As far as Russell Brand goes, eh, I have mixed feelings about him in this movie, at times I was laughing, then in other times I was thinking oh dear god why is this happening right now. The script and the dialogue is funny sometimes, well most of the time, it's never really bad, just had its shining moments and it's alright moments. Now I did kinda take some issue with Jason's full frontal male nudity, it was meant to be comical, but I felt more uncomfortable then amused, especially since he isn't particularly all that physically attractive (sorry :/).

Peter goes to Hawaii to forget her. As soon as he gets to the hotel guess who shows up? Instead of going to another hotel to get away from her, he just stayed there close to her. Every time he looks around, there she is. Peter is stupid, Sarah is stupid, and so is this movie. It was so bad, I could barely watch it. I took it back to Movie Gallery the next day and exchanged it for something else. I say don't waste your time or money.

","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while however didn't get a chance to watch it till last night. I thought the movie was hilarious. Lots of funny parts so your pretty much laughing the entire movie. In my opinion the 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up were better but this one was still good. The only think I was upset about was how they didn't really establish Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) as the bad girl. When Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) breaks up with her and she wants to get back with Peter (Jason Segel) it was kind of like OK is this a good thing or a bad thing. Might be just me but I had mixed feelings about whether he should get back together with her or stay with Rachel (Mila Kunis). The thing that bothered me is when she talked about him ""living on his couch"" which got me to feel that it was his fault. I think they would have been better off leaving that part out.

","After Knocked Up and The 40 Yr. Old Virgin, I was surprised to see Judd Apatow's newest film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, maintain the same success as the earlier films. Try this as a surprise, Sarah Marshall is Judd's best film yet. There's far more comedy in this film than the previous efforts and the actors are perfectly suited for the film. Easily this is Jason Segel's best work and is the perfect vehicle for Russell Brand, whose Aldous Snow virtually stole the show and Mila Kunis, as this film was her best performance as of yet.<br/><br/>Although Aldous Snow stole the show, with some of the best one-liners ever, everyone in the movie you come to laugh at and enjoy. It was a pleasant surprise to see everyone have a happy ending and that the movie was actually really good! With Judd's recent effort, hopefully the way of the one-joke movie will finally die off and make way for entertaining comedies such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall."

","This being the first Judd Apatow film I have seen, I wasn't sure what to expect from this knowing that his forte is gross-out humor with a touch of a heartwarming message. After seeing Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I am pleased to say that is exactly what you get. It was gross sure enough, but there have been far worse. What is so surprising is the amount of heart and soul there is to this story. It really focuses in on Jason Segel's character as he tries to overcome his heartbreak and finds new challenges along the way. It is hilarious at times, as well as sad. Overall, though, it was quite enjoyable and makes a great date movie for guys and girls. The script was great, but Mila Kunis and Russell Brand really make this story work. Each gives a different type of character that you can love and feel sympathy for. Everyone is great, but these two stand out. So, go see this movie if only for the humor and the touching love story that has been missing in Hollywood all these years."
"teresaband","7","2","7","24 April 2008"," Very funny, but predictable
","It's a little tough for me to get a handle on how effective the first 20 minutes of this movie are, because the projectionist was showing it in the wrong ratio, meaning the boom mic was swinging around the screen like a bee that had been let in the room and was intent on following the conversation. A bee on a big metal arm like.<br/><br/>Still, once that got sorted and the distraction was out of the way (idiotically jabbering cinema patrons not-withstanding) I had a pretty good time with this movie. It's completely predictable, and in most respects like just about every other romcom you've ever seen but still manages to hit a consistent laugh rate. A lot of those laughs arise from the japes of Russell Brand though, who is a marmite personality if there ever was one, so if you have an irrational hatred of the man then you may want to steer clear. He does very well though, his character effectively being Russell Brand and appearing to ad lib all over the place, thus avoiding any awkwardness that his transition to the big screen might have resulted in (I haven't seen ""St. Trinians"" though, so can't vouch for him in that, he might be a roasted turd in it for all I know).<br/><br/>Also deserving mention is Paul Rudd, who is brilliant as always and comes close to stealing the show. And an entertaining show it is, ignore that it's horribly clichéd, forget that it follows the cookie cutter structure of every rom-com on the planet, relax and have a few laughs with it."

What Jason Segel has created is full of naked emotion and soul rattling, loony creativity, the likes of which come around so rarely, it's truly a wonder to behold. Every major character in this film has bad and good traits that come to light sooner or later and the hilarious combination of anger, fear, passion, artistry and hope for a better future explode in one memorable scene after another. I paid to see this 10 times and the last view was just as entertaining as the first. Hawaii has never looked so inviting. <br/><br/>The famous from television Kristin Bell and Mila Kunis prove themselves resourceful big screen actresses in their deeply played roles as Jason's former and current love interests. Russell Brand wows in his first significant US part as a self absorbed pop star who remains likable after all the trouble he leaves in his wake. Firm comic support is provided by too many other actors to name here (they're all great!). And Jason sets the bar very high for himself with a gutsy performance and an amazing script that contains many original and hilarious songs you'll never be able to forget.

I was planning to skip this one until a friend told me 'unlike knocked up, forgetting sarah marshall actually IS funny'.<br/><br/>And he was right! Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a pretty funny romantic comedy that follows a quite standard format, but maintains to be better than the lot of them. The storyline is nice and although in some places predictable, contains enough funny and 'painfully' true moments and situations to make you laugh. You should definitely go and see it! The only big minor point about this movie is Jonah Hill's character. It's useless and not funny.

"Monotreme02","7","2","8","15 June 2008"," Great sense of humour and charm elevate this above the average rom-com
","Judd Apatow has done the impossible. He has crafted, over the past few years, a series of movies that have sealed his name as a franchise; just as the name Quentin Tarantino attached to a crime movie means something to the movie going crowd, as such has Judd Apatow's name attached to a comedy become to mean something similar. Whether he's directing or just producing, Apatow and his troupe of actors, many of which appeared on his early, short-lived and underrated television program ""Freaks and Geeks"" bring a certain something more to the otherwise average romantic comedy genre.<br/><br/>Indeed, like most of the previous movies attached to his name, Forgetting Sarah Marshall features a fairly simple, typical set-up and storyline for a romantic screwball comedy: A man is dumped by his girlfriend and he decides to take a vacation at the same resort his girlfriend and her new man are vacationing at, all the while falling in love with another girl who is clearly far more perfect for him. But Apatow, or in this case, his faithful troupe of actors, give the film a little something more that elevates it above other average comedies. That certain something is a sense of down-to-earthiness, crafting real, fleshed-out characters that most of us can fairly easily identify with  because they are essentially playing themselves, which is more than often famous, older versions of us  funny, awkward, movie-loving geeks.<br/><br/>In continuing with his trend of giving lead starring roles to the actors who appeared on Freaks and Geeks and in small but hilarious supporting roles in his films  last year the breakthrough leading role was given to Seth Rogen  Forgetting Sarah Marshall stars Jason Segel, who finally gets a chance to showcase his true talent, and he certainly impresses. Besides delivering a hilarious, poignant performance in the film, Segel wrote not only the film's screenplay but also the numerous original songs that appear throughout it, including the musical numbers to the Dracula puppet musical. I can only hope that Segel will enjoy a slightly more mainstream success just like Seth Rogen has been since the release of Knocked Up last summer.<br/><br/>But the real show-stealers are the various members of the supporting cast. First off, the Apatow regulars Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader who are funny as ever with their quick-witted, probably mostly improvised comedic performances and who provide the flair and the extra punch with their supporting turns. Next up are the totally different, very British comedic styles of Russell Brand. Anyone who has seen The Big Fat Quiz of the Year will know that his performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall is just a taste of his comedic brilliance. And then there is Mila Kunis, who takes a sharp 90-degree turn from the annoying loudmouth character of Jackie Burkhart as seen on That 70's Show and who personifies absolutely the sweetest most lovable girl possible. Kristen Bell is okay but probably the most uninspired casting in the film.<br/><br/>In all, a very particular and absolutely hilarious sense of humour, along with a level of charm and believability elevate this film above the average romantic comedy."
"Quinoa1984","8","2","8","29 May 2008"," another success for Apatow and company, if not as spectacular as 07 releases
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the latest comedy of ups and downs with men and the opposite sex (err, women), is a solid effort, loaded with plenty of laughs, if a little too predictable to boot. Then again, this predictability has a charm to it; the central conceit of the picture is something of an irony: a broken-up couple, Peter (Jason Sigel) and Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), go their separate, coincidental ways to Hawaii- the guy to just escape to somewhere nice and secluded and typical, the girl to, well, have a week-long sex fest with her new British pop-singer guy- and the two find they're at the same hotel. So, they end up going through the most painful motions of the break-up right in sunny, surfy Hawaii at a resort where they can get drunk as they want, have sex much as they want, and both go through their paths of self-discovery.<br/><br/>Of course, we're on the side of poor Peter, who might be a shlub but is a respectable one; he's working as a ""tone-maker"" (not so much composer) for a CSI-rip-off show (starring Billy Baldwin! great gag #1), which Sarah is also the co-star of, and in his spare time is penning a rock opera of Dracula featuring puppets. And his heart was broken in the most inappropriate moments- right after being buck naked in the shower- which adds to the vulnerability. It's somewhat typical of the Apatow formula to go along with the guy, but why carp? Sigel, also co-writer, crafts Peter as a guy we want to get the right girl at the end (certainly not the hypocritical if beautiful Sarah), which ends up being Hawaian hotel customer service rep Rachel (Mila Kunis of That 70's Show), who is of course the right girl at the right time.<br/><br/>Again, predictable, but the formula works so well, so why carp? The jokes come with some intermittent lulls, and despite regulars like Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd only appearing intermittently in one-note gag parts (both hysterical for what they're worth), the cast holds their own, particularly Sigel as the breakthrough of the bunch. Most noteworthy though is the Lothario/pop-star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand, the real wild card of the movie), who is frank about his sleeping with whomever he wants, and is uproarious in that ""hey, he's British, and an a-hole to boot!"" sort of way. Then, of course, there's the whole lot of gags involving penises, dialog referring to penises (and sometimes vaginas!), and, most thankfully, a juicy Dracula song sung by Sigel himself. What makes Forgetting Sarah Marshall a good, if not great, effort is the how knowing the cast and filmmakers are with slipping in little things, improvisations and a general attitude that makes it OK to laughs at some really uncomfortable things.<br/><br/>It is, in a simplistic word, enjoyable. Did I mention a Dracula musical as its climax!"

","After being dumped by actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), a composer named Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, who also wrote the screenplay)tries to take a vacation in Hawaii. But, as luck would have it, she's there with her new boyfriend (Russell Brand). Cue the new girl named Rachel from the front desk (Mila Kunis). Does Peter try to get Sarah back? Go for the new girl? Walk away and move on with his life? Guess you'll have to wait and see.<br/><br/>While I didn't find myself rolling around on the ground laughing, and even though most of the plot is incredibly cliché and predictable, I found something endearing about this film. It comes off as a raunchy film -- especially with the full frontal nudity -- but has a lot more character and less juvenile tendencies than ""American Pie"" . In some ways, I could almost sympathize with Peter (especially the way he'll eat abnormally large amounts of breakfast cereal).<br/><br/>The Mila Kunis was nice -- she's a decent enough actress and very easy on the eyes. The lead was strong. Kristen Bell was a bit weak, but managed to pull off her part. What was really great was the cameo cut-aways with William Baldwin and Jason Bateman. I looked forward to each one-liner, no matter how bad they were going to be. This was really the clincher between a one-time view and a repeat. I'd be glad to see this one again.<br/><br/>I was torn on the Dracula musical. It was clever and I think this had a lot of potential, both as a subplot and even as a stand-alone spin-off if they wanted to make it. But I don't know how much I liked the idea of puppets, and when we finally see the finished project I found it rather disappointing. Not something I would go and see. So, Peter, I hope you made Rachel happy because you failed me.<br/><br/>Nothing new here, but a classic love tale and some decent jokes with full frontal nudity (male). If you like a good comedy and don't mind some smut, check this out. I suspect it will be better than Kevin Smith's attempt at raunchy humor, and I already know it tops the string of teenager films from the past decade. And if you need a break from Will Ferrell, here's a good chance. Although, sadly, since Judd Apatow produced it, there's some scenes with Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill that I could have done without."
"Panterken","8","2","9","11 August 2008"," The best comedy of the year: smart humor in a story with substance.
","In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" 'How I Met Your Mother's Jason Segel plays Peter Bretter, a man-child musician who's entire existence is overshadowed by his successful actress girlfriend, Sarah Marshall. She's egocentric, possessive and emotionally unavailable but naive Peter somehow oversees that, and when she dumps him codependent Peter's heart is left to shreds. Enter Brian, his brother-in-law who aids Peter in his quest to 'forget' Sarah Marshall. Well, he tries anyway. Little does he know when he advices Peter to take a trip to Hawaï, Sarah's there too. And with a new boyfriend from hell, bold rocker Aldous Snow (portrayed by British comedian Russell Brand)...<br/><br/>The plot's a lot more than just a clothe hanger for jokes, in this film the interactions between the characters really captured my interest. Admittatly the usual generic jokes that come with a situation like this do occur, the plot takes surprising twists which open up doors for original humor and engrossing scenes. It's sometimes tough seeing Peter get so easily manipulated and his feelings toyed with by his ex. It's though to let go, even if you know it's the right thing to do, so I'm sure many of us understand the fiber of the story. <br/><br/>The movie's not at all that dramatic as I may have led you to believe though, it's genuinely funny in conventional ways as well as weird ways. Plenty of absurd figures come marching by, Paul Rudd plays a totally 'cool' surf instructor who seems to have a very loose connection with reality. In one scene he 'philosophises' with Peter out in the water: 'if you get bitten by a shark, you're not just gonna give up surfing, are you?' Peter, who doesn't really get him and neither does anyone else, replies (dry): '...yeah, probably'. Then there's the puppet lovin' bartender, the prude Christian on his honeymoon who gets a lot of laughs with one liners such as 'Let me just say that if God was a city planner he would not put a playground next to a sewage system!' and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few memorable side characters.<br/><br/>During the second half, the laughs are dialed down a bit to make room for some pivotal scenes that are nicely handled by first time screenwriter Jason Segel. Despite Segel's involvement, FSM still screams Judd Apatow and the formula might get old soon if he doesn't move some stuff around in his next feature. It's hard to rank up FSM with 'Knocked Up', 'Superbad' or 'the 40 Year Old Virgin', most likely it depends from person to person because they all contain a lot of quality material. Neither of them is very easy on it's main protagonist, which is a nice change from the rest of comedies with substance but it does leave that sweet/sour taste in our mouths. All things considered FSM is the sweetest story out of the 4 and the most conventional, it'll not rank the highest in the esteem of hardcore Apatow fans but the direct opposite is true for those who aren't big fans of the man and his colleagues. FSM will appeal to a lot of folks and it'll hopefully end up on a lot of 'favorite comedy' short lists by the end of the year, I know it'll be on mine!"

They are either just without plot (Meet the Spartans, Scary Movie) or are just depressing and unfunny (The Savages). Forgetting Sarah Marshall is brilliant in its ability to provide a real story with extremely frequent hilarious scenes. The jokes range from subtle to obvious, and almost every single one is worthy of laughing out loud. The pickiest movie-goer and the most easily amused could watch this film and enjoy it to the fullest unless they are just easily offended or not into this kind of humor or movie. The bottom line is that I enjoyed this movie more than I've enjoyed most new or old comedies."

","I just got back from my second viewing of Forgetting Sarah Marshall (there was something wrong with the sound the first time) and I have to say I see it a little differently now. At first you remember all the funny parts because you know it's supposed to be a comedy but even still it seems more like a romantic comedy. But on second viewing you notice that it's really much more of a relationship movie and not even a romantic comedy. Most of the laughs go to the supporting players. The lead character played by Jason Segel, who I'm sure you know also wrote it, is just a guy going through a break up. So even if some of the situations are comical it's still kinda sad and you don't want to laugh at him. It's not a bad thing but if people go expecting to laugh the whole time I think they could be slightly disappointed. It's really a heartfelt movie about a poor guy who is trying to get over a woman he probably shouldn't have been with in the first place. The funny stuff happens around him.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is great. I've been a fan since ""Freaks and Geeks"" and I think he did a great job especially with the musical aspects of the movie. I loved Russelll Brand and Jonah Hill. I thought their scenes together were the best parts of the movie. And today I realized that the best chemistry was between all the male characters instead of between the male/female pairings. Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell are talented young actresses don't get me wrong. I just didn't sense a lot of chemistry between them and the guys. But that would really be my only complaint. Paul Rudd again is hilarious in a teensy supporting role. <br/><br/>It was an enjoyable movie that most adults should like. And I mean adults. I'm not saying teenagers can't see naked people. That's up to their parents. But it's about adult relationships that don't really concern them yet."

Even with the odious and totally unfunny Russell Brand, it was adequately funny, an unexpected change for a romcom. There was plenty I didn't like though.

But when she breaks it off, he gets very upset and goes on a vacation to Hawaii, to try and get over her. Or at least, stop thinking about her. Hence the title, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. But when he goes to the Turtle Bay Resort on Oahu, and Sarah ends up being there as well, with her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow, things take a bad turn. Sarah thinks Peter as come to beg her to take him back, but that's not the case. Peter starts dating Turtle Bay employee, Rachel. But then Sarah tries to have a better relationship with Aldous than Peter does with Rachel. It's a battle to have a better, more steamy and more hotter relationship.<br/><br/>Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis and Russell Brand are all amazing in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"Sandcooler","6","1","3","25 December 2012"," Not what I expected, but it has its moments
","Maybe I just get too demanding when it comes to Judd Apatow productions, but ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is well, forgettable. It's not any worse than the average romantic comedy, but it's not much better either. Ten minutes in you know how the movie will end, which is bothersome because you expect Apatow's team to reinvent this genre at least a tiny bit. But nope, they just follow the same old tired formula everyone else uses. The comedy is pretty decent, but not perfect either. Jason Segel is fantastic in the lead and does great with the material he's got, but the supposedly hilarious secondary characters never really take off. Russell Brand is only funny for the first two scenes, then you've seen it. Jonah Hill is better, but there you have the opposite problem: he's underused. This movie just can't give you a break. The full frontal male nudity is also sort of a desperate attempt to be edgy, a really uninspired attempt to distinguish itself. I didn't hate ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", but it's no well, anything else Apatow has produced."
"krissikrissa","8","1","3","24 July 2010"," Brilliant Writing! Brilliant Cast!
","It's one thing watching a typical rough comedy film; it's another thing watching a rough comedy that puts a lot of work into character development. Judd Apatow the super-producer of comedies has always been good at putting his own known style into a movie by having much more material then you are used to seeing in a comedy, a deeper meaning if you will. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a total gem to be honest and is not far away from movies like Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin, even better actually in some areas. And if we are talking about Apatow movies, i think this one is better then Walk Hard, Pineappla Express and Superbad. There is something just so wonderfully likable about this movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, she is packed with wonderful actors that play strangely believable characters. Seth Rogen step a side and make room for Jason Segal. Jason Segal is much funnier playing the dork that everyone is rooting for. Segel who's always funny in his hit TV show How I Met Your Mother gets praise from me for brilliant comedic timing and a great script that is totally in his own hands. Kristen Bell does also a good job here playing a person who seems as a one sided character but has a secret side. Same can be said about Mila Kunis (It's impossible to not connect her voice to Meg from Family Guy) and the always special Russel Brand who steals every scene as the Looney-sex addict Aldous Snow. Jonah Hill is also always a class act.<br/><br/>It's not only rich on fantastic characters, it's also hilarious in every turn. Nothing more complicated about that. The Humour is never over-done or forced rather it just becomes funny on its own. For example when Aldous was rambling on about the shoe he lost. Brilliant! Like every Apatow movies, it's rather long and suffers a little bit for that. The story is so thin that they could have easily made it quite shorter. The movie is also great in avoiding cliché's but that's always good no matter what movie you're talking about.<br/><br/>8/10 -- If you haven't seen it check it out now!"

","As wild as that line is, it's hilarious when you hear it delivered in this movie. It's one of number of memorable moments that you'll get from watching this comedic gem.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about a fellow who gets dumped by his TV-actress girlfriend. When he goes to a Hawaiian resort to forget about her, he learns that that's where she and her new rock-star boyfriend are staying - and he keeps bumping into them! <br/><br/>It's a pretty standard-sounding storyline, but the movie has plenty of gags and engaging moments to keep one interested. The fast pace makes it easy to stay interested. The movie is a bit edgy - so keep that in mind (case in point: there are some extended scenes with full male nudity of the lead, Jason Segel).<br/><br/>All an all, this movie was very well done. Not only are there are a number of laugh-out-loud moments, but you'll get interested in the story as well. Definitely worth a watch if you're in the mood for a comedy."

I think that these film makers may one day make some really good comedies, because there are flashes of hilarity, but one is left wondering what's happened to the really smart comic film makers? <br/><br/>For my money, a movie with more willies than breasts is also to be avoided."
"pianokid10","10","2","11","31 December 2008"," The Best Film of the Year
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is by the far the best movie of 2008. There are only thirty minutes left of this year, and because of this, I felt obliged to write my one and only review of the year. Overall, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a comedy classic. The premise itself is unoriginal, revolving around a man recently dumped by his girlfriend who takes a trip to Hawaii and meets his ex-girlfriend with her new boyfriend. However, the film had me and everyone in the theater laughing out loud almost every other minute. Jason Segel, the star and writer of the show, should become a star after this wonderful comedic turn. Kristin Bell who plays Sarah Marshall is also very good in her role. However, Mila Kunis (the prettiest woman ever) and the hilarious Russel Brand are the best in the film. Another high point of the movie is the numerous characters that pop up throughout the film such as Kemo, Dwyane, Koonu, Bryan, and the newlyweds, all of whom add their own comedic touches to the film. Each line of the film is so memorable and hilarious, and no other comedy has been even comparable to it this year. The movie is vulgar and raunchy at times, but also is a sweet and touching romantic film that should please everyone. Therefore, if you have not already, go see it. I saw it twice in the movies, and I've seen it six times since then. Make sure to get the collector's edition DVD and watch the gag reel and deleted scenes. All of it is priceless. It is simply one of the best films of all time."

Lets face it he just doesn't have it yet for us to see so much of him....literally.<br/><br/>Which bring us to the other talking point of this film, male nudity, it probably served it purpose to create the stir that it was supposed to create , but when you see it in the context of the film, it really seems totally unnecessary, especially towards the end when it actually turns redundant to the point of annoying. When you couple that with the lack of titillating scenes involving females the disappointment starts knocking of stars.<br/><br/>The other thing about this movie is the lack of the BIG, even the most regular adult comedies will have a premise or a dialogue or a scene which will remain in your memory for years to come and this movie just doesn't have them.<br/><br/>But this movie does have what you will expect from its Apatowish cast.<br/><br/>Well written characters and script (loved Russell brand).<br/><br/>Witty if not hilarious dialogue.<br/><br/>Elements of the hopeless romantic (its more rom com than adult comedy).<br/><br/>Decent Acting all around.<br/><br/>It just doesn't have what it takes to be above good despite what the ratings suggest."

","Characters: 2 Screenplay: 4 Cinematography: 1 Emotional: 3 Overall: 3.0 This film felt different than other comedies. While some of the script writing stereotypical elements a bit far, it still left a nice fresh feeling in my mouth. Jason Segel did an great job with the writing and pacing. The jokes are well timed, and range from vulgar to funny digs. Even though the cast is filled with those known more for their TV shows, there were good performances all around.<br/><br/>The film starts off with shocking and memorable scenes revolving around Jason Segel and his seemingly distance star ex, but slowly unfolds to something more realistic and relate-able. The ex isn't portrayed as a complete bitch and cause of all the issues, and each character shows themselves to be more rounded than you'd expect. Jason Segel was excellent with the lead role he wrote, Mila Kunis is charismatic, Kristen Bell is crazy, but Russell Brand and his character is hilarious.<br/><br/>The only thing is that you don't really feel that there really could be a relationship between any of the people that were. But that certainly doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. A refreshingly vulgar romantic comedy."

","I'd only heard of this film after watching 'I Love You, Man.' I googled the cast, and then turned my attention to Jason Segel. Realizing I had never heard of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I researched it, only to find so many of my favorite actors! Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Jonah Hill AND Mila Kunis all together?? I then rented the DVD and discovered that Forgetting Sarah Marshall is of the same genre as I Love You, Man, and Segel does the same quality of acting. I liked that he was able to get his life back on track, and find a love interest along the way. I was also happy to see that Sarah(played by Bell) got her comeuppance. Russell Brand also does a fantastic job, considering his love for sex in real life. Anyone in the mood for lots of goofy sex scenes will enjoy this movie!"

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is basically another film Judd Apatow produced comedy with a roundabout of the same humor. This stars Jason Segel (surprisingly good) as a guy who's desperately heartbroken after a break-up and needs to refresh his whole life, and so he decides to go to Hawaii to seek out new interest.<br/><br/>Now, I never go into a comedy with high hopes, because I always end up disappointed - luckily, with this I got myself a good laugh. It's standard procedure sure, and the film does lend heavily on the romantic button at several occasions, but still there's lots to laugh at when mentioned Segel, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. There were a few laughs, some minor some rather bigger but not enough for it too be that great. The females were played out by Kristen Bell and the sweet Mila Kunis, does only provide positively for the issues regarding romance, and not for the issues regarding comedy or mildly affecting drama, note: mildly. Their were some real awkward scenes and some other good scenes. One thing that was weird is how everywhere he went, Sarah Marshall was their. First he goes to Hawaii to forget about her, and he ends up running into her. Then, he rents a room and it ends up being the room right next to her. Weird and sorta unrealistic? Also he goes for a yoga class and she and Aldous Snow is there. Then he later goes to dinner and she's right there in front of him. Very strange. Also since she's a TV star, her show was usually on TV when he was watching. He couldn't get her out of his mind.<br/><br/>One thing that was weird was her character, she didn't seem that mean but they explained that she broke up his 5+ year relationship and during the last year, she was sleeping with Aldous. I though her character (Sarah Marshall) could have been meaner and more of a b****. Perhaps Kristen Bell wasn't the right choice. The ending was also really weird. She started having feelings for him again and likewise with him but he like Mila Kunis (Rachel) she he ended up getting with her. Not that surprising but somewhat surprising. Overall it was a decent movie, I enjoyed at parts it but it could have been better! After a rewatch (03/31/17') this film is more well rounded and the writing is quite good, more so of a mature comedy than what we are used to seeing in past years (such as Adam Sandler films). Rating changed from 6/10 to 7/10. For another watch 06 26 19' this film remains an enjoyable and at times funny film. Although somewhat unrealistic there are enough decent and watchable moments."
"jameshubbell-1","8","1","4","5 November 2009"," See it!
","I didn't expect much from this movie, just to waste an hour or two since the choices on other channels sucked. And yet, I ended up liking this movie quite a lot!<br/><br/>I've noticed that a few professional critics take the film to task for it's ""sophomoric"" and explicit humor. Listen, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" ain't Fellini or ""Citizen Kane"" or some high falutin' BBC costume drama, nor does it have to be. Movies can be fun and silly and sex-oriented, and that's just fine. ""Animal House"", anyone? Hey, it's now considered a classic! And no one (except for, perhaps, Chris Farley) was as juvenile as John Belushi.<br/><br/>As far as the nudity and masturbation jokes go, in my youth the bar for this genre of movies was set by ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" If you recall, Judge Reinhold jerked off in the bathroom while fantasizing about Phoebe Cates's breasts - and that was almost 28 years ago (and set in HIGH SCHOOL!) ""Sarah Marshall"" isn't any more explicit than ""Porky's"" (COLLEGE STUDENTS!) At least we're talking about young ADULTS here, and oftentimes the humor of that age IS sophomoric. So what? Not every 24-year-old can be Noel Coward, for Pete's sake.<br/><br/>The main characters in ""Sarah Marshall"" are fairly original, even if some of the minor ones are variations on well-established Hollywood stereotypes.<br/><br/>I found all the characters engaging - even the narcissistic British rock putz. I'm not all that familiar with actor/comic Russell Brand, but he really won me over in this film.<br/><br/>I was pleased to see Kristin Bell and Paul Rudd. I always enjoy Rudd, even in a throw-away role like his empty-headed stoner here (it seems to be genetically impossible for Rudd NOT to be charming in films OR in real life. Anyone see him on ""The Daily Show"" a few months ago?)<br/><br/>Kristen Bell has a bright future in show biz, as far as I can tell. If you haven't seen David Mamet's ""Spartan"", you absolutely should: she'll blow you away with her raw performance. She matches Val Kilmer scene-for-scene, which is pretty amazing given his legendary intensity. I knew then I was watching a serious young talent. Also, look for Bell in an old HBO ""Deadwood"" episode (if you get the chance), ""Suffer the Little Children"", where she plays a teenage con-artist who deservedly comes to a bad end. That's the first time I noticed her. Unlike too many Hollywood starlets, she's more than just a pretty face.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is a talented writer/actor. He projects a real vulnerability and decency (even when his character is, frankly, kind of creepy.) And sorry, all you nudity prudes: I, for one, admire his egalitarian willingness to go full-frontal. Now, if Segel can (or wants to) stretch beyond the comedy genre? Well, that remains to be seen . . . unlike his Johnson.<br/><br/>Watch ""Sarah Marshall."" You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
"Hick_N_Hixville","7","1","4","11 October 2009"," A Funny Movie That Could Do Without Jason Segel's Unsightly Penis.
","You will never see Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise bear all in front of a camera, but actors who have big flaccid penises are not afraid to wag them on screen nowadays. Ewan McGregor does, and now Jason Segel torments us with his. If you can stand looking as his bratwurst flop about harmlessly while his girlfriend outlines the reasons she is dumping him, then the rest of this movie is pretty enjoyable.<br/><br/>I don't really get why this is necessary. Jason Segel is not some ripped stud that anyone (straight woman or gay male) would likely want to see naked and unerect. Maybe it's because the writers of this movie thought it would be FUNNY to see a moderately flabby beer buddy type like Jason Segel lounge around naked and limp on screen. It's just boring. If I have to see a penis, I would rather see an audience in a theater laugh at some matinée idol's small one being fleetingly displayed. Suck it up Tom, and just do it."

The plot is very simple but is also quite realistic, probably the most realistic comedy in recent years.<br/><br/>I've watched this many times and jokes don't lose their funny on me. The characters are well thought out and are very three-dimensional and the actors definitely understood their role in everything.<br/><br/>I'm pretty damn sure this will never get old for me so I feel it's safe to highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone looking for a guy-frienly rom-com as well as a funny and heart-felt character study of sorts."

Jason Segel (Peter) plays the ""lazy average dude"" well, showing the hurt, desires, and frustrations most guys go through in a break up. Kristen Bell (Sarah Marshall) is the TV star celebrity who didn't know what she had in her relationship till she threw it away. Mila Kunis plays the hawaiian hotel worker who eventually hits it off with Peter. She is insanely hot and plays the chill, ""guy's girl"" as well as I've ever seen. I hope to see her in upcoming female lead roles. Finally, Russell Brand is the hilarious British rock star who's contrasting views about women and life with Peter carry the movie well. Throw in Jonah Hill for his always- funny awkward interactions as a side character and you've got a great comedy. <br/><br/>It was one of those comedies where I actually found myself wondering, ""How is it going to end?"". Oh, and not to spoil anything but the Dracula play at the end was hilarious. I heard Jason Segel really wrote that song.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie for men and women to enjoy.

Well, if you're like me you just know him for his role in Knocked Up as one of the gang of funny dudes. I guess Seth Rogen could have been just about right here playing the main role (the character that is ""forgetting Sarah Marshall"") but this is Segel's film, he wrote it, he ""took"" Rogen's ""place"" and damn he had a great time, I mean Kristen Bell and MILA KUNIS!<br/><br/>I really loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall and frankly I wasn't expecting anything less. Saying that Segel took Rogen's place can mean that here Segel's character, Peter Bretter, is the one with really funny friends, you know Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader are here but actually here is not like in the 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up since here there is not a group of friends, it's basically Peter alone going to Hawaii after hearing from his girlfriend of 5 years, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), that she found someone else. Peter is a musician, currently composing the music for the show in which Sarah stars, so basically and at first sight Peter is simply the victim of a TV star whore, yeah at first sight Sarah is nothing better than that. So we go to Hawaii with our main character, trying to change the bad time he was having in LA yet some few minutes in the Hawaiian hotel and we see Peter and Sarah face to face, Peter meets Sarah's new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), Hawaii will be basically a crying all time type of vacation for Peter. However from the moment he realized that Sarah was also in Hawaii a woman have been acting really, really nice with him, a perfect woman (played by Kunis) and of course it will be just matter of time foryou know, and while Peter and Rachel, Kunis' character certainly, start to hang out, have a good time together the relation of Sarah and Snow starts to go down. Was expected then now, and with the cancellation of the Sarah's show Crime Scene, things are not going to be fine for the, still for us, whore that leaved out main character and I say ""still"" because at this point when Sarah begins to miss Peter of course we are like, well before I write anything I better add that we find out, at the same time that Peter, that Snow slept with Sarah for a year, she cheated our character a whole year! So yeah, poor Peterbut, and is a big but, then we hear Sarah and damn she speaks to Peter in a great way, he was just a f****** stupid and certainly for us was since always the victim. But of course the past is just the past and here our character will be act like an idiot again, now for some moments forgetting Rachel, he will ruin things, and that means it's time for Dracula, time for puppets!<br/><br/>Segel basically did whatever he wanted, we have him flashing, singing his Dracula songs, the results are hilarious. And back with the three supportive funny dudes, well Bill Hader, who plays Peter's stepbrother, is quite funny doing team with Liz Cackowski (and getting all f****** excited while singing the Dracula musical!), Paul Rudd delivers some good laughs but he is almost not worthy to mention, on the contrary Jonah Hill is, like always, being himself and delivering fantastic hilarious moments (also worthy to mention the fun with Jack McBrayer. Poor dude, now that's suffering, and later on enjoying, a honeymoon!). But really the characters of Rudd and Hill make a nice friendship with Peter (his real Hawaiian pals are two very funny big dudes. For one of them Peter is like Gandhi but even better! Isn't that friendship?), Rudd's is a surfer who suffers a bit of amnesia (drugs are bad, mmmkayy?) and Hill's character is basically in love with Aldous Snow (loved basically all the jokes with these two). And, for me, Russell Brand steals the film""I hate your music"" ""well, I f**** the housekeeper""."

His attraction to the weird rocker (I don't know his name) is one of the funniest aspects of this movie. I'm not a fan of Jason Segel (don't like him in How I Met Your Mother) and this movie didn't really change my mind either. 6 stars is a generous rating from me. It's fairly generic in its approach and really nothing in it is surprising or really entertaining."

","Recap: Musician Peter is dating TV-star Sarah Marshall, star of the popular series Crime Scene. They have been a happy couple for five years, or so Peter believes anyway. But one day, according to Peter out of the blue, he gets dumped by Sarah. Against all advice he goes to Hawaii, to the same hotel where Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous Snow, is on vacation. Severely unhappy, Peter soon realizes that it will get worse before it gets better.<br/><br/>Comments: This is another piece of evidence that Jason Segel , both starring in and writing this movie, is an emerging star on the comedy heaven. Here he has put together a really nice story, and it actually is a story. I almost expected that it would be one joke after another in a pointless stream, but no, Forgetting Sarah Marshall actual got a real story. And, of course, a lot of jokes too. But they are not independent of another, they work together and so achieving much more success. Because this movie is really funny.<br/><br/>It got a real good cast too. As mentioned, Segel plays the main character of Peter and does it real well. He got two beautiful ladies supporting him in Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell, but also Russell Brand that really has a great character to work with. Also there a lot of minor characters that add flavor and laughter to this comedy.<br/><br/>It is this combination of simple jokes and complexity of a story and characters that makes the movie great. It doesn't repeat itself, it is not a copy from other movies. It is both brand new and entirely familiar at the same time.<br/><br/>I recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Before I start this review, I want to tell a brief story. When I was 13, I got into a relationship with a wonderful girl, who just so happened to be my first girlfriend. We went through high school together, until the 4th of July 2008, I presented her with an engagement ring. I don't think I had a single doubt in my mind at that moment. Before the Christmas of 2008, we broke up, having been in a 5 year relationship. As of this review, I am 18 and still trying to get over what I thought would have been a great relationship. I tell this story not to be a downer; I tell it because it helped me understand the character in the movie so much more than I ever would have.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a brilliant comedy created by the Apatow team and written by Jason Segel, who plays the lovable Peter Bretter in the movie. Peter is in a relationship with the beautiful Sarah Marshall, played very well by Kristin Bell. Sarah Marshall is a famous actress on a hit TV show and Peter, her boyfriend, composes the music for the show. Peter's life is going swimmingly up until Sarah breaks up with him.<br/><br/>Peter, torn up by the relationship that should have been, gets told by his step brother, played by the very funny Bill Hader, that he should go out dating, and when that goes sour, go and relax somewhere nice. Peter goes to Hawaii to forget all about Sarah, but runs into her... and her new fling, famous British rock star Aldous Snow, played by the very rock star looking Russell Brand. Peter isn't adjusting much better, but a lovely hotel clerk, played by ""That 70's Show""'s Mila Kunis tries to help him adjust to a relationship he goes he can get out of.<br/><br/>I will admit, when I saw this movie in previews, I was skeptical, but the movie was earning rave reviews, and I had planned to watch it at sometime. Now that I am single, I feel like this movie spoke more to me than what it could have done if I was still in a relationship. The moments with Peter's sadness was probably done for humor; I honestly felt myself laugh for a few seconds, then literally go ""Aw"" right after all of that. I honestly felt like Peter up until I saw this movie.<br/><br/>That's what makes Apatow's comedy better than any National Lampoon sex comedy out on the market, it's made with real people in mind. Peter isn't sex crazed, he's just trying to get over a relationship, and he's surrounded by people that are kind and real. There are cynics and skeptics who will probably argue that no one should have acted as mopey as Peter did, and he should have sucked it up. They haven't been in a relationship for a really long time, I would imagine.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had heart and soul. There are very few movies that can make you laugh and feel sad almost at the same time, and with this movie, I nearly felt all the emotions of the emotional spectrum. This is a great movie, for romance lovers, for rocky relationships, for couples (be aware there are some naughty bits in there) or for people who want to laugh at people that are as real as you and me.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9/10."

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A music composer (Jason Segel) gets dumped by his actress girlfriend (Kristen Bell) so he heads to Hawaii to get away from his heartbreak but runs into more when he bumps into the ex there with her new lover (Russell Brand). His tears start flowing even more but that all changes when he meets a young woman (Mila Kunis) who works at the hotel he's staying at. This is another good entry in the recent trend of ""gross out"" comedies but it's certainly not in the same league as The 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up. I think both of those films did a great job at mixing the laughs with the more heart felt moments but I was a little surprised that this film wasn't funnier. That's not to say there aren't any laughs here because there are a lot but just not enough to justify the long running time. I watched the extended cut, which runs 118-minutes and I must admit that I think the faults of this film are in its running time, which is just way too long. Many of the jokes just keep getting repeated and while they're funny the first time they're aren't the fifth time. The non-stop crying jokes are one example as are the countless shots of Segel's penis. What really keeps the film moving are the very good performances from the entire cast with Kunis stealing the show. Segel makes for a good lead, although I think a stronger one would have suited the film better. The actor does a good job at making us care for him and he handles the comedy very well. I thought Brand's character was a tad bit poorly written with his ""peaceful"" attitude towards women and sex. Bell is very good in her part as Sarah Marshall but this film belongs to Kunis. I believe this was the first time I had seen her and she certainly has the charm and charisma that really jumps off the screen."
"varundelpiero","8","1","4","1 December 2008"," Apatow delivers...again...
","I am no fan of typical romance movies. I am no fan of cheesy comedy movies. And I fully despise the traditional romantic comedy. Yet, the Judd Apatow company has succeeded for the third time (following the THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP) in getting me to appreciate a romantic comedy. But let's be frank here: calling FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL a typical romantic comedy is doing it a great disservice. Apatow has specialised in merging the male raunchy comedy with the female romantic comedy to create something that is quite watchable, by all audiences.<br/><br/>The story is a rather good one, following the fortunes and misfortunes of a man trying to get over a break-up after a nearly 6 year relationship. While the story is pleasant overall, there are moments that feel rather cheesy, tacky, and over-done or superfluous. Surprisingly that does little to take away from the film. The acting is rather top-notch, as Jason Segel (who also helped pen the screenplay, and is a name to watch for in the future) does a brilliant job of portraying the 'lovable loser' protagonist. Mila Kunis was the standout for me, not only because she was easy on the eyes, but she demonstrated a comedic range and timing befitting of her character. Kirsten Bell is also quite good, as is Russell Brand, who infuses his own brand of humour into this vehicle. The supporting cast is also decent, and there are no discernible weak links. Kudos to Paul Rudd, who has to be one of the most dependable, yet under-appreciated comedic actors today.<br/><br/>The main selling point of this film is its humour. Where typical male comedies go to great lengths to be vulgar and derisive, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL takes the higher, less disgusting, less raunchy road. That's not to say there's not much for guys to laugh at, as I found that this film was quite hilarious. The other big selling point was the romance, and Apatow made sure that the romantic elements in this movie felt real, and not overly cheesy. The balance between the romantic aspects and the raunchy aspects was almost perfect.<br/><br/>For the third time in a row, the Apatow gang has made me appreciate a 'romantic comedy'. If that's not genius, I don't know what is. 8/10. 3 stars. Will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list. Recommended."

","again i'm mystified by many IMDb reviewers who hated this movie, if you have any sort of a funny bone and you have been in and out of a relationship in your life, you will love this film. People are crowing about apatow this apatow that, but he was only a producer here,great credit must go to director stoller and writer/actor segel for creating an adult romantic comedy thats big on laughs but has an engaging story too. I hadn't seen much of segel or his dong before but it was easy to sympathise with his character and while I loathe schmaltzy, happy endings it was acceptable here. Along the way,kristin bell and mila kunis provided great eye candy as his love interests and in the ""how hot am I stakes"" but russel brand as he has a habit of doing with his sardonic deadpan humour was the stand-out for me, it sounds like ""get him to the Greek""will have him in more of a central role with the same writers as here so I'm very much looking forward to seeing that one. If there was a slight disappointment, it was jonah hill who has regressed since superbad, i can see him relegated to be doing stand-up in a few years. Gratuitous sex is never funny but well played, OTT scenes are and thats in abundance here, its not a riotous comedy but it'll leave you with a big smile on your face."

Peter is this not so smart but extra sensitive lover of a popular TV star. Sarah is the one who walks out of his life. But circumstances prevail and they end up seeing each other almost every moment. The plot gets interesting and thicker and the proceedings keeps you guessing if they will get back together again. A good weekend afternoon watch. A word of caution there is quite amount of female as well as male nudity. The funny moments are present here and there and it does bring a smile on you, if not a loud laughter."

","First and foremost the main reason I went to see this was because it was a movie made by the Apatow group. I thought that it would be a nice breath of fresh air to see Jason Segal as the main star, because we normally see Seth Rogen leading in the Apatow movies. I expected a funny movie because previous movies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Kncocked Up and Superbad were hilarious. This movie does fit into the caliber that those movies did, but it wasn't as great as they were. I was still pleasantly surprised with this movie, but it wasn't the greatest comedy I have ever seen.

I do not quite understand the very high ratings; I would up enjoying most of it.<br/><br/>The director is Nicholas Stoller & he does do a nice job directing a cast of mostly Unknowns (to me at least)<br/><br/>Jason Segal wrote the screenplay & enacts the lead role,He is a tall man & we do see ALLof him. His early scenes, I did not care for, he is a good comic & he did finally win me over. Kristin Bell a pretty blond did not win me over. Mila Kunis a very pretty & lovely brunette did win me over, she definitely has talent. Russell Brand an English actor is quite good. Bill Hader plays Jasons step-brother & I feel he gave the best performance of the male actors.<br/><br/>The only 2 names I recognized, Jonah Hill (the heavy-set waiter) & Paul Rudd as the Surf-riding instructor were very good in there shorter roles. Personally, I want to see Paul Rudd in featured roles,To me HE IS A STAR.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay thru the extras on the DVD, you will find out all bout the use of the puppets in the last scenes. Very inventive.<br/><br/>It seems it was the writers idea, before he even started the screenplay.<br/><br/>Most of the film was made in beautiful Hawaii.<br/><br/>This is not a Four Star film by any means, but it is good & I think most people who like raunchy sex scenes will like the movie<br/><br/>Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points(out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)"

He comes off as very believable playing the victim of a bad breakup with an overbearing woman. I have to say, that this movie was as real as it gets (with the exception of everyone being successful actors and musicians which isn't very ""real,"" but for movies sake I'll relent).<br/><br/>Jason Segel shines the brightest and the fact that he wrote the movie may be why he seems so real in the character's skin.

I thought in parts this film was the laugh out loud comedy it had been portrayed as with some absolutely hilarious scenes which are so true and so many people will sympathise with. The part played by Russel Brand as Aldous Snow i think is perfect as despite being the relationship wrecker and stealing another mans girlfriend you cant help but like him, with his witty sarcastic comments and exaggerated rock star character.Overall this film surprised me as i really wasn't expecting much from it but ended up enjoying it.

Like most Apatow productions, this film finds the perfect balance between raunchy comedy and heartfelt moments. Jason Segel's character was so full of pain that it really struck a chord with me.

It also sheds light on celebrity/part-celebrity relationships. Containing a huge amount of situational as well as slapstick humor added with a hilarious performance from Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is another success story in the book of Apatow. The fact that men are as emotionally involved in a relationship as women are is clearly shown in this film. It is more reality than fiction. The fame aspect added in by the character of Kristen Bell brings in the slapstick humor. The characters are all perfect in their roles. Russel Brand and Jonah Hill are two very important pieces of this jigsaw puzzle. Mila Kunis is plain cute.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall is just a good time at the movies. No real complications here, just a simple story of a highly complex situation, well told. It's wonderful how Team Apatow just come up with these films.

","A fellow has written here that the only thing that stands out in this film is male nudity, which is not a plus, and the acceptability of this film depends on the viewer's tolerance to averageness. Well, I am not going to strongly oppose that or anything, and maybe to most, that is what the film amounts down to, but I find this film much more enjoyable that Good Luck Chuck, or Heartbreak Kid, or other similar films a film school student has categorized as ""apato"" in another comment here.<br/><br/>Things shown in this film are, as always, not theoretically impossible, but it just doesn't happen. There are things the drop dead gorgeous beauties could do, that would change the lives of many, which they do not, except in the movies. But of course, it is a movie, so what the heck! One of the things that make this film more enjoyable than most other similar films is the fact that the central character of this film is not a veteran in the industry of playing loony characters, like Ben Stiller is. So it does not take too much of patience or tolerance or hard work to make yourself believe that this guy Peter, who is trying to forget Sarah Marshall, can actually be a normal man from a normal society, who is just sucking at living right now, but he is not completely banged up in the head. When I watched ""There is Something about Mary"", I felt severely suffocated and awkward, because it was mostly not funny and none of the characters in the film did anything at all like an actual human would do! Abnormal or dysfunctional are not synonyms of funny. It should not be too hard to understand, but people often don't! So in an industry where ""There is Something About Mary"" has received complements like ""Phenomenal!"" or ""A True Collectible!"", Forgetting Sarah Marshall deserves at least some credit, in my opinion.<br/><br/>There is not much else to say. I recommend this film over most other mindless comedies made in Hollywood. Not that this one is something very special, but at least I, as a not-so-outdoorsy and not-so-cool-but-still-normal man, could relate to it, and understood it, and had a few good laughs, and also could relate to the sad moments of the film.<br/><br/>If you are sick of films like Good Luck Chuck or Heartbreak Kid, there is a fair chance that you may still like Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

","In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) is way easier said than done!

Heartbroken and unable to Forget Sarah Marshall and after having slept with almost every woman in town in an attempt to dull the pain, he takes the advice of his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hager) to go on vacation to Hawaii, to try to get over his former love.<br/><br/>Just to get this out of the way, the early scenes featuring Peter trying to get through the break-up are pretty painful, but also demonstrate that Segel, in a truly breakout performance, is a truly great actor capable of dramatic depth, as well as brilliant comedic timing. You really feel sorry for Peter and truly sympathize with his plight, which makes our connection with him genuine. Like most features that comedic impresario Judd Apatow has been behind (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up,"" ""Superbad"" and my personal favorite, ""Pineapple Express""), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" has those elements/themes of love & companionship, boys being dragged kicking & screaming into adulthood, friendship, romance, and ""bro-mance"" that has made his films so popular, and returning some sense of dignity to the comedy genre.<br/><br/>When Peter arrives in Hawaii, he finds that his ex-girlfriend Sarah Marshall is also vacationing at the same hotel on the same island he is staying at it. And not only that, Sarah is there with her new boyfriend, self-absorbed rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Love or chance, take your pick, it seems that everywhere Peter goes, he also runs into Sarah and Aldous. So he goes to about trying extra hard to forget his ex, and so he begins hanging out with Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis), the cute hotel desk clerk who knows how to show him a good time during her off-hours with some of the other oddball characters on the island.<br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a brilliant, touching, and heartfelt romantic comedy. Director Nicholas Stoller finds a lot in the layers of Segel's screenplay, which as is true for all of Apatow's productions, rides a fine line between raunchiness and comedic excess. Boys will be boys, as is also true of all Apatow productions. But these boys, and girls, are given a lot of emotion and compassion and sensitivity, and are indeed flawed individuals (in other words, they're real people, just like us), something usually lacking in these sorts of movies. The acting is fantastic from the cast, especially Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, and Russell Brand.<br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" you got to love this movie!<br/><br/>10/10"

","For someone my age (I'm well out of my thirties), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is only mildly funny and the ""hilarious"" segments inserted for the youthful audience were not at all funny for me or my wife. However, the premise is credible, and the acting by Jason Segal (as Peter, the guy trying to forget), Kristen Bell (as Sarah), Russell Brand (as her new rock-star bedmate) and Mila Kunis (as Rachel Jensen, who ultimately replaces Sarah in Peter's affections) is quite good. One thing that surprised me. There are two scenes with frontal male nudity. The famous Marlon Brando movie, ""Last Tango in Paris,"" got an X rating because of frontal male nudity -- and this is the first time since then I've encountered a film which broke that taboo. Have there been others? (The ban never made sense to me, but I wasn't responsible for the movie rating system.) The real revelation in this film is Mila Kunis: absolutely gorgeous. I can't imagine anyone without a blonde fetish who would choose Sarah over Rachel. Peter definitely made the right decision."

","We guys have all had some Sarah Marshalls during our lifetime- a ridiculously beautiful little blonde bombshell with a perky zest for romance, adventure, and sex. OK, don't we wish! But we guys have also been victims of The Marshall Plan when the Sarah Marshalls of the world have dropped the trouncing breakup bomb on us. The highly entertaining comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" encompasses the bitter tastes of the brutal break-up victimization process with comedic connotations. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is yet another brainchild of comedy producer mogul Judd Apatow and his riotous entourage. Jason Segel stars as Peter Bretter, a television show score musician who has scored himself with the hottie star of the show Sarah Marshall played by the bellisima Kristen Bell. But bedding Sarah Marshall becomes a past phenomenon for Peter when she breaks up with him. Peter is in the raw when she does the malicious dumperiski act so there is no doubt she lays the naked truth on him. Peter's life becomes a disarrayed existence in coming to grips with the heartbreak. He takes solace in his stepbrother Brian to help him ease the pain but to no avail. After some uncontrollable crying, Peter starts participating in the one-night-stand routines to help him forget Sarah. But Peter is still in the heartbreak dungeon. Eventually, he decides to go on a solo Hawaiian escapade. But faster than you can say ""Aloha"", he runs into Sarah and her rock star new boyfriend Aldous Snow portrayed by the unrestricted Russell Brand; Snow is a sex crazed British singing lunatic lothario who has an appetite for all hotties named Sarah (pause). , and Diana, and Jane, and Mary and. you get me. Brand has branded his raunchy British comedy to the States with an overwhelming welcome. Back to St. Peter- he encounters numerous outrageous experiences and befriends eccentric characters (besides Snow) during his Hawaiian experience including: Rachel Jensen (Mila Kunis), a cutesy hotel attendant who helps Mr. Peter roll over the breakup hump by devouring him of much pain and even a potentiality for a new romance is invoked. The ensemble acting of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was a firecracker thespian experience. Besides the stellar performances from Segal, Bell, Kunis, and Brand- we also get some outlandish supporting turns from Paul Rudd as an amnesiac surfer (my personal favorite character of the film), Jonah Hill as an obsessive fan waiter, and the stupendous Bill Hader as the previously mentioned ""Stepbrother of Peter""- Paul; I mean Brian. Director Nicholas Stroller is able to stroll his characters with effective dynamic scenarios and I also quite enjoyed how he incorporates Hawaii as central character to the film's developments. Double kudos goes out to Segal for also scribing the very funny screenplay; and the whole ""Dracula Rock Opera"" thang did not suck as some have said. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is unforgettable, that is what you are! Do not forget it! I sure won't as one my favorite comedies of all time! ***** Excellent"

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall was the last Appatow film I saw. I had wanted to see it for months and then I bought it on Black Friday. It wasn't a disappointment. Jason Segel from the awful show How I Met your mother stars as Peter, a musician for a show called crime scene. He has just broken up with an actress named Sarah Marshall(Kristen Bell). THey were together for five years. Peter is heartbroken, so he travels down to Hiwaii. While there, he meets a few people. He meets Rachael(The sexy Mila Kunis), an office clerk, he meets a recently married couple, he meets a cool but stupid surfing instructor named Kunu(Paul Rudd) and he meets Aldous Snow(brilliantly played by the obnoxious Russel Brand). Aldous is dating Sarah. What sucks though is that they are all staying at the hotel. At first, Peter is jealous of Sarah and then Sarah becomes jealous of Peter and there is a lot of jealousy floating around. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very funny film. It's funny for many reasons. I've never seen Jason Segel in much or in a huge role, but it's funny to watch him cry the entire film. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a genius comedy."

"wdashton43","6","1","9","3 May 2008"," funny, but nothing special
","In recent years, movie spawned from the mind of film maker Judd Apatow have made a lasting impression on the comedy genre. I can't count the number of times I have sat laughing hysterically with friends while reciting hilarious lines from Superbad, Knocked Up, and The 40 Year Old Virgin. Apatow's most recent addition to the movie world is Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Unfortunately, after you see this film, ""forgetting"" is exactly what you will be doing.<br/><br/>The basic premise of FSM is nothing new. It's the classic ""boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy wallows in self-pity and cries himself to sleep every night because he wants girl back."" And trust me, the main character Peter (Jason Segel) does a ton of childish, female-like crying. His best friend Brian (Bill Heder) is fed up with Peter moping around eating salad bowls full of Fruit Loops for every meal. So he tells him the best thing to do is take a vacation to a foreign country: Hawaii. Peter figures Hawaii is the perfect elixir to help him forget about his television star Sarah and, in doing so, get his life back together. Wrong. When Peter arrives at the hotel he runs face to face with his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell) and her new boyfriend, English pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). This sends Peter into an even deeper depression. All hope for Peter seems to be lost until he meets Rachel (Mila Kunis), a cute hotel worker with an adventurous spirit and an infectious personality. What ensues is an out of control semi-romantic vacation full of disaster. A sex obsessed tourist, a weird surf instructor, a quick witted bar tender and an overweight employee with pop star ambitions (Jonah Hill) all do their share in adding to the mayhem.<br/><br/>FSM is not a bad movie by any means, but it wasn't a good movie either. The funniest scenes of the movie almost all revolved around Aldous Snow. Usually with films involving a breakup the new boyfriend/girlfriend character comes off as a total douche. Aldous is exactly the opposite. His facial expressions and deadpan honesty make him funny and incredibly likable. In the opening scene of the movie, we see him in a music video singing a song titled ""We've Got to Do Something."" The song and video, which are a parody of musicians who talk about climate change and so forth, feature him singing about nonsense, making humping movements with his hips, holding up signs that say things like ""sodomize intolerance"" and making out with random people on the street. In another scene, he has a hilarious piece of dialogue where he makes fun of Sarah's movie (she plays a television star in FSM) about a cell phone that murders people.<br/><br/>Let me be frank (you can be Sam), Snow stole the show and without him this movie would have been terrible. This is a testimony to Blake's acting schools, but it also reflects the lack of funniness in the rest of the film. A member of the supporting cast outshining the lead is never a good sign. Can you imagine if someone had out-shined Jim Carey in Ace Ventura Pet Detective or Bobby Di Cicco in Ghoulies IV? I didn't think so. The verdict is in: Thumbs down."

Kristen Bell is cute and always turns in good performances as unlikeable (or ""seriously flawed""; take your pick) characters. Lots of Apatow regulars in cameos. Some funny jokes, but not funny enough, and the drama was undramatic: it might not be such a good idea to immediately 'fess up to an abortive BJ with the ex to your new girlfriend, retard."

","Writer / star Jason Segel here gives himself a plum part as Peter Bretter, a composer who wastes his time doing music for a cheesy TV series. He was dating the female star of the series, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), but she has dumped him in favour of a tragically hip rock star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). In order to try to get over the breakup, he takes a vacation to Hawaii - only to realize that Sarah & Aldous will be staying at the same hotel. The balance of Segels' story has him becoming attracted to the friendly hotel desk clerk (Mila Kunis), while doing his best to move on with his life.<br/><br/>The characters become more endearing as the story plays out, in what is typical but engaging fare for the Judd Apatow company. It has its fair share of raunchy gags (Segel, a braver man than I, actually opens and closes the film with some full frontal nudity) and silly moments. But, for the most part, it actually takes the tale fairly seriously, making its characters flawed and recognizably human, but still appealing, and not total cartoon caricatures. It seems to be built on a somewhat formulaic foundation, but at least it keeps its viewers watching and attentive.<br/><br/>Granted, a big part of the appeal is some gorgeous on-location shooting in Hawaii, which adds an exotic enticement to the proceedings. Along the way, there are some hilarious digs at 'C.S.I.' and David Caruso, and some priceless musical moments - ""Dracula's Lament"", ""We've Got to Do Something"", etc. And the gags continue during the closing credits, as one more shot is fired - this time, at 'Ghost Whisperer'.<br/><br/>Segel acquits himself nicely in the lead, but then so do many of the cast members. Bell and Kunis also look absolutely ravishing, needless to say. Brand is a hoot as the self-absorbed Snow. Co-stars include Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Liz Cackowski, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Da'Vone McDonald. The cameos in the TV-shows-within-the-film are a hoot. What's nice is that so many people here get a chance in the spotlight, with Segel and director Nicholas Stoller giving them some effective comic moments.<br/><br/>In general, this is not a genre that this viewer actively seeks out, but he heard some good word of mouth on this one, and he was glad that he gave it a try.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","Judd Apatow's position as producer probably had a lot to do with Forgetting Sarah Marshall being greenlighted, a fairly entertaining romantic comedy which provides fairly consistent giggles for most of its running time.<br/><br/>Jason Segel, who also wrote the screenplay, plays Peter Brettner, a musician who has just broken up with his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall(Kristen Bell), a television star, who is now involved with a rock musician (Russell Brand). In an attempt to forget about Sarah, Peter vacations in Hawaii, and in true romantic comedy fashion, Sarah and her new guy are vacationing there as well. We then watch poor Peter running into Sarah wherever he goes while taking the attention of an attractive hotel desk clerk (Mila Kunis) for granted.<br/><br/>Segel presents a very flawed and believable character in Peter, who is painted as this tortured sad sack while Sarah is painted as this cold-hearted bitch, which is not surprising since Segel did write the screenplay and if you're OK with that, you will probably be OK with everything that goes on here, even if it goes on a little too long, which is something I've come to expect from the Judd Apatow rep company.<br/><br/>Segel and Kunis make a nice couple and Russell Brand is very funny as Aldous Snow, the arrogant but not as dumb as he looks rock star. Segal has provided some funny moments along the way for Jonah Hill as a waiter obsessed with Brand, Bill Hader as Peter's stepbrother, Kristen Wiig as a yoga instructor and especially Paul Rudd as a perpetually stoned surfing instructor.<br/><br/>There are definitely some slow moments here and there, but Segel and company will hold your attention for most of the running time."

And then gets himself cast as the protagonist. You have to hand it to the guy - he isn't shy. But, in his defence, he can write. This is a funny, well-acted film that evokes great performances from the ensemble cast. Love him or hate him, Russell Brand riffs brilliantly off his own persona here. Mila Kunis is naturalistic and manages to inject range into her character, with sympathy, rage, pity and anger all brought to the fore at various points in a plausible display that never reaches. There is hardly a missed beat here; even minor characters such as the best friend's wife, only ever seen on a Skype screen, are either cute or laugh-out-loud funny. Good fun, and bears repeat viewing."

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008): Dir: Nicholas Stoller / Cast: Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Russell Brand, Mila Kunis, Bill Hader: Hilarious comedy about relationships gone bad. Jason Segel plays a composer for a T.V. crime show that his girlfriend stars in. After she dumps him he decides to seek refuge elsewhere but upon his venture to Hawaii he discovers that his ex is there with her boyfriend. While formula in structure director Nicholas Stoller allows viewers to see all sides of the equation as well as place viewers as observers. Segel plays off the depression with great comic payoff but ultimately finds new beginnings and a renewed pride. Kristen Bell plays his ex whom basks in fame and success but also in despair and personal illusion. Mila Kunis plays a resort receptionist whom Segel falls for. One could say that her role is more predictable in nature but Kunis brings honesty and integrity to it. Russell Brand plays Bell's naïve musician boyfriend who accepts Segel despite protest from Bell. Brand is not the typical hooligan boyfriend but rather a gullible but likable sort who learns after the errors of others because he repeats them. Bill Hader plays Segel's stepbrother who is critical of him, which adds further humour when focusing on Segel's downfalls. Very funny romantic comedy that many will relate too. Anyone who has struggled with a break-up will not forget Sarah Marshall. Score: 9 / 10"

","Lightweight romantic comedy about a guy who goes to Hawaii to forget his ex-girlfriend, a self-absorbed TV actress who has taken up with a raunchy rock star. Unfortunately, the ex and her new beau show up in the very same place the schmo has flown to. No matter what he does, he can't seem to get away from her or the new boyfriend. But he does meet a nice girl working at his hotel, and romance soon blossoms. Meanwhile, the rock star dumps the ex. Guess where all of this is going, folks! Formulaic, occasionally funny, an easy film to watch on a slow Saturday night. Kristen Bell is the TV actress and Mila Kunis is the hotel worker. In all honesty, I think I would have switched their roles. Russel Brand as the obnoxious singer has a truly funny, if vulgar, bit performing his hit song, ""I'm Inside Of You,"" with pelvic thrusts that would make Elvis blush. Really, this one is for the girls. Guys, beware. Although I must say Kunis would be sexy simply reading the phone book. Jason Segal as the schmo gets the role Ben Miller would have played about 10 years before."

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a great movie with excellent acting, dialogue and a mixture of both crude and subtle humor. The movie for me was much better than such comedies as ""The 40 Year old Virgin"" and ""The Wedding Crashers"". The characters are well developed and the plot is very ""smooth"". There are lot of sex jokes but the comedy is smart and sophisticated. There's a wit in Segel's writing that I would never have guessed and my respect for him has increased after watching this movie, both as a writer and as a actor. Aldous Snow is hilarious in the movie and I hope he makes more of such movies,<br/><br/>All in all, a must watch movie."

If it wasn't for the great comedy this film would be pointless and kind of stupid.<br/><br/>Nicholas Stoller has made a number of good films, but this one has got to be my favorite. This film also sparked a spin off called ""Get Him to the Greek"" which is another funny movie with some of the same cast.

","The Apatow clan have made a name for themselves over the past decade or so. Since first appearing on the big screen with THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, the clan has proved they can make more-than-the-usual gross-out movie and populate it with realistic, well-rounded characters. The plots for most, if not all, their movies involve characters (normally slacker types) who drink, get high, date, and all-too-easily wind up making mistakes that have consequences. And while the humor tends toward the gross-out, the clan likes to portray the human body and it's functions in a matter-of-fact way.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. For anyone who's ever had someone break up with them, only to subsequently see them everywhere, here's a film for you. Personally I know, I've been there. Peter (played by the always quirky Jason Segal) has been dating Sarah Marshall, a famous TV star, that is of course until she surprises him one afternoon and breaks up with him. Peter is devastated and forlorn. So, on the advice from his half-brother (played by the equally quirky Bill Hader) Peter takes a vacation. Bound for Hawaii. Unfortunately, Sarah (Kristen Bell) is also vacationing there with her new boyfriend, a controversial rock star played by Russell Brand. Caught in the middle of all this is Rachel (Mila Kunis) who likes Peter and may be the one to help him rebound from the heartbreak. And that's the main story in a nutshell. There are so many funny and poignant little moments that I wouldn't think of revealing any. A movie like this is meant to be savored. Speaking personally, I also liked the sub-story involving the newlyweds. Their story alone could make for an interesting film. Granted, there's some very graphic nudity and a lot of sexual content, but deal with it! Because for once here's a break-up movie with something to say."

","Yet another Apatow produced movie about a schlub who is inexplicably able to attract women way too hot for him. (These movies always make me wonder about the lives of screenwriters; does the access to Hollywood starlets convince them that getting women is easy, or if they are simply writing the world they want.) And like most of the movies from the Apatow factory, this one is pretty funny.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple, with a guy getting dumped, brooding then going on vacation where he has the misfortune to run into his ex. There is the predictable new love interest, the funny new beau of the ex, and the usual confusion displayed by people who were once in love.<br/><br/>While the movie doesn't exactly explore new territory, it is quite funny. There are many amusing offbeat characters and silly gags. But what makes this work is that the movie genuinely cares about its characters, and even shows a little interest in their emotional underpinnings.<br/><br/>It's still pure guy wish-fulfillment, and total nonsense, but it is also funny and likable.

","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is yet another fantastic comedy from producer Judd Apatow, the man who gave us ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" a few years back.<br/><br/>As with those previous films, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" which was written by Jason Segel (who plays the lead role) and directed by Nicholas Stoller, has as its center a fairly ordinary person just trying to make some kind sense out of a world that seemingly could care less that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In this case it's Peter Bretter, a fairly average-looking musician, whose girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Mila Kunis), the beautiful star of a cheesy TV crime drama, has just dumped him for Aldous Snow, a scruffy, longhaired rocker played by Russell Brand. In an effort to get over his loss, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii, only to discover that Sarah and Aldous are staying at the same hotel he's checking into.<br/><br/>The element that separates ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" from so many other sex-tinged comedies these days is that it actually knows how to find humor in the offbeat moments of life. The jokes are never obvious, and the situation, though certainly contrived to some extent, is close enough to real life to make us care. Furthermore, the screenplay boasts an unusually large number of impressive secondary characters, including Bill Hader as Peter's exasperated stepbrother; Jack McBrayer (""30 Rock's Kevin the Page) as a sexually repressed man on his honeymoon; Jonah Hill as a sycophantic maître d'; Da'Vone McDonald as a blunt-spoken bartender; Paul Rudd as a zonked-out, 40ish surfer; William Baldwin and Jason Bateman as Sarah's hammy costars; Taylor Riley as a chef with a sumo wrestler build; and Kristen Bell as a sweet and gorgeous hotel clerk who has a few issues of her own lurking just beneath her deceptively placid surface.<br/><br/>Each is a joy to watch and each brings something unique and refreshing to the comedy table.

","Jason Segel writes and stars in a comedy that involves breakup and vacation of separation. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" tells the story of Jason Segel, a song composer for a television series, starring his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, portrayed by Kristen Bell. After hearing the big ""break-up"" from Sarah, Segel tries to go on a Hawaain vacation to get his mind off of things, when running into Sarah, whose now dating an international superstar named Aldous Snow, portrayed by Russell Brand. But then, after meeting Mila Kunis as a Hawaain hotel manager, he finally realizes that he must decide whether to get Sarah back, or to end up with the other girl. Now, I must admit that every single moment in the film, I almost lost my voice laughing, because of the hilarious performances provided by Jason Segel, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, and Russell Brand, and the hilarious writing provided for the film was sometimes raunchy, but extremely well-written. Many moments that included fresh cereal, a surfing accident, a Dracula play with puppets, and even Russell Brand's complete craziness made me laugh a lot. But honestly, this felt like a movie about things we all go through in life which involves depressing love, which follows into a new love. But they take this dramatic lesson, and turns it into an enormous laugh of a movie. Let's just say Nicholas Stoller, Jason Segel, and Judd Apatow knows how to make good comedies. This movie was freaking awesome and freaking hilarious all at the same time, and was truly loving at times. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", in my review, ""Hilariously written, and deserves all the laughs""."
"MBunge","7","0","2","21 April 2011"," Segel deserves an award just for not giving himself all the best lines in this thing
","This is a funny movie about the cruelty of human relationships that succeeds by taking a very democratic approach to comedy.<br/><br/>Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) seems like a lucky guy. He's got a great job creating the theme music for a TV show and is dating the ultra-hot star of that show, Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell). The fact that Peter is a fat shlub who sits around his apartment wearing sweatpants and eating cereal out of big steel mixing bowl makes their romance all the more remarkable. That's why it's not that surprising when Sarah tells Peter she's met someone else and it's over. That sends Peter into a spiral of self-loathing and awkward sexual encounters, which the ineffectual advice of his step-brother Brian (Bill Hader) does little to counteract.<br/><br/>Eventually, Peter decides he's got to get away from it all and heads to Hawaii. Just as he's trying to get a room at the hotel, Sarah shows up with her new boyfriend, rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). A pretty hotel employee named Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) rescues Peter from dying of embarrassment by letting him stay in the hotel's best suite. Rather than run home like any sane person would, Peter decides to say and be tortured by the sight and presence of Sarah. He barely gets through it with the help of some hotel employees and the terrible example of a newlywed couple who act like they barely know each other. Peter eventually asks Rachel out and discovers that there can be romance after Sarah Marshall only to finally realize that Sarah had good reasons to break up with him, reasons that might cost him any chance he has with Rachel.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a funny movie. However, a lot of movies try to be funny, many of them very similar to Forgetting Sarah Marshall in style and attitude. Most of them aren't. The difference is that this film has an actual point and it's not the one you'd expect. The point of this story isn't that Peter has to realize what a horrible shrew Sarah is and learn that he deserves better in life. Sarah's actually portrayed as a fairly decent girl in this film, if a bit self-centered. No, the real villain of this movie isPeter. I t's his passivity, immaturity and refusal to act like a grown-up that's the real problem and it's one that would sabotage his relationship with Rachel as surely as it did with Sarah. The challenge that Peter has to overcome isn't Sarah, it's himself.<br/><br/>This script brings that level of sophistication to just about every thing. Sarah's new boyfriend would have been nothing but a raging douchebag in a lesser film. Here, he has a personal integrity and genuine human emotions that make him likable. Aldous isn't just an obstacle for Peter to overcome or a target for the audience to hate. He's a person playing his own role in this interpersonal dynamic.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a sex comedy and it's pretty raunchy. However, the sex humor is remarkably non-exploitative and it can even get a laugh out of something as simple a guy unbuttoning the top button of his shirt. Writer/star Jason Segel also deserves credit for not giving himself all the best lines. Peter is the butt of the joke more often than not. Segel also engages in some full frontal nudity, which I'm not sure he should get credit for.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe a comedy by saying much more than ""it's funny"". So many comedies aren't, though, that you don't get to say it that often. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is funny. What more can I say?"
"paulpdm","10","0","4","6 April 2011"," Jason Segal Shines As A Star
","The movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a sleeper in a class of many great romantic comedies. As a film the movie flowed well, and had a seemingly flawless view of the life and struggles of the main character. Whether it be a comedic flashback or a small gesture you barely catch, Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a humorous moment for everyone. I can promise that even if you are not a fan of Judd Apatow this film will make you laugh, and you will forever remember parts of this film. I personally am not a huge Apatow fan myself, however this film was intriguing to me at first because of the actor Jason Segal. You may recognize Segal from the hit comedy show How I Met Your Mother as the character Marshall Erickson. I knew prior to seeing this film that Segal was a funny man, and he seemed like a good enough actor to star in a movie. So this got me to the theater.<br/><br/>Segal's performance in the movie was stellar, and as a fan of his acting prior to the film, this just backed up my beliefs of his skills. His acting led to the viewer wanting to know more about this character, and the struggles he now faces. He makes you feel his heart ache and sorrow, and does a good job of making you somehow relate to this man. As a viewer he immediately grabbed your attention with his goofiness, and from the first five minutes on you view him as almost a friend. Segal brought the best acting to the table in the movie, but he was backed up by a surprisingly strong cast. Not only was the cast newer to film at the time, but most of the names were a pleasant surprise to me as a viewer, and now if I see them in other movies I immediately connect them to this film. I enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and if you are a fan of goofy, R-rated, Romantic Comedies then this movie is a perfect fit. See It! This movie also led to somewhat of a sequel in the movie ""Get Him To The Greek""."

","Jason Segel is trying to forget his girlfriend who breaks up with him at the very beginning of the flick and forgetting her is what he actually endeavours in the entire movie. Although it isn't as easy as it seems. Every time he tries to get away from her he deliberately ends up getting close to her. <br/><br/>The movie is a comedy and of course a romantic one with a great star cast (most of them are my favourites). Who doesn't love Russell Brand and wait he shows up as Aldous Snow the psychotic singer who is the current boyfriend of Kristen Bell. Mila Kunis is a receptionist at Hawaii where Jason Segel goes to mend his broken heart and ends up finding his girlfriend with Aldous Snow, (although I'm pretty sure that was an intentional attempt too). Mila Kunis aids him at the time of need which grabs the attention of Jason who finds her attractive and caring. She dates him (so he says) and starts liking her although he isn't able to move on as Sarah shows up every now and then. This however causes some tension between Mila and Jason which leaves a miffed Mila eventually. Now it is the job of Jason to move on, stop thinking about his ex and make matters straight with Mila Kunis who is in deeply in love with him.<br/><br/>The movie has some great characters like Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd etc. who added flavour to the comedy.<br/><br/>I personally like Jason Segel for his acting and he happens to be one of my favourite actors for the character Marshall Eriksen the one he plays in 'How I met your mother'. I have seen him act in a couple of movies and I must say I am pretty impressed with his comedy. Writing such a wonderful story was in itself a bravado.<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshal wouldn't disappoint you at all.

"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","2","7 March 2011"," Another comedy from Apatow Productions, and as I expected, it's another raunchy and funny one
","I've seen a bunch of comedy films produced by Judd Apatow, and haven't been impressed with all of them, but have found most of them funny. Before watching ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", I knew it was another production from him, and also knew that Russell Brand was in it. I had never seen him in any movies before, but first heard of him a while ago, hearing about his friendship with Noel Gallagher, who was then still in Oasis. Brand has become very famous in recent years, getting lots of media attention, but is also a very polarizing comedian. Many hate him with a passion, and you might hate me for saying this, but before seeing this film, videos I had seen of him online had convinced me that he was a talented guy! Anyway, I was expecting lots of laughs from this particular Apatow Productions effort, and I definitely got them.<br/><br/>Peter Bretter is a composer in Los Angeles who has been in a relationship with actress Sarah Marshall for the past five years. She stars in a TV show called ""Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime"", for which Peter writes the musical score. However, after five years together, Sarah suddenly announces that she is breaking up with Peter, as she is now in love with somebody else. The composer is devastated by his loss, and finds that one-night stands don't help him get over it, so he decides to go on vacation in Hawaii. He arrives at a Hawaiian resort hotel to ask for a room, but as luck would have it, he quickly discovers that Sarah and her current boyfriend, Aldous Snow, the lead singer of a rock band called Infant Sorrow, are also currently guests at this resort! Due to this inconvenience, it doesn't look like this trip is going to help Peter at all. During his stay in Hawaii, things do begin to look good for him as he falls in love with hotel receptionist Rachel Jansen, but the struggling composer might still have feelings for Sarah.<br/><br/>This R-rated romantic comedy begins by showing us Peter as he is happy at home, just before Sarah comes in and tells him the bad news. I didn't laugh much at this point until I saw the video for Infant Sorrow's ""We've Got to Do Something"" come on to Peter's TV. After this, it is memorably funny when Peter learns that his relationship with Sarah is over and we see his reaction to this. Many laughs quickly follow as we see the protagonist's struggles after this breakup and before he goes on the trip, which definitely includes the part where he destroys a screen when he sees Sarah's face on it! The funny gags keep coming during Peter's vacation trip, with his frequent encounters with Sarah and Aldous, his computer conversations with stepbrother Brian, some of the people he meets in Hawaii (such as Chuck, a surfing instructor whose beginning instructions are very hard to follow), a bunch of sex scenes and lots of sex talk, etc. The laughs aren't as consistent as I could have hoped, as there are some weaker parts, but there are still lots of comic highlights and well crafted characters. Jason Segel puts on a satisfying comedic performance in the lead role of Peter Bretter, and most of the other cast members are steady as well, including Russell Brand as Aldous Snow, who is funny in a number of scenes, one of them being the part where he helps the Darald Braden character with his sex life. In addition to the humour and characters, it also helps that this film also features some beautiful Hawaiian scenery.<br/><br/>Since this 2008 release is from Apatow Productions, it's unsurprisingly a very crude comedy. The swearing, sexuality, and nudity are the reasons for the film's R rating, and with all these elements, it's obviously not for the kids, but just like any extremely raunchy comedy, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" can also disgust many adults and make them think that anyone who actually thinks it's funny must be out of their mind! However, if you can take all the raunchiness and you tend to like these modern-day R-rated comedies, including the ones Judd Apatow produces, plus you're not one of the many who hate Russell Brand, who doesn't play the starring role here but still has a lot of scenes for this breakthrough performance of his, you just might get a lot of laughs out of this movie, just like I did. As much as I'm sure MANY would disagree, I do think this particular Apatow Productions piece is much better than ""Superbad"", a more popular comedy from the same producer, but one which I just couldn't understand the reputation of!"

","This is a very funny film, as noted, extremely well-acted and written. I do wish that Hollywood had a broader net for comedic incubation but that said, many of the films which Judd Apatow is involved in are very funny. I enjoyed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" though I found ""Knocked Up"" to be a bit harsh on women. I found ""Pineapple Express"" loopier but ""Superbad"" overly reliant on bad language. Apatow did not direct all those films but has had an influence on all of them. This film I really enjoyed. It is written by Jason Segel who also stars in the film. Segel has a great sense for how people act and interact and his dialogue bears this out. There is some great acting from Mila Kunis as a helpful, thoughtful hotel staffer. Jack McBrayer and Maria Thayer are truly hilarious as repressed newlyweds, Kristen Wiig is very funny as a passive-aggressive yoga instructor, Paul Rudd is almost unrecognizable as something like a human ""Nemo"", and Da'Vone McDonald is very funny as an opinionated and helpful staffer at the hotel. <br/><br/>Among the leads, Jason Segel is fantastic as a sad-sack TV show music composer whose life becomes very complicated when the TV star who he breaks up with (Kristen Bell), is at the resort where he is trying to escape from her. Segel communicates a great deal of humanity and seems very likable which makes us more sympathetic to his plight. Russell Brand absolutely steals every scene he is in as an over-sexed but not very talented music star. The songs which Segel wrote for Brand are hilarious and Brand absolutely steals the film with his full-throated depiction of his inane, over-the-top music star.<br/><br/>The writing and direction are very good and the performances, as noted, are wonderful. There is lots of profanity and quite a bit of male nudity which is quite funny in and of itself. At times it seems a little forced but only a bit and it doesn't distract from the essence of the film. This truly is a fantastically written film. Segel could have quite a career as a writer. I have to admit I found Jonah Hill quite annoying. I generally find him annoying and his ""I'm overweight and a nerd"" schtick has worn thin and never more in this film. I thought it was funny how friendly hotel staff was, but these are tiny reservations. I highly recommend this hilarious film."

","In the expanded Judd Apatow universe, Jason Segel has always had the role of the oddball character, be it on TV in Freaks and Geeks or, later on, Undeclared, or in Apatow's directorial effort Knocked Up. Now, following the lead of former co-star Seth Rogen, he takes his stab at starring in a picture, with an additional, significant contribution in the form of the screenplay (with Apatow producing, of course). And despite the implications of the title, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a more than decent effort.<br/><br/>Segel plays Peter Bretter, a TV composer who gets unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend, small-screen star Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell in slightly self-spoofing mode) while in the buff. As per the recommendation of his brother (Bill Hader), he goes to Hawaii on a little trip to find happiness again. And it all seems to go well, what with the company of hotel employees Rachel (Mila Kunis) and Matthew (Jonah Hill) and surfing instructor Chuck (Paul Rudd). However, one big problem has to be dealt with: Sarah is also there, with her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)...<br/><br/>Sticking close to the Apatow template (hence the presence of regular players Rudd, Hill and Hader), Forgetting Sarah Marshall attempts to deftly mix sweeter material and rude comedy. The former comes in the form of Peter's very real and affecting relationship with Rachel; the latter is best embodied by Segel's infamous full frontal nude scenes (based on real events, apparently). The balance works quite well but is somewhat disturbed by Segel and director Nicholas Stoller's show business-satirizing agenda. Some ideas (the Seinfeld reference, a Dracula musical with puppets) work brilliantly, others - including the titular character - fall a bit flat.<br/><br/>The lead performances are equally uneven: though he lacks the weird charm of Seth Rogen, Segel is a likable protagonist; Bell, on the other hand, is stuck with a very clichéd character and isn't able to elevate her above a basic starlet caricature. The supporting cast is, fortunately, up to the challenge and effectively lifts up the movie. Best of the bunch is Brand, also in a vaguely autobiographical zone as a British rock star with various addictions. Profane, honest and hilarious, it's no wonder he got his own movie recently.<br/><br/>In short, Forgetting Sarah Marshall isn't exactly the best of the Apatow bunch, but it's got solid laughs, an ace soundtrack and, for better or worse, Jason Segel's penis. Oh, and did I mention the Dracula puppet musical? <br/><br/>7,5/10"

Basically musician and composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segel, also writing) is unmotivated, and is shocked to have his girlfriend of five years, and star of hit television show Crime Scene, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), dump him for another man. The situation is made worse as he works on the set of her show, so his step-brother Brian Bretter (Bill Hader) suggests he should take a vacation to try and get over his love, so he chooses Hawaii. Arriving at the tropical paradise, Turtle Bay Resort, a place that Sarah had mentioned wanting to go to, and not very coincidently she arrives on the same day with her new boyfriend. She is now with the pretentious lead singer of the band Infant Sorrow, pop singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), making his plan to forget about her impossible, and all staff and guests of the hotel are aware. Neither Peter and Sarah are leaving the resort hotel though, even with everyone knowing, and he instead, with the help of advice from Brian and his wife Liz Bretter (Liz Cackowski) tries to get with another woman.

Good!"

","When actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) dumps her long-term boyfriend Peter (Jason Segal), his world falls apart. Stuck in a horrible depression, he decides to go on vacation to Hawaii; unfortunately for him, Sarah also happens to be there with her new boyfriend, world famous rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)...<br/><br/>After the surprisingly charming ""Knocked Up"" and the surprisingly gross-out ""Superbad"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a nice mixture of the two for the Judd Apatow crowd. It has a good, solid script, though the tendency for improvisation does become a little too regular at times. It also looks beautiful, a perfect picture postcard for Hawaii.<br/><br/>If you have ever been dumped you can probably sympathise with Peter, played convincingly for the most part by Segal. However, at times the reliance on him being a bit of a cry baby does damage the character a little bit. What's nice, however, despite the initial finger of blame being pointed solely at Kristen Bell's Sarah, is that Peter too was at fault for the problems in the relationship. This makes the situation a lot more 3d and realistic.<br/><br/>The two stars of the show are undoubtedly Mila Kunis as Peter's new love interest, Rachel, and Brand as Snow. While Kunis underplays and conveys the character that she is needed to be, Brand is a force unleashed, though thankfully he isn't let too far off the lead. His Snow is a wonderfully stereotypical and, in the end, monstrously pig-headed rocker; in a sense, Brand is really playing himself. It was always going to be a success.<br/><br/>There is good supporting work from Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd as two dysfunctional hotel employees, though they do become a little annoying after a time. Bill Hader is much more successful as Peter's friend.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film the story attempts to go into clichés, and though it ends on a really big one, the blow is softened by the previous five minutes; the puppet musical of Dracula is laugh-out-loud funny, entirely reminiscent of the wonderful ""Avenue Q"" in its brilliance and its audacity.<br/><br/>At times one could argue that the film doesn't really know which audience it's aiming for: frat boy or genuine Rom-com lover? It is however a very decent effort, and should certainly not be forgotten in a hurry. We are waiting to hear about the movie rights to the Dracula Puppet Musical.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Peter (Jason Segal) is dating Sarah (Kristen Bell), has been for a long time. Peter is supposedly nerdy while Sarah is hot and famous.<br/><br/>Sarah dumps Peter.<br/><br/>Peter shows his doodle and pleads for her to come back. Sarah then says she is already seeing someone else.<br/><br/>Peter is very sad.<br/><br/>After the obligatory ""Peter tries out a bunch of skanks"" montage, which at least allowed the filmmakers to add Bill Hader as his step-brother, Peter decides to take some time off and heads to Hawaii to recharge the batteries.<br/><br/>The holiday is unplanned, he literally gets on a plane and arrives at the airport without any other structure. So the first hotel Peter gets to is fully booked, and who do you think shows up?????<br/><br/>That's right Aldous Snow the famous rocker... <br/><br/>No wait, I haven't told you about him yet. Sarah Marshall his ex-missus, that's it. She is there with her new beau Aldous Snow the famous rocker (Oh so that's where he comes into it!) and they are celebrating their new love in paradise.<br/><br/>Peter is understandably unsettled by this unexpected (but totally expected) turn of events, and imagine his surprise when the desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis) helps out by allowing him to stay rent free in one of the more luxurious suites, happens all the time right? I mean she has that power. Who else wouldn't risk their job for someone they never met before?<br/><br/>I bet you would!<br/><br/>As Peter continues feeling sorry for himself and boozing his way through the week he keeps bumping into the new happy couple which depresses him more, and other guests and staff try to cheer him up which leads to encounters with Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd, and more and more meetings with Rachel.<br/><br/>Peter learns that Aldous Snow is actually quite cool, as well as being a world famous rock star he is a recovering addict and a pretty nice guy, which sh*ts him. He also finds out that Aldous and Sarah have a past that goes a little further back than he first thought, that sh*ts him more.<br/><br/>As Peter gets along better with Rachel a mistimed polite gesture becomes an awkward double date, with both chicks trying to one up each other. (For the record: Mila by a mile, even if she has absolutely no arse.)<br/><br/>Forgetting Sarah Marshall definitely has its share of potty talk and there are some dirty bits for the grown ups, but in the main it is kept pretty light and likable. Thankfully there are no fluid or put down jokes that seem to be the thing these days.<br/><br/>As well as being pleasing and almost constantly funny Forgetting Sarah Marshall managed a few other notable things:<br/><br/>* It announced the now seemingly ever-present Russell Brand.<br/><br/>* It showed Mila Kunis as more than merely Meg's voice, but that she is hot, friendly and spunky, a pretty winning combo.<br/><br/>* It showed Jason Segal can carry a film, he even made I Love You, Man seem more fun than it was.<br/><br/>* It showed that Kristen Bell is harmless enough but imminently forgettable, even now writing this I had to IMDb her name as it slipped me.<br/><br/>Aside from the much publicised doodle showing and some low key sex scenes Forgetting Sarah Marshall is basically a feel good comedy. There is little to detest or recoil at, and even if you don't agree with Aldous Snow's philosophy on women it's still pretty hard to dislike the guy.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 8 / 10. Throwaway fun with jokes aplenty and a beautiful backdrop, both Hawaii and the two leading ladies."

The characters are great fun and the plot just seems effortless in it's ability to make you forget you are watching a movie and just flow with it. Jason Segel is convincing as a lovable loser and Russell Brand's character is just retarded funny. A great date movie with all the right pieces, the fake TV show Kristen Bell is on is hilarious and she is very cute in this too, but the show stealer is Mila Kunis who can be both beautiful and approachable at the same time.

","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the lifeline that spares all hitched men from watching a plot-less Patrick Dempsey film and enduring the single dimensioned antics common to the 'chick flick'.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Peter Bretter (Jason Segel), a music composer who dates Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), the lead actress of a crime fiction television show. After an unusual break up, Peter heads to Hawaii in an attempt to flee from his unbearable reality.<br/><br/>Upon checking in, Peter bumps into Sarah and 'the other guy'. Caught between the pursuits of winning his love back and moving on, the film exploits almost every awkward scenario in a truly whimsical fashion.<br/><br/>Jason Segel (knocked up) effortlessly balances his heart wrenching torment with peculiar and raunchy humour that favours both sexes. Solid characters coupled with a refined script make this an enjoyable—laugh until your spleen aches—couples movie."
"snarby1","9","0","3","18 October 2010"," a personal encounter: funny, crude, yet tugs at the heart strings
","This movie is a lot like Knocked Up or Zach and Mirri Make a Porno in that it can be funny, crude, yet also a little bit romantic. But IMHO it exceeded these two films by far.<br/><br/>I first watched this while I was going through a difficult period with my girlfriend at the time. I had never heard about the film until my friend mentioned it, and judging by the title alone I thought that it was a chick flick or something. But he assured me that it wasn't, popped in the DVD, and off we went.<br/><br/>This movie not only entertained the hell out of me but also brought me a great deal of catharsis. The focus of the movie is the painful and confusing period a person goes through following a breakup. A variety of characters and situations all served to help the main character resolve this pain in hilarious, honest ways.<br/><br/>I watched this the next day with my girlfriend at the time; i guess trying to express to her through film some of the feelings I had been going through. Apparently she didn't get it, and we broke up about six months later. I watched the film a third time a couple of months after that and got teary-eyed at a few parts, some of it because of laughter, some of it because of sadness.<br/><br/>Every character has a message: Russell Brand's character seems initially shallow, but then comes off as being stoic and honest; really telling it like it is and cutting through the BS; which is something I admire. His supporting role was hilarious and moving.<br/><br/>The surfer dude is all about blissful ignorance and living Buddhist; in the moment, Samadhi, whatever you wanna call it.<br/><br/>The bartender has a short piece of dialogue where he talks about how it was his dream to come to Hawaii, and now he can name over 400 fish. A lesson in not putting any boundaries on your dreams.<br/><br/>The newlywed couple represent young love and how difficult it can be, and how important it is to communicate honestly.<br/><br/>Sarah Marshall represents the insanity in trying to date an unhealthy person. One minute they will be crying in your arms telling you they want to make it work, the next they will be screwing someone else and then trying to make you feel guilty for it.<br/><br/>This movie hits very close to home for me, but even if it didn't I probably still would have still enjoyed it. Comedy for the sake of comedy can be entertaining (Happy Gilmore), but honest films like these are great. Perfect blend of comedy and honesty, which is hard to do (for an example of a failed honest comedy, watch Funny People).<br/><br/>I know this wasn't a very well-written review, and I don't give a crap. I just hope that if you're hurting like I was, you can watch this movie and gain some insight -- or at least a few laughs."

The beginning was funny so I was like ""Oh, a comedy!"" Then there was a devastatingly upsetting part. ""A tear jerker?"" Then a few parts where I was sitting on the edge of my seat. ""A suspense film?"" It had it all. I was laughing hysterically until I couldn't breathe, I was crying, I was on the edge of my seat Though I had some issues with the ending, overall I enjoyed it greatly and would love to see it again.

","""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is another in the sequence of comedies bearing Judd Apatow's imprint. Here Apatow acts as producer while the direction is handled by first-timer Nicholas Stoller and the script comes from the pen of star Jason Segel.<br/><br/>The story concerns a guy who gets dumped by the titular Sarah Marshall and has a tough time getting over it. When he follows his brother's advice and vacations in Hawaii he arrives only to find that his ex is staying at the same resort with her new boyfriend. Awkward. Needless to say, hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>I find Jason Segel to be a likable presence in films and this one is no exception. Kristen Bell is also quite likable as Sarah Marshall though I think I wouldn't have much trouble forgetting about her with the lovely Mila Kunis around. Meanwhile, Russell Brand makes a fine addition to the mix with his effortless delivery and cocksure attitude. Add to these some notable individuals in support - including Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill and Bill Hader - and you've got an enviable comedic ensemble.<br/><br/>Nicholas Stoller's direction does the trick though there's not really anything special about it. It competently presents Jason Segel's script, which is funny, insightful and original. I've also got to single out the soundtrack for some special praise; opening as it does with Cake, closing with a Hawaiian translation of ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and featuring a number of good tunes in between.<br/><br/>In the end, what elevates this comedy above most of its brethren is the story. The simple premise paves the way for a story that feels authentic while also hitting the right notes for a romantic comedy. Certainly worth viewing in my opinion, though I should note that Segel goes full frontal in a couple of scenes, so you might want to choose your company accordingly."
"hall895","8","0","2","29 August 2010"," One to remember
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a consistently funny and at times utterly hilarious movie. Can't ask for much more than that from a comedy. That the movie has some heart to it is a nice little bonus. Yes the movie is somewhat raunchy but it's also kind of sweet. It's a delicate balance but one which works. Full credit to writer Jason Segel for pulling that off. Of course Segel is not just the movie's writer, he's also the star and his performance provides much of the film's ultimate appeal. He plays Peter Bretter, a composer for a popular CSI-style television show in which his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, stars. Unfortunately for Peter his carefree, blissful and somewhat sloth-like existence is about to be rudely interrupted. Sarah dumps him. Peter, to put it mildly, does not take the news well. You can't help but feel for the big lug and that's a feeling that stays with you throughout the whole movie. Segel has created a character who is so easy to like. But as much as you like him you can laugh at him too. And as the movie plays out there will certainly be plenty of opportunities to laugh at the expense of poor Peter.<br/><br/>After wallowing in post-breakup grief for a while Peter decides that perhaps a vacation will help him forget Sarah Marshall. So off to Hawaii he goes. Unfortunately it turns out that Sarah is vacationing at the same Hawaiian resort. With her new boyfriend, the pompous, narcissistic British rock star Aldous Snow. Awkward. But this situation is a potential comedy gold mine and hilarity most assuredly will ensue. Segel is great throughout but Russell Brand threatens to steal the show with his portrayal of Aldous. I am not really a fan of Brand at all but there is no denying he is perfect for this role. Mila Kunis has plenty of good moments in playing Rachel, the hotel receptionist who helps Peter break out of his funk. And the likes of Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Jonah Hill and Paul Rudd are on hand in smaller roles and each of them is very funny as well. Ironically, given the movie's title, the most forgettable character is Sarah Marshall. Kristen Bell plays the role and there's nothing wrong with her performance. Her character just never seems to get the big comedic moments. She's the straight woman who is largely left to react to all the antics going on around her.<br/><br/>Funny throughout the movie really kicks into high gear near the end. The big climactic scene is rather bizarre but delightfully so. It's a fitting cap to a thoroughly enjoyable movie-watching experience. The movie clocks in at nearly two hours which you might think would be a little long for a movie of this type. But the movie never really drags. The story keeps moving forward and there are plenty of moments of comic genius sprinkled all along the way. It's a movie that has big laughs and big heart. There's also room for some memorable songs which are all performed wonderfully and which provide some of the movie's funniest moments. Everything comes together quite well. This is a movie to remember, one which definitely leaves you with a smile on your face."
"ComedyFan2010","9","0","3","10 July 2010"," A funny comedy with well developed characters
","We all have been dumped and we all have dumped someone. This makes it already easier to understand the main characters. But what helps it even more is the fact that the characters are very well done.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is great in his part. He is sweet and vulnerable. Sarah's character is great as well because she is not done as a ""monster"". Even though we feel for Peter we still can understand her. This is what makes me like this movie so much, the characters are human and not just ""good vs. evil"".<br/><br/>Not only the main characters but the supporting ones are great as well. It is full of awesome and funny actors. A special mention deserves Paul Rudd. Whenever I see him in a new movie he plays a different kind of character and always with a great success.<br/><br/>I like also that the movie has a great balance of comedy and romance. It is not too sentimental and one gets too laugh a lot. Aldous's music video and song lyrics as well as scenes from Sarah's TV show were in my opinion especially funny.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is that the ending was too long. It went on and on and on. The last few scenes could have been done much faster, it actually feels longer than it was"

","When I heard the previews on the radio every day upon the film's premiering, I thought it sounded bad. I had no interest in some movie where the girlfriend dumps her boyfriend and there's some joke about him being naked. That's about all the previews did for me. When it was on television, however, it changed my entire view of it. I came across it accidentally and I laughed the entire time. It's clever and ridiculous at the same time. Russel Brand is of course a genius at his character and Jason Segel is perfect at portraying a character he himself created. He chose his actors well and as a writer myself, I admire this piece of art! If you like shows where there's a variety of characters who play off of each other, this is for you!"

","Before I saw this movie when it came out in theaters, I only knew who Jason Segel was from his small part in Knocked Up as one of Seth Rogen's buddies. Segel wrote the screenplay for this movie and stars as Peter Bretter, a musician for a TV show that stars his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (played by Kristen Bell). It starts out with Peter feeling good about himself knowing that he has a stable job and a hot girlfriend. All that changes when Sarah shows up at Peter's apartment to break up with him. This has Peter upset for days. His step-brother (Bill Hader) suggests that he takes a trip. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and get over his breakup, only to find out that Sarah is in Hawaii too. Now Peter really can't get over his breakup and is even more upset when he finds out that Sarah is dating and sleeping with (along with having been sleeping with) British singer Aldous Snow (played hilariously by Russell Brand).<br/><br/>Segel does a great job in his first leading role. Bell shows what she can handle playing an unlikeable character. Brand is flat out funny and I see a long career ahead of him. Mila Kunis does a great job playing a sweet hotel receptionist who Peter starts to have a thing for. There are also funny cameos by Frat Pack actors Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill.<br/><br/>Segel does a great job at being a screenwriter and director Nicholas Stoller does some good work at translation Segel's script to the screen. I look forward to seeing what else both Segel and Stoller can do."

"jimjo1216","Null","0","2","7 March 2010"," An overlooked sweet & raunchy comedy
","**A WORD OF WARNING: This film features brief but full-on frontal male nudity of the star actor (Jason Segel). The scenes are short and don't spoil an otherwise good movie, but viewers should be warned up front to avoid any possible movie night embarrassment. (It is a rated-R comedy, remember.)**<br/><br/>The movie is about a man (Jason Segel, also the writer) wallowing around in self-pity after being dumped by his girlfriend of five years, who happens to be a famous TV star. To clear his mind the man treats himself to a Hawaiian vacation, but runs into his ex-girlfriend (Kristen Bell) with another man (Russell Brand). Unlikely as it may seem, the film takes an uplifting turn in the second half. The man learns to stop feeling sorry for himself and move on with his life. I'd say that FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is a great film about breakups, as it shows how depressing they can be, but leaves the viewer with a sense that people can pick up the pieces of their lives and get back on track.<br/><br/>I think this film is overlooked when it comes to recent comedy hits. Everybody loves THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, SUPERBAD, and THE HANGOVER, but SARAH MARSHALL seems to be forgotten in a sort of second-tier of also-rans. I think this movie is plenty funny (and plenty raunchy, if that's what you're looking for), with a lot of heart and soul. I think the taboo of frontal male nudity probably scared some people away, but looking past these brief sight gags the movie is a winner in my book.<br/><br/>I also think that people don't appreciate how great this film is on a couple different levels. The character of Aldous Snow (Brand) is a world-famous singer and the film includes two of his original songs. It's really worth checking out the full music video for ""We've Got To Do Something"" on the DVD. The film itself only shows snippets and they can't do the song justice. The whole thing is hilarious, both the lyrics and the accompanying video. Also, Jason Segel's character in the movie stages a Dracula-themed puppet musical. The concept for such a musical was an actual idea Segel had in his mind for years. The songs are all original, the puppets were created for the film by the Jim Henson Company, and some actors actually get to do some puppeteering. The hit TV show that stars Sarah Marshall is a over-the-top parody of shows like ""CSI"" or ""Law & Order"", with Billy Baldwin providing terrible and inappropriate one-liners.<br/><br/>A lot of effort had to go into these songs/shows-within-a-show, and I feel that the creativity goes under-appreciated. The film is funny at the surface, but it's even more impressive upon further consideration.<br/><br/>Russell Brand is great at delivering hilariously constructed bits of dialogue, and his performance here is a minor revelation to viewers unfamiliar with the British comedian. The cast also includes many Judd Apatow regulars, notably Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Bill Hader. Rudd's supporting role has some great moments. Some less-famous actors stand out in supporting roles as staff at the Hawaiian resort. The whole ensemble (which include's Mila Kunis and ""30 Rock""'s Jack McBrayer) is pretty solid.<br/><br/>FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL is full of depictions of and references to sexual intercourse and features quite a bit of profanity as well as brief nudity. It is rated R for a reason. But it's one of those ""raunchy comedies with a heart"", produced by Judd Apatow. Much of the humor is sex-related and/or vulgar and, as one would expect, the film features trademark Apatovian improvisation.<br/><br/>It's a lot of fun, from the endearing characters to the comedic performances to the charming Dracula puppets. Shot on location, the film really captures what I'd like to believe is the feel of a Hawaiian vacation, with the sun always shining and the blue ocean in the background.<br/><br/>The movie didn't impress me at first, but it had grown on me by the time it ended. There's plenty of funny R-rated comedy, but the uplifting spirit of the film is what really won me over. This film makes me feel good."

I laughed, I felt related to the plot, and I wanted to listen more from the Dracula rock-opera.<br/><br/>The humor is pretty good. I does offer some creative dialogs, but sexual references carry on this one pretty well.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the four main characters is something to notice and that's because the main actors are really good. Heck, I didn't like Russell Brand but I have to admit he was really funny. Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis apart from being extremely hot (those bikinis...) were funny and charming.<br/><br/>The production values are very good.

This is on one hand a lame and predictable story, I saw the break up with Rachel coming from far and also the moment that they are coming together again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have seen very interesting things in the movie that makes it an above-normal comedy. The movie develops to an excellent story, and even made me think off great movies like ""Before Sunset"", ""Garden State"" and ""Definitely, Maybe"" that have the same atmosphere. There is a scene in which Peter has been forced by Rachel to play the piano, and that scene makes you want to express yourself and show your talent to everyone, which I have only seen in a couple of movies to this date. Rachel makes you smile and makes you want to live and get out everything life has to offer.<br/><br/>There are more scenes in which the movie stands above the normal comedy and where you think ""wow, this dialog is very clever and smart"". There is a scene in which Peter apologize to Rachel about what has happened in the bedroom with Sarah, where the dialog is very clever, and you are hoping that Rachel accepts his apologize. But sadly, at the end of this dialog, the movie falls back into the cheap predictable romance story it was starting with, and loses all his credits. This was such a bummer for me, and watching the end credits it left me with the feeling ""why in earth have they done this!"" I was very disappointed that the story was ruined by these last scenes which could have made Forgetting Sarah Marshall unforgettable and one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>Could have been much better. 7/10"

Jason Segel's comedic oeuvre seems to be finding himself in utterly humiliating situations, and proceeding through with that hangdog expression, and that's what he does here. Some of the stuff works better than others, like his self-abnegating song, and the Dracula puppet musical. Others, not so much. Russel Brand as the totally self-absorbed rock star was pretty funny, too. Kristen Bell looked good, and did her not-terribly-likable role pretty well.

"jzappa","8","0","2","18 May 2009"," Fulfilling, Honest Romance Dryly Flaunts Huge Laughs
","Jason Segel, the writer and star of this surprisingly great entertainment, is plagued by melancholia. The film evinces that he likes to feel like a star, at least in the ragtag circle he's amassed of Judd Apatow's expansively talented posse. His character here is a TV musical sting composer who has spent five years adoring his girlfriend, television star Sarah Marshall despite living completely in her shadow like some deposed tsar still doing his seemingly post-middle-age royalty routine for flatterers/bartenders. His journey seems essentially to aim as high as he may in love, not settling for second-best rundowns, and yet to still secure the same kind of neutral lifestyle with a righteous babe with brains, bod and spirit, the challenge of the journey being to realize that that has been his circumstance for five years.<br/><br/>Director Nicholas Stoller seems to surrender to a higher power, so to speak, by being entirely malleable to Segel's material, providing merely a backdrop for the cast to let loose with the goofy, impeccably timed extemporaneous hilarity to which they've become accustomed under Apatow's philanthropic wing. This is indeed the charm of Stoller's elusive touch from the illusory helm, showing an unusual degree of flexibility for a film director.<br/><br/>In subduing any style, the story flows very deeply, mainstream romantic comedy or not, and allows Segel's underdog lead quite an expose of a journey to ""forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" a catharsis of the id which conquers his depressed self-image. Along the way are quirky escapes such as Russell Brand's about-face in my perspective as surprisingly interesting in the role of the title character's new narcissistic rock star boyfriend, Paul Rudd's burnt-out surfer, Bill Hader's ungraceful friend from back home, Davon McDonald's silver-tongued bartender and Jack McBrayder's hilarious rendition of a repressed young religious virgin who's just gotten married. The highlight of the film is Jonah Hill's Hawaiian waiter, who comes to be an awkward, overzealously pushy fan of Brand's. As with Superbad and Knocked Up, he sprinkles fleeting nuances of over-the-top inflections that inspire huge laughs.<br/><br/>As is Apatow's agenda, it's a romantic comedy aimed at guys. All the men in the film get in touch with their feelings, inadequacies and gross idiosyncrasies, rather than safely remaining with the limitations of merely a hot guy who's cool and cocky. And indeed, these films have a much better probability of being satisfactory entertainments, because in spite of their condescended genre they give honest impressions of what it's like to be a horny young guy who seeks the approval of his friends and the women to whom he's attracted. From a film like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we are fulfilled by the best one can hope for in a film of its kind, and it does that by releasing the leash of social pressures. Jason Segel is funny because he depicts himself as so insecure, but there is nerve in doing that because he imparts to us that there is wisdom in insecurity."

"MLDinTN","8","0","3","9 March 2009"," has the plot of a date movie, but the raunchiness of American Pie
","I thought this movie was pretty funny. And it's ONLY for adults. Some of the language and visuals( like full male nudity and various sex positions) make this a far cry from a date movie. However, the story says different.<br/><br/>TV star Sarah Marshall breaks up with her 5 year boyfriend Peter. He gets really down in the dumps over it. At first he tries to tag any girl he can but is still depressed. So, he decides a vacation to Hawaii is best. He picks a hotel that Sarah often talked about. And as luck would have it, Sarah is there on holiday with her new boyfriend, British singer Aldous Snow. Peter decides to stay anyways, and front desk clerk, Rachel, helps him out by letting him stay in the best suite for free.<br/><br/>Peter begins to like Rachel and they go out several times. He also keeps running into Sarah and Aldous, and they try to act like it is not as awkward as it is. Aldous is like most stero typical rockers, he's all about the chicks. So, it doesn't take him very long to get bored with Sarah. He's very polite and wants to be Peter's friend.<br/><br/>So do things work out with Peter and Rachel? How many women does Aldous bag? Or how about does the naive honeymoon couple finally figure things out? <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of the funnier movies that's been released in the past year. As long as you aren't a prude, then you should enjoy this one."
"jpschapira","7","0","3","3 March 2009"," Among family is better
","The Judd Apatow produced ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is one of the latest examples of a comedy form in American cinema that hopefully still has some things to show us. It's also a movie made in family, in which you feel everyone had a really good time and worked really hard so you could laugh out loud; and don't forget, the work of people that have respect for each other and their talents.<br/><br/>Some time ago, the humble Apatow directed a script co-written by him and Steve Carell; ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", and gave Carell the lead role. He had already worked with him in ""Anchorman"", which is not another story because both movies share, among other things, cast members. Then came ""Knocked Up"", an opportunity for Seth Rogen to steal the show; then Rogen wrote the script of ""Superbad"" and was also part of the cast; then Jason Segel (just Jason in ""Knocked Up"") wrote a script, which ended up in the film I'm reviewing, directed by another writer, Nicholas Stoller.<br/><br/>Essentially, everything here is about the script. What the script requires, the movie will deliver. After we meet Peter (Segel), naked, being dumped by the super famous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) and we hear him cry, we also want what his stepbrother Brian (Bill Hader, from ""Superbad""-and ""Knocked Up""-) recommends for him: a vacation.<br/><br/>In Hawaii everything looks more colorful, and I don't know if Segel knows much about the culture and the people there, but the way the script puts it, the beach and the hotel where Peter ends up seem to be paradise; specially when a beautiful woman (Mila Kunis) salutes you at the reception. But is it paradise if your ex-girlfriend is staying there with her new guy (a British rockstar wonderfully overplayed by Russel Brand)? I don't need to tell you how funny this movie is because you should know already for the people who made it, although I'll tell you how they admirably work to make it funny. They save us discussions and dialogs about the couple breaking up by going directly to the point; they provide us a vacation with plenty of characters to meet and supply each one of them with a killer line that is not repeated later (smartly, thankfully) for a greater effect-there's only character played by Jack McBrayer that has an inevitably continued joke-; they even make sure we know some of the people we meet (Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill get us an instant smile when we meet them and we feel that we are safe among friends).<br/><br/>Segel's screenplay is hard work, developing one character that shares the 'Apatow sindrome' (not to good looking but scoring a strikingly good-looking girl, not getting out of home, few friends, tenderly-or not-addicted to sex) but somehow strikes as different. Segel's writing and his performance make us see a sensitive and committed guy in the way Peter speaks but don't forget to show us the flashbacks of a relationship that most of the time made him look stupid (anything for the sake of a good laugh). The script also dominates the shape of the modern romantic comedy, with its typical structure, adding some elegant personal touches that are all of Segel's merit.<br/><br/>The film is not better than others like ""Knocked Up"" because in the whole development of Peter, the movie forgets about the rest of the characters and loses a bit of the Apatow humanity. The women are not fully developed (in fact, the Sarah Marshall of the title seems like a heartless doll, which is in part the point) and there's a lot of the friendship factor, values and talks missing.<br/><br/>It's all good though, because the honesty is still there, and because the movie runs too long again and we don't complain (thank you Jason Bateman there in the credits). We just keep laughing."

","I'm not exactly sure what I liked about this movie but I did. It was really one of those romantic comedies that I would usually complain didn't have enough laugh out-loud moments to keep me into it, and I can certainly say I've come to expect more from this writer but there was enough chemistry from the actors and enough quirky little moments that I came away happy with my viewing. It's been weeks now and I still find myself singing the Dracula song to my wife in a thick Transylvanian accent and it still gets a warm reception. I was also surprised to so easily accept ""That 70's Show's 'Jackie"" on the big screen but she handled her role like a pro and I'm guessing my already established history with the actress had me a little more emotionally vested in her relationship than the script actually earned. Regardless of the personal mystery I came away pleased and have to say it's a pretty decent movie. Even that British fellow I had already decided I hated after the MTV awards partially won me over in this one. My only other real critique is the story seemed to think it made us really hate Sarah Marshall when they had actually gave us some room to see where she was coming from. You might want to save it for a rainy day but it's worth a watch.<br/><br/>Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html"

","This kind of film is by no means my kind of film and I was not really expecting a great deal from it considering that it was ""from the guys who brought you The 40 year-old virgin"". However it has to be said that this is a very funny film it did genuinely make my laugh out loud on more than one occasion and has a semi original story line.<br/><br/>The acting is not exactly the highest order but there are many funny performances in this film. At first I was critical of Russel Brand for doing this film as it seemed to me he was putting his wallet before his reputation and back bone so to speak but he is without a doubt a very funny man and this is evident in the film itself. He provides many laugh out loud moments as he is basically playing himself so his trade mark humour shines through. Jason Segel provides a good main character and is not to short in the laughs department also. Jonah Hill plays a hotel clerk with an unhealthy obsession with Brand's rock star character and is almost as funny Brand but is only playing a minor character.Bill Hader and Paul Rudd are also very funny in their respective roles.<br/><br/>It must be said that the story is not really anything new when it comes right down to it and at times the story and event are very predictable but that does not take away from the film on the whole.<br/><br/>very funny but with its faults like any other film of this genre 7 out of 10"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","25 October 2008"," Off-beat romantic comedy, with graphic male frontal nudity.
","We watch everything the public library gets, and during the first 15 minutes of this movie, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", we were almost certain that it was a very bad movie. I am glad we continued watching it and I am doubly glad that we were wrong.<br/><br/>However it has several scenes of nudity, a small amount of female topless nudity, but mostly frontal, non-erect male nudity that was not sexual at all. In fact he will probably lose a lot of potential dates from that. Still, I consider this a movie for adults, not teenagers, because of the pervasive off-color language and sexual references.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is musician Peter Bretter who is dating the pretty Sarah Marshall, star of a TV series. He happens to provide the keyboard background music for the shows. But early in the story Peter gets dumped, and he takes it very hard. At the urging of his best friend Peter goes off to Hawaii for a break.<br/><br/>Kristen Bell is petite, blond Sarah Marshall who clearly is a bit stuck on herself. As luck would have it, she and her new boyfriend, a famous singer of weird songs, are there also, and staying at the same hotel. This situation provides many opportunities for funny moments as Peter tries to cope, but can't avoid continually meeting up with Sarah.<br/><br/>My favorite in this movie is pretty, dark Russian native Mila Kunis as Rachel Jansen. She works at the front desk of the hotel, arranges for Peter to have a special room, and keenly observes what is going on with Peter and Sarah. Although all these actors are primarily TV series actors, she has the most natural and believable acting style. I look forward to seeing her in more movies.<br/><br/>Overall a very funny and entertaining movie about this man's attempts to get over his former girlfriend.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As the story develops Peter and Rachel get to be friends and go places together after hours. Their friendship develops to more until they sleep together. But meanwhile Sarah figures out her new boyfriend is really a cad, and tries to make up with Peter, but he decides against it. This does have the effect of breaking off Rachel, but back in the states as Peter sees the initial stage performance of his puppet ""Dracula"" rock opera, Rachel is there and she and Peter seem destined to develop a lasting relationship.<br/><br/>N.B. - On the DVD extra, it is told that the actor Segel (Peter) in real life was already working on the Dracula stage piece and this movie allowed him to develop it further and integrate it into the story."

","Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) works as a background musician for television shows, including a show in which his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) stars in. Things are going well, until Sarah drops the bombshell that she's leaving him for another man.<br/><br/>Distraught, Peter decides to go on vacation in Hawaii, but as luck would have it, he's at the same hotel as Sarah and her new boyfriend, musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand).<br/><br/>With the help of front desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis), Peter vows to not allow this mixup to ruin his vacation. As he begins to forget about Sarah, he begins to draw himself closer to Rachel, but of course, things aren't always that easy.<br/><br/>""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is another extremely hilarious raunchy comedy from the people who brought ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" The laughs flow like sweet wine and there's even some hints of seriousness from the characters. Sure, it has a predictable plot, but ultimately, the laughs are well worth the price to pay to see it."
"barrys82","7","0","5","25 September 2008"," Nothing spectacular
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall follows the same formula than 40 yr old Virgin, Knocked up and Super Cool but to be honest I didn't feel the same impact that the other movies had. Yeah it may have some funny moments but in general the jokes aren't that funny. The story isn't that original and the plot is kinda predictable. The cast is good, Jason Segel made a decent and funny performance but for God's sake keep your clothes on. Mila Kunis proving that she can act and be funny at the same time. Kristen Bell was good, doing the necessary and Russell Brand was very funny. Maybe the best of this movie was the photography, the landscapes from Hawaii were beautiful. In conclusion, if your are a Judd Apatow fan this movie is for you if not then you can watch it just to waste your time"
