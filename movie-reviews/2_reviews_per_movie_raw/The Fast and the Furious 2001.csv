","The Fast and the Furious (2001) It is solid decent action film of the film franchise. I love this film it is my third favorite film in the series. I wasn't watching this film for the cars or street races this film is about robbery, as a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies rocks the area. The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it. There is only one team that could be responsible, Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) and his gang of street racers. During the night Torreto and his crew of street racers are driving cars in Los Angeles. Brian O'Conner (Paul walker) a undercover LAPD officer under the alias ""Brian Earl Spilner"", is he assigned to find out who is stealing the merchandise. <br/><br/>This is my favorite film, it is an decent Action film about heist $1.2 million and not about the cars. Why I love this film? Because It is clever, intelligent, Entertained, fast paced and not boring film. The girls are beautiful in this team. The Action sequences are real and perfectly done. I love that late Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner and undercover L.A. Police Officer who try's to do the right thing. I am Paul Walker fan and Brian O'Conner is my favorite character of the whole franchise and series. I am saying The Fast and the Furious is better than 2,3 and even 7 so the film is pretty good.<br/><br/>Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster did a terrific job playing their characters.With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films..here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. These themes are reinforced by the fine performances by Paul Walker and, particularly, Vin Diesel. Diesel's Toretto is a tough, no-nonsense, street-smart and highly-skilled racer on the outside, but as O'Conner and the audience come to know him, it is revealed that he is a human being with feelings, a troubled and hard past, and doing his best to get along, even if it means skirting or breaking the law. He's the head of a household, and the patriarch of sorts of a gang that is more family than it is a collection of members. Diesel brings hard-nosed and gritty energy to the role, but compliments that with a softer, more accessible side that makes him an odd sort of antihero, a man clearly in the wrong but not maliciously or spitefully so. Walker, too, is excellent as the undercover officer that finds the world of underground racing not-so-seedy as it seems. <br/><br/>On the turbo-charged streets of Los Angeles, every night is a championship race. With intense full-throttle action, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, this fast and furious assault puts you in the driver's seat and dares you to exceed all limits.Los Angeles police officer Brian O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie when he becomes enamored with the street racing world he has been sent undercover to destroy.<br/><br/>It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile. Winning's winning. <br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a gritty and gratifying cheap thrill, Rob Cohen's high-octane hot-car is a true rarity these days, a really good exploitation, the sort of thing that would rule at drive-ins if they still existed. The Fast and the Furious is a good Action movie. It offers a conventional plot but populates the story with well-developed primary characters that draw the audience in and make them care about their stories. In the movie, the line between good and bad becomes blurred to the point that, by the end, it matters not which side of the law the characters call home.<br/><br/>I love this film to death! It is my 3d favorite film in the series franchise. The Fast and the Furious kicks ass! Even for PG-13 film they kick ass! Brian O'Conner kicks ass!!!"

","A mindlessly entertaining film, The Fast and the Furious features fun action, sexy cars and women as well as having some cool characters. Don't go into this film expecting it to engage your brain though or any Fast and Furious film for that matter. Thank you Rob Cohen for starting this franchise!"
"Jashhh","9","22","25","5 July 2013"," One of those underrated movies
","This was an actual 'movie'. The sequels were just entertainment takes. People forgot about the actual contents of this movie.<br/><br/>The main part of the movie is the trust-and-suspect-relationship between (undercover agent-) Brian and Dominic with his team. This is a red line in the movie and made you want to keep watching.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, you lose awareness of Brian's mission and start respecting Dominic's team. You want Brian to get into the group and be with the beautiful cute girl. It is about 'the family'.<br/><br/>It was also about Dom being a unique character who tells you about his past, his father's race, the 10-second-race story and all. It was exactly how a movie about cars, races and action should be. Simple but powerful and beautiful.<br/><br/>This was all build up really well. In a cool traditional (unforced) way, we were introduced with cool cars, cool people, street-racing and stuff.<br/><br/>Before the end, a series of events happened that made you very excited. These events that happened are somehow connected and brought a sort of realistic thrilling experience. Here, the acting skills were superb and the drama in the scenes were pictured in a pitch-perfect traditional way. Brian was a lot tougher here than in the sequels where he was like Dom's slave or something.<br/><br/>It's beautiful to see Brian and Dom at the end: Brian betrayed him and should arrest him but instead, they do the 10 second-race and don't know what to think about each other. This race was one of the most memorable scenes in film-history. After Dom hits the truck and survives the air-spinning of his car, Brian gave him the keys of his car, his car that has just also finished the 10-second-race. So, he finally gave Dom a 10-second-car and by doing that, he officially shows that he is not going to arrest him anymore.<br/><br/>Somehow, he knew that Dom should not be sent to jail all along, even though he appeared to be a trucker-thief after-all......"
"baumer","8","95","123","25 June 2001"," There's something about Vin
","Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?<br/><br/>F&F doesn't contain any machinations similar to a film like Mission Impossible and it doesn't dazzle us with special effects of impending doom like Armageddon did, but it takes us into a world where people live life ""a quarter of a mile at a time.""  <br/><br/>Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, a massive, bald mechanic that owns a garage but street races on the side to make some extra cash.  Paul Walker ( The Skulls, Varsity Blues) plays Brian Spindler.  He is a cop that has infiltrated the street gang to find out who is highjacking trucks and stealing all their merchandise.  There are about four rival street gangs in L.A. and one of them is pulling this off.  He has to figure out which one. Of course along the way he seduced by the life, but that is not what we really care about.  All we want to see is lots of racing, a few crashes, some fights and some sex.  F&F doesn't disappoint.  If what you have seen in the trailers of the film excites and entices you, then you know exactly what you're in for.  This is not going to win any Oscars for anything but what it will do is entertain you.  It will expedite you for 90 minutes into a world where Honda's are souped up to look like Dragons and junkyard scraps are rebuilt from scratch to be better than they were before, better, stronger and faster.  If this film appealed to you in the commercial, it will appeal to you on the screen.<br/><br/>And of course there is Vin Diesel.  He first made a name for himself in Saving Private Ryan where he played Capparrzo.  Then he jumped onto the scene with his excellent and grandiose turn as Riddick in Pitch Black.  I think this is the film that got him noticed because no one had even heard of him before this.  Then he did Boiler Room and he showed a different side to him.  But F&F is all muscle and sheer bravado.  I think Vin is going to do great things in the years to come.  He is not a nobody anymore.  This film will take care of that.  And face it, isn't it cool to see the genesis of a new action hero?  <br/><br/>8 out of 10-  The ultimate summer rush!"
"skternate","8","79","104","21 June 2006"," Solid movie... Worth renting
","Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.<br/><br/>All in all the cars are hot, the girls are hotter, the cars are fast, the guns are loaded, and for the more serious, the relationship between Dom, Mia, Vince, Letty, and the others is amazing.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, rent it tonight"
"UniqueParticle","9","6","6","29 December 2019"," Damn I miss Paul Walker!
","The most traumatizing installment but very enjoyable none the less! I love so much of the film, the colors, cars, dialogue, and the fun vibes. Such a great movie, it's been many years since I've seen it. The motorcycle gang is such an annoyance to the plot would've been better without them."
"Jonathan-K_97","8","12","15","19 March 2015"," Great movie.
","I've been watching the first five movies in the series recently. Must say, all of them are great movies if you're into cars and action. Really not that much to say, lots of action, lots of cars and really entertaining to watch. Actors are/were great, according to me Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are/were great actors. Too bad that Paul Walker is gone now, he was one of the best if not the best actor in the series according to me. Although all the actors were great but Paul was probably my absolute favorite. Very short review, I know, I can't find many bad things to criticize about this movie. Great actors, full of action and lots of awesome cars but not the greatest movie according to me, just a great movie that is entertaining to watch is all I can say really."
"PWNYCNY","9","28","40","24 October 2011"," It's more than just an action movie.
","This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles."
"departed07","7","31","46","1 May 2008"," An action movie with a some-what plot, hot babes, fast cars, great action and a meet-expectations.
","The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.<br/><br/>Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.<br/><br/>The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.<br/><br/>The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic."

","I love ''The Fast and the Furious''. Many people are criticizing it in a bad way, saying that this movie have ruined the street car culture among other things.Well, I can't judge very much because I am not(yet) a car expert, but I can say that what this movie did was show to other people who never saw or heard anything like that, another reality that they are not used to see or hear. I became much more interesting in cars(specially tuning them) after watching ''The Fast and the Furious''and a whole new world have become a reality to me. Vin Diesel is awesome and hot (as usual)as the character Toretto,the respected leader of a famous street gang that is under suspicion of stealing expensive electronic equipments. The plot itself is not a profound or a big thing, but the cars and the races in this movie are really awesome!<br/><br/>You gotta love or hate it! :)"

","The Fast And The Furious is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a cast that stay interested in their characters from start to finish,and some great car chasing scenes.This movie is the first Fast And Furious movie,and it is still going today,it is a very hit and miss film series,but the fifth is definitely the best one yet,and everyone has very high hopes for the sixth.Vin Diesel is the breakout character in this,he plays his character Dominic with great passion from start to finish,its hard to believe they did the second and third without him (with the exception of a brief appearance in Tokyo Drift).Fans of action movies and cars will get a great kick out of this movie.<br/><br/>An undercover cop gets involved with a gang of street racers in LA in order to bust a hijacking ring,but he soon becomes close friends with the racers."
"Maniac-9","8","7","8","18 January 2013"," The beginning of it all
","This is the movie that created a brand new mega movie franchise. Generally when there's movie franchises they make movies in the form of trilogies. But later this year when Fast and the Furious 6 comes out it'll be the sixth movie in the series which shows the level of box office appeal the series has to be able to pump out an average of 1 movie every two years is quite impressive. The only other series doing that kind of productivity with different directors on basically a once every 2 year rate is the James Bond series.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel who outside of his other series Riddick movies generally puts out mediocre to bad performances was basically made to play the role of Dominic Torretto. Same goes for Paul Walker, normally when I see he's going to be in a movie I don't bother watching it. But somehow when these 2 guys get together in a movie about driving fast cars with hot girls it turns into a guilty pleasure."
"Robert_duder","8","9","11","8 December 2013"," Mainstream fluff but this first instalment works for them
","The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a ""family"" and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.<br/><br/>This cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the ""villain"" o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.<br/><br/>The film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10"
"Bruce722","9","9","11","1 June 2013"," Great modern classic!
","There aren't many movies over the last dozen years to have a bigger impact on society than this one. The Fast and the Furious glorified street racing and made the Honda Civic and the other cars featured in the film must buys for teenage boys across America. The reason is pretty obvious, the movie is outstanding. The cast of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and others is outstanding and the story is really interesting and unique. The plot and characters are all really well developed, creating an immersive viewing experience not often seen in movies under two hours. The cars and race scenes are fantastic and the action has you sitting on the edge of your seat. The only negative for me was some of the cinematic effects. The director tried to get cute and a lot of those effects actually hurt the scenes, not helped. Nonetheless, those few sequences aren't enough to ruin the film and the entertainment value for the movie is still sky high."

","This movie, has by far the best car racing scenes ever filmed, as well as the best cars. They are gorgeous machines, and these guys certainly can drive them. Great story, not just another Gone in Sixty Seconds where all they did was steal cars, there actually weren't very many race scenes as you might expect, but every shot is filled with cars, and lots of them. The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you. I highly recommend this to all fans of cars, and racing, but it has something for everybody so see it even if you are not a fan of either, bottom line, just see it!!!!!!"

The first movie of Rob's that I saw was xXx and that was amazing! I loved that movie. Of course I mostly love all brainless high octane action flicks.<br/><br/>But, there is something else about this film that makes me love it beyond my own comprehension. Maybe it's the heart and the whole leave-no-man-behind theme that rocks around throughout this film, especially in the last half-hour.<br/><br/>Most people only don't like this movie because of it's absence of a plot. I agree. There isn't much of a plot here, and if there was, it's all over the place.<br/><br/>But who needs a plot in a movie that is meant to be just a movie to hold your attention.

","The fast and furious will not exactly WOW you. But it will do enough to keep you entertained through out, thanks to it's excellent cast and furious race scenes. The film was a good idea and it could have not been executed any better then it was. The not so familiar director Rob Cohen did a very good job. Most scenes were well panned out and ribbon tied with it's cool racing or just brilliant acting. For that it really does deserve 9 stars.<br/><br/>The major impact this movie had was it's pride. The fast and the furious did not get too a head of them selves and also didn't have the biggest budget to work with. But the movie reflects on a job well done. The movie is just simple plain fun, it take you for a enjoyable ride. The racing scenes were well though out, intense and very fun to watch. Some scenes were all the friends are together were witty and fun to watch too. The script was nothing major but decent. The acting was the brilliant, Vin Diesel knew and played his role very well, his role had the major impact. The plot was interesting but nothing real special. Overall the movie was very enjoyable, great racing, cool cars with a touch of action and humour."
"celtic_girl1990","Null","6","7","9 September 2006"," It truly is Fast and Furious
","What makes this film so great? One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.<br/><br/>If you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called ""tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy"" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too."

","It begins with a spectacular action scene where three Honda Civics execute a high-speed highjacking of a cargo truck, and from there, the action never stops. With The Fast and the Furious, director Rob Cohen seeks to capture and thrill the audience with a booming soundtrack and non-stop action, and he seems to have succeeded.<br/><br/>The film follows officer Brian O'Connor as he infiltrates a street-racing gang in order to capture the drivers of the three enigmatic Hondas, which have been terrorizing truck drivers in Los Angeles. The gang is led by ex-racer Dominic Toretto. Toretto immediately takes a liking to O'Connor, while his gang seems a bit skeptic. Toretto's right-hand man Vince is O'Connor's main problem, as he suspects the truth about his identity from the very beginning.<br/><br/>The plot is slightly dry, as the movie incorporates many typical aspects of other films of the genre. For example, there's the fact that Toretto is the only one to trust O'Connor. The rest of his gang except for, of course, Vince, quickly follows him. Then there's the whole falling-in-love-with-the-sister-of-the-guy-I'm-about-to-get-arrested subplot. And then there are your typical problems from rival gangs and the hero's attempt to prove himself by striking against them. Yet despite the many stereotypical aspects of the script, the well-developed characters and interesting relationships save the movie from becoming just another heap of typical Hollywood sensationalism.<br/><br/>The movie features strong acting, as the actors work well together and compliment each other's performances. This is only Michelle Rodriguez' second major performance since her film debut in the independent drama Girl Fight, which was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival last year. Not just another bad girl, Rodriguez shows a strong acting ability, which is apparent in her portrayal of Lena. Vin Diesel is also a fairly good actor who seems to be climbing through the ranks of Hollywood. Best known for his role in the failed science-fiction thriller Pitch Black, Diesel sports a memorable attitude and strong screen presence that promise to make him a contender for future stardom. Opting to cast less known, yet strong actors instead of more commercially viable ones, Rob Cohen has created a well-rounded cast, which gives the movie its fresh attitude and memorable mood.<br/><br/>Yet it is the action scenes that are the real stars of the movie. Featuring three races and four equally spectacular action sequences, the movie delivers fast and furious action from beginning to end. Accompanied by a rocking soundtrack, the action sequences are put together by flawless editing and elaborate stunts, effectively creating a maddening adrenaline rush in any viewer.<br/><br/>A long time producer and Harvard graduate, Cohen has achieved success a director, with movies such as Dragonheart, The Skulls, Daylight, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (which he also wrote and starred in) and several episodes of the series Miami Vice. He is also a screenwriter and has had small roles in some of his movies. He plays a pizza delivery boy in The Fast and The Furious.<br/><br/>Although the slight semblance of a plot does not make this something for the serious moviegoer, the relentless action more than makes up for it. Not too long and filled with fantastic cars and non-stop entertainment, The Fast and the Furious will leave you dazed and breathless."

With that said you would consider it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>True, the movie has bad acting and poor story, but that is what makes it a marvelous popcorn film.  My friends and I spend hours mocking the film and its horrendous dialogue.  The movie is full of silly lines bound to make you laugh.  Just check the memorable quotes section.  There are so many classic scenes that make it a campy movie. Some scenes and dialogue is so ridiculous that it is too much fun to ridicule and imitate.  It so bad it's good. Plus it is very watchable because of the fast cars and hot girls.  I'm not sure if the filmmakers intentionally had the goal of ""so bad it's good"" but the cast and crew have made this into one of the best unintentionally funny films of all time.<br/><br/>I urge each living soul to witness this magnificent work of art with an open mind and sense of humor.  You won't regret it.<br/><br/>(Another note:  Ja Rule is terrific in this film.  He produces the all-time greatest cameo.  Unintentional or not it is a work of genius in the comedy department.  He is a pure delight to see him on screen.)"

","If you like cars - this movie is for you. Sure, the cars in this movie are not what an ordinary European lad would regard as decent, some of the parts are quite alluring (T66 with NOS you know... ;-)) but among the car bodies there are some that look way too stereotype (Honda Civics...?).<br/><br/>The story is entertaining, though rarely sophisticated. This, I guess, is the reason for why someone reader of IMDb commented that in this movie Vin's talent was wasted. I consent to this to quite some degree and really suggest to those of you, who haven't already familiarized themselves with the work of this convincing actor to do so as soon as there is a chance to."

"SupraTurbo","10","53","95","25 June 2001"," Comes at you Fast AND Furious
","The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says.  It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all!  Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it.  The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.  It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do.  In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered."

","I don't remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen't matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that's why this movie rocks."

This movie touches action, love, hate, friendship, adrenaline etc. It has a great storyline to keep you entertain. This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected. At that time these were not world wide icons and had not been involve in a blockbuster movie that would tattooed their careers in Hollywood. Finally I just want to point out that I am no movie critic or someone who studied in order to criticize a movie, I am simply an average Joe that likes to see all kinds of movies but, specially action movies been The Fast and the Furious my favorite movie of all times.

","Awesome fun entertaining movie with a great story. the story is a lot more intricate than I remember it being and flows very well. good character development and building an attachment to them. There is a pretty strong psychological aspect to Brian and Dom's characters as well as some of the others. good creative directing. and even tho most people may disagree, I think it had good acting by Paul walker, and the other actors played their roles perfectly. the dialogue was pretty weak. good score and song selection for the soundtrack. One of my favorites and partially a guilty pleasure movie for me. I think it's really good but at the same time there is a lot you can make fun of, i find myself laughing at those parts, because even though they're bad, i still like them (about 5 viewings)"
"drhoads-93743","8","3","3","7 January 2019"," Guilty Pleasure
","On an objective scale, this film is pretty cheesy. It's a direct ripoff of Point Break. The acting from Walker and a few others is pretty terrible. Every scene is unrealistic...<br/><br/>But why do we watch movies? We watch because we enjoy them. And I can't help but enjoy this film.<br/><br/>It almost feels like it's in the same world as Training Day. Not as dark (and certainly not nearly as good as Training Day). But it captures LA very well. And nostalgia runs through this film like crazy. Makes me sad to know those days are over. And even sadder to know that Walker is gone."

","I loved it a lot, but the final scene, when Jesse is shot, was really sad. They dwelled less on it than they did with Vince (the guy who everyone hates!) getting hurt. It never really tells you whether he lives or dies, they just leave. And at the end, they should go back to help poor Mia left witgh a dead or dying Jesse, but they RACE!!!!!

","This movie has by far the best acting in any racing movie I've ever seen. Vin Diesel plays his role extremely well in this film as well as Paul Walker (Brian Spilner) who acts as an undercover cop trying to bust Dominic and his street racing gang. This movie also has some of the best cars and probably the most cars I've seen in a street racing film. In almost every scene there's cars. The film takes a dramatic turn in the end which gives you a rush and thrill as if you were actually in the movie. All in all, I think this movie is perfect for any racing fan or car enthusiast however, it's also extremely entertaining and I think anyone would enjoy this movie."

","""Fast and The Furious"" is one of those kinds of movies that polarizes people into two groups: those who loved it, and those who hated it. I happen to be one of the ones who loved it, I unlike many other reviewers, thought the dialog was written fine, Vin diesel is a good actor, and that a large amount of this movie's appeal is in how the car scenes are shot.<br/><br/>In a lot of movies, when they try to throw cars into the mix, you get bored, the shots are too centered, it gets boring, every time they race the cars here, the screen shakes and gives me (and anybody else who loved this movie) an awesome rush. All in all, don't believe what ANYBODY tells you about this movie, it's really the sort of thing that you need to see for yourself to know if you love it or hate it.

It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be.. The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job.

"Achylles","10","8","11","23 October 2011"," True blockbuster.
","Firstly, this movie became a masterpiece and a blockbuster of all times - not because of it's plot, literally it is plain, but because of the scenes with the fast, tuned, hot cars, having neon lights and nitrous which was something people had never seen before. There had been many racing movies but this one is unique itself because of the illegal racing stuff. In my opinion this movie is very underrated because of it's low ratings and disliking reviews complaining about plot, but - come on, guys this ain't a movie whose purpose is to having a nice plot. If you want a nice plot movie go watch Star Wars but the purpose of the F&F franchise is to see some fast beautiful cars, hot chicks and affairs which are not about love but something more... I admit that the writing was not well-made but the defense of this disadvantage is that action films don't need perfect writing - go watch a good drama instead if you want a good writing.<br/><br/>What I mean is that this movie is the origin of the illegal street racing movies and was the first of it's kind. Then we saw Street Racer, Born to Race and even the failure of the year - 200 MPH. But all those movies were inspired by the Fast and the Furious franchise. The plot is plain and predictable otherwise it is different than any plot in any other action movie made before the movie. The acting was great - all the actors made the deal especially Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, whose roles made them famous and the reason being famous now is only the movie. The special effects, that every action movie need to have, are immaculate and the stuff used in the movie is perfect. In addition, people in real life became inspired about tuning their own cars and this movie is the reason about that. In my opinion if you're a fan of cars you should definitely watch the movie and will truly love it. If you expect too much or are a drama/comedy person you will also not be disappointed but also not so satisfied. ""Damn"" I can say so many things about this movie that literally mean a defence of itself but I would repeat myself so I will skip to the summary.... The movie is a blockbuster itself. It is plot is plain and predictable but because it's unique itself and is origin of all illegal street racing movies so this makes the meaning of the plot inconsequential. The acting is awesome as immaculate are the special effects too. The writing is typical for an action movie, despite being awful but what really makes this hustle and bustle movie amazing is it's uniqueness and beautiful adrenaline among fast and tuned cars. Recommendation - just watch if you're big fan of cars and adrenaline. Don't expect much if you're not.<br/><br/>Plot - mild, plain, predictable though it is unique and doesn't need to be amazing. 6/10.<br/><br/>Acting - Amazing; Vin, Jordana, Michelle and Paul do very nice job. 10/10<br/><br/>Writing - as plain as the plot is though it's very typical to the classic action movies. 6/10<br/><br/>Performance - Immaculate special effects; Very beautiful designed cars; Spectacular racing scenes. 10/10<br/><br/>OVERALL: 8/10, though I give it an excellent personal TEN because it is literally my favourite franchise."

"Shevy1103","10","13","20","13 April 2013"," A perfect 10...
","I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics. The script and plot is close to perfection. Everything from Action, comedic feuds, deceit, romance and amazing surprises. It has a little of everything and a lot of the rest.<br/><br/>The characters' difference is brilliant. The background of them is hidden beneath the surface of someone completely different. They're just amazingly entertaining. They're personalities is even better. I can't say anything else because I'm out of words; speechless.<br/><br/>The action scenes are incredible for a movie like this. I won't say to much about them though, but if you haven't seen it yet, do so. The first scene when you see how good Brian drives is good and when you see the spark he has, and how his driving improves throughout the movie; nice, very nice. <br/><br/>The turning point is pretty good too, but you'll have to find it yourself because I am not going to spoil your movie-experience. The twists in the movie are good, and there is more than one as well. Everyone has secrets, and the secrets are what make this movie just as good as it is. Without the secrets the movie wouldn't be worth watching. <br/><br/>OK, let's talk about the acting. First, Mark Vincent (or as you may know; Vin Diesel), I'm a big fan for a reason. There's never anything to say on his acting, so I won't even get into how amazingly amazing he is. So, the rest of them, I am a little iffy on their names so I am just going to call them by their character names. Brian, or the guy who played his role in the movie did a great job and so did Mia and Vince. There wasn't any bad acting in the movie, only good acting and some awesome acting.<br/><br/>The mix of secrecy, trust and romance is pretty damn good. I'm running out of adjectives. So I'll just try and wrap this up and give you my concluding opinion and rating of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth watching. I really and truly recommend you to watch this movie and its following movies. They are worth watching, ask anyone who've seen them they'll tell you the same. Personally I think it's great and awesome and so does my pal here who watched it with me an hour or so ago. For my rating, based on everything I wrote and didn't write, I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Why? I couldn't find anything negative about it and since I still enjoy watching after all these times I've already seen it it's probably worthy of a perfect 10.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review. Good night, Bon soir, guten nacth, god natt y Buenos noches. Peace & Love God Bless<br/><br/><ul><li>J.J.Shevy</li></ul>"

","Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) wants to join the family of the head of California street racing (Vin Diesel)...but why?<br/><br/>The plot is comic book level; the dialogue is very VERY bad...but who really cares?  This is a throwback of those dumb 1970s drive-in movies...it's for people who like loud, fast films filled with mindless action, attractive women, cars...and nothing else.  I didn't like the film.  It was too loud, too silly and way too long for a dumb action flick.  What saves it is some truly incredible action sequences (the ""hijacking"" sequence towards the end was unbelievable), some very nice, innovative direction, a cast that manages to be good despite the script and a very good performance by Vin Diesel. This was supposed to be Walker's breakthrough film but Diesel steals it away.  Also it looks kind of silly to have tall, lean, pretty boy Walker against tall, muscular, severe-looking Diesel.<br/><br/>See it for the action and Diesel.  During the slow spots admire the cars or the women."

I thought it should've been because of the profanity. But it was great anyway. But the film wasn't really about Dom. Mostly about Brian. If this wasn't good the furious series never would've started.

","This is first movie of the Fast & Furious franchise it has a solid plot and a nice finish scene which leave place for next movie. It's a great movie for all, especially for car lovers. Movie is full of tuned cars, hot girls and races. Old school street racing (1/4 of a mile, NOS in cars). Cars like Toyota Supra, Honda Civic and American classic Charger. It is nice treat for all car lovers. When you hear that engine sound and that NOS boost you just wanna get there and race. Racing and chasing is pretty much realistic. But movie is not all about racing it gives connection between main characters that will last trough other movies. It is very underrated movie. I rated it 8 cause of his lack of action. It has nice plot so you won't get bored at all but there is something missing. All in all I recommend this movie for everyone who is interested in cars you will enjoy it."
"cooper1-318-937211","8","6","8","19 March 2012"," Great great film!
","I gotta say, I love this movie, and the stunts are really amazing. Special FX include cars driving under speeding trucks and staying in control, plus a wheelie from a dodgy corvette.<br/><br/>Anyway the film was Dynamite!!!! The story of the lead guy being undercover and gaining the trust of the crooks is quite good but here it could have been better. There was one moment I will remember above all and it's the moment that I reckon was the most tense in the entire film. Most people won't remember it but I just happened to. Anyway I won't give any details but basically it's when he blows his cover to the lead crook. The look on the bald guy (Vin Diesel)'s face gave that scene more suspense than any other. But then it's just wasted after that.<br/><br/>The film ends with us perhaps not knowing what will follow but it's not hard to work out what probably would have done if it were continued a bit longer.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. That Vin Diesel bloke was criticized by a lot of people on this site but there's a bit where he talks about his dad's death and i thought he shined then. And the others weren't that bad anyway.<br/><br/>Overall the film is worth a watch if you're looking for a little action that's easy on the mind. Of course it goes without saying that if you like cars this film is for you."

"CinemaCocoa","8","4","5","13 April 2017"," It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film
","The surprisingly humble beginnings (by comparison) of what is now a six film series, The Fast and the Furious was a hit for bringing a new lease of life to the racing film.<br/><br/>An undercover cop, Brian O'Conner, must discover who is to blame for goods trucks being hi-jacked and stolen by drivers in high performance street cars. He puts himself into the urban culture of street racing where he meets Dominic Toretto and his team. Brian falls for Dominic's sister, Mia, in the process and threatens his investigation and his life.<br/><br/>The film is quite a brainless piece of entertainment, its story is predictable, it follows an undercover cop who starts to sympathize with his targets, and the characters are written spontaneously to fit the demands of the plot. You gotta love the opening dialogue: ""I like the tuna here,"" ""Nobody likes the tuna here!"" Plus, Paul Walker really is a bland actor.<br/><br/>But, that isn't why we watch the film. The Fast and the Furious does have some great car racing scenes and director Rob Cohen can shoot the cars and make them look great. What is most appealing is the physicality of the stunts and the racing; there's no CGI tomfoolery here, and there is a simplicity about the film that makes it worth watching. You don't need to suspend your disbelief, the plot doesn't shovel many excuses for racing into your face.<br/><br/>It is a neat, nitrous oxide powered glamour film. It doesn't say much, and it will probably age badly over time (and get a remake) but it is a must for every petrol-head and car racing fan out there."
"ryanskywalker-87402","7","4","5","12 April 2017"," Still ""Fast"" after all these years
","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" has no business being as great as it is. A film about fast cars, undercover cops, and highway robbery should provide limited, perhaps dimwitted thrills, but Cohen's colorful and swift-paced action outing provides such likable characters, slick stunts, and buoyant spirit that the whole affair elevates itself to the highest levels of lively, well-assembled fun. It is a surprisingly robust and satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The film follows an undercover police officer working to infiltrate the world of street racing to bust a low-level crime syndicate. While undercover, he develops an affinity toward the racers and inconvenient brotherhood is established. Between the cars, busts, and friendships, a token crime story becomes a tale of family. It is simply compelling and effortlessly entertaining.<br/><br/>Cohen creates a multi-ethnic world of sunshine, turbo charged technology, and well-rendered characters. It is a Los Angeles of beautiful paint jobs, palm trees, and lived-in locations. Color, verve, and speed burst forth from Cohen's frames in layered and lively compositions. Editing, design, and music create an always- pulsing energy that permeates every sequence.<br/><br/>Though the film is about racing and the thrills that drive the sport, Cohen cast actors that earn as much attention as the horse- powered rockets. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Chad Lindberg, and Michelle Rodriguez form the family unit the inspires the film's themes and emotions. Each actor builds a solid character, with the leads being especially memorable. Diesel glowers and Walker exudes a naive charm. They form a charismatic duo.<br/><br/>A slick and undeniably entertaining action gem, ""The Fast and the Furious"" soars with its combination of character and thrills. Set pieces are exciting, character beats are affecting, and the stunts are electrifying. It is a remarkable, sweat, oil, and sun-soaked piece of work."

","This movie is adrenalin charged from the very beginning.  The plot centres around an undercover cop,Brian, who has to investigate a number of hijacks. To do this, he must get to know the chief suspect, Dominic Torretto (a stellar performance by the magnificent Vin Diesel) and his group of street racers who buy Japanese cars and spend thousands of dollars converting them into racing machines.  As well as being a street racer, Dom also runs a store and a garage.  His gang includes his girlfriend Lettie, younger sister Mia and friends Vince, Leon and Jessie.  Brian is drawn deeper into the glamourous world, falling for Mia and discovering a respect for Dom, which conflicts with his objectivity.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen does an amazing job of directing this movie, even making a Hitchcock-esque cameo as a pizza delivery guy.  The film is very well acted, particularly by Vin Diesel, who manages to portray the two sided character of the carefree street-racer with the responsible older brother who looks out for Mia and the rest of his team.  His performance is by far the best of the entire film.  Apparently the character of Lettie was not in the original story and unfortunately this shows.  Michelle Rodriguez pouts and sneers her way through the film, and her character has no real depth.  This is the only low point in a truly brilliant film."

","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN*<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious (2001) is another run-of-the-mill crash-bang action car chase flick. I went into the cinema expecting that, and that is exactly what I got.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), or 'Brian Earl Spilner,' as he calls himself when he goes undercover, a rookie cop who races cars and works for The Racer's Edge, an auto parts store, who is infiltrating a street racing gang lead by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who are under suspicion for hijacking tracks containing DVD players, television sets and other electronics. When he gets to know the group more, he learns a lot of lessons from Dom about Life, and car racing, such as, ""It doesn't matter whether you win by an inch or a mile. Winning is winning."" He also discovers that Dominic and everyone else are too calm and collected to hijack trucks, and that it may be being done by a group of Chinese street bikers lead by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune), who's sister Dominic made the mistake of sleeping with. As Brian gets more and more attached and drawn into Dom's world, he throws a spanner in the works when he falls in love with Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Soon, they are all suspicious of Brian being a cop, and he must choose where his loyalties lie.<br/><br/>This film has some pretty impressive car chase and race scenes, but is clearly following the same plot outline as Point Break (1991), but using car racing instead of surfing, and both the films star two young male actors as rookie cops (although Keanu Reeves is getting older now).<br/><br/>
But even so, The Fast and the Furious was an enjoyable film for me. If you're looking for a little bit of entertainment where you don't have to use your brain too much, and love car chases and action, then this film is for you. I think that it is more for the younger generation, and if you talk to the older generation about car chase and race sequences, then the film Bullitt (1968) is sure to come up, starring the late, great Steve McQueen, who starred in other such great movies as The Great Escape (1963), and The Getaway (1972), and who tragically died on 7 November, 1980, of lung cancer. The Fast and the Furious was a good movie, with some kick-ass action, but if you want to see one of the first great car chase films, rent Bullitt, as it is by far one of the best of that ilk.<br/><br/>Beau's Rating: *** 1/2 out of *****"

","""The Fast and Furious"", adapted from a magazine article, could have been adapted from a comic book. With a simple minded plot,  some pretty awful acting by just about everyone (Diesel excepted), and the usual Hollywood excesses pushing the PG-13 envelope, ""The Fast..."" gets off on high octane street racing. From cool cars to hot babes this flick is made with one goal in mind: to separate the teen male from the price of admission. Not for mature audiences."

","Could there be a movie made in this world worse than this one? Of course there is but this is still a shocking movie. What chance does a remake of ""Point Break"" seriously have? Neither contained a script worth performing, let alone an idea with originality. They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.<br/><br/>At least ""Point Break"" mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline."

"stevenrotherforth","9","2","2","22 August 2019"," 4K Blu-ray gives this movie a nice tune up
","The Fast and the Furious<br/><br/>This is the movie that started the mega franchise we all know of today.
However the series stalled and ran out of gas after the third entry and it was only when Fast Five offered a overhaul did the franchise get back on track.
I personally think the fifth instalment is the best of the bunch but only winning by an inch not a mile.
2001's 'The Fast and the Furious comes in close second and is actually a loose remake of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surfboards.<br/><br/>'TFATF', we'll call it that because I can't be arsed to keep writing out the full title is directed by Rob Cohen and stars Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker.
Walker plays Officer Brian O'Conner who goes undercover to catch a gang of truck robbers.
By doing so he gets embroiled in the world of street racing.
'TFATF' is pure carnogaraphy. If like me you're a petrol head then this movie will be right up your alley.
Performances by all are fantastic, especially from Diesel as hard-man Dom Toretto and the aforementioned Paul Walker. All cast members are great and one of this films less talked about attributes is the strong character development of those onscreen.<br/><br/>Action is a plenty in this movie and at the time of release the Car racing sequences did move the game on.
'TFATF' is borderline silly unlike the sequels which have become even more ridiculous with each latest instalment.<br/><br/>On 4K Blu-ray 'TFATF' looks good. A thin layer of grain lays over a mostly crisp image. This is the best this movie has ever looked. The grain gives the movie a cinematic look and the refreshed transfer is packed with detail.
HDR allows the paintwork of the wonderful automobiles to pop like never before.
Skin tones can sometimes
look a little over baked for my taste but overall the film does look sublime.
The blue of Paul Walkers eyes make him look like one of those creepy dudes from Game Of Thrones, but this is testament to how good HDR is on this transfer.
Audio gets a belting DTS X mix and this is one to bring the house down.
Bass is really punchy. So much so that I had to disengage the Dynamic EQ on my Home Theatre receiver.
The films soundtrack pumps out with a beat so heavy furniture may move.
Surround effects are constant and height channels are working overtime. This DTS X
mix is best described as being rather Furious.<br/><br/>I enjoyed revisiting this movie.
It's been given a new lease of life on 4K Blu-ray."

","A newbie to Los Angeles (Paul Walker) falls for a cafÃ© host (Jordana Brewster) while trying to join a street-racing gang led by her brother, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel). Meanwhile the LAPD are trying to apprehend a radical group on the highways that targets semis and their valuable cargo. Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.<br/><br/>""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of ""The Warriors"" (1979) and ""Torque"" (2004) with the more serious air of ""Grand Canyon"" (1991) and ""Training Day"" (2001). (Yes, I realize ""Torque"" and ""Training Day"" debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).<br/><br/>Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.<br/><br/>Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.<br/><br/>The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent ""Deep Enough"" by Live.<br/><br/>The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"joedunks","10","2","2","20 February 2019"," The OG and the Best
","I'm never one to write reviews, but this film is one of my favorites for multiple reasons. The 2 main characters of Brian and Dom are just a match made in heaven with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel playing them respectively. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez fit perfectly as the love interests and are some of the most badass women I've seen in car films. This film is a timeless classic because of the car chases, the chemistry of the actors, and the greatness of the action displayed with the cars. The directing was really well done for a movie of this scope mixing slow motion in some car sequences with the real time effects of the stunts that the cars are undertaking. The music fits the film well, and it maintains the tone of the film superbly.<br/><br/>The original of the fast and furious saga definitely set the bar extremely high for the sequels and luckily some of the sequels have been able to reach and some exceed it.
Most of all this movie is special for me because it was influential in my childhood as it was the first PG-13 movie I ever saw as a child (I was 5) lol.
Just an awesome movie all around. Check it out if you've never seen it before."

No, it was just good, clean, greasy fun. The whole cast looked like they had a good time making this. I liked the shoot-out on the roadway, where one of Vin Diesel's crew was hanging for dear life on the truck driven by the psycho who was shooting at him and Diesel with the rifle. I also liked the fight scenes.<br/><br/>See, I'm not really doing an Ebert-style comment on this as it was just a ""joyride"" (excuse the pun). A fun-to-look at joyride and two hours of escapism.<br/><br/>Diesel will never remake Gone With the Wind, but he's cool to watch.<br/><br/>I only gave this 8 out of 10 because I didn't see the whole thing, I tuned in late, but I would like to see it again, this time all the way through."

","My Rating: *** out of ****. <br/><br/>Its safe to say the Fast and the Furious is not an intelligent movie. However, that does not mean it is not entertaining. This is definitely escapist entertainment, or a popcorn movie like many people like to call them. <br/><br/>Vin Diesel is impressive, he has a presence when on screen and he doesnt screw up when delivering his lines. This performance elevated him into stardom and I can definitely see why. Paul Walker is only adequate though, he pales when hes next to Diesel. Jordana Brewster makes Mia into a very appealing character. Michelle Rodriguez is once again playing a tough girl. Rick Yune is effective as the bad guy. <br/><br/>Fast and the Furious does have a few bad lines but that is expected in some summer movies. Mostly the dialogue is fine. The car races and chases are well shot. The film has a few scenes that are a bit overlong but the movie will mostly hold your attention."
"Incubus_Reborn","Null","2","2","16 June 2003"," It serves it's purpose
","The thing about a movie like ""The Fast And The Furious"" is that you can't really trash it too much. Why? Because it is everything that is stated on the label. Look at the cover of the DVD. That is what you get. An Gen-Y action movie starring cars, Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and more cars. It's fast. It's furious. Sure, many plot-holes appear and the movie seems to take a little too much liberty with the plot (a lot of loose-ends) but the movie is fun. It serves it's purpose by providing pure escapism. As someone who HATES reality-tv, it's nice to pop in a movie like this, kick back, and forget my problems for 110 minutes. The movie moves fluidly and just as fast as the cars do. The plot, despite having many flaws, is extremely strong for it's type. Basically, Paul Walker plays an undercover cop who is trying to bust a group of hijackers to earn his ticket into the FBI. He hits the streets to blend in as a street racer and try to nose out who is behind the job. He gets close to the top-street racer Dominic (Vin Diesel) and soon he is faced with the decision of keeping true to his pal, or ratting him out for his chance at the career he has always dreamed of. It's basically a pop-corn movie. Don't hold too much too it. As long as you can get over the lapses in logic -- Why didn't the trucker just stop, reload his gun, and shoot Vince? Because it makes for an adrenaline pumping action sequence (that's why!) -- you'll find yourself enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>7/10"

The Fast and the Furious is all about street racing and until you actually race you kinda don't get the whole picture. Its not about the plot (which was a good plot, nicely organized, and played out) its all about the cars. How many people go to a movie just to see if the plot is played out in a good way? Maybe you guys should try watching the movie for the cars, the excitement, and the people...not for a stupid plot.

The friendships that were found and the TEAM efforts meant everyone was included (maybe with a little rivalry between Vince and Brian at the beginning) BUT it all worked out in the end showing that friendships over ride all.<br/><br/>The cars were brilliant (me i love my cars!) but these were SEXY cars with popular names and each car suited it's actor / actress down to the ground.

I have to say that im a definite movie buff, but fast cars, action sequences, macho cops, girls in skin tight clothes coupled with brainless actors dont appeal to me.  Thats the impression i had of this flick.  Every guy i spoke to said that they LOVED the movie.  I had NO inclination to watch it either, until my twin made me see it and i was shocked.  Not only was all the stereotypes that i previously mentioned tastefully avoided, but those that were included were executed with style!<br/><br/>Excellent!  Vin Diesel was brilliant as Dominic not to mention on the top of my sexiest guys list! Paul Walker could have given a stronger performance, but i think that was mostly due to the script and not a reflection on his acting abilities.  The script is filled with humour and great wit.  What a pleasure to watch a movie, have no real expetations and come out smiling!  I have already seen this movie 3 more times and am not at breaking point yet. I was also thrilled to hear that there is a sequel in the making.<br/><br/>
Great Movie - again! See this, there's something for everyone.  Romance, action and not forgetting...the beautiful cars!"

","I don't really care what anyone else thinks of this movie. I thought it was a great movie. I went to the theaters 13 times to watch it and then I bought the movie the first day it was out on video. I even have it on DVD. I thought Paul Walker was excellent in this movie. And even though it was a small part, Chad Lindberg was great too! I just loved the whole thing. They need to make more movies like this one. Not to mention the cars were so awesome."

","God, how i loved this movie! Okay, so the story-line is thin, and the movie has an open ending(which i love because the now can make a sequal!), but the sound of the cars and the total entourage was perfect!! This is the way i would have liked it over here in Holland, but the car-culture is not as dramatic as is in this movie over here- as is the weather!! I found it most entertaining because i completely lost myself in the movie- the movie didn't bore me throughout the 1 hour 45 min. I went for four times to the movies and now own it on DVD.

","The Fast and the Furious is not too bad.  The plot line is predictable but is presented in a way that makes it entertaining.  There are some scenes that are not believable and could have been better.  The most glaring are the robbery scenes.  It is just a miss match that is so obvious the director ignores until the end of the film.  <br/><br/>The acting of Pawl Walker as Brian O'Conner and Vin Diesel as Domminic Toretto are not bad.  There are few difficult scenes that will make you wince but overall it is workable.  The chase scenes are generally good but the opening scenes is painful to watch.  It just does not appear plausible and does not make much sense.  <br/><br/>Overall, not bad (7 out of 10)."

The stunt and race sequences were excellent and the actors all played their parts like i would expect the characters to act in the real world.<br/><br/>You might think that this is solely a bloke flick, but even if your not car crazy like myself, there's enough else happening during the movie to keep you watching intensely, as was proven by the fact that it kept the attention of my girlfriend and 2 of her female friends from start to finish.<br/><br/>Over all a fantastic movie, combining all the best parts of male life: Beautiful Motors, Beautiful Women, Violence and Money.<br/><br/>Truly Awesome; rent or buy it ASAP."

","Having read the other comments on the Fast and the Furious after watching the film and its making of feature on DvD. I felt I had to add my own comments on the movie. Yes granted its storyline of undercover cop starts liking the world he infiltrates isnt that great. But I didnt put the Fast and the Furious in my DvD player expecting an expertly crafted character piece. I wanted an action movie seeing as this what it seemed to be advertising itself as. If you want a great car chase movie, full of some expertly shot set pieces like the attacks on the trucks, the drag races and the final shot of the charger flipping of the truck then this movie delivers in spades. It easily ranks alongside the classic car movies of all time, granted its no Bullit or the Italian Job. But its just as good as Gone in Sixty Seconds, and for any fan's of the playstation and PS2 Gran Turismo series of games its great to see hollywood recognise the coolness of Asian cars like the Supra, Civic etc. As an action movie it scores 7/10 as aside from some interesting shots it isnt that original if your a complete petrol head or love seat of the pants movies add another point or 2!"

","This has to be one of the best movies i have viewed in recent years, the acting is awesome and was full of realism a quality that you will struggle to find nowadays. To add to the acting the plot was smoothly laid out and the cars were total mean machines that any man would be proud to drive Although the storyline may have been vague in places and long winded it certainly lived up to its name and rightly deserves to live up to its name 'the fast and the furious'.

","When i watched the fast and the furious i thought it was the best movie i've ever seen. I read some of the other comments and when the people complain about the ending that's not right. They said that they were going to make a Fast and the Furious 2! So if they told you what happened to the guy that got shot, or if (Paul walker) was still a cop, or even if him and the girl got together! Then what would the sequel be about? It's called a CLIFHANGER and it's suppose to be like that, your supose to make up the ending on what you think happened. And it does tell you where (vin diesel) goes at the end of the movie if you were paying attention. He goes to Mexico!"
"Krystall_Mechelle","8","2","2","1 February 2002"," I loved it
","This movie is about illegal street racing (people who build or design their own cars to race them) and how someone within the racing world is robbing truckers.  I am a fan of cars, racing, and all that jazz. So this movie was a great way of bringing this underworld to life. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Rick Yune, Michelle Rodriguez (even though her role was small) and Jordana Brewster gave a solid performance. The soundtrack was excellant with every scene. This movie is stellar if you love cars, racing, and music."
"godwhosees","Null","2","2","29 January 2002"," I loved this movie, and I don't even care about cars!
","This movie is about so much more than just fast cars. Loyalty, friendship, truth, and split-second life changing decisions are all a part of this film. The car-mechanic side is kept to a minimum, and it is all fast-paced enough to keep the non-technical audience from getting bored. I went and bought the DVD before I had even returned the one I rented!"
"Gambitt","7","2","2","2 July 2001"," THIS is how you do summer movies
","If you want plot, script and oscar-winning performances, go rent Shawshank Redemption or something.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't know why some people have come down so hard on this movie. It's like saying, ""Airplane"" was dumb because the characters were poorly developed and shallow, and the plot was unrealistic.<br/><br/>""The Fast and the Furious"" is a great summer, action flick.  Definitely gets the heart pumping and the adrenaline flowing.  The chase and race scenes have some great stunts.  The cars are gorgeous and fun to watch.  I saw it over a week after it opened, and the audience was still very receptive to the action in this movie.<br/><br/>Now this is where I am supposed to slam the plot and the acting.  Well, to be honest, I thought the plot was quite GOOD, given that all they had to work with was the theme of ""street racing.""  I didn't think the acting was all that bad.  The entire cast did fine, given the script they had and the kind of movie it was.  <br/><br/>One fatal mistake many action movies try to do is weave in too much drama or emotion, which inevitably ends up looking cheesey and just slows down the movie.  FnF was guilty of this, but only to a small degree.  A brief dive into Vin Diesel's scarred childhood, a little bit of corny romance for Walker, but that's it.  I respect a movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to cross any lines.<br/><br/>The movie makers set out to make a movie that presents Import Racing to the masses.  So they had to make a plot to house that movie.  Personally, I think they did a pretty good job.  Definitely worth a go in a theater.<br/><br/>PS: I never saw all of Point Break, but from what I did see, it looked dumb. Like an extended Mellow Yellow commercial."
"I_Ailurophile","1","16","34","16 October 2002"," Absolute trash like I can scarcely recall seeing before
","Fast cars.  Fast women.  Superb plot.  Superb acting.<br/><br/>Which of the above would you like to have in a movie?  The former two, or the latter two?  Well, if you're looking for the latter two, then don't watch this movie, because you just might find yourself jumping off a bridge in horror afterwards.<br/><br/>Why this movie was popular I will never know. Sure, it has fast cars.  But has anyone aside from me noticed that all the drag racing vehicles look almost identical aside from the paintjob?  That's no fun; 'Gone in 60 Seconds' had a plethora of beauties; this film, with seemingly only one model on display, doesn't even pick a particularly appealing car to flirt with. Fast women?  Sure.  But I've lost count of the movies I've seen with beautiful women in them, especially movies with beautiful women that actually DO have a plot to them. There is no plot here that hasn't been used scores of times already.  And the ""chase"" scenes?  Ugh.  I think I'm going to go watch 'The French Connection' again; it bored the heck out of me, but even those chase scenes are more exciting than this. Finally, the acting.  Vin Diesel is the next Arnold Schwarzenegger; you can tell that easily, first by his build, second by his horrible attempt at acting.  And the other actors here?  Ugh.  I've already forgotten their names with glee.<br/><br/>Drag racing.  Whoo-hoo.  Yay.  Yippee.  Too bad it's been done many times before - with better cars, purtier women, great plots and great acting.<br/><br/>Watch this only if you're really, really, terribly bored.  Wait, hold that thought.  Just don't watch it, period.  You have better things to do with your time, I'm sure."
"Cheese_Detector","1","17","37","26 January 2002"," This movie made me Furious really Fast
","I won't say: 'What were you expecting, an Oscar performance? I was expecting crap and that's what I got, so I'm going to give this one a 10.' (You don't rate a movie on how it met your expectations, you rate them compared to OTHER MOVIES. Don't read reviews with the title ""What did you expect?"") If those are not what you want to hear, read on.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. This movie is about a hip-hop cop who infiltrates a street racing gang that hijacks trucks for fun. You've got to see the hijacking to believe it; those idiots tear up stuff worth much more than whatever is in the truck. From the very beginning it's hard to believe that this Walker dude is a police officer. He acts like a teenager; the only thing missing is those baggy pants that you can get lost in; he's got the accent and everything right. This gang leader guy, Diesel Tornado, is also a tough hip-hop punk, so they get along quite well. And the way Tornado's girlfriend acts makes me wonder is she's really a girl, or an undercover guy. She doesn't act girly and she's got a scorn on her face 24/7 - not pretty. Somebody tell me why a 1/4 mile race lasts a few minutes with 10 second cars. Oh, and the last guy to hit the tiny red button on the steering wheel wins. If you read some of the other reviews, you'll probably notice that every second one says it's a clone of 'Point Break'.<br/><br/>Here's how you make a really cool movie: 1. Get pretty actors, and... that's it. It doesn't need to be original. As long as all the viewers fall in love with the actors, they're going to love everything about the movie. So what if a floodboard magically comes back into the car? So what if the cop doesn't do his job, just to get the respect of his fellow hip-hop buddy? Who cares?<br/><br/>The music was okay. (I had to say something good.)<br/><br/>Now here's how you know if you'll like the movie or not. You'll like it if any of the following is true:<br/><br/><ul><li>You find anyone in the cast you're in love with. - You call your friends 'brothers' and 'sisters' (and not because you're a priest). - You only pull your pants halfway up and you cover the rest with 5 layers of shirts (longer one at the bottom). - You're a car enthusiast. - You're pretty stupid and you like your movies the same way.</li></ul><br/><br/>If you're into hip-hop, this movie will make you feel good. Be proud of the time you spent in jail, support your friends who break the law and go practise your special handshake with your buddies.<br/><br/>Look for an increase of street racing in your area and thank the people who made this garbage.<br/><br/>1/10"

","The Fast and the Furious (2001)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Brainless but entertaining action film about cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who goes undercover to get inside the street racing crowd so that he can try to bring down a group hijacking semi trucks. He gets in good with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew but of course they don't know his true identity. THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS isn't to be taken serious because if you did then you'd see one flaw after another in regards to the story itself. Like a lot of summer blockbusters, this one here has had way too many Red Bulls as every single scene is just over-the-top and has some testosterone going overboard. That's not to say this is a bad thing because there's no question that the film remains entertaining as a pure action movie as we're given some likable characters as well as some great racing scenes. I think most people are going to be coming to this thing for the fast cars and the various chases and this here is where the film won't let you down. There are some terrific stunt sequences, although I will admit that a few of them appear to be too much CGI and not enough actual driving. With that said, there are some great ones here including the ending, which I won't spoil here. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some characters that we can like even if I think the screenplay doesn't do a couple of them justice. Both Walker and Diesel are very believable in their roles as is Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and even Ted Levine in his role. I will say at times it's somewhat hard to root for the main guys even though we do like this. This is especially true during the final sequence when the truck is being hijacked. Still, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fun ride as long as you don't expect some serious piece of art."

","This movie shows what people mad about racing cars can make. It's absolutely awesome that any of those cars can reach such high speed in the streets of an American big city. This is due to the good quality of the asphalt and the skills of the drivers. One thing that impressed me was the Detroit-made car driven by Toretto.<br/><br/>America looks like an awesome country.<br/><br/>Dominic Toretto is an American car builder who has the reputation of being the best at everything that has something to do with gasoline. And Vin Diesel carries out his task with an awesome performance.<br/><br/>Paul Walker is another great American actor, very handsome, who plays a good-guy who is loyal first and foremost to his buddies. He would never let them down. He shows a fascinating charisma and that is what make a difference. The style of American customized cars is astonishing and you will dream with those cars for a while. This great Hollywood movie is worth to see several times."

","I had never seen any of the fast and furious films before I just watched this one recently and had heard from some friends that they were absolutely amazing! I finally decided to watch the 1st one and see what it was all about. Brian O' Connor is a cop who is sent undercover into the street racing world to bust some crooks who have been stealing millions of dollars worth of electronics to pay for their extremely fast (and furious) cars. I enjoyed watching it but it was not a jump and amaze me completely movie. I enjoyed how Brian O' Connor was not revealed to be a cop until around 30 minutes or so into the movie. It made you feel for him that much more as he tried to gain respect in the hard undercover world of street racing. The races were very high intensity and fun to watch, even if I do not know hardly anything about cars. Vin Diesel has since lost his appeal but he was great as the big bad leader of the street racing team around him. Overall, 7/10."
"elijaman2002","Null","3","4","11 December 2011"," An action packed ride that will please gear-heads and non-enthusiasts alike
","Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), a police officer, goes undercover at Harry's high performance auto parts store, The Racer's Edge, to infiltrate an illegal street racing subculture and figure out who is responsible for hijacking trucks loaded with expensive electronic merchandise. Armed with a highly modified Mitsubishi Eclipse, O'Conner enters the world of street-racers to meet the leader of a notorious gang led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), who are suspected in the hijackings. After helping Toretto escape the police when their race is broken up, O'Conner wins his way into Toretto's good graces. Things go awry, however, after the gang attempts another hijacking, and O'Conner is compelled to move in and stop them. The NOS injected action/adventure film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (Letty), Jordana Brewster (Mia Toretto), Chad Lindberg (Jesse), Johnny Strong (Leon) and Matt Schulze (Vince), and is sure to please fans of such genres as well as many a gear-head.<br/><br/>But The Fast and The Furious is, of course, not without the requisite, if not cliché, femme fatale motif to add a little suspense. Sure, Mia Toretto is not exactly fatale, but her role is just a docile variety of what you expect in a movie such as The Fast and The Furious: to create inner conflict in O'Conner and unwittingly—in her case at least—to challenge his priorities. Unlike other undercover movies such as Point Break or Breach, though, The Fast and The Furious will not keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. But that is fine here. Despite the covert operations and confused loyalties of O'Conner, action is the point here—car action to specific. Everything else is supportive filler to keep the story moving.<br/><br/>What is perhaps one of the best treats of all in this movie is the final drag race. It is a classic stop light drag race, complete with a speeding train through a railroad crossing and an obstructing tractor trailer to add extra layers of excitement. After all, what good is a car movie without at least a few melodramatic crashes and close calls of the predictable variety. Who would have guessed a train would go speeding by mere seconds after O'Conner and Toretto go airborne—inexplicably—over the train tracks, or that a tractor trailer would just happen to impede a lane traffic as the pair go racing down the street at full throttle? Even though the special effects are simple here (no CGI), they still add to the excitement. Indeed, the action packed plot is focused on catching a gang of street racers who hijack trucks to support their lifestyle. The cars, then, are naturally as much a part of the supporting cast as the actors themselves, and the special effects and stunts are what make their action sequences so much fun to watch, while also supporting the story line.<br/><br/>In the end, The Fast and The Furious is well worth the addition to any action/adventure enthusiast's or gear-head's DVD collection. Even though the film may not be a classic hit, it has a well cast ensemble of actors who fulfill the sub-cultural niche this movie seeks to portray, using a fictional undercover story line of cops and robbers."
"KineticSeoul","7","3","4","28 April 2011"," The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors
","This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"raulfaust","7","3","4","27 December 2010"," break her heart and I break your neck
","Wow that feels good. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a classic for those who like cars and gangs with a believable plot. All the actors really seemed to be what their characters were, specially Vin Diesel's. He playing the bad boy who puts friendship above everything is really respectable and it makes the spectator likes him and his friends. <br/><br/>Also Walker's character could be considered as a hero and someone to be looked up to, since he cared for people as they were, putting people and their considerations above his job. It was an amazing scene when he saved Vince, because Vince showed no respect and consideration for him; Walker's char could easily leave and let him die, but he saved him without nothing in return: worse than that, allowing Toretto find out he was a cop, leading him to a trouble.<br/><br/>Toretto's sister was really sexy and we feel happy when she gets together with O'Conner. The cars were awesome and I think that everyone who watches this movie is jealous and wants to drive those speedy cars. I just didn't like how the movie ended, it was kind of disappointing to me, I was expecting much more. Anyways, a must see for adrenaline lovers."
"qormi","8","3","4","19 December 2010"," Pure Fantasy, but it Works
","This is a good movie to watch more than once. The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect and it seemed very fast-paced and confusing. The movie is rather bizarre, and I dismissed it as being dumb. The second time I saw it, I began to appreciate it. The cinematography, editing, and clipped acting worked together with the hip soundtrack. The plot seemed implausible, but it was entertaining. Definitely a cut above any ""B"" flick, this film was first rate. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were great in their respective roles. When Diesel went off and kicked someone's butt, he was the epitome of a genuine bad dude. Walker was the ultimate in cool, even though he acted like a teenager, but that's what undercover cops do. So, I have to recommend ""Fast and Furious"" - tuner car heaven. And the climactic duel between tuner cars and 18-wheeler was one of the better action sequences ever filmed. Even though climbing onto the hood of a truck going 80 mph is completely ludicrous. How would he get into the cab without being hit with a stick? Doesn't the driver have a cell phone to call 911??"
"Floated2","7","3","4","8 September 2010"," One of a kind of the series
","There's a good love story wrapped around the manifolds and superchargers.Its about a series of truck high-jacks has brought in a squad of undercover cops to deal with the problem and they do so by sending Officer Brian Earl Spilner (real name Brian O'Conner) (Paul Walker) to infiltrate the number one racing clan. It's led by Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), the fastest and strongest among 'em. O'Conner starts his quest by demonstrating his hangup with speedy metal, then by hanging around Dom's bar, which Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) runs and bartends. In the course of events he loses his ride, saves Dom's life and some embarrassment, hooks up with Mia, and learns to respect Dom in ways he never expected.<br/><br/>The racing sequences are brought off with considerable energy and as an expression of this culture but are weakened by a plot device contrived to give the races and the racers a dynamic advantage. The movie had a decent plot but the writing and dialogue was poor. Many people consider the first one the best of the series and I agree with them on some levels. Though had the writing and dialogue been better, this film would have been much better. Also they could have used better character development and better acting. Its a film centered at a specific group. Meaning not for everyone. As a rewatch 06/03/19', the original Fast and the Furious shows how everything was set up. A solid debut and shows the early stages of how this become a dynasty in the making."
"RNMorton","9","3","4","10 April 2009"," Unique and very entertaining
","It's pretty hard at this point in time to call anything ""groundbreaking"" in cinema, there's so much trash out there that is either eye candy, mindless or a rehash of some movie made much better years ago. I thought this one rises above other recent efforts largely because of the screen presence of Vin Diesel. Walker is undercover cop out to get behind recent truck-jackings in California. Diesel is an L.A. car hot-shot who is a prime suspect for the crimes. Walker insinuates himself into Vin's group and takes the lay of the land from there. Brewster is very attractive and effective as Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest. There's two things about this movie I think unique - Diesel's character (a strange mix of menace, indifference and personal loyalty), and the focus on the hopped-up econocar culture these guys operate in. I've seen bits and pieces of Diesel in other movies and he seems darker and less effective there, I think he worked well with the quietly upbeat Walker on this one. I'm hoping the new Fast & Furious can live up to this entry, well done!"

But when I went to see this movie I was blown away! It was beautifully done, from the edge of your seat rush of the racing sequence to the excelent plot.<br/><br/>Normally movies like this have no psychology to their characters, and though that wasn't the main focus, this movie did pull off having convincing and entertaining characters. It gave us a look at friendship, and showed us a whole other world not often portrayed in movies! Vin Diesel blew me away, a great talent I hadn't formerly seen.<br/><br/>An excellent piece of cinema!<br/><br/>I gave it a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>It pulled off exactly what it set out to do. It may not be one of those Oscar winners, but it wasn't meant to be. It was just a fun movie."
"bsblover99_98","10","3","4","20 May 2002"," This is the best movie that I have EVER seen!!!
","I HATE people that badmouth movies with STUPID criticisms, and seeing as I can only find bad criticisms on the internet, I'm here to sway the pendgulem. The acting was impeccable! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two actors, not soon to be forgotten, and with the sequel coming out in 2003, who COULD forget them?! They are obviously the hottest onscreen duo that I have seen in a long time! Many memorable lines will forever be etched into he minds of viewers such as: ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck"" (Vin Diesel); ""...it doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile- winning is winning."" (also Vin Diesel). This movie is by far a definite winner and everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like it... haven't even seen i. They say the commercials for it don't look good! Well I say don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a movie by it's trailor!"

","I had so much fun watching this movie that I went back 9 more times!  I made sure that I took different friends every time and none of them ever complained either.  Three of them were indifferent, but the other six said they honestly got a kick out of it the high energy, special effects, beautiful people and beautiful cars!<br/><br/>I loved TFATF because it never pretended to be anything more than what it turned out to be.....  A great action flick with lots of speed and color. No one was pretending this was Shakespeare, but each actor gave his/her performance his/her best shots.  Yes, they are ""callow youths"" and the story was pretty much unbelievable, but hey!!  That is why I go to movies.  I go to suspend belief and be entertained and amused.  When I want to get intellectual and ""think"", I stay home and read a serious book.<br/><br/>
I loved this lightweight piece of fluff.  It was great fun and I made sure to buy the DVD when it came out so that I can revisit the color, action and speed whenever I please.  God bless Rob Cohen, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and all those beautiful vehicular bullets in The Fast and The Furious!"

If you like cars, street racing and watching a movie to see the cars only we can dream about this is it. Plus, these aren't fifth rate actors, because they spent money on the cars.

But all in all it's a none stop thrill of fast cars and brilliant action sequences from the great Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story), My recommendation is that if you haven't seen it then WHY NOT."

I expected a major testosterone rush and I got it.<br/><br/>FaF warranted three sittings in the theatre.  It had the best cinematography since Crouching Tiger and Fight Club, and it had good special effects.  If all anyone ever watched was a movie like Traffic that was an intellectual movie then he or she would not have a credible say about the quality of a movie.  If you can't handle bad acting and a mediocre plot in exchange for some intense testosterone pumping action then don't come near it.  What were you expecting?  It's VIN DIESEL!!!

","This movie is my favorite movie of all time- the acting was great, the story line was great and it was very fast, action-packed and well... furious!!! I loved how the movie allowed the viewer to create their own ending for themselves, and how Dominic Toretto being the villain was such a surprise. I really believed the hi-jackers were Johnny Tran and his gang!!! I would have never expected The Team.  The love between Brian Spilner and Mia Toretto was an added twist, giving the movie a lot more feeling to it then just fast women and fast cars.  Letty was great, she has an attitude that I totally agree with- it's time for the guys to take a back seat and let the girls show their stuff.  She also doesn't put up with crap from other girls when they are hitting on her man!!!  Leon and Jesse are great additions, Jesse being comical, but also being a very leading role in the whole situation.  Vince was a jerk, but without him, the movie would definitely not have been complete.  The cars were just sic, the effects and the drag racing making your adrenaline pump along with the characters'.  This movie held me spellbound in the theaters and I have watched it at least 10 times so far on the DVD, never tiring of it once.

"eupolis","1","13","28","1 July 2001"," trash, designed specifically to play on my generation's stupidity
","I personally hated this movie, for several reasons...<br/><br/>Firstly, seeing a (""modified"") Civic with a 5 foot spoiler and neon lights, flying down a street at 170mph by a fruity pretty-boy high school reject doesn't excite me. In fact, this was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This movie is aimed squarely at a market of teenagers who add racecar decals, spoilers, and 4 exhaust pipes, to their 35mpg mom-mobiles in hopes that people will think they are cool. I'm also proud to announce that my '84 Volvo is apparently ready to go on hijackings using sophisticated equipment (thing that shoots a hook thing) and extensive planning (shoot the hook thing at the thing), as soon as I get myself a neon light or two and a dorky helmet. OH yes, and NOS!!!!!!!<br/><br/>For help deciding if you'll watch 'the fast and the furious'... If you enjoy movies with a plot, or any other even remotely intelligent values (like adhering to the laws of physics) then this one's a no go, unless you enjoy making fun of things like the little Darias that you are. The special effects are mediocre, just because they either involve fire coming out of cars somehow, or cars flying through the air. They were doing that all the time in the 80s, you know. The characters... yes, they have some character development; By the end of the movie you know that they are all a bunch of losers with way too much money to spend on their Civics. Bottom line: as long as teens are stupid, movies like this will keep being made, to profit on that stupidity. Thats the American way."
"MACarter214","1","11","23","4 April 2008"," My Most Hated Film
","Normally I don't comment on films that I knew I wouldn't enjoy just by seeing the trailer. But I was reminded of this atrocity when I recently saw a news blurb about another installment of this franchise and remembered when I saw it for the first 5 times. I was serving in the Navy back in 2002 and our IT department ran a channel shown on the ship that shows movies. Apparently, someone thought it would be a good idea to show this film over and over.<br/><br/>This movie manages to be offensive on so many different levels that it boggles the mind and violates it at the same time. The plot is unoriginal and base, the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered, the editing is like an epileptic seizure, and yet somehow it is overglossed and shined up. Kinda like a polished turd.<br/><br/>And as if the film wasn't just badly acted and written, it also manages to offend just about everyone with an IQ above a 10 year-old who views it. I'd say it's misogynistic, but there are no women in this movie. There are material possessions that resemble women, but when their function is to be placed on the hoods of cars for decoration, won in races, or used against other men for position, than basically you've turned once promising actresses into blow-up dolls with heartbeats. There's also plenty of racial stereotyping. Whites, Hispanics, and Asians frequently insult each other based on skin color, but hey, that's hip, yo! But I'd have to say this film is more insulting to me as a man. If you believe this movie, then all men are insecure, materialistic blowhards who are in constant competition and serve only to one-up each other. Whether who has the faster car, who can break the law more, or who can get closest to the ever elusive ""menage a trois."" And what's sad, is that I've seen so many trailers for films that seem to ape this MTV culture of immaturity, faux-machismo, and flash-zoom editing since that basically make this the culmination of all that is bad in films today.<br/><br/>I try to see the good in all movies, and if I can't, then I just say ""it's not my thing, but if someone else likes it, good for them."" This is the ONLY film I cannot let off the hook. It is unforgivable and I loathe its very existence."
"benestine","1","14","31","14 May 2002"," One of the worst movies I ever saw in the theater.
","I know this movie isn't supposed to be a work of art.  It's just supposed to be a mindless roller coaster ride with car chase scenes.  I can respect shallow entertainment sometimes.  THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL. I'm not going to go into detail about the horrible acting; predictable, unoriginal plot; and the complete absence of any kind of meaning.  This is a dumb action movie that is just supposed to appeal to a person's shallow senses. The running time of this movie is 106 min.  Maybe 15 min of this movie actually has car chase scenes or action happening on the screen.  A mindless action movie should be at least 1/3 action.  Most of this movie is filled with unlikeable characters in their 20's, who act like they're in junior high, just conversing with each other like morons.  The only character in this movie I liked was the truck driver towards the end of the movie trying to kill all the main characters with a shotgun.

"kurkosdr","1","7","15","22 January 2009"," Awful movie...
","Awful movie made in order to help makers of ugly body kits and rims sell their garbage to teens desperately wanting to make their economy cars go faster (see: ricers).<br/><br/>Mind you, the fast and the furious movie IS NOT a movie for car enthusiasts. This movie is trying to PASS ITSELF as a movie for car enthusiasts, in order to extract money from teens on needless ""upgrades"" by making them believe they can become real racers (and car enthusiasts) too.<br/><br/>---This movie has either been made: <br/><br/>1) By a bunch of people having no clue how cars work whatsoever (as I 've seen the inside of a Mazda shown as having pistons and not rotary engine) <br/><br/>2) Or by a bunch of marketing guys trying to make people throw their cash away hoping to make their rusty urban car into a super car (as I 've seen blatant advertising of several part makers, and trying to make the audience believe that skylines, supra s and civics with silly modifications like ugly body kits and rims are the best cars to drive around in a city*) <br/><br/>---Need more convincing? Here are the Lessons I learned From The fast and The furious:<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing wrong with installing a nitrous oxide system in a stock engine. Why someone shouldn't? The only thing you have to worry about is not to burn your piston rings. Yes, these damn piston rings. You don't have to worry about losing a valve, destroying the piston itself, or blowing up the engine block. <br/><br/>Flames coming out of the exhaust all the time is good, cos, you know, it looks cool and doesn't mean that the air-fuel mixture is improperly balanced and the catalytic converter will melt the next second. -When attempting to go around a corner, make sure your car slides (aka ""drifts"") to the side as much possible, 30 degrees or more, as this is the right way of driving fast.<br/><br/>All these -so called- professional racers at WTCC, trying to keep clean lines and never slide more than 30 degrees, are pathetic losers forced to drive politically correct by their bosses. Only Vin Diesel knows how to drive really fast and like a real man. <br/><br/>Mazda's do not have rotary engines<br/><br/>---Final Verdict: 1.3 That's 1 point for the Challenger I saw in the end(it would have been a 2.4 if they hadn't removed the 'hemi' engine during the drag scene and put a fake air scoop), plus 0.3 for effects. This would have been a nice and fun movie, IF the makers DIDN'T PRETEND to be knowing about the subject it was dealing with and MADE IT AS FUNNY AS POSSIBLE. Period.<br/><br/>Also see: Need For Speed Underground (a formerly good racing video game that replaced super cars with bummers, exotics roads with boring urban landscape, and the concept of just racing for fun with the concept of fitting loads of plastic junk to a economy car to earn ""rep"", races, magazine covers and chicks -in that order-)<br/><br/>*I am not saying the Skyline, Supra and Civic aren't good cars. They are very reliable and well made machines, that can do wonders in the hands of someone that is a real car enthusiast."
"nichtssagend","3","5","10","29 May 2011"," Shallow movie about hot cars and girls - big problem: they get the ""cars"" part completely wrong!
","OK, I get it, the movie is only to show hot cars and girls, so I won't comment on the thin, improbable and hole-riddled plot. Instead I'm going to list just a few thing that are wrong about the cars in the movie, which I'm guessing was designed for viewers who largely have no clue about cars, maybe because the target audience is slightly too young to drive, i.e. early teens? Well, here goes: 1. NOS seems to be the solution to everything. There is a lot more involved to make a car go fast, yet the shop is full of NOS, NOS, and more NOS parts! Oh, and exhausts, because everyone knows loud exhausts are the 2nd most important thing that makes a car go fast ;-) 2. The car ""tops out at 140"", let's add some NOS (surprise!) and it'll go faster. If your car tops out at 140, NOS will not help you one bit. Maybe you're running out of gears, maybe the engine should be built for higher revs, but NOS won't change anything about your top speed! 3. The best qualities of the type of cars driven, modern Japanese cars, are cornering and handling. What do they do? They have a drag race on a straight instead - wrong car for this purpose, any average US muscle car will beat the hell out of the Jappa there with less money spent on it (and conversely, a modern Japanese car will leave an average old US muscle car in the dust in an actual race involving lots of corners).<br/><br/>4. Double-clutching ... oh dear, what a complete and utter nonsense! You double-clutch if you have an unsynchronized transmission - very unlikely - and even then only when you down-shift (which you never do in a drag race!) 5. 140mph is fast at the end of a quarter mile, but not that fast in principle, there are *many* European and Japanese cars that have a top speed around that figure or higher, even ""family cars"".<br/><br/>6. Nitrous oxide doesn't run out after a few seconds (lines in the movie indicate a racer has used his NOS boost ""too early"").<br/><br/>7. If Vin is serious about drag racing, he wouldn't have a sound system weighing a ton in his car. Note, there's a scene where the geek is explaining how to save 2-3kg of weight on the car they're building later on, so on the other hand they do seem to be interested in saving weight.<br/><br/>8. Towards the end, Vin drives the Charger and does a monstrous wheelie. You don't get that kind of traction/wheelie on anything but big fat racing slicks, yet the car has pretty normal tires on it.<br/><br/>9. While we're at it - the tires are smoking while he does a wheelie?! Wheelie means you have grip. Smoking tires means you don't have grip. Which is it?!? 10. A car like that Charger would definitely have a wheelie bar, especially since a wheelie as big and exaggerated as the one shown in the movie would just cost you time.<br/><br/>11. If you're serious about 1/4 mile times, you're not going to drive a FWD car, but rather a RWD or 4WD car.<br/><br/>12. Surely even the boy-racer scene with Jappa cars finds cheap stickers tacky (no pun intended) and would opt for real airbrush or pin-striping on their prized cars (there is one scene where they put decorative stickers(!) on a car).<br/><br/>13. Why would you rebuild a burnt out Supra?! Apparently their labor is free and restoring the car is done in a leisurely afternoon or something. Oh, and the engine is so special that $15k turns it into a 10s car! These are just off the top of my head, and I'm not even that knowledgeable about cars myself, so I'm sure there's plenty more wrong. The movie doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't, but at least they should have gotten the ""car"" parts right in what is meant to be a car movie! ...or did I get that wrong and I just watched a very long commercial for NOS (which is a brand name ;-) ?"

Like motorcycle gang cliche movies from the 50's, you see.<br/><br/>(Spoilers abound ahead)<br/><br/>How about this one: the blame for the crimes is shifted to an Asian guy, who is arrested at his family home during a meal. Instead of being angry with the cops, the father slaps his son. Good scene. Anyway, in spite of the fact that this guy machine gunned a police undercover vehicle which we are told cost $80,000, destroying it completely, he can't be held because all they have is ""minor weapons violations"". Right.<br/><br/>Ok - I had a stopwatch and timed the ""10 second race"" at one minute 51 seconds. Now, this is about par for the quarter mile times of a REAL Honda, but apparently these ones are heavily modified, so you'd expect them to at least be in the under-a-minute range, right?<br/><br/>It amazes me that someone can blow up his motor, destroying rings according to one character, and yet drive away with no smoke AND elude cops with the exact same car just seconds later. I wish MY car would self-repair like that, it would save me a lot of hassles and scuffed fingers.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say is, if you feel that you want to immerse yourself in a fantasy world that has very little basis in reality, where cars auto-repair and quarter mile races last almost two minutes, and cops let their quarry escape, and truck drivers don't get out of their trucks to check on the guy that just totalled his car on the truck, well, go right on ahead.<br/><br/>Afterward, go slap a giant exhaust tip and goofy spoiler on your ugly little tin box import, then come race me at a track. This movie will not prepare you for the realities of street racing OR life in general.<br/><br/>I rate this movie as a 2, only because of the strangely compelling performance of Ja-Rule and because the cinematography was pretty good. Otherwise it deserved a zero."

","You've all seen them. Kids driving around in their ""souped up"" cars... tinted windows, flashy decals, low profile tires, sweet rims, body kit, wing, and of course the noisy turbo blow-off valve and a few NOS stickers. This movie is basically filled with street-racers doing quarter miles. Meanwhile, Dom and his goons are also stealing car parts. There's a bunch of sub-plots going on here. The movie wasn't all that bad. I watch it from time to time.<br/><br/>The bad points: <br/><br/><ul><li>The quarter miles take 5 minutes to complete </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They manage to reach 160 mph in a quarter mile.

","'The Fast and the Furious' is probably only enjoyable for those cinema-goers who enjoy films about cars and ellaborate chase scenes and for girls who like to see Vin Diesel. This film had nothing going for it whatsoever (unless, of course, you are really into one of those subjects that I just mentioned). The film is all about fast cars and a little bit of crime with 'bad guys/bad girls' image. That sums up the entire film, which leaves little to the imagination and little anything to appreciate.<br/><br/>I certainly will not be recommending this film to anyone. Hey, if you like nothing but watching cars race on screen and a little bit of 'bad guy/bad girl' gang life, then I hope you enjoy this. I personally think it is one of the worst movies that I've had the displeasure of seeing."
"Agent10","3","6","13","26 May 2002"," Fickle film making against a backdrop of stupidity
","Mindless, thoughtless action was happily brought to you by this crum-bum of a movie. While I did like the cars in the film, especially the modified muscle car, this detail just wasn't enough to call this a legitimate story. Paul Walker seemed horribly out of his element. Are we supposed to believe his is an actual cop or some wannabe? Vin Deisal was solid in his role, but nothing else could be gained from this relatively low brow film."
"Tyson14","7","3","5","28 March 2015"," the first ride
","It's strange that one of the best franchises in movie history started off with Vin Diesel stealing a bunch of VHS players. Make no mistake about it, under the corny dialogue, awful soundtrack, horrid direction, and a general sheen that makes it clear that this is a 2001-ass movie from 2001, this is also at its core a Fast & Furious movie. So in preparation for the impending release of Furious 7, let's look how the film that started it all held to the franchise's tenants of Life, Cars, and Family.<br/><br/>Life: Although the ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" mantra is corny, I think it plays well in the streets of the film's world. A world where respect is everything, but that respect has to be both earned and backed-up with actions. It means taking big risks, knowing your priorities, but also living in freedom of choosing your own destiny. While Dom's arc here is learning to live with that freedom, by his own code of honour, and the consequences and all it entails, Brian's arc is about earning that respect and choosing how far he's willing to go to get it. It may not seem a lot, but I think it speaks a lot to their arcs throughout the entire series, especially when you see how awkward Brian is at the beginning, knowing he'll eventually become one of the coolest and most respected white dudes on the planet later.<br/><br/>Cars: Although originally envisioned as a movie about street racing, the film actually grinds to a halt when people stop to race. Director Rob Cohen is as bad at directing as he is at acting (As that Pizza Hut guy annoyed by street racers) and manages to make the races both boring, but also hideous to look at. He adds several horrible effects to each racing scene to convey speed and excitement, both CGI and otherwise, but it never feels, or looks right, and they also never sound right. Seriously, when people aren't talking, Cohen turns the film into some god-awful ""nu-metal"" or ""rapcore"" music video. All he needed was to add some crunk, and he would have completed a devil's threesome of best-forgotten 00s music genres. What is good however is how Cohen handles the heist, which the series would eventually realise is much more interesting than racing, which they prove here. Cars drive under trucks, people jump from cars to trucks, and people jump from trucks to cars. It's nothing the series wouldn't do better later, but it's still edge-of-your seat classic action, complete with a last minute save by our hero, Brian. As for the cars themselves, the only truly memorable one is Dom's classic Charger, which plays heavily into his back story.<br/><br/>Family: Again, this movie is strangely best when people are talking, and not racing. The film obviously establishes the code of honour and of respect, but it's also about family, which the series is ultimately about. I forgot that they go into Dom's back story here, and why family is so important to him as he establishes one in the absence of his father, while being welcoming to all who gravitate towards him. His code of family really drives the film, and his accepting of Brian builds both Brian's character of being a good man and saving Dom, but also Dom's appreciation of Brian not leaving him behind build's up Dom. Family doesn't leave each other behind, and they watch each other's back. The film tries to make us think Brian's desire to help Dom is Mia-based, but I think he just really wants to be apart of that family, and Ted Levine even says he has to make a choice about which family he wants to be apart of. He kind of chooses the police in this film, but his actions here come back where he finally makes his choice in Fast and Furious.<br/><br/>Overall, if you can get past the horrible direction and how dated the film is now, there's actually a lot to like here from the above and beyond character work, to the heist gone wrong. I never cared for this film when it came out, but looking back it has the early shine of the elements I love of this series. It's flawed, but I still like it. <br/><br/>RIP the great Paul walker"

Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is a cop working undercover to infiltrate his gang of suspected truck robberies. However he finds himself falling under Dominic's charisma and for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).<br/><br/>There is a lot of silly action, and unrealistic story lines. This is purely style winning over substance. The cars look cool and babes look hot. But it's the Vin Diesel presence and Paul Walker pretty boy looks that provide the heart of this movie.

I can not believe people are seeing this movie why would any one in there right mind go see this movie from the previews this movie looks good but that's because they don't show how badly the acting is in this movie. The plot with so many turn that is feels like your driving the car instead of watching them. I'm sorry but when the writer of this film wrote the script he had to have been half a sleep or thrown it together in two minutes because I could have wrote some thing better in my sleep. All this film is, is a plot that that gets dumber as it tries to play out, several good actors with very bad lines, nice looking cars and little boring love story that has no end. It's lame it's not fun to watch and I wish I had seen some thing else."
"shea-8","9","4","8","21 February 2002"," simplify things just a bit
","One word...FORMULA. This is Hollywood. Break it down and it is simply a western plot with cars races substituted for drawing guns, 18-wheelers for stagecoaches, and a whole lotta ""this town ain't big enough for the two of us"". Anyone expecting an original plot must be oblivious as to the state of American film. Accept it for what it is and be fortunate that it is lacking in pretensions. It is not titled, ""leisurely-paced, intellectually stimulating plot with rice burners"". It is FAST and it is FURIOUS, delivering what it promises.<br/><br/>The movie is founded in reality, whether the movie-speak comes across accurately or not; this culture exists across the US. Rent the DVD to read the article the script was conceived from and see more details about this particular group of people. The ability to take your mothers leftover civic and dump a few grand under the hood, resulting in power and freedom, unites many different races and cultural identities in the street racing world. Even within the one ?team? in this movie there are several different cultural groups identified including women, Latino, African-American, redneck, and WASP.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen has succeeded in creating a movie where the cars are given life. They are characters in the film along with the actors. And for those complaining of realism, a majority of the cars used in the movies are real cars raced by their owners who were extras in the movie, thus, one must conclude that this must be based in some sort of mechanical reality?But hey, that's just my take on it."

","Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.<br/><br/>The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.<br/><br/>The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment."

This film is 106 minutes long and the budget was 38,000,000 $.<br/><br/>The film is about a man named Dominic Toretto who organized illicit games with customed cars in the streets of Los Angeles with his team, they earn money by stealing illicit gasoline and an agent of the C.I.A. (Bryan O'Conner) who investigates these robberies and who tries to befriend this group.<br/><br/>Honetly, this film is short but the budget of this movie is cheap compared to the budget of Harry Potter and Fast and Furious is as good as Harry Potter.<br/><br/>This film is really action-packed and breath-taking.
The topic of the movie is thought-provoking because they speak of illegal race cars af is it was normal, it's very funny and cool but it's so dangerous.<br/><br/>The visual effects are extremely beatiful because it's real stunts and there aren't special effects because the explosions, the flames and the rest are real.<br/><br/>The sound designer is cool because the songs in this film are rap and rock and I love it.<br/><br/>It's the film I have seen the most (17 times)<br/><br/>And last but not least, the cars are very beautiful and customed, for the die-hard fans of cars, it's the film that you must see.

","Fast and Furious. The first one. This film came out a month before I was born, and I've only just watched now in 2018. Do I like it? Does it hold up? Let me explain.
Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today."

The part I like best about the film is that it has a great story line with a lot of action in the film. Paul walker in the film was not originally supposed to play the part of Brian but he did an amazing job at playing the part and he is now one of the most recognized actors from the franchise. Brian in this movie is an undercover cop who is trying to catch the group of people who have been robbing semi trucks and there are three suspects however Brian seems to think that Vin Diesel ( Dominic torreto) is not the leader of the group who is taking on the semi trucks until he learns towards the end of the movie.

","The Fast and The Furious 
 After watching every single Fast and Furious movie in the series thus far, I can say for sure that the very first original Fast and Furious movie is still the best. The story goes from undercover cop trying to find illegal street racers robbing trucks of millions of dollars in electronics to the undercover cop growing close to the racers and trying to help them get away from the cops.
 This movie is very fast paced and an in your face thrill. The stunts they do with the cars are incredible and keep you very engaged and waiting for what's to come. All of the characters in the film are easy to relate to and makes you wonder which character you would be if you were in the film. The best duo is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. In the beginning they are enemies hunting each other but by the end they are good friends helping each other out.
 Being a car guy myself, I have always loved car movies but this one just never goes away. I'm not sure if it's the action-packed scenes filled with police chases or the realistic street races that keep you on the edge of your seat. Although there are some insane car stunts in this film, the street races are very real and show how sometimes street racing goes good and sometimes it goes horribly wrong.
 The only thing about this film that I didn't like was some of the cars. Nearly all of the cars used were your typical European import cars. They could have branched out to some cars that many people don't see as often, and I would have been even more interested in the cars.
 There is truly something for everyone to enjoy in this movie even if you aren't a car person. There is thrills, action, love, hate, adrenaline, and a little bit of everything. I have watched this film with lots of different people and I have yet to hear any of them say they didn't like it because they can easily connect with one of the characters.
This movie got me hooked on horsepower at a very young age and still to this day whenever someone asks me what movie I want to watch, I always say The Fast and the Furious. Every time I watch this movie, my adrenaline starts pumping every time there is a racing scene and by the end I just want to go jump in car and race! 
All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I will never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like street racing and/or import cars."

All in all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I will never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend this film to anyone, especially if you like street racing and/or import cars."

","""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a great movie, but it delivers what it promises to deliver, and knows that a chase scene is supposed to be about something more than special effects. It has some of that grandiose self-pitying dialogue we've treasured in movies like this ever since ""Rebel Without a Cause."" ""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time,"" Toretto tells Brian. ""For those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And, hey, even for the next 30 seconds, he's decelerating."

","The first movie of the successful saga is probably the best one. We are introduced to the main characters and to a world most of us had only heard of. You will laugh, you might cry, you may even want vengeance... You won't leave the theater or your living room without feeling some kind of emotion.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to watch this in one of the best movie theaters in the country so I could enjoy the sound effects in all of their glory! However, as a petrolhead, I have to forget how many times they change gears (9 times? Really?!) to properly enjoy the movie about special cars and a large family (in the truest sense of how a family should be).<br/><br/>The cars are also loud actors who are given to the right characters. The actors really studied and embraced their role to a point where we can feel their emotions and identify ourselves with some of them. There is a real chemistry between them and that is a very positive thing in this type of movies.<br/><br/>10 out of ten to the best movie of one of the most successful sagas ever launched by Hollywood. Everyone who wants to properly enjoy it should start by watching this one."

","This is the one that started it all,is it more than just Point Break with cars?Let's find out.First,the good,the action,the race scenes are great,but there is also some good fist fights.The climax,it was intense and had some great stunts.The soundtrack,while it dates the film a bit,there's no denying it fits the tone perfectly.This may sound a bit stupid,but the editing was great,it had a fast pace that worked terrifically.I liked that there seemed to be little CGI involved,it seemed like there was a lot of practical stunts.The story,while it may not be the best it is well told.The best part,which sets this film apart from Point Break,is the characters,they feel real and are likable,even if most of them are criminals,the acting was good,even if some dialogue wasn't the best.Now,the bad,the pacing,while a movie like this doesn't need to be long,I feel like it went by a bit too fast.The ending,it was kind of dumb,but I did like how it completed Paul Walker's arc of the film.The villain,while he did have one good scene,he wasn't memorable at all.The script,due to the writing,the story's a bit hard to follow.Overall,The Fast and The Furious is a fun movie with great characters,but some bad scripting."

","The Fast and the Furious is one movie I wouldn't go out of my way to see. And yet I have to be fair. When it first came out I took one look at it, and said 'No way Jose. That's one movie I just know I'll hate.' A few years later we rented it, and horror of horrors I enjoyed it. As a 16 year old girl (which I was at the time) it certainly does not fit my profile of film watching (I watch Japanese movies/ horror/ war films) in any respect, and yet I found myself actually caring about the characters however slick and bland they were. And no I don't fancy Paul Walker or Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>Though it has a formulaic plot- cop infiltrates street racers, and learns its about friendship and respect, it made up for this with it's admittedly excellent chemistry between the stars, and the rather cool race scenes.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker turned in reasonable performances as the cop and gang leader, and Michelle Rodriguez was surprisingly watchable as Dominic Torreto's girlfriend.<br/><br/>However what made the film for me personally was the element of pure good fun going on between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. They weren't taking it seriously, there was no heavy philosophy, and if you plan to watch this movie you should just follow their lead, and take it as a mindless action movie with a good dose of fun."

","I saw this movie yesterday and quite enjoyed it. It is a film with a lot of action and high-speed driving (no surprise there). After seeing it I realized that I had seen it before. Actually the story is a little too much like Point Break, but with cars: Cop infiltrates a gang, falls in love with a girl in the gang, becomes surprised that the gang is actually the 'bad guys' he is looking for, chases the 'bad guys', lets the biggest bad guy free. Even so, the film is entertaining and is worth seeing, if only for the awesome car driving. It could be interesting to compare this movie with the sequel. I actually saw the sequel before and I think it is at least as good."

","The user comments by 36-year-old Theo Robertson of Isle of Bute, Scotland, are sort of valid, although he is very dismissive and critical of TFATF's plot and ""product placement.""  Like it's a bad thing.  Perhaps living on an island in Scotland does not equip one to understand or fairly ""criticise"" a southern Californian car-cult movie.  And he's 36, ""...too old to enjoy TFATF by about...oh, twenty years?""  I am 61 and I thought it was a fun movie.  In New Mexico, we know A LOT about custom cars, low-riders and high-riders, and we understand how (and WHY)one might put tens of thousands of dollars into creating a really boss machine.  Sure, TFATF is pure science fiction, the science being the cars and the fiction being the likelihood of scores of custom race car afficionados being able to commandeer a ""deserted"" street for a midnight race.  But yes, the car cult does cross race and ethnic lines, because it's all about the cars....  And so what if the film has a lot of ""product placement""?  Personally, I didn't even understand half of what the characters were talking about when it came to custom engine parts.  The movie does one thing very well:  it entertains.  Obviously. There's a very successful sequel out now.  Compared to other movies in its sub-genre, The Fast and The Furious deserves an 8 or 9."

","Real good movie ,in purpose that i´m a sucker for ""import-style"" cars. Not too good actors, but what the heck, you don´t look at XXX-movies because of the ""good"" storyline? One of the worst things about this movie is that they included Vin Diesel (Dominick Toretto) as a co-star. I don´t like that at all because he´s probably the worst actor since... Well i can´t even recall an even worse actor. Probably Vanilla Ice in that high school movie. I can´t even recall the title of it. Paul Walker isn´t that good either. But then again.

Allowing the average person a glimpse into an unknown, yet fascinating, world makes for excellent marketing. The more guns, drugs, and cops, the better.<br/><br/>Neil Moritz chose to not get picky with details. Well done. Rather, he saw the movie through the demographic's eye.

It did.<br/><br/>For the car-fanatics out there, myself included, there's a bakers dozen and a half of errors. Who cares? It was good fun if you took it lightly and checked your automotivelly superior attitude at the door. If not, you ended up like most of the posters. Caught up in arrogance.<br/><br/>As a whole, this was definitely not Oscar-worthy.

With the headbanger's music in the background, it's the perfect setting for the younger crowd of today.  The special effects in this film is all right, but not that spectacular.  Walker makes this role work, but the only thing I don't believe is that he doesn't have some kind of partner working a little closer.

And no, it did NOT make me want to go out and do 140+ MPH in my car after seeing the movie. There are good performances in this movie. This was the first time I'd seen Vin Diesel in a film, and I think this guy is going to be HUGE. Paul Walker isn't bad either, but Vin Diesel stole the show here. The cars were great too, plenty of nitrous-powered, fuel-injected insanity for gear heads (and wannabe gear heads) everywhere. The addition of that black Dodge Charger (!!) just made things that much sweeter. To tell you the truth, I had wanted to see this pretty much ever since it first came out but never had; it was a car-loving ex-girlfriend who finally convinced me to see it a couple years ago. I've since gotten the DVD myself, and intend to watch it again in the next few days.

However, as Brian is sucked in to the street racer world, he and Dominic become better friends. One thing Dominic does not know about Brian is that he is a cop. As war clashes between Dominic and his rival Johnny Tran, the cops start closing in on the street racers. The story is really stupid, but the great stunts and action make up for that.

"Jeremy Farrance","8","1","1","16 June 2002"," Not Since the Road Warrior...
","This movie was a trip.  I never expected to have such a wild ride and so much adrenalized fun.  The main reason I went to see this movie was Vin Diesel - who is not very well know - yet - but I am pretty sure he will be. He has an incredible voice (he was the robot in The Iron Giant, a highly recommended favorite of mine) and a charismatic presence that reminds me of a young Marlon Brando.  He also played Riddick in Pitch Black which I plan to review eventually.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie does not make my top 10 or anything close. The story is pretty generic, young-undercover-cop material with only a not-too surprising twist or two.  Some of the acting was a little strained and weak which can often tank a whole movie (for me).  But this movie did something to me that I haven't felt since the 2nd Mad Max film, The Road Warrior... it raised the bar on visual action and ""the need for speed"".  It wasn't cinematography either - to me (I am not an expert) - but something incredible happened in the way this movie was edited, filmed, and scored. It was just a thing of beauty.  The sounds, the motor, the pitch, the beat, and then being jacked inside the engine; to spit through the fuel injection, feel the power of combustion and then be ejected out the tail pipe as the car roars away from you... breathtaking... and all that is just the rush of the car lurching in to first gear on go.<br/><br/>I was expecting to recommend this movie just so you can get a handle on who Vin Diesel is and how great this guy is gonna be in movies in the coming years (in my humble opinion).  I didn't expect to O.D. on adrenaline and walk out of the theater ready to rev the engine right out of my poor little Mitsubishi Galant's frame.  I warn you - seriously - be careful driving home after watching this movie.  For me, doing 42 M.P.H. in a 35 on the way home felt like I was standing still.  It was painfully frustrating.  After being reasonably disappointed by Pearl Harbor and The Mummy Returns, this movie has restored my faith.<br/><br/>Normally I walk out of a movie feeling like I know when a director has made a great movie. I have to say I was confused when thinking about the director on this movie. I haven't even gone and looked up who it is - I usually do and try to keep the names and credits straight when I know a great director or at least one I recognize and/or like. But I guess that is what I am trying to say here; I did not get that feeling this time. I somehow - do not - feel like it was the director that delivered this incredible ride to me. Somewhere between the hyper-speed action, incredible music/sound, and the charisma of Vin Diesel I want to believe this movie hit its mark regardless of the director. Or maybe they knocked a damn good movie up two notches beyond what the director envisioned."

I like to consider myself and intelligent individual, so when I was reading comments I was surprised to see such things as "" if you have an IQ of over 80 stay away from this film"" and other comments like ""the film spent too much money on the cars and couldn't afford good actors"" (or something to that notion...).  I personally am the type of person that appreciates a good film with a good story line, great actors, and deep underlying concepts.. but give me a break.  Not every movie is made for that reason.  The reason I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious is quite simple... it has something for everyone... well, almost everyone, there are always the people who can find something wrong with it.  It has fast cars, actors people like to see on the screen along with some fresh faces, characters that people identify with, and an action packed storyline.  What more could you want?  Some say the dialogue wasn't so great... okay, what exactly would you say when you wanted the tuna fish sandwich?  The dialogue fit in with the situations they were in... you couldn't expect more.

","I went into ""The Fast and the Furious"" knowing the acting and the plot wasn't going to be oscar worthy. I went into this film just for the pure action of fast cars. I was totally happy with the results of this film. This film had some of the best car chase/racing sequences I've ever seen. I loved the chase scenes in ""Bullit"",""French Connection"" and my favorite of all time, ""Ronin"". ""Fast and the Furious"" matches up pretty well with those great car sequences. If you like cars at all, you should think about seeing ""The Fast and the Furious"". It's just a fun summer film. Peace"
"TOMATO KID","8","1","1","8 June 2001"," Point Break on wheels !!!
","This one was far better than Gone In 60 Seconds. At least you care for the characters. The plot is pretty much the same as the one in Point Break (undercover cop becomes friends with the ones he has to bust) but what makes it so fun is Rob Cohen's direction and the action sequences. The whole racing scenes are well worth the price of admission. You feel danger and excitement on every action-packed part of this movie. Vin Diesel looks cool and strong. Go and see it if you're into car racing. it's take the bad taste 60 seconds left in your mouth."
"simont9","Null","1","1","24 June 2001"," If you want Racing, it doesn't get any better than this!
","I went to see the movie on the first day, with much, much anticipation. I walked in 15 minutes prior to start of the flick, and I could not find 2 seats together since I went with my brother. After 5 minutes of going through the theatre and sitting down, public relations announced that our show is sold out. What I came to realize, is that night that wasn't the only one. EVERY SINGLE SHOW FOR THE 3 DAY WEEKEND WAS SOLD OUT. Doesn't that tell you something? This will be the sleeper hit of this summer.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a mix of adrenaline rushes, compelling racing story, and the overall ""good"" bad guy lead. Vin Diesel rocks as Dominic Toretto, the man of racing in L.A. I've seen everything Diesel has ever done, and every time he exceeded my expectations. Paul Walker is Brian O'Connor, the undercover cop trying to crack a truck-jacking case. I've seen Paul in a couple of flicks, and even though he's no great actor, I don't think I could imagine anyone else who could do it. These two and the rest of the cast are half of what makes this movie. The other half, is the cars, and the driving, which is downright terrific, Gone in 60 doesn't stand a chance. Overall, the movie made me jump in my seat,  speed up my heart beat, and I have to admit, cry. I came out of the show in complete awe, not for the acting, or the story, but for the overall content. I saw it all three weekend days, and must say, it only got better.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of driving, cars, and great young actors, this is definitely a movie for you and I highly recommend it. Do not listen to all these big time critics like Ebert & Roeper. These guys aren't us, and can't tell us what we like. So finish reading this, get into your car, pick up your friends, and go see The Fast and the Furious. You won't regret it!!!"
"chase_pc","8","1","1","24 June 2001"," Great movie, but...
","I went in wanting to see this movie, and it delivered on everything I had hoped for.  It did have a reasonable plot, and what it was lacking for in plot it made up for in character development.  It had style and great actions scenes.  The story never got boring, and I stayed interested until the end.  I am sure that eveyone leaving the theater with me wanted to burn rubber as they drove home. (The difference being, I can, in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd!) What is lacking in this movie is any intelligent explanation of the science behind the speed.  Throughout the movie we learn 2 things.  1, nitrous makes a car go faster, and 2, you have to press the button at the right time.  I dont think I ever heard anyone in this movie mention the size of the engine for any of the cars raced.  Diesel, who again does a great job - contrary to those who assume big muscles mean no brains and automatically pan him - does give a top to bottom on his father's car, but it is never raced.  I guess we have to assume these are basically japanese compact cars that are painted nicely and mod'd out to the max, and that's the only reason they come close to matching the speed and power of classic street-rods. Still, I really would have liked there to have been more explanations of why Car A is faster than Car B, and known why Car B's driver needs to use his wits to win. Of course, the writers must have known, it doesnt really matter."

If you are after a film that will make you think while providing you with a new and interesting look at the world, then this is not the film for you. If you want a film that you can just sit down a watch for alittle bit of fun then I say this is it. Because lets face we've seen the plot a thousand times before and it's still as predictable as ever, but the film doesn't pretend to have a twister of a plot it's very clear that cars are it's focal point. It's like every other film, if you walk in with certain expectations that aren't met then you'll be let down.

","This was a compelling movie with interesting characters that suffered from a lame script.  It was fragmented and full of cliches both in dialogue and scenes---sort of a composite of trite subplots.  However, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriquez provided some spark.  Brewster is too beautiful and had some pretty sappy lines, but she was fun to look at. The cars and race scenes were cool.  The plot could have been good except for the stupid denouement which once again had some good action scenes based on lame ideas."

(Which i found out on the DVD that many of the lines were). it raises itself just above the typical ""Teen"" movie but still keeps true to that youthful genre.

","I must confess to actually reather enjoying the film; whilst there was little in the way of plot, the actors are no better or worse than the majority of the Hollywood lot these days. The cars were awesome (as the owner of a MKIII Supra I enjoyed that aspect) and the sound and ethos was very immersive, but there wasn't a huge amount of intelligent dialogue. The actors weren't bad - the characters just weren't overly deep.<br/><br/>That said, ask yourself why you watched the film. Was it for the undercover cop story, admittedly done a thousand times? Or was it to see THOSE CARS move? I think that that last, as the films focus, was done incredibly well, and the actors did a good job of being the varied and individual if somewhat cliched drivers, which is essentially what they were there for. I liked the story, but then I tend to like almost all stories, I'm very open minded.<br/><br/>This leaves me to say one thing...I'm not THAT much of a car person, but after seeing this...I WANT MY CAR TO DO THAT!"
"bix171","8","1","1","20 March 2002"," Stylish
","Nothing wrong here. Rob Cohen's hyperdriven paean to illegal street racing is one of the more stylish films in recent memory and he gets some pretty good little performances from his actors, especially star-in-ascent Vin Diesel. Cohen is working as his title suggests but he also adds a bold use of color, flashy but not ostentatious editing and a sophisticated hip-hop soundtrack as a perfect compliment. As plots go, it's standard fifties fare, cribbing elements of `Rebel Without A Cause', but with everyone involved trying to create a technically superior experience, who cares?"

I'm sure many will agree though, anything it lost in predictability it made up with sheer horse-power and speed. The cinematography techniques used in this movie to enhance the viewers experience with the speed were excellently designed and implemented. I was especially glad to see a movie about fast cars and racing that didn't break down into some romance or deep-felt-drama.

I did get the DVD, though, and am glad I did. Maybe my low expectations helped me to enjoy it-- I admit that I was pleasantly surprised. There are two heros-- the blond guy, and Vin Deisel. The blond guy was an annoying weasel and wuss for the first three fourths of the flick, and then I began to like him. The other hero is played by Deisel, an amazing actor. I'd seen him in ""Saving private Ryan,"" but nothing else. This dood' screen presence is magnetic. He's got charisma as well as depth. My guess is we'll see Deisel become a solid and major star--- that is, if he chooses his roles and career moves rightly."

To me it sits in the same class as films such as ""Gone in 60 seconds"", ""Days of Thunder"" et al. The story isn't the most important aspect. It's a thrill ride, an experience where the atmosphere and lifestyle captured in the movie is the important thing. This is achieved by the overall look of the film.

I found myself liking these characters,particularly the girls.  Both Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriquez did a fine job as very strong young women,each in her own way.  Vin Diesel was likeable as a character that was reminiscent of a Hollywood version of Jesse James or Robin Hood.  Paul Walker did well in his portrayal of the young undercover cop,who is torn between love and duty. I also found Chad Lindberg's portrayal of Jesse,the young genius whose potential is never fully realized,to be touching.  Certainly,having the talented Ted Levine aboard,as the voice of reason,lent an air of credibility to the whole proceedings. This man always shines,even in the smallest roles.<br/><br/>Some of the plot was disturbing,such as the treatment of truck drivers,but it was apparent that the world of modern day street racing was well researched,by writers and actors alike.  The terminology was up to the minute and if all else fails,just holler,""NOS!""  There were definitely times that one had to suspend disbelief,but all in all,I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes cars,a flashy soundtrack and a fast-paced movie! Pure fun,all the way."
"ironmacd","8","1","1","23 June 2001"," The Fast and the Furious was so good, I felt the need to register and share my views of the movie, thats how good it is
","Don't let anyone fool you, the Fast and the Furious is a wonderfully entertaining movie. If you saw the trailer and though that it looked like a fun roller coaster ride styled action movie then you are absolutely correct. The best summation you could give of the film is that its like two hours of what you see in the trailer. It's seriously one of the most accurately advertised and needless to say one of the most fun and entertaining movies of the year.<br/><br/>The racing scenes have been cleverly filmed and edited together in a way that gives you a false sense of motion with lots of first person views as cars race down the street. In addition, just about every scene in the movie looks really sharp thanks to nice lighting, some visual effects, and just plain good camera work. The direction of camera work for the most part is very traditional in the sense that each major scene is proceeded by a few seconds of a `set up' shot that gives you a feeling for the size and surroundings of a scene locale. The majority of the dialogue shots and racing shots are of course third person, however, many of these shots are extremely tight giving you a very strong sense of being there.<br/><br/>
Vin Diesel's performance is convincing and very entertaining. He's extremely enigmatic and seems to have that quality that some actors like Bruce Willis have. That quality of coming off as being an extremely cool person who you just know you'd be best friends with. Paul Walker's performance while somewhat wooden, really isn't bad at all. In fact if you really stopped and thought about his character's motivation Paul's on screen apprehension and uncertainty early in the film actually fits his character. Stack that up against his wide eyed and completely commanding on screen presence toward the end of the film and you've got the complete emotional stages of his character that realistically depicts a man in his situation. The rest of the main cast really deserves a lot of credit too. Sure they might not be a lot well known actors, but I'd have to imagine that a few of them will be after a few casting agents see this movie since there really isn't a bad performance in the movie.<br/><br/>The writing and dialogue is fairly decent. Sure it isn't the most original story ever, but it does a great job of delivering a plot through the use of a lot of action. The dialogue while a bit awkward a couple of times is for the most part well done.<br/><br/>In the end, you won't be disappointed in The Fast and the Furious if you like action movies, cars, or Vin Diesel. The story is decent, the sound and visuals are fantastic, and you'll walk out of the theater with a big smile and the undying urge to drive really reckless while listening to loud music. The PG-13 rating is a very liberal one by the way, people shoot and are shot by guns on screen, some language, some slight skin, but since the movie moves so fast and is so loud, you really think you hear and see more than you actually do. Great movie!"

"zetes","7","1","1","4 January 2002"," A lot of fun (SLIGHT SPOILERS)
","The Fast and the Furious is not a great movie by any means, but it is very entertaining. It's definitely a turn-your-brain-off-for-two-hours flick, a nice popcorn flick. The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing. No real surprises here. The acting is quite good. I'm putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. Michelle Rodriguez, who was just amazing in last year's Girlfight (she is why I saw this film), is extremely sexy in it. Oh yeah, she gives a good performance, too. I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie. The other performers are all relatively good. There aren't any weak spots. The action, which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious, is very good. Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes, even in slow motion, for cars that go 150+ MPH, to travel a quarter of a mile, it doesn't hurt the flick too much. I generally don't like car chase movies. The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions. I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences. 7/10."

"nivek_nailgun","7","1","1","28 November 2001"," good...but we've seen it already
","I really thought I'd hate this movie but it wasn't at all bad. In fact, I really enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I was going to. Exciting racing,nice cars and not a bad story...buuuuuuut; it's already been done. The story is so close to Point Break that the writers HAD to have noticed it. Point Break is the better of the two,but I still recommend this one. Now for the other bad stuff....(I'd put this under the goofs section,but it's not available yet). 1- The first streetrace we see lasts far longer than a quarter mile race does,which is NEVER over 20 seconds (unless your car is really really slow or broken). Well,this first race was (roughly) 2 minutes in duration. I know it makes for better action,but it's unreasonable all the same. 2- I don't care how powerful your car is. In the final scene of the movie,Dom does a wheelstand WITHOUT doing a burnout (heats the tires for traction) this is impossible (although great eye candy,the car would do nothing but sit there and spin) and 3- Final scene again. Dom's car apparantly was a 9 second vehicle vs the 10 second import and the race ended neck and neck. There is no way they would end that close if the cars truly ran what they said they did. A full second in a race is a huge gap. If there were a couple of tenths difference,that would be different..but a FULL second? That being said....it was a pretty good movie anyway. 7/10"
"Benny T","7","1","1","26 November 2001"," The name says all
","A few months ago this film burst onto U.S. screens with little or no build up, and became a huge success.<br/><br/>With a virtually unknown cast and competition from movies such as Dr Dolittle 2, it made a large impact on the box office, reaching number one.<br/><br/> As for the product itself, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality. The movie opens with a spectacular truck hijacking by a group of black high performance cars. The plot then follows the story of Brian, played by little-known Paul Walker, a young car parts salesman who is trying to ingratiate himself into a group of revheads in L.A. After initial resistance, he becomes the protege of their leader Dom, played by Vin Diesel, a minor celebrity actor whose biggest roles were in Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/> The big letdown is the close similarity between the story and the movie Point Break, except the activity of surfing is replaced by street racing. Paul Walker is certainly no Keanu Reeves, but he doesn't have to be - the cars are the real items of interest in this movie.<br/><br/>It happens that Brian is actually an undercover cop, intent on finding the hijackers. He must first prove himself to be a legitimately talented racer as his cover identity. Naturally there's the obligatory love interest for Brian provided by Dom's little sister.<br/><br/>The stunts are extremely well staged, almost to the point of believing that they must be computer generated pictures.<br/><br/>The races and car chases are totally exhilarating, such that you don't have time to pick holes in the plot or worry about the quality (or lack of) the acting or script.<br/><br/> The soundtrack is completely occupied by either cars revving or full force rap/techno music - under no circumstances see this movie with a pre-existing headache - it will be 50 times worse afterwards! That said, I think the sound is wholly appropriate to this film.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay until after the closing credits, because it's one of those movies where there's something more for the viewer.<br/><br/> Sit back, relax, and enjoy the spectacle."

A lot of comments that I'd heard about the movie thought that the little mottos of the movie were pathetic (things like ""I live my life a quater mile at a time"" and ""It don't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning"") If they were delivered by an actor with less screen prescence than Vin Diesel, they might have sounded corny, but as a part of the overall movie, they made sense and added to the character of Dom Toretto.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7/10.

This really is an excellent film about street racers. Incredible racing scenes, an involving plot, but best of all, more gorgeous cars than you can shake a Civic at.  You probably do need some knowledge of cars before you go see this movie, to get the full effect. 9/10 on my scale."

","In the Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze movie 'Point Break', A young cop goes undercover as the member of a team in order to root out some crims and things escalate when they move on the wrong gang and start to realise that the offenders are closer to home than realised. It comes down to a choice between loyalty to his cause or to his friendship. In this flashy, loud and heavy petrol head flick it is no different, infact there are more similarities between them than just in the basics. It is a step by step re-hash. If there was to be between them a re-watch choice it would be this one over and over again though. It is gripping, with solid performances and a unique and impressive look. This movie is easily the best car flick yet.<br/><br/>A veteran of Pitch Black, Vin Deisel I would say is headed for action stardom. He's a similar character in both but it doesn't matter. Pitch black is an under-rated gem and this by legitimate critics reviews is a worthily rated gem. I think they deserve Sound Design and Cinematography oscar nominations for it, the Limp Bizkit overtures are the only thing really that could do them out of it, they have the worst rep on the globe which is why they are so successfull, the oldies who vote for the academy would hate that. Don't go past this one for the best teen flick this year and one of the best in years.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

I couldn't help but admire this anti-hero and the honourable loyalty portrayed by his tight nit group of desperados.<br/><br/>Okay so there's very little in the way of 'message' or 'social comment' but that ain't what this movie is about. It's not even attempting to pamper your intellect. It's only intent is to get your adrenaline flowing and to stop you breathing which it succeeds at admirably.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie, hold on to your seat, hit that NOS button and don't close your eyes until the final, white knuckle ride which will leave you breathless and stunned.<br/><br/>Just don't forget that it's only a movie and drive home carefully.

The storyline, although predictable, was not too bad, and followed the typical ""undercover cop makes buddies with the bad guy, then has to give him up"" style of movie, but i still found it enjoyable.<br/><br/>I think in the end, you will have to go see it for yourself to really make up your mind."
"biggschnutz","Null","1","1","21 September 2001"," Pure adrenaline rush!
","Only one word describes this action flick starring Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Amazing! I'll be the first to admit, I wasn't exactly excited about cars and the things they can do, but now, after seeing this movie, it gets me pumped up to go do the exact same thing with my friends.<br/><br/>The movie did have its downfalls. Such as the crappy dialogue. Okay, so there were more than it's fair share of stupid comments made. But one of the most popular movies in the past five years was exactly the same, The Matrix. I swear if I heard ""he is the one"" one more time, I was gonna put my foot through the damn VCR!<br/><br/>Point is, people don't go to see movies for the acting. Leave that to the classy, Oscar winning pictures starring Gwyenth Paltrow and Ben Affleck. Did anyone rent or go to Barb Wire to see Pamela's acting ability? No, they saw it because she's one of the hottest women alive! I don't know about anyone else, but I can't see Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington in Vin Diesel and Paul Walker's shoes. It just doesn't work! What should be different about this movie?<br/><br/>No matter what town or city you're in, you will see cars similar to the cars in this movie, and that's exactly why it's so popular. Who cares if you hate Hondas, Acuras, Toyotas, Mazdas or Nissans. There is no denying that they are the best made automobiles ever made.<br/><br/>According to a lot of people in big cities, The Fast and the Furious wasn't exactly the most accurate portrayal of street racing in America, but it gave everyone a new prospective on street racing. In the car culture we live in, a movie like this needs to come out in order to shine light onto the subject. So what if there is cheesy dialogue, it wasn't written to win Oscars, it was written so they could put the nicest custom cars in the country on the big screen for people to enjoy.<br/><br/>I give The Fast and the Furious 8 stars out of 10, because, much like myself, it gives people around the country and around the world a hobby to enjoy and to call their own. The movie showed the world what intense means. And if we lose good acting and a pleasable script in the process, who really cares. As long as the desired effect was achieved."

But I am human and I have to love films like this. I might love higher quality films. But I do love big action films and rediculous plots. But the difference is I don't go into a movie like this looking for it to be a classic. I expect stupid dialoque, bad acting, and so on. And that is what I got. AND I LOVED IT. That is the main problem with the major movie critics. They don't see it as a fun, stupid film. I do.<br/><br/>      One actor that has had my eye for about a year now is Vin Diesel. He has yet to be bad in anything I've seen him in. Plus, as soon as I saw ""Pitch Black"", I new he was not only the biggest bad ass in movies in the past decade. But he really can act. And I respect him for that.<br/><br/>      I can't say the same for Paul Walker. He has always sucked. But I wish that Michelle Rodriquez wasn't in this movie. She just seemed like she was a new version of her ""Girlfight"" character. Her main point in the movie was to look cool and make an angry face at the guys. But I did like Jordana Brewster. I think, with the right material, she could be a great actor.<br/><br/>      For anyone who saw ""Point Break"", this film is basically the same plot. Just change surfing into street racing and there you go. But I must say. I like this film a lot more than I liked ""Point Break"". Mainly because I have a personal grudge against Keanu Reeves (minus ""The Matrix""). And, Paul Walker may suck, but he's better than freakin' Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>      The action sequences in the film are all top notch. The first heist scene is very cool. And the last one in the desert was my favorite. Of all the car films lately (""Driven"", ""Gone in 60 Seconds""), this one is definatly the best of them all.<br/><br/>      I will no doubt go see it again.

"jon.h.ochiai","8","1","1","25 June 2001"," Speed Rush
","Rob Cohen's ""Fast and Furious"" is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.<br/><br/>Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and ""Fast and Furious"" does this with style and without significance. That is a good thing..."

","You know, I've been noticing a trend.  These past few summers, at least one action flick stands above the rest.  ""The Matrix"" for 1999 and ""X-Men"" for 2000.  After seeing this, without a doubt, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is THE best action film of Summer 2001!<br/><br/>I began my weeklong vacation in New York just before the weekend this movie was released.  I was lucky enough to catch one of the first showings with a bunch of my cousins from all over the country.  We were having a family reunion that weekend and we agreed that ""F&F"" was the film we needed to see as part of our celebration of togetherness.  And in light of the fact that we were all guys (not to say that girls won't enjoy this film), we all knew we were in for a real treat because the movie deals with one subject of fascination to many young males: street racing.<br/><br/>The opening highspeed carjacking sequence showed us that everything from then on would be pure hype and adrenaline.  It didn't seem to me that this film has a solid plot, save for the storyline of actor Paul Walker's character and his mission to probe and catch the carjackers from the opening scene.  But that hardly matters if you came to see this movie for pure popcorn entertainment.  If you worship cars and love beautiful babes, then you'll love ""F&F""!<br/><br/>Through intense and often exhilarating speeding visuals, director Rob Cohen does a great job in giving the audience a first-hand experience of what it is like to actually sit behind the wheel, turn on the engine, and literally go VROOOMMMMM!!!!!<br/><br/>The actors perform pretty well with their tough but enjoyable attitudes. Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez are perfect and sexy as the girlfriends of Walker and Vin Diesel, respectively.  Diesel has such a formidable and commanding onscreen presence, and I'm sure that the box office success of ""F&F"" will only further catapult him to Hollywood superstar status.  And rapper Ja Rule has a short but memorable cameo appearance as a contestant in the film's first superhype drag race sequence.<br/><br/>
For its amazing street racing and the coolest cars on the planet that I've ever seen, I vote for ""F&F"" to be the must-see action flick of 2001.  To those other so-called ""racer"" films like ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" I've only got this to say: EAT YOUR HEART OUT!"
"KerryW","Null","1","1","6 September 2001"," FINALLY!! A film that lives up to it's title
","Film fans may have been disappointed last summer after Snatch, Shaft and X-Men were all released, yet failed to live up to their respective titles (c'mon, think about it). This year however, we finally have a film whose title we can rely on, for director Rob Cohen has served us up something both fast and furious.<br/><br/>Brian Spilner (Walker) is an undercover cop assigned to infiltrate a street racing gang suspected of highway robberies to help pay for their expensive parts. Despite losing an invigorating race against the gang's head leader Dom Toretto (Diesel), Brian earns his respect by saving him from the police.<br/><br/>Under pressure to close the case, Brian gets drawn further into the underground world as he falls for Dom's sister, leaving him facing a choice between his new lifestyle or his job.<br/><br/>Based loosely around a magazine article about late night Japanese racing gangs, F+F explodes onto our screens with a ferocious race scene within the first 15 minutes. The awesome filming style of Cohen leaves us on the edge of our seats as the sheer pace of the cars scream past the camera. Cohen's hook is just the beginning however, as the entire movie is dominated by souped up cars that make Gran Turismo look like go-karts.<br/><br/>Star of the show however is the gravel-voiced Vin Diesel as Dom. Here is one screen tough guy that you know has the brawn to back his words. When he tells Brian that if he breaks his sister's heart, then he'll break his neck, there's little doubt over whether he means it. Diesel's terrific performance comes off the back of last year's success in Pitch Black and it seems Hollywood has finally found a new hard man.<br/><br/>The plot is slightly thin on the ground, but that is more than made up for by Cohen's work behind the camera and Diesel's in front of it. The hundred minutes are choc full  of nutty stunts, gorgeous girls, fast cars and cool lines  if ever there was an antichrist of chick-flicks then this is it.<br/><br/>After a summer of big budget flops and box office disasters, F+F took just a weekend to make back it's costs in America. The race scene should be worth your money alone, but if that's not enough, then the chance to see Vin Diesel, a star in the making, should be: and for once you won't be disappointed by the title.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I will have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  It was action all the way.  I loved the chase scenes (and the Paul Walker scenes).  This is the first movie that I have really noticed Paul.  He is really good and so is Vin Diesel.  It was one of the fastest action movies I have seen this year. Much better than 60 Seconds. Great Movie!"

","Reading some of the reviews posted on the site, it seems some people were expecting too much from this movie. I went to see this expecting good race and action scenes and not much else, and it delivered. I didn't go in expecting Academy Award material, and anyone who saw the previews should've done the same. I thought some of the acting left something to be desired, but it was adequate for the movie. The action sequences were definitely the highlight of the movie, especially the street racing scenes. I didn't mind the plot holes or the paint-by-numbers romance side plot, I wanted action and I got it. I liked it so much I saw it again a few days later. Lighten up and take this movie for what it is."

This movie was made for one reason alone - pure eye candy.  I didn't care about the plot holes and unrealistic action sequences, etc.  I, like most other people, went to see some cool cars and races.  Others might go to see some good-looking young actors (Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, etc.).  What kind of moron expects a plot or fine acting from this type of movie?  It's a movie.

Even though I am a HUGE Paul Walker fan, I think Vin Diesel's character (Dom) was the most well-rounded & deep.

"SPYMAN2001","Null","1","1","28 July 2001"," Fast Cars + Fast Women + Hot Music = Hit Summer Movie
","""The Fast and the Furious"" follows the time-honoured and time-worn formula in order to produce a film feature that will be swallowed whole by the 18-25 year-old set.  The director, Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story) did not intend to bring to the screen his vision of a moral tale.  There is no deep thought required to digest this morsel of celluloid.  It can be compared to a 15-second amusement park ride that thrills the audience for the time occupied, but leaves them empty after the ride is over.  In short, this is a good summer movie that will never see the light of the prestigious film awards.<br/><br/>The plot involves an undercover police officer who must insert himself into a street-racing ""team"" in order to shut down the truck hijacking that is frequently happening on the Los Angeles freeway system.<br/><br/>The cars are the products of youth that are totally enamoured with the automobile, from supped-up Honda Civics to Toyota Supras enhanced with nitrous oxide.  These vehicles are a young man's dream.<br/><br/>The women of the story are Michelle Rodriguez (Girl Fight) and Jordana Brewster (The Faculty).  These two ""girls"" portray the sweet, young, exotic playmates of the male leads in the movie.  There is no time to develop their characters and their presence in the movie is generally wasted.  The male leads are Vin Diesel (Pitch Black) and pretty boy, Paul Walker (The Skulls and Varsity Blues).  Diesel, he of the mysterious ethnic origin shows promise as an up-and-coming thespian.  However, Walker provides a performance that can easily be forgotten or be replaced.<br/><br/>
Finally, the music is the best part of the movie.  It is a superb sampling of the latest popular music, with DMX to Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit.  This creative aspect is the most solid part of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  It moves the scenes along in the movie and transforms it into one long music video.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""The Fast and the Furious"" has been churned out by Harvard graduate, Rob Cohen as a very watchable action movie.  He is developing a good reputation as a competent director of the action genre of films.  My suggestion, see the movie in the theatres, but buy the movie soundtrack instead of the VCR/DVD when it is released in a few months."
"ILovePaulWalker","Null","1","1","26 July 2001"," Good movie
","Great actors, great cars, bad plot. The movie leaves you hanging in the end. But the cars were awesome.. I love that orange supra. The movie is good and gives you an adrenaline rush with its fast cars, Racing, and very well done stunts. But I think the producer ran out of time to get all that he wanted to get involved in this movie. A lot of the main characters were shady. It will leave you guessing in the end."

","I can't really say how much I liked this movie.  The action was great. Every race scene was amazing...especially the first one you see, since you don't know what to expect.  The acting was pretty good, too.  I didn't expect great acting, but I was a little surprised.  Acting didn't compare to the cars, though.  If you like cars, then you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>My friend and I watched this movie stoned.  Since he was driving, let's just say it was a very high-speed ride into town after we left.  That totally ruled, too."
"ruby_fff","7","1","1","21 July 2001"," Stay 'til the very end, after the credits roll, for the conclusive ending
","I wouldn't call this 'trashy' goods. It's a perfectly good Hollywood script. Besides the car 'dueling' action sequences, it includes energy of the younger set (20 something's), the eagerness to experience risks, and the plight to feel the spirit of freedom - even if it's a matter of moments. Death is not an ominous worry to them. They live for the moment.<br/><br/>
Paul Walker is in the lead role of Brian, the undercover LA cop. He has worked with director Rob Cohen before in ""The Skulls"" 2000. Rob Cohen directed the ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" 1993 with Jason Scott Lee and Lauren Holly. Also ""Dragonheart"" 1993, a fable of a legend with Sean Connery doing voice of the Dragon which Dennis Quaid gallantly duels with. Cohen's movies may be Hollywood, yet they tend to have a backbone ethical/living outlook that prompts the integrity of the central character(s).<br/><br/>
Vin Diesel is Dominic, the rebellious one here - can past as James Dean, the leader whom the gang looks up to. He stood out in ""Boiler Room"" 2000, opposite Giovanni Ribisi, and was the only good thing in ""Pitch Black"" 2000, the sci-fi flick which he was the lead opposite Radha Mitchell (from ""High Art"" 1998 opposite Ally Sheedy.)<br/><br/>Jordana Brewster was last seen as the furiously grieving sister of Cameron Diaz in ""The Invisible Circus"" playing opposite Christopher Eccleston (who's in ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" another fast cars and chase flick). Brewster is Dominic's feisty sister Mia, furiously sulky here besides having a chance to be fast (driving, matching up to the testosterone bunch.) Michelle Rodriguez is Dominic's woman, full of anger within, charged with a devil may care defiance. The role of Johnny by Rick Yune has a flavor of Giovanni Ribisi's energy as in ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" But Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" is comparably more substantial and colorful in storyline and character development, even comes with a 'dream' quote for the fast and the furious: ""I live my life quarter of a mile per second at a timenothing else mattersin those 10 seconds, I'm free."" And the backbone that held together the friendship between Walker and Diesel's characters is soundly strong.<br/><br/>
Be sure to stay on to the very end of the movie - after all the credits roll, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker you'll see, and you get to hear Dominic's quote once again (besides receiving a satisfying closure to the story.)"

Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are excellent in this film and it is well worth any price to see it.

","There are already a lot of comments here, so I'll keep it short, but everyone either says it sucks or it was good when you don't worry about the plot.  I went to see ""The Fast and the Furious"" with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  It was a magnificent movie with unquestionably fantastic special effects and stunning realism.  True if you are an actual street racer, you may see a few flaws in the realism (as happens with any movie about any non-publicized culture), but for the rest of us, it is a much needed improvement on movies like ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" (I still hate that part where Nick Cage outruns the helicopter).<br/><br/>There is truth to the statement that this movie is very similar to ""Point Break"", though I did not notice it until it was pointed out in this site. It still has great acting and great action, not to mention a cohesive plot. I challenge those who disliked this movie to find a better action movie released this year. This is one of my new favorite movies."

Not the line through the movie but some of the things that happen in it. Feels like the script writer took some help from that movie! But came up with a better movie!!"
"Blackace","8","1","1","13 July 2001"," The Title Says It All
","I won't go into a long drawn out review of this film. The Fast and the Furious is just what it means. You have extremely fast sporty cars racing furiously down public streets. The plot is pretty irrelevant, but if you must know, think of this as Point Break on wheels instead of on a surf board and you'll know what I mean. Paul Walker does an admirable job in this flick, but doesn't really sell his character as an undercover cop. True..no one would ever believe he's a real cop, but even when he's acting like a cop, it's not convincing. Vin Diesel does a great job as Dominic Toretto. His deep voice and statured physic fits him perfectly for this role. This guy could be the next Arnold S. with the right script. He was sensational in Pitch Black, and just as good in The Iron Giant (voice of Iron Giant). This guy is going to go far.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it was what I expected. Lots of fast cars, crazy chases, sexy women, and timely stunts. The plot is forgettable, but the action will be remembered. If your looking for a drama induced flick with incredible acting and a nail biting plot, you'll have to look elsewhere. But if you want fast cars, fast women and incredible chase scenes, this is the movie for you."

I knew the plot, but the people who edit this movie cut out so many wonderful parts and takes that the movie was more liked rated G (no sex just a bunch of drama). One comment, PAUL WALKER looks good!! Really good!!!! He was the part that made me came to see this film!! My friends were screaming and yelling, ""He's so hot"" during the movie!! I couldn't stopped them from disrupting the others who were there. The cars were phat! What I don't liked about it was how it portray the Asian people. We're not liked that!! WE're not slutty, pervert, nor  evil (well, most of us aren't). That was the only part I was offended by. The way they made the Asian people dress was so entirely gross. I mean I can't even think they think we're liked that!! Anyways, the movie went by so fast, I didn't even see Paul Walker get any ""action"" with Jordana Brewster. It was a shame that the writers didn't really get into the ""Brian Mia's relationship"" because I thought that that was an interesting ""part"" to know. Well, anyway, the movie was awesome, the cars were da bomb, and it has incredible special effect. For those that didn't saw it, go see it for the action, cars, or my personal favorite, Paul Walker.

"Keyser Soze-12","7","1","1","7 July 2001"," A good, fun movie, but nothing more
","I am not a car person.  I try to be, but I'm sadly am not.  All of my friends are (or at least most of them) but it's something I never fell into as a kid.  Movies are my thing, not cars.  So, here I am, review The Fast and the Furious, and guess what? I loved it.<br/><br/>I love a good car chase.  Nothing in this world can impress me more than a good car chase.  To this day, RONIN still has the best chases (with maybe the Blues Brothers coming in second), but The Fast and the Furious makes a valiant effort.  Okay, TFATF has a plot recycled from Point Break (which is justt slightly a better movie).  Sure, the car chases will inspire teens to drive like stampeding cows.  But, this is the best dumb movie of the summer.<br/><br/>Tomb Raider was stupid beyond belief.  Pearl Harbor was like a dumb blond, she looks good but we all no there is no brain in her head.  The Mummy Returns was just one long action sequence with bad special effects. Swordfish tried to be smart (and was, for the most part).  But the Fast and the furious knows that it isn't the smartest girl at the ball, and it admits it.  This movie is about cars, babes, and, ummm, more cars.<br/><br/>Yea, all of the cars are rice burning Hondas or Mitshubishis.  There is ONE Volkswagon though...<br/><br/>So, it's not too bright, but it's fun.  If you liked Point Break, you'll like this.<br/><br/>7/10"

While the performances and the story wasn't riviting, it was fun and entertaining. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker turn in admirable performances, along with the rest of the supporting cast. Set in the underground racing scene in California, The Fast and The Furious picks you up at the begining and never lets up until the end, keeping you involved in the story until the final scene. Many surpries keep you guessing as to the outcome, and the ending is perfect for the movie. Overall, its a bit clique, but very entertaining and an enjoyable ride."

This tells the story of an undercover cop who has to infiltrate a group of illegal street racers who also may be involved in a highjacking ring. But things get complicated when he develops a close friendship with the leader and falls in love with his sister. I loved every minute of this movie, even Ja Rule's cameo.

The story has been done before (think Point Break with drag racing instead of surfing and there you go), but its done well for what it attempts to accomplish: fast and furious fun! No other movie has ever given me such an urge to jump into my car and put the pedal to the medal...unfortunately, I drive nothing like the cars in the movie, so I don't go anywhere when I floor it.  But let me tell you, the cars in this movie are smoking!  The action is fast paced and explosive, and the story built around it may not be Oscar caliber, but it sure is entertaining.  I would see this movie again anytime, even for the rush of the racing scenes alone. But even as a total package, the movie does one thing perfectly that few movies lately have accomplished: keeps me entertained from start to finish."

If you haven't developed a love for his acting you will, he hasn't been in much but he has captured notice of even Speilberg. Flics: pitch black (decent sci-fi), broiler room (good illegal trading movie) and few others.  Most of the other acting in the movie is first rate which allows you to stay focused throughout.

"sunface","7","1","1","3 July 2001"," It hit the spot.
","In contrast to Driven, The Fast and the Furious actually hit the mark it was aiming for.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it actually surpassed my expectations.  I'm not going to go overboard here and suggest that it is a masterpiece of cinema.  However, it is certainly a cut above the average Hollywood movie.  Firstly, its theme is one of inherent interest.  There is something really quite engaging about the life of a street racer: modifying a run-of-the-mill Japanese compact car into a 500bhp vehicle that can do a quarter-mile in 10 seconds and gathering in the middle of the night with 100 like-minded racers to wager thousands of dollars on quarter-mile drag races.<br/><br/>The film had great energy and was just angry enough to give it attitude, but not too angry as to be obnoxious.  The race and chase sequences were excellent; full of high speed action and cool camera angles.  Unfortunately, there were a couple of crashes that people walked away from which, in real life, would have seriously injured those involved.  But apart from the odd departure from real-life, the driving seemed actually pretty accurate.<br/><br/>The story and characters were also better than I expected.  There were some tough choices for the hero, Brian (played by the blue-eyed Paul Walker), and you actually felt like you got to know the main players a bit.  Vin Diesel, who plays opposite Walker as the charismatic, if harsh, street racing legend Dominic, has an on-screen presence similar to Ving Rhames.  In fact, it is Diesel who forms the backbone of the film, both within the context of the story and with his performance.<br/><br/>In addition to the great races and chases, there are some nice scenes<br/><br/>involving interaction of the characters.  In particular, a moment towards the end, when Brian reveals his true identity to Dominic, generates a great deal of tension.<br/><br/>As with many films of this nature, it would be easy to pick it apart. <br/><br/>Dissecting the inconsistencies in the story and illogical decisions of the characters would, however, just be a futile engagement.  This film is more about the experience than the meaning... more about the journey than the destination."

This film is a showcase for performance parts and will no doubt make mechanics drool.  The actors definitely did very well with what they had to work with.  On the technical side, cars that were able to speed away after popping it's header's nuts from over-pressure was a bit too much to swallow.  But putting technical expertise, quality and angles of photography, degrees of socially redeemable values aside...Was it a fun film to watch?  You bet!  I believe I got more than my money's worth.  I'll be watching it again just for the fun factor."

Sure the dialogue is cliched and the plot is amateurish, but who cares! A film like this allows you to forget its flaws as you are so wrapped up in the cars, the women, and the chases. Vin Diesel is great as always, Paul Walker was kind of stiff but then again most cops are. Now I loved Michelle Rodriguez in GIRLFIGHT, but here she was mainly used as eye candy. The chase sequences are some of the best I've ever seen, easily putting films like GONE IN 60 SECONDS and even THE FRENCH CONNECTION to shame. It offers little for women, old people, and those who follow all the traffic laws. But be warned: this film may cause you to drive a little faster and more reckless. Nitrous boosters rock!!!"

","Honestly, I was expecting a B movie, but I was blown away by the Fast and the Furious. The film is fast paced and exciting all the way through. The actors are young and beautiful and play their parts with such angst and innocence that you really feel for them (you don't cry for them or anything). The car scenes are fantastic. The fast cuts, the real stunts, the beautiful cars, the humming of the engines... everything was assembled to recreate an intense atmosphere. On my drive home from the screening I was revving up my engine, accelerating only to slow down, and truly enjoying my five speed manual. What was nice about The Fast and the Furious was that even though people are gunned down by machine guns, the film had a very G rated feel to it. There is no gratuitous sex, no over the top violence, no crazy unexpected explosions... and no superfluous CGI. What I like to call a movie that is somewhat true to reality. And these kinds of films are a pleasure to watch because you can slip in and out of them with ease. Granted I love fast driving and this movie hit the spot."
"Landryan","1","8","22","5 March 2002"," A sexist racist pile of poop
","Oh dear.<br/><br/>Where do we start?<br/><br/>Let's ignore the fact that this film was poorly plotted, poorly scripted, badly conceived and reminiscent of the tackiest MTV video you can think of. Let's remain blissfully unaware of the production values that would make yesterdays breakfast look like a five course dinner. Let's also overlook the poorest acting I've seen from young Hollywood ""talent"" since Sunset Beach.<br/><br/>Yes, lets.<br/><br/>Okay, onto the REALLY objectionable stuff...<br/><br/>Firstly, the only oriental characters involved are not only street punk goons but also the primary bad guys. Okay, so the main goon's dad is in it too for about five seconds and isn't very happy at his sons conduct, but this is hardly an excuse to have such a racially imbalanced plotline. This is the 21st century and this cowboys and indians style concept is worthy of a prison sentence, particulary as it comes from a country where racial equality is considered to be a key issue.<br/><br/>Secondly, we see lots and lots of cars and... guess what? Oh yes, women wearing next to nothing running around allowing their drivers to fondle their ""assets"", then offering threesomes. Despite the fact that the realisim factor is minute - surely most women would despair of a guy who's life revolved around his car - it also portrays an image of women as mere sex objects to pleasure guys in fast cars. Again, we have one token female who is a racer, but this hardly makes this kind of imagery morally sound, and the camera still takes time to wander over her person with an almost feral attention to detail.<br/><br/>By portraying these women as trophies, it suggests that irresponsible behaviour such as street racing can earn you sexual favours. This is of course complete rubbish in the case of nearly every single woman with an IQ above 0.2.<br/><br/>Finally, I would just like to point out that the entire plot and premise of the film displays a complete lack of belief in safe, responsible driving. Not a single seatbelt is seen throughout the entire film, people have horrific accidents in their cars then stroll out completely unscathed, and not once did I see a crash helmet or protective clothing except on the ""oriental bad guy goons"". What sort of message is that sending out to our 13 and 15 year olds as they begin to reach the age where they can legally drive?<br/><br/>To sum it up, this is a meathead movie, made for meatheads by meatheads. Avoid at all costs and burn copies wherever possible!!!"

","SOME SPOILERS CONTAINED!<br/><br/>The fast and the furious.... If this title is told many people think about the coolest film on earth, the greatest cars and the greatest drivers. I don't know yet why though. <br/><br/>I am personally into cars. I'm also interested in mechanics and electronics in general and I do know about that topic so don't tell me I have no clue what I'm going to talk about. <br/><br/>The film is made for 6-year-olds. There are ""cool"" (in my point of view pretty stupid) paint jobs, roaring engines and of course NO2! And then there is Vin Diesel who plays cocky Torreto. So they race illegally and the young cop is sent out to investigate the racing. <br/><br/>The racing is nothing spectacular. 400 meters straight line, the best built car wins or whose engine can manage the most turbo pressure or nitrous in other words. In total there are only few races throughout the whole film and it's rather boring to watch them. The cars the characters are racing could not be as powerful as real drag racing cars so the handling should be relatively easy as well. That fact already doesn't make the racers heroes in front of my eyes.<br/><br/>But racing is acceptable. The worst part of the movie is Torreto's gang truck robbing. It is so unrealistic and stupid that I don't have words for it. Every thinking person can understand how lame it looks. You can't hold on the truck with nothing to worry about when a truck is traveling about 100 km/h. And just how it looks. Truck drivers don't really do anything to get rid of them except the last one who starts shooting the gang. <br/><br/>And finally the whole story limps. It's very stereotypical and overall boring. I'm not gonna spoil too much but basically the undercover working cop merges into Torreto's gang and eventually starts defending Torreto. In the end he still founds out that Torreto is involved to truck robbing and tries to put the end to that. He also flirts with Torreto's sister. Some gang members speculate he's a cop but Torreto doesn't take that seriously etc. In other words quite boring story.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say that Fast and furious is a weak movie, unrealistic and quite boring. I don't know how this movie is so highly respected because for me it really doesn't look anything special.<br/><br/>2/10"

"ironhorse_iv","5","4","9","15 May 2013"," This movie is driving me crazy. It's an awful skid mark on film.
","The Fast and the Furious is just a movie with gas fumes of half-baked ideas for a popcorn flick. The movie is simple mindless full of hot chicks and fast cars. 'Petrolheads' probably did like it as it was the sleeper hit of 2001, and spawned many sequels. Still, the movie had mixed reviews, and in my opinion, they didn't go all the way in entertaining the kind of audience this movie was aimed towards. In the movie, there were few street races and not to mention the fact that the street racing element is just dressing for a bland, generic plot of thieves stealing commercial goods. If I went to go see a racing movie, and found myself watching a Point Break (1991) rip-off. I would be disappointed. The story goes like this, rather than having intense full-throttle action fun, awesome high-speed stunts, and full-on pedal to the metal intensity, the movie goes into another direction by having an undercover cop, Brian (Paul Walker) infiltrates an underworld subculture of Los Angeles street racers looking to bust them for stealing goods. He soon befriends the leader of the group, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and begins to question if he should turn him in, or let him free for one last ride. The movie is supposed to be fast and the furious, but it's not- it's slow pace like a grandma driving in the fast lace in the highway. The limit racing in this movie are over so quickly they're just boring as the movie puts countless amounts of filler scenes of talking that don't further the plot. There are unfinished sub plots. The movie spend all that time developing a love interest, and then you aren't going to let us know what happens? What the hell, movie! I know the movie was going to be for the low-brow, so I didn't expect a life lesson, I want to entertain. This movie was flat out lackluster. There's not enough action. The movie has a lot of flash, but the characters are dull and not interesting enough, with cars replace for personalities. That is, of course, with the exception of Toretto, who thanks to that scene about his dad and Diesel's performance, shines above the material. Still Diesel's acting is mediocre, at best. I presumed they were going to sell them off for upgrades to their cars and bikes, like Toretto was doing with his stolen goods. It's not made clear, though. It doesn't make much sense, either. The cars in the film are not that real to the real deal. Doing a wheelie while burning the the rubber on the rear tires of a 900hp Charger at the same time is simply not possible. First of all, don't expect any kind of realism from this movie. I was dumbfounded when the Brian's Honda floorboard came out of his passenger side when he used his nitrous boost and then his engine blew smoke. Next scene, after this, he picks up someone who was running from the cops with his car and drove away as if it's brand new. I didn't know Brian's puke green car came with a healing factor modified in his engine. What is with each of the ""underground street races"" have so many spectators on long streets block off. Not once, you think the police would just look for a large street block off and arrested them. The women in this movie are just drop dead hot, but it's weird for them to be hanging out at underground racing. I don't see many women there, at less not as hot as Jordana Brewster. The movie is supposed to be about Import-car racing which is a spectacle started by Asian American auto enthusiasts. How does ""The Fast and the Furious"" pay tribute to the sport's Asian American heritage? Make them the villains in the film. The movie has a lot of loud noises, and soundtrack full of the worst music artist at the time, Limp Bizkit and Ja Rule. The techno rock is a bit annoying. Like the 1955 film, The Fast and the Furious which is not based on, but took the title rights from, this movie is less for smart adults and more for kids who shell out money to pimp their car and add a 4"" diameter exhaust to it, thinking it's cool. Don't get me wrong, I love cars, but you don't see me endangering other drivers by driving fast illegally on city urban street. I like driving fast in the country side where it's less dangerous for other drivers. I think the movie glorified the illegal street racing way too much that it's a bit unhealthy. I think the movie is a bit far fetch from reality where most illegal street racers end up getting killed due to crashes or other car racers car-jacking your car before you can race. So it's not worth it. People like seeing cars go vroom and potential cause untold amounts of property damage. That must be it. Still, there are better movies than this. Go see the chase scenes in Bullitt (1975), the French Connection (1979) or Ronin. (1998). Even modern movies like Drive (2011) are better than this movie. If you have to watch the movies, go rent it, don't buy it. I wouldn't advice thinking too much into this, it's just mindless popcorn flick and also don't complain if you hate it, cause I did warn you about seeing it. It's still driving me up the wall."

"HenryHextonEsq","2","4","9","16 September 2001"," An absolute farrago that frankly fails to entertain.
","I gave this film every chance, but at every turn I could not quite believe the extent of its failure as both entertainment and film-making. My mind was much as antagonized as were my ears by this film's far from unique blend of noise, nonsense and numbskullery.<br/><br/>Rarely if ever have I been rendered so disinterested in a movie's opening in particular than with this film. No attempt is made to draw the viewer in whatsoever, with shoddy direction of unrelated, uneventful scenes. The ""effect"" of the car scenes is but one-trick-schtick. The music is unimaginatively chosen, and in its blaring merely adds to the unsubtle, dulling overall effect of such scenes. There really is nothing original or particularly impressive about the director's use of visuals and sound.<br/><br/>The acting is resolutely bad in a semi-laughable vein. If this ""Diesel"" chap is one of Hollywood's ""brightest up-and-coming stars"", he does little to show why here. His one-note performance consists merely of risible, cliched ""hard man"" posturing, inane shouting and a touch of the insufferably phony. This actor exudes none of the magnetism and genuine cool of, say, Robert Mitchum or Paul Newman, who could both act a bit as well... Diesel and Paul Walker, as the two leads, really do fail to induce any interest. The token ""emotional"" stuff is, as others have commented, utterly laughable. That one pathetic scene of this ilk has caused other reviewers to brand the film ""multi-layered"" and the like, is even more laughable. Trite lines delivered in a stilted, faux-sincere manner make for unintentional amusement and nothing besides. The main female actors are just as ineffectual; their characters are so thin they may as well have been reduced to the eye candy status of various other female ""extras"" on show throughout the film. That is not say, mind you, that genuine allure is generated at any stage... it's all rather perfunctory and sanitized.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, indeed I don't *expect* such action movies to be well scripted and interesting, but it would make a change if one actually was. There is no serious attempt to provide a cohesive story line, attempt to twist the formulaic or be at all offbeat. The bones of this script are chronically malnourished and boundlessly bare. The way plot strands are introduced and just as soon discarded without reason, just illustrates this. The writers and director are either being condescending to their target audience, or, remarkably inept - if they consider this script of any merit at all. Also, the lack of humour renders the film toothless, with the drag racing culture dully and unconvincingly put across. It all just comes across as moronic, violent and slightly sordid. The film also fails to show the side of the law with any gravitas, realism or interest, besides the incredulity stirred within me at the sight of a police/FBI headquarters in the form of some mansion equipped with a swimming pool...! The very vagueness of Paul Walker's character and the subplot centering around Diesel's activities, is matched by the equally vague and unconvincing way the police are portrayed.<br/><br/>This is a movie with no focus, fascination or indeed, ""fury"" if you will, beyond a facile, faltering nihilism. An assault on the senses it may well be, but it is a rather hollow and unprovoked assault.<br/><br/>Rating:- */*****"
"loach10","2","4","9","16 September 2001"," The Lame and the Ludicrous
","Where does one begin, coincidentally a dilemma which the director also faced, with considerably less success. I entered this movie with low expectations hoping, vainly, to be surprised. Needless to say it failed to meet even these low expectations. I actually left the cinema, feeling personally insulted that a director could show such contempt for the audience. The acting was uniformally appalling, not in the least part aided by a script that was, quite frankly laughable; 'and if I win, I win the respect.' The actors handled the complexity of human emotions like warring neanderthals; I would be tempted to read into this a brutal misanthropic polemic, though this of course would be crediting the director with far more than he deserves. The very fact that the first hour escaped the cutting room floor is an act of escapology comparable to exploits of Houdini himself. Admittedly, it improved marginally as it progressed, though by this time I was numb, feeling drained, overwhelmed and violated, not least by the almost constant grating noise of screeching engines. Oh yes, and the attempt to get away from crude ethnic stereotypes was... well er absent. <br/><br/> In conclusion if the thought of fast cars, vacuous 'ladies' and at least 10 minutes of fascinating dialogue about car engines has you salivating, then this may, I repeat may, be the film for you. If on the other hand you value the more conventional customs of the film industry; plot, characterization, drama, suspense and intrigue, then please, please avoid.  <br/><br/> */***** (this is the first film I've ever reviewed as a *!, it really was that bad!)"
"Rioter","2","4","9","24 July 2001"," What a mess...
","The problem that The Fast and The Furious has is that it is inconsistent. It at times is a police drama, at times a car movie, a gun movie and a romance. As a result, it fails on all counts, and fails spectacularly.<br/><br/>
The acting is pitiful, but the writing may be worse. There are times where lines are delivered so poorly that the actors seem to have simply given up trying to salvage the train wreck of a script. The attempts at ""street cred"" are embarrassing (""dawg,"") and the film's method of sounding technically proficient is to deliver lines of dialogue that sound like the actors are reading an inventory list at AutoZone.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about the movie is that it refused to budge from its somewhat complex story line. While nothing brilliant, the story was more developed that a standard action flick's. This is only a problem because the film was absolutely not up to the task. The action was nonsensical, and surprisingly scarce. The movie lacked a true protagonist because everyone was far too annoying to root for. The actors themselves seemed lost; milling around, reading lines.<br/><br/>It is important to mention the cars themselves, though, since this is being billed as a `car movie.' And that depends on what is expected from a car movie. If you are hoping for Camaro SSs and Hemi Cudas, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for Acuras and Hondas, you'll see them. If you're looking for Ronin-style car chases or Blues Brothers silliness, you'll be disappointed.

"bob the moo","Null","3","6","29 June 2003"," Mildly entertaining stuff for teenagers  hardly exciting or dramatic enough
","A gang of drivers are pulling off high speed hijacks of trucks and stealing their cargo.  Undercover cop Brian O'Conner is sent in to infiltrate one of the numerous street racing crews who are suspected of the crime.  He wins over Dominic Toretto, the head of one such crew and begins his investigation.  However the closer he gets to the crew and the more he gets into the culture, the harder it is to do his job.<br/><br/>One weekend I was considering going to see 2 Fast 2 Furious but decided to go and rent the first movie before I see the sequel or else how would I be able to follow the plot and characters (oh  how optimistic I was!).  So I rented this film knowing that it had received better reviews than the sequel.  I expected stylish thrills and exciting high speed action with a weak plot  I was half right.  The plot was pretty weak and full of clichés  from the `going native undercover cop' to the `urban' lingo that everyone tries to speak in.<br/><br/>It doesn't really make much sense and it is a pretty fragile house of cards that comes crashing down logic-wise if you ask too many questions.  However, to focus on the plot here is wasting my time and yours, as it matters little  this is an action movie, not a drama.  I expected the action to be slick and breathless given the speeds involved however I was really disappointed. Aside from a few directorial flourishes that make it all appear much more exciting than it is, the car action is actually quite normal.  Even the climatic hijacking is done with no feeling of `edge of seat thrills' although it looks impressive.  I'm sure many will be taken in by the sheer slickness of the thing, but I found the action to be soulless and lacking in any real excitement.<br/><br/>The cast are a line of urban clichés who sound like every suburban teenager in the Western world tries to sound. Walker is bland and manages to make Vin Diesel look like he's acting hard.  In fairness Diesel was responsible for the only scene I found dramatic (where Toretto finds out who O'Conner is) by doing good work with his face  but for the rest he was simply a tough guy lacking in the charisma needed to do a likeable bad guy.  Rodriguez looks good but is better than this.  Brewster is surprisingly plain given the amount of eye candy on display and the rest of the support cast simply mug (Ja Rule included).  More often I found myself watching the crowds who were populated with beautiful girls who were cynically edited in at every chance to try and get the teenage boys coming back for more.  I'm not complaining, but it is hard not to feel a little exploited when the film has a lingering shot of two gorgeous girls snogging for no reason other than visual titillation.<br/><br/>Overall, like the cars themselves this is a very slick vehicle but I found it to be ultimately empty and soulless.  The plot is meaningless and the script one cliché after another.  The action scenes are ordinary and it is a major failing of the film that it doesn't manage to translate the thrill of 140 mph races etc onto the screen.  If you want to see a road race done better I suggest an exciting scene in the Jackie Chan 1995 film `Pi li ho'  that I found exciting, this I just found to be hollow and noisy."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Emphasis on the Furious.<br/><br/>My ideal movie will take me to unknown places, ideally through new visual experiences. This film tries twice to do so. On one of these accounts, it fails, but the other really impressed me. And I'm a hard case.<br/><br/>The failure was that the filmmaker thought he discovered a new counterculture worth exploring. As with all such, it is illegal, costly, dangerous, urban and youth-centered. But this is rooted in asian-influenced techno and has an appearance that is unique. The writers (were there any?) weren't good enough to capture any of this beyond showing us the cars. A failure.<br/><br/>The success was in extending the visual grammar. Nothing revolutionary or original here. But the visual effect does push the experience to a new level. I believe it does so by relying on Manga, which is the art of this same counterculture. I'm pretty shocked that no one here has compared the essential style to `Akira.'"

","Some movies drop clues (albeit small) that allow you to believe, even in retrospect, that you could have ""solved the crime.""  Even if this movie is more concerned with the milieu of this racing society and the relationships among the characters, it needs logical plot development.  The fact that it doesn't have it aside, perhaps, from the ""revelation"" that the ""team"" must be getting all that money SOMEWHERE (something that could be said about just about every ""team"" out there), is the major weakness of the film.  In fact, one senses the only reason the guilty party IS the guilty party is because the writers sat around drinking a little too much Corona and decided, in their drunken state, that it would be cool to have those people be guilty...of course because it would maximally affect one particular relationship...which, of course, leads to the huge cop-out of an ending. Teens across the country will be declaring that this movie is ""true"" and ""real"" - I guess because it puts relationships and ""honesty"" within relationships above everything else.

The only decent cars in the movie are the Ferrari, F150 Lightnig, and the supercharged Charger. The day when an old $3k RX7 can beat a $140k V12 Ferrari will be the day cows fly.

It surely isn't going to win any prices and Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto)isn't the kind of actor that gives great performances (well maybe in the Riddick franchise).

Even Jordana Brewster (Mia Torreto) who started off in a horror called The Faculty (1998). This flick had so many technical aspects that people who are tuning their cars will get a tuned hard-on from watching this flick. But for me, I wasn't really attracted towards the story. Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) did well and in fact it's all about him.

Owing certain debts to Point Break and Stone Cold, director Rob Cohen has crafted a technically adroit picture which is an assault on the eyes and the ears. Cars tear around, crash bang and wallop, thru the camera, under trucks, in front of speeding trains and on it goes, with no real let up till the end credits roll. There is a plot, it's thin, but it does have a story from which to race around. The cast flex their muscles and pout respectively, with a little bit of eye candy for either sexes to admire from their comfy chairs. Boasting great stunt work mixed in with very capable CGI, The Fast And The Furious deserves much better regard than it currently has on some internet sites. Why?

","I had just come from a rather desultory day at the movies where I saw the sequel Fast & Furious to this film. I had written in the review that you probably would have had to see the first film in order to fully appreciate what was going on. Wouldn't you know it, the FX channel was broadcasting this tonight. <br/><br/>I was partially correct, but this film had a bit more plot to it and didn't concentrate on just the special effects and the violence which was served up fast and furious. Vin Diesel is a criminal who races cars as an avocation and does hijackings for a living. The FBI wants him, the LAPD wants him and Paul Walker is an LAPD cop gone undercover to get him.<br/><br/>Walker takes his assignment quite literally and part of getting undercover is under some blankets with Diesel's sister Jordana Brewster and getting it on with the young lady. But he also proves his driving abilities to Diesel.<br/><br/>Diesel's racing rivals are some Asian gangbangers headed by Rick Yune and Walker would dearly like to pin something on them. Still it's Diesel his superiors want and it's Diesel they will have come what may.<br/><br/>Paul Walker compromised his effectiveness as an undercover agent thoroughly in this film.

","I'll tell you what ... THE worst movie ever made.  I can't even believe I paid the $5 to rent this piece of DVD-Trash and I feel even worse for those who paid much more to see it in the theatre.<br/><br/>Where to begin, where to begin.  Why not start with the plot, since people here keep saying it doesn't matter.  Okay okay, so there actually was no plot, but that's not going to stop me from ranting.  This movie had no focus or direction.  In the beginning it's this kid wanting to be a street racer. Then he's a cop trying to stop an electronics theft ring. Then it's some half baked attempt at a love story ala Romeo & Juliet with the kid and the family who doesn't accept him. Then it's a story about ripping off some truck.  Oh ya, and the occasional car race.  And as if that couldn't get any better, this movie even comes complete with an evil Chinese syndicate(could we get any more stereotypical????).<br/><br/>I guess I should talk about the cast now.  Um ... ya, what an amazing cast of stellar bad-actors.  Yeesh!  Although I suppose it's not all their fault (well, except for Vin Diesel), most of the blame belongs to the awful script and terrible dialogue.  I watched Jordana Brewster for 3 years on As The World Turns, she's a good actress.  She was great over on ATWT.  But here... the height of her performance is the frequent use of ""Stop the bulls&@% !!!!"".  Paul Walker, he may be good, he may not be.  You can hardly judge by this movie and I havent seen him in anything else.  To me, it seemed like a classic case of casting based upon looks.<br/><br/>Speaking of bad dialogue.  The absolute worst element in this movie was all the male ego BS.  The worst example of this was the ending scene with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel.  Paul Walker's character, the cop (just thought I'd reiterate this) was chasing down Vin Diesel's character in one of the movie's few car chases.  Diesel's car is smashed into by a truck and the car's totaled.  Walker pulls his gun on him and looks like he's going to do his job and arrest him.  But what does he do?  Hands him the keys to his car and says ""I still owe you a 60 second car"" and lets him ride off.  Then the movie ends.  Hopefully, what we didn't see was Walker's character suspended from the force, followed by a hearing, followed by an arrest and sentencing for Aiding and Abetting.<br/><br/>Now this wouldn't be a good review if I didn't mention the car stuff. Firstly I found it extremely annoying that this movie threw in so much car gibberish that the average movie goer like myself had absolutely no clue what was being said.  Second, the car stunts were few and extremely lacking in excitement.  How exciting is it to see a car go in a straight line?  Not very.  How exciting is it to see 5 cars try and rob an 18 Wheeler?  It probably was, but by that point in the movie I simply didn't care.  And also... if the truck driver is shooting at you with a rifle ... why are you still chasing him?  To save some redneck who most of the characters don't seem to like, and end up killing two of the people you do like?<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the flaws and annoyances of this movie ... but I don't have the time.

By the end of it, I was incredibly surprised at how much I liked this movie. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it kept me interested from start to finish. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is about drag racing in L.A., and focuses on a young undercover cop who falls into a group of professional drag racers who just might be the same ones who've been participating in a series of truck hijackings. The young cop tries to get to the bottom of this by becoming close friends with the leader of this group. Here for once is a movie that features car races and chases with the use of real cars, not special effects. It's at its best when the action takes place behind the wheel, and these scenes keep you on the edge. Plus, it has a story that works because it's interesting. Paul Walker (as the cop) and Vin Diesel (as the group leader) are given good material to work with, and both actors play their characters well. You get to know these two guys, and you can't help but wonder what's going to happen to them in the end. That makes ""The Fast and the Furious"" an even better film.

"nickmesafilms","7","2","4","1 January 2012"," The Fast and the Furious (2001) - Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, Start Your Engines!
","Known as the first film in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series, this thrilling street-racing action flick brought a start to a daring and explosive franchise. Paul Walker plays LAPD officer Brian O' Connor, who is sent undercover to investigate a gang of street-racers, all portrayed by Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Jordana Brewster as his sister Mia, and Michelle Rodriguez as his girlfriend Letty. But then, he starts having feelings for this particular group, and has no idea whether to bust them or not. This really is a thrilling, and exciting film. Who doesn't enjoy watching car races, hot ladies, and rocking music? The race scenes are exciting and fun, and they steal the whole movie. But I don't really think this movie should be called an ""excellent"" movie, but instead a ""cool"" movie. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are two of the toughest guys ever seen on film, so it was really fun watching them racing cars, shooting guns, and beat up people. But neither one of them gives a special performance. The story may sound like a crazy concept, but it is original. It's neither a remake or a reboot of classic car race films. Anyways, if you're interested in watching a classic movie with chase scenes, hot ladies, explosive bombs, and tons of violence, you won't be disappointed. This is the perfect movie to invite your friends to, and watch this with everyone. ""The Fast and the Furious"", in my review, ""exciting premise, a thrilling ride""."

","while i admit,this isn't the most smartly written movie,it is fun,especially the races and the chase scenes.some of the souped cars are quite something.there's isn't a great deal of acting required here,as the focus is mainly on the cars.i won't get into the plot,as it's just held together by a thread and there are holes everywhere.there isn't much in the way of character development,but Paul Walker and Vin diesel do have some charisma,and Jordan Brewster is easy on the eyes.things move along at a good clip.it's really a fast food movie.you throw it in,it fills you up,it's over.if you just want to be entertained,this may be what you're looking for.if you want something more substantial,look elsewhere.for me,The Fast and the Furious is a 7/10"

"Movie-12","Null","2","4","12 July 2001"," Yes, it's fast and furious, but it's also an audiovisual assault. *1/2 (out of four).
","THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS / (2001) *1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>""The Fast and the Furious"" is not a movie as much as it's an audiovisual assault. I suppose you can call it a motion picture because it consists of moving pictures flashing before a large screen, but movies are a form of the arts, which exist to please people. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is not pleasing, involving, or entertaining. Some people might enjoy it because of all the car stunts, crashes, chases, and intense action sequences, but that's all this production has. ""The Fast and the Furious"" should have a medical alert warning on its poster: ""This film is not for those faint of heart."" Not because of high octane suspense, but because it attacks our senses from all angles-to an unhealthy level. The booming, nauseating soundtrack demolishes our eardrums while our sight becomes desensitized by all the gratuitous violence and testosterone-laden fist fights. This isn't entertaining-it's violating.<br/><br/>
This is the kind of movie that throws logic into the air to concentrate on stupefying the audience with unconvincing action. There's a scene where a cop speeds down the streets of LA in his car while firing a gun at an accelerating motorcycle. First, there would be more people on the streets of LA. Second, I do not think a cop would jeopardize the lives of so many innocent pedestrians by opening fire on a moving object.<br/><br/>Actor Paul Walker reunites with his ""The Skulls"" director Rob Cohen. (I will give Cohen credit for one thing: ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a whole lot better than ""The Skulls,"" but that's not saying much.) He stars as an LA cop named Brian, who's working undercover to investigate a frequent string of truck hijackings.<br/><br/>The prime suspect is Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel from ""Pitch Black""), a buff, tough, and rough dude who spends his days working at a tune-up shop and his nights drag racing high speed cars. Brian decides to earn the respect of the racer. Toretto's excepts Brian as his right-handman. Brian also falls for an attractive young woman (Jordana Brewster). Here's a surprise: the girl is Dominic's sister. ""You break her heart, I'll break your neck,"" explains Dom to the humbled Brian. I wouldn't second guess him.<br/><br/>The one-dimensional, unsympathetic characters explain most of the plot to us, but their dual explanations feel like an intrusion to the copious action sequences. When they do speak, it's only in clichés. Don't worry, though. These scenes are few and far between. Most of the time the characters speak in actions, not words. Sometimes that can work to a movie's advantage, but not when the actions are violent impulses and obvious plot motivations.<br/><br/>""The Fast and the Furious"" occupies no surprises, no involving character relationships, and no memorable lines of dialogue. After the movie, I defy anyone in the audience to quote a single line of important dialogue. You probably couldn't either, because there are no important lines of dialogue in this movie. A few moments do induce some much appreciated suspense, but before we become too interested, the production abruptly cuts to the next scene.<br/><br/>Naturally, ""The Fast and the Furious"" contains some eye-popping, jaw-dropping car stunts. This movie is a surefire hit with fans of such movies as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Driven."" The action sequences are indeed intense and well accomplished, and I also admire the work by Vin Diesel. These positives make the negatives even more apparent. With the decent material present, it's a shame the movie as a whole is so utterly pointless.<br/><br/>
""The Fast and the Furious"" is yet another prime example of how movie producers hold back on the material to warrant a lower rating. In this case it's the PG-13. The rating greatly limits the violent and  sexual content, and the language the street gang uses is anything but realistic. Some movies are born to be R-rated, like ""The Fast and the Furious."" But gutless producers want their movie suitable for all audiences, thus the movie is more likely to prosper in the box office. I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I felt cheated out of a more edgy, provocative movie.<br/><br/>
I like the title, though. ""The Fast and the Furious,"" they got that right!"

This movie series is such a miracle. It has been a very unremarkable seedling since the first part, and it has been crooked, but it turned out to be a wonderful flower after the correction.

"wiserurchin","9","0","0","4 June 2020"," A iconic Action Film
","A movie that for its time was a first of its kind, Hollywood had never seen a movie involving illegal street racing. Little to everyone's knowledge that this first startup movie in 2001 would lead to a long and ongoing series of movies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) Is a LAPD officer assigned to investigate Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) under suspicion of multiple high speed truck robberies. O'Connor quickly meets Toretto in the street racing scene, Toretto takes O'Connor under his wing and gives him a place to stay as well as helps him build a new car. Throughout the time O'Connor is with Toretto he falls in love with not only his new environment but also Toretto's sister. The Movie doesn't only portray the criminal activity like street racing, running from the police, and robbery of semis carrying Blu Ray Players but shows bonds being made between two completely different worlds and a true feeling throughout Toretto's group known to him as family. O'Connor works so well into the family that when it's time to step in and do his job to bust the family for the thefts he can't do it and feels like he's betraying the family. The movie is beriddled with effects from the early 2000s and at some point shows poor editing. The movie has many interesting little quirks that the average person watching the movie might not notice but to its intended audience of car guys shows. One recognizable scene that is laughed upon is the first race scene of the movie of the movie Brian goes to spray Nitrous Oxide into the motor and the passenger footwell floor pan just falls right out of the car. How those to relate or even nearly are possible is out there and foolish. Looking past its few small quirks and editing issues the film was quite a good turn out. The film was low budget and to the studio seemed like a one and done film but turned into something much bigger. A cool fact is the cars used in the film were cars built by actual people throughout the state of california. To wrangle up some car ideas they invited a large group or car tuners to bring down their car to the movie studio and from the directors chose which cars would star in the movie. The cast brought the movie together with good chemistry and put on an amazing performance with most not really being seen in any big buck films before. The Fast and The Furious for most was a movie that brought together the car community and created dreams for the members of all with this action movie. The movie would go on to make a total of 10 action packed movies. The Fast and Furious movie was and will continue to be an amazing movie not only for its action scenes but its depiction of street racing and the car community in the early 2000s which is largely the same today."

Anyway, this movie then shifts to brian who where he work, still allowed him to do anything he want, however he arrived at this street-racing, this is the event of where they race on this street, anyway this is not allowed, but they do it somehow by making sure no other car drive on this street, anyway Dominic is on this race as well, also if they win this race, they get a cash, but Brian does not have money, so he agreed, if he lose, he will give the winner of the car of his car, anyway the race started and there is more than two people competing in this street race, anyway Dominic win and Brian loose, so now the car belong to him, but the car is slightly damaged, but somehow the police arrived, so they all have to escape, anyway they all drove their own car including Brian, anyway Dominic parked his own car, then walked, but still is getting caught, however he soon sat on Brian car as they finally escaped. Anyway they somehow arrived to enemy place of where somehow there is a reason of which is hidden of why they could potentially be enemy, but there is one dialogue of where Dominic say he own them as he slept with their sister, anyway they look street racer as well, anyway Dominic lied to these people of who the car belong to, also introduce brian that he is a mechanical engineering, anyway these people destroyed the car, so now Dominic and Brian has to walk to their own place at this night. Soon, Dominic invited Brian to his house of where somehow there is party happening in this house, anyway Mia is happy once Brian arrived there, also he had conservation with Mia as well, whereas for Dominic, he spend time with his lover, but there is other people in this team who does not like Brian entering this house as well, but they could not do anything. Anyway Brian still own a car for Dominic, but in this movie, they use this dialogue ''i own you ten second car'', anyway Brian decided to bring a damaged car to their garage, also he is now part of the team of where he is a mechanical engineer as well, also these people are also mechanical engineer as well, anyway they agreed to make this damaged car repaired and make it an posh car, however they have their own computer system which analyse this car of which he does talk about features of this car as well, anyway in this movie, you will also see that this group of people will do party in this movie as well, also Brian began dating with Mia of which she agreed, also one person is angry because of this, but Dominic does agree as alongside as he does not upset her, anyway they probably like each other from this stage of this movie, anyway he probably use her brother to go closer to her, i suppose, anyway now Brian work for Dominic of whatever he want him to do. Anyway, soon Brian who went secret to this group enemy people place on the garage of where there is cars, anyway Dominic and his other team arrived there as well as they think that he is a cop, anyway he told them that he is looking at vehicles on other people who will take part in the future racing. Anyway there is one scene of which i forget to talk about, this is the police officer scene, anyway there is one scene of which Brian character is revealed as he is a cop and he meant to investigate the incident happened on the beginning scene of where thief stolen the goods from truck, anyway this is why he is doing all thing of which he is doing in this movie as well. Anyway let's skip to other scene as soon police officer arrest these enemy as they are suspect of stealing the goods from truck, also Brian is part of this police officer team as well of capturing these people. Anyway let's skip to the racing scene of where Dominic team take part in this competition who they are against his enemy who now have freedom as they are no more a suspect, anyway because he lost, this person drove straight to a place to wash his car, this is a lie because they do not want to give the winner of this race something as a gift, anyway the enemy also start to have fight with Dominic team for accusing them that they stealing the goods from truck, but they somehow fought against this enemy, anyway this person who lost the race used his father car, anyway he could be in trouble as well. Anyway soon Brian realise that Dominic team are actually thief, also Mia told him the truth, also he stopped the team of stealing the good from trucks, but this time is harder to steal the good as the truck driver is strong man, anyway they could not steal it, also one person injured, so Brian called cops for help, also now everyone now that he is a police officer, anyway they all went away.

Extra Information - This movie is overall a average film as it has positive point and some part which is disappointing as well as some part which seems okay, anyway, this movie has good sequence in term of racing and whenever they use the car as these car are just good in term of looks, feature and the way it drove and make nice noises in order for it to drive, also the street racing sequence and the hijack of using a car is good, so car sequence is good, even-tough in real life, we are not supposed to use higher speed for cars, also street racing does exist, but not all country has this rule, anyway this movie has negative points which is only bit disappointing because Brian is cop, also he meant to investigate this case of people stealing good from truck, but whenever he go to cop, we are so confused of what they are saying, also they way the cops investigate this in term of this case is not done in perfect way, because we first accuse these enemy, then Mia team, don't know how, anyway they are the people who do live as they are mechanical and are rich who can afford these cars, this is maybe they steal stuff as well, anyway this could be improved in order to make us engaging, but then you know, cops also like this family girl which is Mia, so he is stuck, but this case could been better if they explore detail of who could steal it of what we think that police already know the car who stealing it, this is why they may accuse these enemy people, but don't how they changed their mind, maybe no evidence, maybe they are gone somewhere, anyway this movie, these thief just do one more stealing is at the end of this movie, it is not like, they done many time of where police may realize of who stolen it, anyway how do they know that Mia team is involved with this, this all could been better, anyway the ending of this movie is okay, however there is scene of this movie which seem okay like when Brian meet Mia family and know that they have enemy, do street racing, be mechanical engineer and fall in love with Mia as well, anyway all these point are okay for this movie, but this movie is the first part of fast furious of first time seeing this old movie, anyway the title suits this movie as it suits the name for this movie as it is about cars which are fast and furious, but yes, this movie is action movie, obviously it contain bit of swear words and fast furious do show love scene as well, anyway characters look young in this movie as well, also there is more things of which i have not explained in this movie, you just need to watch this movie, but nearly 2 hours of this movie is enough for us as a audience, anyway if you seen this movie, think about your favourite car, also cop like Mia as well, this is another reason, he allowed Dominic to use his car to escape from police, anyway waiting to watch second part soon."

","Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover in the Los Angeles street racing circuits in order to find out which of the racing crews is committing crimes with their muscle cars. But going undercover is never easy, especially with such affable miscreants.<br/><br/>The basic premise is really nothing special. But then again, it doesn't need to be. The point of this movie is in its style. It has fast cars, lots of racing, lots of hot, greased-up babes, muscle-heavy men (and cars) and a killer soundtrack. You don't watch it to be intrigued by carefully orchestrated plot points or tragic backstories or the heaviness of its pathos. No, you watch it to kick back, relax and have a good time.<br/><br/>And in delivering that, the movie more than delivers. But if it was just that, I'd probably rate the film a bit lower. What actually elevates this film above its immediate peers and helped launch a huge franchise, is the fact that this film is punching above its weight class and succeeding. And it does that by having some real good actors playing roles they were born to play. Walker is one of them, but I also have to mention Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>The dialogue is also surprisingly snappy and memorable. The plot, while basic, succeeds in making you care for these characters, and it also manages to make itself feel novel, despite arguably being at least a little clichéd. Once again, the fact that you care for these characters matters a lot.<br/><br/>Not a groundbreaking movie by any means, but it has surprising quality underneath all the testosterone being forcibly pumped into your veins."

The attention-grabbing, high-speed racing and chases were put together perfectly.  The soundtrack will be a must have as well.  I am not sure why the critics dogged it so much.  It appeals to the age group that spends the most money on movies.  It was loud, fast, adrenaline-pumping action that kept everyone's eyes glued to the screen.  I am a female who LOVES cars and this movie just made me want to be a race car driver.  So don't let Rolling Stone magazine and other newspapers determine whether you see this movie or not.  This movie fits our generation and you can't help but leave the theater with a smile on your face and feel the urge to shout, ""Yeah!!""<br/><br/>Oh, and people did drive out of the parking lot with screeching tires after the movie.

","I wanted so bad to like this movie, but I can't. There are so many technical inaccuracies it made me want to puke. I'm part of today's ""Import Enthusiast"" crowd, and have a good knowledge of engines and mechanicals. I read somewhere that they hired technical consultants for this flick, so it would sound like the actors knew what they were talking about. Could have fooled me. I'm not about to list everything that was wrong, but I'm still confused as to why you'd put SR20 Nissans in CIVICS!!!! Those of you as proficient as I am know exactly what I'm talking about. Those that don't, have a mechanic friend watch the movie with you, and watch him/her go insane. Enough about that. The ONLY things saving this movie were Vin, Jordanna, and the cars. It would have been nice if they weren't so riddled with graphics, but they were still cool. The dialogue was laughably rediculous (""....before I leave treadmarks on your face.""), and so was the acting. Michael Schultz (sp) needs some serious acting classes. But Vin and Jordanna did a great job acting out their respective parts. For the sequel, can we get new writers, actors, and technical consultants?! A little less graphics would be nice also!"

Letty was a kewl character, they should have explored it more though. Mia was just another female added in to make Brian's character well a man off course. The car scenes were just excellent, if you definitely have a thing for cars and speed well then this rocks.

","..and I really mean that. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that its scorching visuals and enormous kinetic energy were backed up by a fine, sympathetic performance by imposing Vin Diesel and, overall, what I like to call ""a good heart"" --a film that isn't nihilistic and bitter at the core but has humanity and a sense of values. I had no trouble understanding why our cop hero, himself once in trouble with the law, slowly gravitated away from his chilly bosses and toward the vitality and warmth of the street racers' family unit, with its backyard picnics, protection of weaker members and strong internal loyalty.  I won't go into a lot about the plot, not because it doesn't have one but because you don't need to know: just know that if you get sick of movies where people do bad things for no reason, this one will make you feel better.

","The Fast and the Furious, I remember in 2001 this was the must see movie. I was in high school at the time and I remember the weekend that it opened strangely enough, and I remember the Monday at school, all the guys were just screaming how cool this film was, how ""badass"" it was, it was so ridicules. So, I decided to steer clear of the fast and the furious films, it just seemed like a waste of time. But recently one of my friends told me that I should give these movies a chance. So I decided to go ahead and see what they were about, plus I had a coupon for a free rental and there was nothing else better to watch it seemed. So I watched the first two fast and the furious films this afternoon, and for the first film, I have to say that it lived up to everything I would've expected.<br/><br/>Brian is a cop in LA and is going undercover into the deep dark pimp my ride world of street racing. He meets the head of the LA races, Dominic, who has a gang of people who are loyal drivers and race for money, also a sister who Brian falls for, what a shock, huh? But there's bad news, there is a rival race gang in the area, The Fast And The Furious became quickly from an action movie to a mystery thriller of who's gang is trying to get the major pimp your ride engines for money. So Brian of course starts to like the gang and wants to become one of them, what another shock.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it The Fast and the Furious is the most predictable and horribly written piece of a film you could think of. I don't understand how others, besides a teenage guy, could get into these films. I shouldn't have rented the sequels, just because now I have to watch them to get my money's worth :P But I think it is just silly all the major over the top special effects, it has a pointless plot as well as it's sexist. I'm not saying that to be a pain in the butt, but all the women in this film were used as mostly sex objects, they had no development. But I guess that's what to expect from a film like The Fast and the Furious. Oh, well, at least I could say I saw these films.<br/><br/>4/10"

Not only that, it's a huge rip off of ""Point Break.""  An undercover cop, trying to get the inside on these street racers who are suspected to be robbing 18-wheelers, while falling in love with the girl who is on the side of the street racers.  That rite there is a horrible plot and should've been tossed at the site of that garbage.  There were also many other things wrong with the film. First, you see the driver's using nitrous on their rice burning cars like 4 or 5 times in a single race.  That is almost not even possible because the Japanese cars they are using can't take that kind of pressure on the engine block.  They could last about 2 shots of nitrous, maybe 3, before their engine block blew up and/or cracked, or before you had to do a complete rebuild of the engine, both top-end and bottom-end construction.<br/><br/>Secondly, when they race at the beginning, they do a mile long race, which no idiot would do because to determine the winner, all you really need to race is a quarter of a mile. And lastly, the movie would have been a tremondous amount better if they used AMERICAN CARS!!!!!!  All these ""new age"" racers nowadays try to supe up their Honda Civics and their Eclipse's, and none of them were designed to race and none of them could ever compete with the kind of power an AMERICAN CAR could put out.The only two cars in the film that are worth any respect are the Ford Lightning, that doesnt even see the drag strip, which is stupid considering that it does a 10 second quarter-mile which is damn good, and the Dodge Challenger, which THANK GOD is raced, cuz if it wasnt i would have killed myself, but sadly ends up being destroyed by that idiot Vin Diesel.

Michelle Rodriguez tries to be the exception to this image, but in acting tough she has a permanent scowl on her face and merely comes off as being very, very unhappy.  I don't think she smiled once in the film.<br/><br/>The film blurs the line between good and evil (except for the Asians--they're evil) and has no sense of closure or justice.  Top it all off with a few plot holes (why didn't they use the cell-phone trick in the beginning?) and you have a movie that tries to be fun but is actually ridiculous and offensive.

Together, they form a duo. They so discover that the street racing is causing theft to occur in L.A. So, it's up for Walker's character to tracked own these robbers before they hit again. The Fast and the Furious is a good action flick for the summer because it combined the energy level to high as the chases become greater and greater. As for Walker and Diesel, these guys know how to act. They know what's the game is. When the game is on, they go at it. Their formula together is very good and the action sequences are really astonishing. As for the car chases, they are somehow very neat and well made. All in all, The Fast and the Furious is a heart pounding, fast and furious ride from start to finish. ★★★ 3 stars."

"Ariel_Ronnie","4","2","5","14 October 2008"," Technically and Ethically Flawed
","Rather than just bashing this film (albeit well deserved) let me start with the good points. 'The Fast and the Furious' has good production values, cinematography, and performances. The director does a decent job at maintaining pace and the story does offer some character development. Where this movie hurts itself is: 1) Apparent lack of a technical consultant. In the first race scene, Walker's car begins spewing nuts, bolts, and washers from the dashboard (?). Apparently he has plenty of spare parts in places they should not be. In the same race he burns out his cylinders and yet is still able to outrun the police. This movie is filled with such technical flaws (I won't even mention hitting a semi head on and walking away without a scratch); 2) The good guys are a crooked cop and a thief who hijacks trucks. The bad guys are truckers who defend themselves and Asians.; 3) The film-makers should have seriously set aside their own prejudice.-- Although the technical inaccuracies frankly will not bother many at all (hey, if it's entertaining, why not), it's basic asinine concept of protagonists and it's expressed prejudice make it something I cannot recommend. There are several stellar reviews for this movie on this page that rate this movie as good to great. Just take a look at the number of copies of this DVD which are available and the cheap asking price. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will not want to see again and that at least a few of the stellar reviews are from people wanting to get rid of their copy."

","If you have seen Point Break there is absolutely no need to see this movie. The plot is EXACTLY the same, just substitute the skydiving/surfing with street racing and you have it.<br/><br/>Point Break: Undercover FBI agent, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), infiltrates a group of surfers suspected of robbing banks. The group has a very charismatic leader, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze).<br/><br/>Fast and the Furious: Undercover cop, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), infiltrates a group of street racers suspected of hijacking electronic equipment. The street racer group also has a very charismatic leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel).<br/><br/>Point Break: The FBI agent finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the community he has infiltrated and Bodhi's ex girlfriend. This causes an internal struggle for Utah, as his fondness for the Bodhi and the lifestyle he embodies conflicts with his duty as an FBI agent.<br/><br/>Fast and the Furious: The police officer also finds himself increasingly attracted to the adrenaline-charged lifestyle of the street racing community and also has a romantic interest in the form Toretto's younger sister. The lifestyle of Toretto and cronies and said romantic interest again causes, just as in Point Break, a conflict with his duties as a police officer.<br/><br/>Point Break: Utah first suspects another group of surfers as the ""Ex-Presidents"" bank robbers and organises a FBI raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.<br/><br/>Fast and the Furious: O'Conner first suspects another group of racers and orders a raid on them. He subsequently finds out that they are not the guilty party.<br/><br/>Point Break: Bodhi and his fellow surfers are the bank robbers, they go for the jackpot and it all goes horribly wrong. Utah, who befriended Bodhi, lets him get away.<br/><br/>Fast and the Furious: Toretto and his crew are the hijackers, they also go for ""the jackpot"" and again it goes horribly wrong. O'Conner, who befriended Toretto, lets him get away.<br/><br/>You would think that Hollywood actually takes into account that the average person's memory is slightly superior to that of a goldfish.<br/><br/>Except for that carbon copy plot I quite enjoyed it and can recommend it for anyone who hasn't seen Point Break."

And they sound like a retard trying to sing an opera. A God-awful buzzing noise. I frankly don't care how fast they are, or how much boost they run. If you have 10,000 dollars laying around, you can make almost any vehicle do anything you want. This film just glorifies what I can't stand - white guys, and other non-blacks, trying to act tough and hard with their gay, little, girlie cars.This trendy feckfest, and the two movies that followed, loves make the dumbest comparisons. A 4 cylinder car running nitrous and/or turbo should not be compared to a single cam, pushrod V8 with normal aspiration. Most horsepower figures should not be trusted either. How were the dyno sensors calibrated? How was the engine treated at the time of testing? If you want an example of V8 turbo, look at the Sledgehammer Vette'.Around 900 horses and 254.76 mph.

","On one level, ""The Fast and the Furious"" is two hours of machismo. But on another level, it does show the subculture of street racing. Before it came out, I'd never known that people soup their cars up with nitrous oxide to increase speed. Vin Diesel plays his typical role, and Paul Walker almost seems like a side character.<br/><br/>I should identify that much of the movie looks pretty improbable. I won't divulge the scenes right here for risk of spoiling the movie, but trust me: you'll know these scenes when you see them. But like I said, the movie does give one an insight into the world of street racing.

","Welcome to the world of street racing. Fast sleek car, hot women, and lots and lots of money. The man everyone looks to is Dominic, but he is being put under investigation by undercover cop Brian. There have been hijackers robbing trucks of their merchandise and Dominic is the main suspect. Though Brian is on the case, his judgment is clouded when he befriends Dom, but more to when he becomes infatuated by Dom's sister Mia.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a head first trip into the world of underground street racing; but the film doesn't do it justice. It doesn't explore the notion of why people do it and just shows us that street racers are petty crimes looking for a break. The plotting is paper thin and the dialog is so hammed; they sound childish. The guys gruff their way through not showing much intelligence and the girls are given this fragile ego. All the actors try to look tuff but they don't show any sign of intimidation. The have surly looks but are giant pussy cats. They should have gotten lesson from Clint Eastwood on how to be a tough guy.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen, though not a favourite director, does have en eye for action sequences. Most of the time his direction is very heavy handed, but when the action starts he is in his foray. The action is high energy and come at a relentless pace. He does get you right in the middle of it. Though the problem is that it doesn't keep its impact over time. Once you've seen it a few times the car chases don't really have the same intensity they had when you first saw it.<br/><br/>It fast and has a very slick look to it, but with a script lacking development and very mediocre acting, not even the good car chases can save it from it plot holes."

"SwingBatta","3","2","5","27 February 2002"," Fast cars, furious action, comatose plot
","""The Fast and The Furious,"" directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the ""in"" movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million.<br/><br/>To label it a ""surprise hit"" was erroneous. ""Furious"" was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions  I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars.<br/><br/>And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was ""in,"" all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior.<br/><br/>The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough  you guessed it  Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays.<br/><br/>I knew the script for ""Furious"" would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like ""Damn, that guy's fast!"" and ""Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?""<br/><br/>It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, ""Check it out, it's like this."" If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll ""get the money and the respect."" (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.)<br/><br/>I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time,"" I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick.<br/><br/>Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as ""the buster."" Does anyone even use that term anymore?<br/><br/>Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like ""Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?"" my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform.<br/><br/>Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting.<br/><br/>The other type of race figures prominently in ""Furious,"" and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and ""has a last name but can't pronounce it."" Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only ""F"" word during his mercifully brief screen time.<br/><br/>Big shock  the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words.<br/><br/>However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of ""Furious"" is just outright nonsense.<br/><br/>For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers?<br/><br/>If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away (""I owe you a ten-second car,"" Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape.<br/><br/>""The Fast and The Furious"" would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars. This movie does remain true to the essence of its subject matter in one aspect: it's one hell of a drag. 3/10"

"Buddy-51","Null","2","5","19 February 2002"," begins well then careens downhill
","In its early stages, `The Fast and the Furious' offers promise that it will become a kind of street-smart, urban version of `American Graffiti' for the new millennium.  It is, alas, a promise that goes largely unfulfilled when the film decides to go the `Donnie Brasco' route instead (although this ain't no `Donnie Brasco').  Like `American Graffiti,' this movie peers into a culture centered largely around automobiles  although in this case it involves high-speed street racing rather than mere cruising.  Unlike Lucas' classic, however, `The Fast and the Furious' betrays its milieu by incorporating a trite tale of an undercover cop (cherubic, squeaky-clean Paul Walker) sent in to infiltrate the cruisers led by Vin Diesel, who appear to be running an elaborate, but actually rather incredible and impracticable, truck hijacking business.  Thus, we are left to endure the inevitable moral conflicts that arise when the cop falls in love with the leader's sister and he begins to feel `sympathy' for the man he is supposed to betray. <br/><br/>We could forgive the fact that the dialogue is incredibly inane and the characterizations nonexistent if the film had at least stayed true to its first 40 minutes of nonstop action.  Director Rob Cohen brings a real style and feeling for visual composition to these early scenes, punctuated by incredible stunt work and lightning-paced editing.  The film also captures the feel of urban street rhythms in its musical soundtrack (although you may feel somewhat assaulted by all the visual and aural over-stimulation if you happen to be 25 years of age or older).  In fact, if `The Fast and the Furious' had stayed in this mode throughout, it might even have become an epochal film for the teens of its era.  In this early part, the film's characters pose and strut and drip attitude in a way that becomes emblematic of the trendy youth culture of the time.  Instead, the film becomes just another trite police melodrama straight off the film-factory assembly line. <br/><br/>
That's really a shame because the stunt work is phenomenal throughout, and Vin Diesel conveys a kind of raw animal magnetism that bodes well for his future in action cinema.  He has a way of commanding the audience's attention every time he makes an appearance on screen.  The cars too are spectacular, although they are so overloaded with computer gizmos and jet propulsion devices that one begins to wonder if NASA itself didn't design and build them.<br/><br/>Had it been willing to forego the standard plot mechanics and been content to afford us a glimpse into the life of the street-racing culture, `The Fast and the Furious' might have ended up as a `classic' of youth action cinema. Instead, it becomes just another dumb movie with some really neat car chases."

Brian lacks any credibility as a law enforcement officer, as do his silly ""superiors,"" and his motivations for anything other than spending time with Mia are a mystery.

","Set in Los Angeles, The Fast and the Furious follows Paul Walker's character, an up-and-coming street racer whose cocky antics land him in a race he loses. After saving Dom (Vin Diesel), who is in charge of a small group of racers and owns a garage, the two become good friends. Paul Walker is actually an undercover cop trying to get evidence against these racers as many of them attack trucks on highways and steal their cargo.<br/><br/>What sounds like an exciting plot is ruined by lackluster pacing and, at least for me, a lack of excitement. Cars, guns, tits, a pointless shot of two girls kissing, beer. It's all the kind of things that fourteen year old boys tend to masturbate too. And that's not to say the film is childish (which, let's face it, it kind of is) but it is built to appeal to a crowd that I don't belong to. The actual racing of the film is drag racing, which does not translate to exciting pieces of action. Driving in a straight line toward a finish line and pressing a button for nitro is not fun to watch and I felt the opening drag race between Walker and Diesel had some pretty poor directing. It looked obviously sped up and I can understand it was done that way to actually allow us to see the cars, but it looks pretty stupid.<br/><br/>As far as characters go Brian O' Conner (Walker) is as boring as they get. The romance between himself and Dom's sister could be interesting for character interactions if the characters themselves were worth anything. Dom himself is cool if only because he's supposed to be. You can easily dismiss every character here as none are truly worth remembering.<br/><br/>And then there is the pacing I mentioned before. It starts off moving at a decent clip but slows dramatically in the middle. The final twenty minutes are a mishmash of endings with a climactic scene on the highway followed by a climactic chase through the streets of LA and finalized with a climactic (and pretty pointless) scene of drag racing. There are some loose ends that needed to be tied by the end, but it's done pretty poorly and doesn't feel organic. It just feels like the writer wanted to jump from here to here to here with nothing to lead to that next scene.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is pretty dumb and juvenile, with really nothing to offer aside from a few sweet cars. It's a lackluster film that you'd be best off watching on TV."

","The Fast and the Furious is decent but with flaws from director Rob Cohen whose admirable in making this movie about an undercover cop who infiltrates an underground subculture of street racers in Los Angeles. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Paul Walker, Vin Disiel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and Ted Levine but some of them (Yune and Levine to name a few) lack screen time. Ja Rule even makes a brief extended appearance but his character like others aren't in it that much to leave an impression. The racing sequences are intense but there's some you can tell is obviously CG which is okay because thats the only way they could ever show the characters going so fast in the movie. The action sequences are well executed but some of them can over the top at times. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either and there were some predictable things that happened. For those of you who have seen it you might know I'm talking about. If you're a fan of these type of films than you might like this one better than I did. Despite it's flaws though overall The Fast And The Furious isn't that bad it does have intense action/race sequences, some suspense, and good performances by the cast but the movie as a whole could have been better."

"poolandrews","6","2","6","25 December 2007"," ""If you want time buy the magazine."" Entertaining enough but rather shallow.
","The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles & starts as undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) enters an illegal street race between racers with high performance sports cars, he bets his $80,000 car that he'll win but instead loses. Suddenly the cops show up & he manages to save Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) from being arrested, Brian gains Dominic's trust in an attempt to use his knowledge & contacts to identify & take down a gang of street racers who are hijacking huge container trucks & stealing millions of dollars of electrical goods...<br/><br/>This American German co-production was directed by Rob Cohen who has a small cameo as the pizza delivery guy & is an entertaining action flick without ever reaching the heights of greatness. The script by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Bergquist & David Ayer moves along at a reasonable pace & has decent amounts of action but it never quite satisfied me totally in any area. The plot is predictable & pretty standard fare, the twists have little dramatic impact like the revelation that Brian is a cop or that Dominic is behind the hijackings. A lot more could have been done with them. I usually don't take the moral high ground but in the case of The Fast and the Furious I feel I have to considering the age group this will appeal too, I mean it turns the criminal element into hero's which didn't sit well with me especially at the end when the cop is more concerned about the scumbag hijackers than the poor innocent truck driver! This isn't as action packed as you might like either, sure there's a good opening street race through LA & some good stunts during the final hijack but otherwise it's all show & no substance, just like the cars featured in fact. There are plenty of scenes with high powered cars reeving their engines, plenty of scenes of nicely painted sports cars driving around & plenty of scenes of them breaking the speed limit but it doesn't really amount to much apart from the opening race & the final twenty minutes. The character's are OK if a bit clichéd (I mean Brian actually starts to respect Dominic after being around him for a while...), it keeps one interest & it certainly passes the time harmlessly enough without ever being outstanding.<br/><br/>Director Cohen does OK & turns in a suitably glossy looking film that will probably appeal to the boy racers out there as it glamorises the notion of street racing, winning at any costs & show's these souped up sports cars in as good a light as just about any film out there. The cars themselves look nice enough for sure & they are a pleasant distraction whenever on screen I suppose, at least they divert attention away from the acting. The film has some style about it for sure, the opening street race for instance when they reach top speeds the lights outside the windows blur into one long bright line & there are other tricks used as well to make a cool sequence. The violence is minimal so there's no need to worry about that.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $38,000,000 I wouldn't call The Fast and the Furious exactly low budget but it's not up there with the 100 million plus Hollywood blockbusters, making $40,000,000 on it's opening weekend in theatres it did really well & I think it was a bit of a surprise to everyone involved with it. It's well made with some decent CGI computer effects as well as some good old fashion stunt work. I must admit I didn't like the loud electronic dance type music though. The acting is not great, Vin Diesel was paid a cool $2,000,000 apparently & he's pretty poor, just check out his speech to Brian about his father! Jordana Brewster & Michelle Rodriguez provide the good looks & do a fine job.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a good solid action thriller, it's not that great in storytelling terms but I think it provides enough cool action, macho moments & fast cars to keep most quiet for 100 odd minutes. Followed by two sequels, 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) & The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) while a third sequel is currently in production."

","Despite some good action sequences - no, sorry, strike that - a good action sequence involving a bike/car chase toward the end of the movie, there's little to recommend ""The Fast and The Furious"" to anyone with a central nervous system.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel tries his best but his performance is lost among a tribe of glove puppets and stick figures. Paul Walker looks great but makes Josh Hartnett The Wooden Boy look like Laurence Olivier. Michelle Rodriguez scowls and pouts so much that she actually looks like a bulldog for most of the movie. Jordana Brewster gives Katy Holmes a run for her money in the WET AS FISH stakes and Rick Yune is woefully miscast as a villain. Yune looks even better than Paul Walker but has all the acting ability of a packing crate. He needs to spend more of that money he made being pretty on acting lessons.<br/><br/>Director Rob Cohen clearly hopes that layering on the surface glitz will distract an audience from the dull plot, thinly spread characterisation and unrealistic stunt driving in this movie. Well, he's wrong. If, however, you actually like video-game driving action, Mattel Hot Wheels and lots of barely-dressed girls draped over every available surface, this movie was created for you.<br/><br/>You sad, sad individual."

"SimonCornelis","9","1","2","31 July 2015"," Still the best of the bunch!
","So I finally got around to seeing the 7th movie in the immensely successful Fast & Furious franchise. I am a big fan of the entire franchise, and even though the latest part (Furious 7) currently gets the highest ratings out of all, the 1st is still my favorite. It has a certain charm that all the sequels lack. As a movie on it's own, much has been said before: The story is rather shallow, it has plot holes-a-plenty and the dialogue makes you cringe, but if you like fast cars and action, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Nothing new there. But I would like to point out why for me the original The Fast & The Furious is still the highlight of the franchise.<br/><br/>First of all, next to being a movie buff, I'm also very much a car guy, and from that point of view I can appreciate The Fast & The Furious' efforts to try and portray genuine car culture. An aspect that for me has really been missing from the later additions in the franchise. Admittedly for the car-tuning community this movie probably did more bad than good, and car enthusiasts love to rip on all the technical mistakes in this movie, but compared to the later F&F movies, this one actually does quite alright. For example, when Dom (Vin Diesel) shifts his car (a Mazda RX7) into gear at the start of the first race we get to see an elaborate CGI sequence that takes us through the entire drive train of the car. It's a fancy gimmick at first, but re-watching this sequence some time ago I noticed that the engine of the car didn't have pistons. Instead it has rotors. The filmmakers actually took the time to research the fact that RX7's are powered by rotary engines rather than your standard piston engine. We don't see this kind of attention to detail in the later movies and for all it's technical mistakes the 1st Fast & Furious also gets it right in many places.<br/><br/>But even apart from these technicalities, The Fast & The Furious has got more redeeming qualities. I find that the original Fast & Furious has the most believable characters compared to the other installments in the franchise. Here we have a group of high-school drop-outs, who grew up together doing their car-thing. They're clearly a close-knit group of friends (a family) kept together by Vin Diesel's leader/father figure. In this context Diesel's character and the entire ""I got family"" thing makes sense. This isn't so much the case in the later movies (especially 5, 6 and 7), where Dominic becomes this stuck-in-the-past guy going on and on about his so called ""family"" who are actually just a group of loosely associated characters that come together on occasion and then go their separate ways again. Don't get me wrong, the all-star ensemble is fun in the action-blockbuster franchise F&F has become now, but below the surface the original still provides most of the drive behind the characters 6 movies later.<br/><br/>In a similar way The Fast & The Furious has the best ""bad guys"" from the series as well. I always found Johnny Tran and his gang much more intriguing than any of the other bad boys in the sequels. In every other F&F film the crew rises up against some mafia figure (Verone, Braga, Reyes, etc.) who is evil for the sake of being evil, and who's ultimate downfall is always underestimating this crew of street racers because, you know, they're just street racers, right? It gets rather formulaic. Johnny Tran on the other hand isn't this ultimate bad guy. In fact his actions are rather well motivated. He's not even looking for trouble, like he says: ""You stay away, I stay away. Everybody stays happy"". But then this Torreto guy shows up in his turf again, some guy steals his engines, his whole family gets raided by the police, and to top it off he wins a pink slip fair and square, but the guy drives off. So he's righteously angry and retaliates. Johnny Tran has a reason to be the bad guy, unlike those in later installments.<br/><br/>Further more the dialogue is actually one thing that I like about this movie. For better or worse, this movie has become one of the most quoted movies among my friends and family. Like many have pointed out before, the dialogue (especially the tech-talk) isn't the best written, but unintentionally this also adds to the believability of the characters. Go to any car meeting and you're bound to hear guys talking like they know all about cars and engines, while in fact they don't. Just like Dom's infamous victory speech. A lot about this movie is all show and no go, but that's also very much the ""tuning"" scene it tries to portray, in such a way that by now this movie often feels like a time-document, an homage almost, to the ridiculous car-mod culture in those days.<br/><br/>Lastly I think The Fast & The Furious deserves a an extra credit for the original score by Brian Transeau (BT). He perfectly captures the atmosphere of the film with his scoring, particularly taking influence from his groundbreaking debut album ""Ima"". The later films lack this quality especially whenever ""Ludacris"" is involved and the entire soundtrack is full of cheesy pop-rap/club music that really doesn't fit the style of the movies at all.<br/><br/>So there you have it, 8/10 for the original Fast & Furious film. Well deserved and still the best of the bunch!"
"AdrianValOlonan","10","1","2","17 July 2015"," ""The Fast and the Furious"" is One Hell of a Thrill Ride!
","I've seen a compilation of the 1st-6th movies of the ""The Fast and the Furious"" film franchise and seeing ""Furious 7"" trailer on Youtube, and I think they're very great movies. Instead of seeing ""Furious 7"" on April, I decided to watch the earlier films and just catch up to the seventh movie. I'm kinda surprised that these movies began in 2001 until 2015 and counting, so this series is 14 years old. Buying the 6 DVDs is money very well spent! The awesomeness begins here!<br/><br/>Brian (Paul Walker) is an undercover cop who should investigate the illegal street racing, where Dominic (Vin Diesel) is a key person. Brian then establishes relationships among the people, especially to Dominic's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), and now finds himself in a middle of a crossroad. Will he perform his duty or will he choose the people who consider him a family?<br/><br/>I love the car races. Nice editing, good special effects (for Hollywood 2001), and fantastic soundtrack! I simply adore how this movie moves at lightning speed, thus living up to its title. The scenes will pump up your heart! Hell, yeah! The ending is obviously a cliffhanger, so expect a sequel. And if you're the type of person who stops watching during end credits, watch the credits and listen to the soundtrack. Trust me, okay?<br/><br/>I just learned that Walker passed away on November 2013 in a car accident. Rest in Peace, man. All my love and respect go for you."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","1","2","2 July 2015"," Aptly named
","I hadn't seen this since '01, and frankly I wasn't all that impressed at the time. So much so that I skipped 2 and 3, and watched 4 only because it had solid buzz. And then of course the franchise evolved from a 'Point Break' rip-off (and I mean beat for beat) with street racing substituted for surfing into Ocean's Eleven for the Red Bull generation. After enjoying the fifth one on DVD I actually caught the last two at the theater and had a blast both times. So with all that in mind, I revisited the original with some trepidation. How would a movie I obviously didn't care much for the first time hold up against its more popcorn-style sequels? The answer; surprisingly well. Though it lacks the over the top action of the more recent films, the movie itself moves along at a brisk clip. Diesel and Walker have really good chemistry, with the former really carrying the flick on his V-neck clad shoulders (much as his 'Point Break' counterpart Patrick Swayze did). Diesel's Dominic Toretto has become a rather somber, mumbly character of late, but here he's downright jaunty by comparison. I'm not afraid to say that Paul Walker was a ridiculously good looking man, and honestly that may have worked against him a bit. He never did get much respect for his acting, and while I wouldn't say he was exactly Brando, he did well when he was in his wheelhouse, and this is directly in said wheelhouse.<br/><br/>It's not going to win any awards for originality or brains, but like many of the films in this franchise, it's a lot of fun."

","Ever since the first Fast & Furious films came out, I never had a look at them like they're untouched new millennium movie gems. Back in April 2015, I've seen Fast & Furious 7 and instantly loved it so much that it's favourite movie of that year! When that movie became a monstrous box-office smash, I have planned to watch the whole franchise from the very beginning. With that said, It's time to review The Fast and the Furious, a solid start of the movie franchise ride!<br/><br/>In the movie, we have the legendary Paul Walker and Vin Diesel who both did fantastic performances throughout. I also have to mention that the variety of tuned cars in this movie is pretty unique. We have the Supra, the Civic and more which can be perfect for car lovers (like me). Speaking of cars, the car chases and races are quite fun to watch. Although there were less than I expect but it's still fitting. The music by BT is another thing that fits well in the movie, as well as the songs. They give us the music theme of tuned car racing. Finally, the pace is in an acceptable speed of over 100 mins, just the way I like it.<br/><br/>Now that I watched Fast & Furious 1 & 7, the journey goes on as we head on to 2 Fast 2 Furious! If you haven't seen the films and if you like to watch them, hop in the car and get ready to burn rubber!<br/><br/>Film Score: 8/10 - Great"

","I had never actually seen this movie. I had seen most of the second one (I found it OK) watched the third one (was bored to tears) and I lost interest in the franchise before I was dragged to see the 6th movie, which despite not knowing a lot of character development, I enjoyed.<br/><br/>However prior to the 7th movie being released, SkyMovies are showing all the movies, so I decided to see what I had missed out on!! <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: LA street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) falls under the suspicion of the LAPD for a string of high-speed electronics truck robberies. Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) an officer of the LAPD, joins the ranks of Toretto's highly skilled racing crew undercover to convict Toretto. However, O'Connor finds himself both enamored with this new world and in love with Toretto's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster) As a rival racing crew gains strength, O'Connor must decide where his loyalties really lie.<br/><br/>Although essentially ""Point Break"" with street racers instead of surfers, this is easily the best movie of the franchise (of the movies I have seen) not surprising with it being the first (they usually the best) As with ""Point Break"" the villain (Patrick Swayze in ""Point Break"") is much more interesting than the hero. Vin Diesel has charisma in spades, Paul Walker is likable and an attractive enough lead, Michelle Rodriguez is tough and sexy whilst Jordana Brewster is absolutely gorgeous. <br/><br/>The racing scenes and action set pieces are well directed, the dialogue is a bit weak and cliché at times but overall this is a lot of fun."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","2","13 January 2014"," The film that made a lot of actors popular
","Upon first reading the title, viewers would get the first impression that this film involves just racing cars. In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.<br/><br/>Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.<br/><br/>This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.<br/><br/>The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.<br/><br/>The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.<br/><br/>It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm."
"paulsrobinson","7","1","2","21 May 2013"," A good fast paced action film
","To go in and watch The Fast and Furious, it is a lesson in expectations as it is obviously not a masterpiece, and you should not expect it to be either. it does exactly what it says on the poster though and the film is fast and the action is furious.<br/><br/>The story of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is a undercover police officer. Trying to breaking on to the Street racing scene. Through Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) so he can bring down a crew who are hijacking trucks. The thing with the film is that in a lot of ways it is terrible. I'm not a Rob Cohen fan, of all his films this is probably the best of his work in my opinion and only challenged by 1996's Dragonheart. In acting terms Paul Walker is a good looking guy but lacks real acting talent and charisma on screen. Vin Diesel though does have good screen presence, and at times I think is an underrated actor. The supporting cast is generally OK except for the insufferable and thankfully only in it for a short period Ja Rule, and the definitely not very intimidating Reggie Lee as the main protagonists henchmen.<br/><br/>What is surprising and actually good about the film is that it does have a nice simple plot and develops the characters as we get to know about Dom's father and his childhood, and see Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) and Brian fall in love. The Car chases are decent and again are practical effects, which are better than CGI Green screen chases uses in some of the sequels. Praise also has to made of the final sequences involving the final hijacking, the chasing of some drive by shooters and the final race off. which were very thrilling and kept you on the edge of your seat until the end.<br/><br/>I can't say i love this film, because i don't. But i did like it and enjoyed the ride while it lasted."

The FBI sends LAPD officer Brian O'Conner undercover into Los Angeles' street racing circuit to take down Toretto and his team. As O'Conner becomes part of Toretto's life and gets involved with his sister, Mia, he tries to prove that Toretto is innocent.<br/><br/>TFaTF can be seen as a mindless popcorn flick. However, what puts TFaTF above mindless popcorn flicks is the fact that it has a brain which took me back by surprise. The film isn't only about street racing with hot lesbian girls and how much muscle your car has. There's actually a decent story in here! And this is the reason why I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Another thing that stuck out to me was the rare use of CGI. The car sequences in the film are extremely well done, mostly due to using practical effects rather than CGI. The scenes felt more real and gritty compared to action scenes in other films. The climax car sequence had me on the edge of my seats!<br/><br/>The performances by the cast members aren't half bad either. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker both pull off convincing roles. There's something about Diesel that is likable. I don't know what it is, though. I also liked Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez, who complete the clan. Overall, here's a mindless popcorn film that isn't at all that mindless and performances that aren't at all bad."

The fourth film wasn't great but the first film was the only one that I gave a thumbs up to. The original film was the best for many reasons.

","Even after two sequels, Fast and the Furious kept the racing genre very well alive in the 2000s. The film still retains much of the fast action, well paced storytelling and cheesy, yet clever, one-liners. As far as thrillers go, it's pretty hard to beat the botched hijacking scene for one and for Vin Diesel himself, still his best movie by far.<br/><br/>Brian seeks out Dominic Torreto. ""He likes the tuna,"" he says, at Toretto's restaurant but Brian lives a double life, and that role is quickly trying to find answers behind several truck hijackings before the truckers take the matters into their own hands.<br/><br/>Furious retains this stylish edge that many films lose over time. I also remain impressed with the total conviction behind Johnny Tran's words by Rick Yune. The movie remains an excellent example towards timing and editing and let's never forget the beauty of the cars and engines themselves. Fast and the Furious is everything you would want from a racing movie."
"MaxBorg89","8","1","2","19 November 2006"," Shallow as hell, but fun to watch
","If you watch The Fast and the Furious for the script and the acting, you will be disappointed. This movie has no intention of being a Michael Mann-like philosophical action movie. It's just a silly ride that will entertain for a couple of hours without any real emotional impact on the viewer. I knew this right from the start, which is why I enjoyed The Fast and the Furious.<br/><br/>Actually, I'm being a bit unfair, since there is one respectable performance in the film: Vin Diesel's career-making portrayal of Dominic Toretto, who is the undisputed king of L.A.'s illegal street racing. That is, until a cocky guy named Brian (Paul Walker) shows up to challenge him. Naturally, Dom wins, but in the meantime he's made friends with the newcomer, who saves his life when the cops show up.<br/><br/>As we learn soon after-wards, though, it's all a set-up: Brian is a cop himself, going undercover to find out whether Dom is involved in a series of truck hijackings.<br/><br/>In the hands of a better director, the movie could have been an interesting character study, with the addition of a few mandatory action sequences. Rob Cohen, however, treats the script like an excuse to stage a bunch of visually spectacular race scenes. Those scenes, as well as Diesel's charismatic presence, make The Fast and the Furious fun enough to watch, but not good enough to remember. In fact, there aren't enough elements to justify the film's transformation into a franchise. But focusing on these aspects is pointless: just take the movie for what it is (a good-looking, if shallow summer blockbuster) and enjoy it. Otherwise, watch something better.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","This just shows that there is almost nothing good coming out of Hollywood these days. This movie is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. The people who made this movie must have been thinking, ""hmmm, if we put a few nice cars and Vin Diesel in a movie we're going to have a hit!"" For one thing Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors to ever walk the face of the earth. Another thing, anyone who watches a movie just to see some nice cars needs to be shot. There really was no story. There was nothing going on. Just car races and stunts.

Yes those aforementioned elements are addressed much to the appreciation of the film's target audience I'm sure but Vin Disel and especially Paul Walker's charisma made their characters very interesting and even sympathetic. I actually cared about their fates. The rest of the supporting cast also complemented the leads nicely, especially Rick Yune (Die Another Day). I'm not really that fascinated by cars (I think they are noisy and pollutive) but this introduction to the street racing sub-culture was informative.

","THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS **<br/><br/>Action aficionados look out, because if you want a movie with limited plot to get in the way of some rip roaring cars then this is the film for you. Succinctly put, Paul Walker plays a cop who has to go undercover to infiltrate a gang of illegal car racers and must get into their circle of friends to find out their illegal activities.  Diesel is the leader of such a group and together they become friends.  A moral dilemma story; I think not.  What you get is an excuse to see the fastest turbo boosted cars on the market with some feisty women to boot.  Some sequences may get the blood pumping and the constant bumping soundtrack will leave you thinking that you've just participated in such an illegal street race yourself. <br/><br/>
The acting is wooden and Diesel just portrays...well Diesel.  He stands there looking angry and mean and doesn't really do anything.  There's a love story to boot, but the emphasis is firmly on the street races and how, rather unfairly, they can easily avoid the dumb police who seem intent in every movie in crashing into each other and generally looking foolish in pursuit of criminals."
"Spleen","Null","1","2","1 March 2002"," I blame the sound
","Too loud.  Any time there's a car (or motorbike) moving anywhere in the frame, we have to listen to a teeth-splintering metallic roar which doesn't get any louder or quieter - it just is.  Like the people who provided the hideous music and rap chanting that makes up the soundtrack most of the rest of the time, the sound effects guys don't seem to understand that the value of dynamic contrast: if the roar of acceleration is preceded by silence, we FEEL the acceleration.  If it's always that loud we just feel a mild throbbing pain around the ears.<br/><br/>Most of the speeding footage (there are one or two visual conceits that come off, and that final, utterly unmotivated chase towards the end is, I'll admit, exhilarating) is also all wrong.  It's the modern vice: cut, cut, cut.  If only the director had been willing to see just one of his shots through to the end.  The computer-generated footage of car engines doesn't help, either.<br/><br/>-Oh, and the story is one of the most ludicrous I've ever encountered (sample: the roadsters who rob trucks, when they operate at night, are covered from head to toe so that they won't be recognised; when breaking the law in broad daylight, they scarcely wear anything, presumably because they want to be recognised by the audience) ... and I wanted to like the story, I really did.  I even thought the basic situation was promising - as was the look and feel of the world in which the hero found himself.  (Cinematography is excellent.)  But the plotting is irredeemably silly, and what's worse, it gets in the way of the racing and the hotrod ambience and the views of Michelle Rodriguez and whatever else we were supposed to be looking at - just as they get in the way of the plotting."
"tomchiz318","10","1","2","4 January 2002"," Fast and furious all the way
","PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE FILM, THE ENDING IS REVEALED IN THIS COMMENT...<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious, the underground sleeper hit of 2001. Not everybody saw it, but most of those who did see it loved it. Starring Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Connor, and the sexy Jordana Brewster as Dominic's sister Mia, it centres around the escapades of Dominic and his ""team"" of car enthusiasts, who fix up cars when not racing them at breakneck speeds down a Â¼ mile stretch of road. Gone are the American muscle cars such as the Viper and the Corvette, replaced by the computer chipped, NOS screaming Japanese super cars, like the Toyota Supra, Honda Civic, and Nissan Skyline. Such beautiful cars blend well with the great cast, as they are as much part of the film as the actors are. The amount of camera time they are given is just enough to show you how powerful and brilliant the cars are, but not too much to suggest they're only there for advertising sakes (like the ridiculous amount of screen time given to the Fed-Ex label in Castaway (2000), which spoils the film). Vin Diesel lives the part of Dominic, a brilliant driver who ""lives his life a quarter of a mile at a time"". His performance is as beefy as you'd expect from the actor who played killer Richard B Riddick in the 2000 hit Pitch Black. He delivers his lines with a style that suggests his character; a nice person when not racing, but deadly serious and all for himself when strapped into his vehicle. Paul Walker is just as good as the undercover cop Brian, hoping to pin a serious of jaw dropping robberies to Dominic. As he learns more about Dom and his team, he falls for Mia, also a great driver, and the lifestyle of fast cars, guns and women. As the film gets near it's amazing climax he struggles to keep his mind on why he's here; to catch Dominic Toretto and put him behind bars. But as they grow closer to each other it gets harder for Brian to do so. Anyone who loved the high speed chases in Ronin, The French Connection, or Bullit, will love the stunts in The Fast and the Furious. From the opening attack on the lorry, with the three sexy Civic's floating on their green neon light as they swerve and cruise around the truck, to the first race and the last race, the action is filmed so cleverly it seems impossible that cars could do what they did. The Civic that slides under the lorry as they speed down the motorway in the pre-credit sequence is simply amazing, and the adrenaline buzz from the first time Dominic and Brian race is great. It all flows so seamlessly between the racing, the stealing, and the normal life of the characters that you don't know what to expect right up until the end. The final scene, however, is outstanding. When Dominic tells Brian midway through the movie about the car he and his father built, a 1969 Dodge Charger with ""900 horses of power"", it's presence is overwhelming, and when he says he's never driven it because ""it scares the shit outta me"", your spine tingles. Dom then pulls it up to the start line he used to race on. He and Brian (driving a Supra) both await the green light, and when it arrives, and Dominic floors the throttle, the car pulls up violently and makes more noise than the cinema could handle, as it screamed off down the road at a shattering speed. But as they get toward the end, the movie stopped for a split second. If Dominic hit the train, and died, then it would become a bad ending to a good film. Neither hit the train, but then Dominic smashes into a truck and flies into the air. Again, if he had died it would be a bad ending, but he did not. The final choice, which fell to Brian as the police sirens got louder, was whether to let Dom go. He does, telling him ""I owe you a 10 second car"", and signifies a great ending to a brilliant film. From start to finish The Fast and the Furious is a NOS powered adrenaline rush, with beautiful actors, scenery, and even more beautiful cars. The start of the final race will live in my memory for a long time still."

Second, anyone that puts Ja Rule in their movie isn't actually looking to make something worthwhile, but rather looking to draw as many young kids in, as possible without any effort at filmmaking. The mass public that is teenagers, which have no taste in movies whatsoever, will enjoy it because it has fast cars, hot chicks, and half-ass rappers. This is what films have come to these days. Put some fresh faces and maybe a ""rapper"" (i use that term loosely) or 2, add some lame scenarios and the usual action elements, and come out with a totally uninspiring and predictable film.<br/><br/>I'd say more but I've already wasted too much breath on this horrid film."

I thought this movie deserved 2 thumbs up because it was interesting and theres lots of action pack in it. I liked this movie alot because it gives you a look and feeling how it is like to race and to have people race against you. I especially liked how they made a movie only about street racing. I would rate it 10 out of 10 because it has alot of action pack and it doesnt take awhile before the movie gets into the action, in this movie it starts right away. I think whoever loves old or fancy and fast cars will love this movie and i loved all the cars in this movie especially the black car in the end.(the one vin disel was driving)"
"Rextacy","10","1","2","24 September 2001"," Great film for what it was
","Sometimes I'm constantly amazed to read reviews by people who have so obviously gone to a movie they either didn't want to watch or knew wouldn't really interest them. To these people, I say give your money to charity or something, I've never understood those people who have so little to do in their life that they go and see every movie ever made then complain about 90% of them. Life is like that, I happen to think Star Wars sucks, so when a new Star Wars movie comes out, you know what?! I DON'T go and see it!<br/><br/> TF&TF is like this. For those who enjoy cars...no let me rephrase that, for those who love cars, this is a great film. It really makes ""Gone in 60 seconds"" look like an excuse of a car film - they raid a Ferrari garage and we see about 5 seconds of actual DRIVING? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING! Not so in The Fast and The Furious, thankfully. The riced out cars may not be to everyone's tastes, but owning a powerful turbo vehicle myself, they actually captured my imagination with the audio - the vehicles sounded immaculate with audible induction noise, blow off valves and sweet exhaust notes throughout the movie. The black muscle-car near the end of the movie absolutely thundered in Dolby delight in my cinema, and was awe inspiring. With a decent home theatre setup at home, not much impresses me these days but I was blown away by the audio at most times in this film. It reminded me why I still bother going to the cinema.<br/><br/> Visually the movie was fine, the stunts were well executed and the camera angles engaging. You don't go to an action movie to see involving dialog, you go to remove yourself from reality and have a damn good time doing it, and I felt TF&TF did this well. The fact it was about a subject close to my heart (cars) just added to my personal like for the film. My wife, who dislikes a lot of films I enjoy, also loved the film - which surprised me seeing it was so obviously a male oriented film.<br/><br/> Yes the plot was a bit weak, the dialog a bit shabby at times, and the acting a bit forced. The corny ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" was almost laughable, but taken in context was bearable. But at the end of the day, this was a fantastic movie for car freaks - the same crowd who will spend $50 on specialised videos JUST about cars, with no plot, no Dolby surround, no multi-million dollar budget. If you take this movie for what it is, a fast action romp around the car racing scene, then it does its job admirably IMHO. I think those thoughts are backed up by the huge haul it has done at the box office, and I'm even thinking of seeing it again, something I've not done since I was a stupid teenager :)<br/><br/> Go see it, and grab it on DVD - I know I will."

Granted, the script ignores logic and reality at regular intervals, but the stakes are reasonably low and the stuntwork usually seems to exist in the real world. Ardent fans of shiny cars and street racing will probably enjoy it to some degree; for anyone else, it's no better than a way to kill time and appreciate the absence of Tyrese Gibson's witless-cisms.

Before Hollywood took it and threw into unrealistic scenarios and laughable over the top action sequences.</li><li>This movie at its core is about friendship and the close bonds the main characters hold for one another. Lengths a person will go to for those they love.</li><li>It keeps things simple, street racing, robbery, fist fights and racial feuds. Why do audiences need cars jumping from high rise to high rise and over the top villains with pointless back stories and agenda's?</li></ul><br/><br/>It's realistic (to a degree) has impressive actor chemistry, makes you care for the characters and their close bonds.

You really don't need more to create a great film, if written and executed correctly.<br/><br/>On a side note I will say, at this time of his career, Paul Walker, cannot act. Thankfully he improved on his talents as he worked in the series more and more.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","3","4 June 2017"," How it all began
","""The Fast and the Furious"" is an American movie from 2001, so this one had its 15th anniversary already last year. It runs for 105 minutes roughly and the script was developed overall by no less than 4 writers, the most known one being David Ayer I guess. The director is Rob Cohen and this is probably still the most known effort from his career. He never returned to direct any other of this franchise's films. And now I said it already that this action movie we have here is the very first from the extremely long-running F&F franchise that is still very strong today. Eight films have been there so far and two more are already greenlit. The franchise seems unstoppable as even the death of number 1 lead actor (at least in this film we have here) Paul Walker did not put an end to the series. But we don't wanna talk about his tragic fate today, but instead focus on this film we have here. Tragic, or at least sad, is also a fitting description for the film I would say as I was not convinced by anything in here really apart from the effects perhaps. People often say that this is a movie for men, but if you take a look at the demographics here you will realize that women have actually given it an 0.3 higher rating, which of course also has to do with the quantity of voters. But still, saying this is a film for men is is pretty inaccurate in my opinion as it would imply that men have worse taste in film than women because honestly there is nothing impressive at all about the story here, the character writing and also the performances.<br/><br/>I believe that in terms of depth, the story could have fit in under one hour as well. The rest is mostly ""cool"" quotes that add nothing really, gimmicky behavior from the characters and then of course the pompous action scenes that turn this film into a definite case of style over substance. The core story of a cop infiltrating a gang of very fast drivers in order to get evidence on illegal activities is nothing that hasn't been done before and frequently better. If you read the actors' names, you also know that honestly you can't expect any powerhouse performances in here. It is all subordinated to the visual side and with the casting they absolutely made sure none of the cast members is going to take any attention away from that. The epilogue is probably even more embarrassing than the rest and honestly, having seen none of the many many sequels, I truly hope they managed to step things up and give audiences more than pointlessly spectacular car sequences and when they had enough of that, they switched to motorbikes and even helicopters. With films like this, there is of course always the opportunity for pointless fun, but this requires the film to not take itself as seriously as this one here did on several occasions. I give it a thumbs-down and like I said: If the following films don't show improvement, then I probably cannot be as generous as I was here with my 4/10 rating. Watch something else instead."
"BA_Harrison","7","1","3","25 July 2015"," The start of Universal's biggest franchise to date.
","A slick, adrenaline-fuelled action flick featuring a hot cast, a cool soundtrack, and countless custom cars, The Fast and the Furious is designed primarily to appeal to the young petrol-head crowd—those who would spend a fortune on a sound system for their ride and then blast crap music out of the windows while sat in a McDonald's car park (at least here in the UK). Anyone heavily into car culture will probably wet themselves in excitement over the modified machines on display.<br/><br/>But even if the idea of highly-polished Japanese street cars with more expensive accessories than a Kardashian doesn't get your pistons pumping, there's always the human eye-candy: for the ladies, there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Paul Walker and bald bit of rough Vin Diesel, while the guys get numerous tasty young women to ogle, including Jordana Brewster as Vin Diesel's younger sister and Michelle Rodriguez as feisty girl-racer Letty. We also get lots of impressive stunts to keep the pulse pounding, with a great chase scene featuring one character dangling from a truck cab while being shot at by the driver, and a white-knuckle jump across railway tracks in front of an oncoming train that results in a spectacular crash."

","The Fast and the Furious (2001): Dir: Rob Cohen / Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Rick Yune: Stupid action farce that made me furious very fast. Paul Walker plays an undercover cop out to expose illegal drag races. They hijack trucks by surrounding their target and harpooning their way inside. Police fear that the truckers will arm themselves. Walker is unwelcome at a hangout since the waitress shows him more respect. She is sister to star racer Vin Diesel who seems unfazed at the violent commotion. Walker wins Diesel's trust in a crucial moment. Disturbing film where law can be broken pending on who you know on the police force. Director Rob Cohen keeps the action at fast pace. This is a much different film from his previous, which includes Dragonheart and Daylight. Diesel is the so-called hero who will win over the mostly young male audience and get rewarded for his reckless lifestyle. Walker is total cardboard who will eventually be found out yet be the good guy to the bad guys. Jordana Brewster as Diesel's sister is there to sleep with Walker. Michelle Rodriguez also makes a wasted appearance. Smokey and the Bandit is much more entertaining and contains just as much nonsense. The difference is that the characters are more interesting.

"policy134","3","1","3","4 July 2015"," I am getting old
","Awful, awful. I avoided seeing any of the Furious movies for over a decade and maybe it was because of the teaser trailer. Maybe it was because it didn't show anything about what the movie was about or maybe it was because the movie itself wasn't aimed at me as an audience. I was almost thirty at the time, but I have enjoyed other movies that were not aimed at my age group like the first Spiderman movie which was released around the same time.<br/><br/>What I dislike about the first movie is the stupid dialogue. Yeah, yeah. I know it has something to say about loyalty and whatever but mostly sounds like it was written by a 13-year old. Spiderman was goofy in places but there is a weird kind of tone throughout this, especially in the scenes between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.<br/><br/>There is one particular scene that I didn't get for the life of me. Diesel's thuggish best friend accuses Walker of being a cop and the two of them is ready to kill Walker, but the scene ends without a payoff what so ever. It just cuts to the next scene. What the f...! The friend does inspire one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing. The friend is about to cause trouble because he is incensed that Walker has been accepted so easily by Torreto (Diesel's name in the flick). Diesel loses his temper and says something like: ""I didn't know you either and accepted you"". The friend then replies: ""We were 3, you idiot"". Priceless, even though it's not totally verbatim. I honestly can't remember if I reversed the dialogue, but it is still funny as hell.<br/><br/>One more scene I have to mention which is unintentionally hilarious. Walker blows his pistons in the first race. Diesel says something like: ""Oh, we better get that repaired"". The car is steaming and 2 seconds later Walker's car is fine to drive. What did they do? Just throw the pistons in the hood and they magically attached and worked perfectly. Granted, I am not a mechanic but I know a car that has lost its pistons need more work than that. Then there is a guy who says: Cops are coming! Walker and Diesel flees in separate cars and for a very flimsy reason, Diesel decides to park in a garage and just slowly stroll down the street (check out the directors commentary).l The cops spot him and Walker picks him up (of course in the magically reconstructed car).<br/><br/>I know I am not supposed to nitpick at plot points like this but they are so obvious here. The races are few and far between which is another problem and they are hard to follow. One thing you could see is the lever that activates the nitrous oxide conveniently labeled ""NOS"". Again, hilarious.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other problems with the movie but let's just say I was thoroughly underwhelmed. I knew I was not supposed to see a piece of high art but come on; some b-movies make ten times more sense than this. I was also shocked to find out that Roger Ebert actually liked this and gave it three stars. He attacked films that had much better dialogue and plot developments than this. Maybe his illness was getting to him at that point, but I don't think so.<br/><br/>I know my commentary is a little long and perhaps a bit unfair because there are some good elements in the show. A sensational car chase at the end and the best part, Paul Walker, as I am saddened by his death. He could have done so much more than these picture and if you saw one of his first roles in Pleasantville you saw real potential. He looked a lot like a young Paul Newman and could have followed his path which makes his death even sadder. I guess the money eased his pain, though.<br/><br/>Note: Do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary. Not only is it hilarious but makes you understand the film a whole lot better. I changed my opinion from this being a terrible movie to a terrible movie with some good elements, if that has any relevance to anyone at all."

","Over the years, I ignored the hype about the Fast and the Furious franchise, until the 7th film came out and I thought to myself that it's about time I got caught up with the series. So I went back to the original Fast and the Furious from 2001, which I originally catch glimpses of when I was 8 years old, but I remember the plot being too complicated for me to follow so I didn't enjoy it as much.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious lives up to its namesake. Fast cars and furious action that has spurred the cult following for the past 14 years. Aside from the souped-up cars and racing scenes with no seemingly no real purpose, the plot is dry with many loopholes. This film is not for the serious and critical movie goer, it is the typical man movie. I can see why it has earned itself such a following over the years, but this movie wasn't my cup of tea. I've been told the 2nd movie is a lot better, so I remain hopeful."

","Brian O'Connor goes undercover as Brian Spillman to try and infiltrate an underworld of street racers lead by Dominic Toretto. He earns the trust of Dominic, falls in love with Dominic's sister Mia, but Brian might have to put all that aside to do the job he was hired to do. OK. I'll fully admit this isn't anything thought provoking. But it isn't trying to be! Does it lack substance? Of course it does, Sherlock! What do people honestly expect when it comes to these movies, Schindler's List? i think you may need to straighten out your priorities. This doesn't try to be anything more than a enjoyably big budgeted B movie, and that's exactly what it is. It is filled with hot chicks, fast cars, heavy metal & rap songs, and impressive stunts. The most entertaining thing, aside from the action scenes is the chemistry between Paul Walker & Vin Diesel. It is the main cog that keeps this movie going. The acting won't win any academy awards, but they are enjoyable. Paul Walker had really become a solid actor over the years. He was amazing in Running Scared. I genuinely like Walker. Honestly, he isn't at his best here. For half of the film, he is far too mechanical with his surroundings. I know that was part of his character, but he doesn't really show off the talent he has until the finale when things get hectic. He is very good in the final 20 minutes, but his performance is very forgettable as a whole. I know Vin Diesel gets a lot of flack, but I dug him. His macho routine was very enjoyable. He'll never be considered a great actor, but he has charisma in spades. He has one great scene where he realizes Brian is an undercover cop. Jordanna Brewster is rather bland as Walker's love interest. She has moments of great work, but not enough of them. Michelle Rodriguez does her bitchy routine again, and glares a lot. She was alright. Matt Schuzle annoyed the crap out of me as Vince. He acted like a petulant 5 year old. The Finale is great stuff, loaded with emotional scenes, and heart pounding action. The showdown between Walker & Diesel is memorable. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS* I have mixed feelings on the ending. I like that Brian had so much respect for Dominic that he let him go, but it felt a little contrived as well. It made sense, considering the friendship they built up, but it also felt like an excuse to continue the franchise, even if Vin didn't return fully until part 4. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I enjoy it, sue me. It isn't art or anything like that, but I can't deny how entertaining it is. I say give it a break, and check it out. Kick your brain to the curb, and enjoy! <br/><br/>7/10"
"jaredmobarak","4","1","3","12 July 2009"," I smell skanks  The Fast and the Furious
","Ah, The Fast and the Furious, the film that launched the careers of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and, for all intents and purposes, Michelle Rodriguez, (yes she starred in Girlfight previously). This foursome was so hot after this movie that some of them couldn't demean themselves by starring in the sequel. Poor them as, just a short eight years later, they all jumped at the opportunity to reunite with fast cars in the fourth installment. Oh how the mighty fall, especially when they weren't too mighty in the first place. I had my own preconceptions about this popcorn flick, virtually making me never want to take a chance on it at all. I thought the acting would be amateurish and campy, the story ludicrously absurd, and the cheese factor too high to overcome. Well, after finally sitting down to check it out I realized that I was clairvoyant. I wanted to at least have fun, and for a couple moments I did, but overall this Rob Cohen disaster is a throwaway that only shows how influential teenage boys are in the Hollywood spectrum. How else could we have three theatrically released sequels to what could be a made-for-TV movie at best? I see the similarities to Point Break, as my friend told me existed. It even goes to the point where if I closed my eyes I could have believed Paul Walker was Keanu Reeves. Where this film goes wrong, though, is by having Brewster's character involved, taking Walker's love away from Diesel. What works so well in the before-mentioned Kathryn Bigelow film is that there is more than just allusions to a man-crush between Reeves and Patrick Swayze. That dynamic doesn't quite exist here. Walker's Spilner/O'Connor may respect Diesel's Toretto, but he never idolizes the man. He sees a misguided soul that watched as his father burned to death on the racetrack, he sees a man who is nothing without his sister and racing team—his own makeshift family. Whether it is Toretto who is behind the truck-jacking or not, Walker is only staying close to find out, and get with Brewster's Mia of course.<br/><br/>Speaking of the truck-jacking, is it just me or is that opening scene completely out-of-place? The film begins with four Hondas harassing a trucker, taking the driver out and, I guess, stealing the shipment. The cut is so abrupt that you never do find out what they do with the cargo, if anything. In fact, having the next scene in daylight with Walker, I thought maybe he was involved already, waiting for the criminals to meet up with him. Instead, he just floors his car, swears, and is all of a sudden at Mia's diner. It is so discombobulating that I seriously wanted to just turn it off. Only when Walker goes back to work at Harry's do we find out why he swore driving, and it's even longer until we find out where the trucks come into play. But this isn't trying to win awards for storytelling, it's just doing its best to entertain and titillate. Unfortunately, it did very little of either.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty horrid across the board with Rodriguez probably the best of the four in a limited role. I didn't mind Diesel too much, the guy has charisma, but Walker's Keanu-speak was distracting because I don't remember him ever talking like that in other films. And when the cast is rounded off by stilted delivery from Rick Yune, Ja Rule, and Matt Schulze—the moment when Brewster asks Walker out and Schulze elbows the wall in anger made me laugh—you know you shouldn't be expecting very much else. Although, Chad Lindberg, as the whiz-kid engine technician, showed a lot of promise. I guess even the most asinine of films has a diamond in the rough somewhere.<br/><br/>If anyone reading this has wanted to see it, don't let me stop you. I'm the first to admit that I have never seen the appeal of cars, either in their speed or in their look. The Fast and the Furious is all about the cars, so it had a pretty large strike against it from the beginning. I also don't particularly care for action films devoid of a strong story. That said, however, I had a fun time with the trucker's revenge sequence at the end watching Diesel attempt to save Schulze. It all kind of gets ruined with Vin's ""anger"" afterwards and his blind rage for payback against Yune's Johnny Tran, but at least one high-octane moment kept my interest. It's a good thing too because the ending is as abrupt as the start, answering all questions about where our two leads' relationship will go with wordless looks and nods. These two understand each other; they are kindred spirits who have opened their souls. One is a hardened criminal and the other an undercover cop, both with the streets to unite them. No loose ends are sealed and the fate of many is left unanswered. I'd love to see how Walker explains who was stealing the electronic equipment to his superiors. The filmmakers probably never thought a sequel would be imagined and felt pretending it didn't matter would be enough."

","Not surprisingly, plot takes a back seat to action in ""Dragonheart"" director Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious,"" with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Paul Walker, and Matt Schulze. This cinematically souped-up, hot rod retread of ""Point Break"" (1987) with illegal street racing instead of skydiving and surfing qualifies as an entertaining but amoral thriller with enough action to satisfy the most attention-deficit viewer.<br/><br/>A white LAPD rookie cop who wants a detective's shield goes undercover in to crack down on a ring of daredevil truck hijackers. Gritty performances from a credible ensemble cast topped off with gripping, high-velocity races that smoke ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Driven"" offset this fast-paced but formulaic anthology of clichés that masquerades as a plot. Once upon a time, Hollywood designed movies as morality plays, rewarding good and punishing evil. Those conventional rules no longer apply in our enlightened liberal 21st century. Nowadays, villains stand a better-than-average chance of escaping the consequences of their skullduggery.<br/><br/>At least, ""The Fast and the Furious"" differs from the usual summer tripe, because it ushers audiences into another world where rival Los Angeles youth gangs race nitrous oxide-powered illegal street roadsters with computer-controlled fuel injection systems. Scenarists Gary Scott Thompson of ""Hollow Man,"" freshman writer Erick Bergquist, John Pogue of ""U.S. Marshals,"" and David Ayer of ""U-571"" based their preposterous but unpredictable screenplay on Ken Li's ""Vibe"" magazine article.<br/><br/>The twentysomething protagonists in ""The Fast and the Furious"" go to elaborate lengths to close down quarter-mile stretches of roads to drag race in the nocturnal urban landscape. They post sentinels to monitor the local authorities on scanners so that they can evade detection from the police and drive like hellions. Indeed, this kind of thing really happens. Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (brawny Vin Diesel of ""Saving Private Ryan"") reigns as the underworld king of dragsters. ""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time,"" this hard-bitten, existential felon confides in Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""The Skulls""), ""and for those ten seconds, I'm free."" Brian races against Dom, but he loses. Later, he rescues Dom conveniently when the LAPD arrests fleeing hot rodders from a drag race. Luckily, our hero finds himself on the inside track with the suspects. Dom's childhood buddy Vince (Matt Schulze of ""Blade"") accuses Brian of being a cop. When Dom asks Brian, our hero deftly sidesteps the question. No sooner has Brian ingratiated himself with Dom than he finds himself infatuated with the prime suspect's sexy kid sister Mia (Jordana Brewster of ""The Faculty"") and plumbs her for information. Eventually, Mia breaks down and fesses up to Brian, but not before the villains stage one final hijacking. Brian and Mia race off to stop them before it is too late.<br/><br/>Americans worship rebels, and these charismatic hot rodders attain larger-than-life, heroic stature in ""The Fast and the Furious."" Not only does this actioneer deliberately flaunt the law with an out-of-the-blue surprise ending, but the filmmakers also invite negative charges for glorifying the reckless shenanigans of their ultra-cool, anti-establishment dragsters. The chief offending scene depicts a dangerous game of chicken between the hero and villain to see who can beat a train across an intersection and survive.<br/><br/>Altogether, the testosterone-fueled, adrenaline-laced races make ""The Fast and the Furious"" worth strapping yourself in for if your summer appears to be heading for the doldrums. The sequels ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" and ""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" were average, but the protagonists from the original would not regroup until 2009's third sequel ""Fast and Furious"" with Vin Diesel and Paul Walker working hand in hand to bust a notorious drug dealer. The special effects shots when the car engines receive their jolts of nitrous oxide are imaginative. Brian O'Connor's boss is played by none other than ""Silence of the Lambs"" serial killer Ted Levine. Director Rob Cohen has a cameo as a pizza delivery driver and producer Neal H. Moritz cruises through one scene in a Ferrari."

","Fast cars. Big engines. Big Egos. High velocity action. Michelle Rodriguez. Definitely one of my favourite films based on these factors. TFATF is a high velocity action packed street-racing movie with a simple plot. the story is cliché ridden but it works well incorporating the street-racing aspect and its characters into it. Although to film critics the film is just a mindless street racing movie with a back-story that was made to entertain audiences under the age of 25. Though it is true that the movie draws its audience through the street-racing aspect.<br/><br/>The film is not a cinematic classic, however it cannot be placed as another Gone in 60 Seconds because the two movies are not the same. Although both centred around high powered cars, their plots are significantly different. The plot of TFATF is simple and cliché along with some of the dialogue but it delivers on thrills and high intensity stunts. It falls nothing short of hitting the audience with fast cars, sexy women and heart-pounding stunts.<br/><br/>The film can appeal to both male and female audiences; sexy women and fast cars for the guys and the motorheads; and the muscle-bound, action-heroism of Vin Diesel for the ladies.<br/><br/>Despite the plot somewhat lacking any depth or complexity, the movie is successful in drawing its target audience of under 25's and proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster smash.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","There's one thing that's always bugged me about this movie: that it's not what everyone who hasn't seen it thinks it is. For whatever reason, there had to be a tacked-on crime story, the whole subplot with Johnny Tran (he should've had a separate movie, and it's a shame that the amazing motorcycle stuntwork is now completely forgotten), and lots of interesting but generally uncohesive exposition about Dominic Toretto. In fact, you could compare this movie to a ""ricer"", with lots of bits that look cool but don't add anything.<br/><br/>If you want action, you got it. The racing is always exciting (well, as exciting as going in a straight line can be), the trailer hijackings need to be seen to be believed, and of course, I loved the motorcycle chase at the end. But I wanted a movie about street racing. STREET RACING, not cops or crime families or vendettas or divided loyalties or love triangles or any of that meaningless junk. A good screenwriter could make a movie about racing work. As it is, we're left with a fairly generic action movie that's a notch above average."

And Diesel has a certain . . . charisma, even when I don't quite get the game. <br/><br/>But I just didn't get it. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the genre. Maybe if I was, it would have seemed more coherent, instead of a of ""day in the life"" mojo. <br/><br/>There were too many characters, too many wandering subplots, too many moments where I was going ""huh?"" And then not really caring. <br/><br/>I did like that the two major female characters weren't ditzes or helpless. The girlfriend even throws one of the best punches in the film, even though her apparent age did get close to my squick line. But good grief, you've got Vin Diesel, and the only real fight scene he's in, he's hitting someone who's already down? Maybe it's 'cause I know him through Pitch Black/ Chronicles of Riddick, but I want superhero (okay, super anti-hero) stuff. I want him in real fights. I want preternatural. <br/><br/>The movie might have been better if it had been more violent, more sexual. Or it might have been better if it had had a tighter plot. Or it might have been better with more things blowing up. Mmm, explosions. As it was, it was fine. But I don't think I'll be watching it again."

I liked all the action, thrills and I liked the car chasing scenes in this action packed adventure. The movie is about a guy named Brian (Paul Walker) who is a detective who is undercover and blinding in with street racer groups to catch the bad guys. So while he is on the case he joins up with Dominic (Vin Diesel) who is one the best street racers and together they bring the bad guys down! The best chasing scene is the one where after they are street racing Dominic gets chased by the cops and ditches them. I really thought the car the Vin Diesel drove was really cool. The one he drives at the end of the movie kind of look liked the car he drove in the movie XXX. But it was a big shame that Vin Diesel wasn't in the sequel but he wasn't able to be in the sequel due to the fact that he was busy with a different movie at the time when 2 Fast 2 Furious was in either pre-production or post-production. But at least Paul Walker returned for the sequel. This would be a movie I would recommend to car racing fans."

","Completely empty and annoying flick made primarily for teenage boys and men who never totally grow up. ""The Fast and the Furious"" is a headache waiting to happen as undercover cop Paul Walker starts to rub shoulders with a Los Angeles street gang led by Vin Diesel (who has about as much acting ability as a cardboard cut-out). Diesel and his gang (which includes younger sister Jordana Brewster and girlfriend Michelle Rodriguez) are road pirates who hijack trucks in California and Arizona. They go after electronics equipment that they can sell to other street gangs around the city. So many missed opportunities hurt ""The Fast and the Furious"". There is a possible bond between Diesel and Walker ala that of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino in ""Heat"", but that never does get much time because the film-makers are too busy showing off hot cars and hotter women. The movie is totally void of intelligence and its heart is as black as tar. As loud and as flashy as the production makes itself out to be, it is still amazing that in the end ""The Fast the Furious"" is really a somewhat boring experience. Rapper Ja Rule does the music here and makes a short cameo as a street racer who has the need for speed. 2 stars out of 5."

","A boring Friday night with nothing on normal steam-powered telly so I part with three pounds and fifty pence to watch ""The Fast and The Furious"" on digital pay-per-view.<br/><br/>After it was all over the only positive thoughts in my mind was that enduring the movie 'on-demand' I had saved myself at least a tenner and had no physical evidence to dispose of in the local landfill. I had spotted this film on a supermarket shelf when it entered the DVD charts (early 2002) and I was tempted to buy. Yup I was nearly suckered by the hype about car stunts and babes. Fortunately I spent my money on routine groceries and as it turns out it was about the same quantity of cash spent on writing the plot.<br/><br/>Well fair do's in the end you do get some fast shiny car stunts and cliched Hollywood babes but nothing more noteworthy than the cheap US TV-movie standard car stunts and Hollywood babes you can stumble on channel-hopping Sky. You will not witness anything new or groundbreaking here. It does not get that fast and not particularly furious. At least to my eyes. On the other hand maybe this is the benchmark movie to test if you are an old fogey. Clearly from other reviews this must all look so different to the target early teen market. The only thing missing from this movie is ""The Logical Song"" by Scooter booming out of glossy hot-hatches as they pelt down the road.<br/><br/>Now there is a thought. Someone should make a Brit-movie remake with the aforementioned Supertramp track, visits to Halfords for the custom go-faster stripes, gold plated multi-coloured speaker cable and clip-on girth-boosting chrome tail pipes. Fat slags in Novas munching chips instead of Californian babes and Steve Coogan as the lead role. Call it ""The Fat and the Spurious: Grim up North"".<br/><br/>The Fast and The Furious.

Blacktop Mayhem.... Could be next summers Fast and the Furious, eh?)...  Tooling around town in my turbocharged Daytona, sometimes I get the same feeling I used to get when my ground pounding '69 SuperBee belched fire and roared thunder from its 383 Magnum...<br/><br/>What I got instead was a lame excuse to show a bunch of imported pocket rockets burning up the road...  The street race scene, supposedely a 1/4 mile race (but never actually stated to be such) took much, MUCH longer than the accelerated film speed would indicate.  Heck, it seemed like a full mile...  I've seen races at Belmont run faster than this!  Oh, wait, and we're supposed to believe that our hero is able to operate TWO computer interfaces for his fuel management system and GPS locator (okay, that's a joke, but hell, so is his movie) while he's blasting down the road at over 140 mph, FOUR abreast!  Not me, baby, I'm gonna have MY eyes glued to the road and those OTHER idiots!<br/><br/>I almost, ALMOST got interested in this movie when they started to try to develop a plot.  Okay, so Brian's a cop, he's undercover, and Dom and Trang are under suscpicion for truck hijacking...  The Feds are involved, they want the hijacking stopped before the truckers start arming themselves for vigilante justice.  Boys and girls, trucker vigilante justice (hmmmm, another nice phrase for a summer movie) would have been MUCH more entertaining - as witnessed by the scene when one of our hapless hijackers is pinned down by a faceless shotgun wielding trucker...<br/><br/>OH, and wait... At the end of the movie...  Well, I won't spoil it (the movie itself does a passable job of doing that), our ""hero"" performs an action that is SO out of character, that is SO anti-reality as to cause one to sit in one's chair with his mouth hanging in disbelief...

"mattymatt4ever","3","1","3","1 February 2002"," The Dull and the Boring
","Why did this become a box office smash?  It has action, it has fast cars and it has no intellectual value whatsoever.  Not to mention, it has Paul Walker and Vin Diesel--who will appeal to the female audience.  OK, so it has the potential to be a slam-bang, entertaining action flick...but I wasn't entertained.  <br/><br/>Many will be blown away by the stunts.  But I found them to be far from spectacular.  The movie does keep a fast-pace--almost in the style of an MTV music video--but it can't seem to escape from dullness.  Director Rob Cohen, who has actually directed some good movies in the past, tries too hard to be flashy.  The soundtrack, though full of great songs, is out of whack.  The songs seemed to have been chosen at random.  And of course Cohen felt this is going to appeal to a predominantly young audience, so he jumped at any attempt to insert a song from Ja Rule or any other popular rap artist into each scene, whether it's appropriate or not.<br/><br/>As for our two leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker--ever consider acting lessons?  The two of them are stiff as a board.  In one scene, Diesel is telling a story about his father's death and he doesn't let out the slightest hint of emotion.  Walker's got the looks, Diesel's got the bod.  I guess that's all they need to qualify!  Standards are getting lower and lower by the minute, in the world of cinema.  Michelle Rodriguez unfortunately has a very small role.  Too bad, because she seems like she has real potential.  I haven't even seen her debut role--which everyone was raving about--in ""Girlfight,"" but she has great ability and a strong presence, and I'm sure she can rise to the top if given the right outlet. BTW, she's also from Jersey City.  Representin'!!!!  <br/><br/>The dialogue is downright awful.  The characters are flat.  The plot is far from compelling and sometimes predictable, with tired action cliches planted here and there.  How many movies are we gonna see where the hero ends up falling in love with the villain's sister?<br/><br/>And I think the movie would've worked better if it took itself less seriously.  ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" was no gem either, but it was campy and it was meant to be campy.  And it was done with a tongue-in-cheek approach, with some very funny moments of comic relief.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" actually tries to be A-class entertainment, but it doesn't even deserve to be in the D-class.  <br/><br/>There are some nice shots of scantily clad babes, and that's the only reason why I'm not giving this movie a rating of 1.  If you're an automobile fanatic or is this is simply your kind of entertainment, have fun.  If not...be prepared for the Dull and the Boring.  <br/><br/>My score:  3 (out of 10)"

","The summer of 2001 was filled with a countless number of action flicks that for the most part were successful.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" was one of them.  Some of the previews for this movie which have Limp Bizkit's ""My Way"" or Ja Rule's ""Furious"" playing in the background can lead you to expect a no-holds-barred film with relentless action scenes that are made to get the adrenaline pumping.  ""The Fast and the Furious"" for the most part has all of that.  The acting here is pretty good despite the fact this is a summer action film.  Vin Diesel is already on his way to super-stardom as is Paul Walker.  The racing scenes are excellently done but look a lot more like something out of a really hot Playstation 2 game, as someone pointed out earlier at this site.<br/><br/>Now for the bad parts.  The storyline sucks mainly because we saw it in another movie that was released nearly ten years before ""The Fast and the Furious"".  That movie was ""Point Break"" which just so happened to star Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.  The plotlines for both films are almost identical.  I'm going to do this in comparison style with ""The Fast and the Furious"" first and ""Point Break"" second.  ""The Fast and the Furious/Point Break"" both have rookie cops(Paul Walker/Keanu Reeves) going undercover(LA street racing scene/LA surfing scene) to find the culprits behind several daring heists(truck heists/bank robberies).  The cops both fall in love with someone close to the suspected ring leader(Jordana Brewster/Lori Petty). The endings for both films pretty much leave the door open for sequels but is more likely with ""The Fast and the Furious"" than it is ""Point Break"". None of these complaints however, really had an effect on my viewing pleasure.  Lastly, what the hell happened to Ja Rule?  His performance seems to be more a lot more of a cameo than a small role.  He's only in one scene in the whole movie(the first racing scene) and I expected him to at least be in more scenes.    <br/><br/>Well ""The Fast and the Furious"" gets an 8/10 despite the absence of Ja Rule."

Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.<br/><br/>The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.<br/><br/>The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload. Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience. There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on `Miami Vice', has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.<br/><br/>Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate. Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.<br/><br/>The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in `Somebody Up There Likes Me', the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's. Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.<br/><br/>If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.<br/><br/>Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in `Snow Falling on Cedars', is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.<br/><br/>This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets."

","I have read a lot of reviews on The Fast and the Furious, and most of them were negative.. I saw the fast and the furious twice and I thought it was a really good movie, despite what anyone says. Many people say the actors were crap and didnt act well, but what do you expect? It's not supposed to be going for academy awards here. Its only a low budget film anyway. As for the actors, what is there to say in a movie about cars? ""I love you, I hope we'll always be together?"" I dont think so! The script was very realistic if you ask me.<br/><br/>The fast car racing was great, and the cars were even better. If you're not into cars then don't see the movie.. I thought the movie was really good and if you like fast cars, street racers and any of the actors whether they are male or female then i definately recommend you go see this!"

All the set-up was fun, even if dumb of course, and the 2nd act was good, creating tension for Paul Walker's character.<br/><br/>And then... they dropped the ball. They made a scene that could've cut a lot of boring minutes of this movie, and justify the ending at the same time.<br/><br/>And yet, they keep going, wasting all the tension just to have a stupid last motivation for the characters to be where the writers wanted them to be. Again, they didn't need the dumb Hollywood 3rd act because by the end of the second they had the characters in good position to finish the movie. But they wanted more chases, and races, and cars blowing up, and they made a bit of a boring flatter ending.<br/><br/>It's ""ok fun"", 5 points."

I'm rooting for Vin Diesel and his gang to die a bloody death for being ruthless thieves. Why on earth are they making movies with bad guys as the heroes?<br/><br/>Sure, there were incredibly cool racing scenes, done as only American movie studios can do. But seriously, what the heck?

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","4","15 December 2014"," A fun, if brainless, start to a successful franchise
","Never in a million years would I, sitting in the cinema (with my mum and stepfather, oddly enough) back in 2001, think that the auto-porn I had just witnessed would kick-start a hugely successful franchise due it's seventh instalment next year in 2015. Not that I didn't enjoy the 90 minutes of homoerotic machismo, endless gear-stick changes, scantily-clad gyrators and a cameo by Ja Rule - I actually found it highly entertaining in a Point Break (1991) sort-of-way - it's just that how much of an audience can a film about cars draw? Lots, it would seem.<br/><br/>Undercover L.A.P.D. officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is assigned to infiltrate a gang of street-racers led by the notorious Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) after a series of high-speed truck hijackings using pimped-out Honda Civics. A highly competent driver himself, Brian uses his skills to befriend Dominic, while falling for his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). After saving Dominic from the police, Brian earns his respect but not that of his crew, and when Dominic proves himself generous and loyal to those who offer him the same, Brian must choose between protecting his new friend and arresting the criminal he has been assigned to bring down.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious' script is often bad enough to make your ears bleed. This is a film where words of wisdom are offered in the form of ""it's not how you stand by your car, it's how you race your car,"". But it's delivers on what the title promises, and the action scenes are well-staged and it's nice to see real metal bend and break in an increasingly CGI-reliant marketplace. It's loud and often crude, but the two leads of obvious limited acting range prove likable and actually generate some chemistry. It's difficult to say where the franchise will go after the sad death of Paul Walker last year, but this first instalment was a fun, if brainless, start.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"y-a-z3689","6","1","4","11 January 2013"," Too Fast & Furious for me
","We are all tired of fast cars as a central plot, but this is where it pretty much all started. The Fast & Furious epitomizes Racing Movies. Granted, they aren't my favourite type of movies to watch, but this one really hits the nail on the head.<br/><br/>Foolproof storyline, star studded cast (for it's time) and of course, testosterone. Fast and Furious reeks of it, but I can only take so much. Yeah sure it was moderate action but, whether this was before HD or not, the way the cars looks when traveling at super speeds were far to fake for me. It looked cheesy and the green screen was obvious. Plus the acting of some of the cast was sub-par. I mean, who would of though that putting Ja Rule in a film would be prosperous. Mediocre at rapping, what makes you think he would be auspicious for a motion picture.<br/><br/>I can't ignore the giant pink elephant in the room so lets get right to it. Vin Diesel. The bravado that follows Diesel in ever film he appears in is present here. In one of the ending scenes where Paul Walker's character reveals something shocking, the look that was given by Dom (Vin Diesel) was chilling in every sense of the word. He definitely out shined the rest of the actors. But Johnny Tran (Rick Yune)really surprised me. He made for a very compelling antagonist and I really wish he was is in the recent Fast & Furious'. <br/><br/>All in all, you must see this revolutionary racing film. It has it's flaws but what movie doesn't? <br/><br/>But what do I know I'm just a 15 year old boy.<br/><br/>~Caesar Drake"

","I give this movie a six because it really is a pretty good movie. The story line is new and interesting and it is very entertaining in my opinion the actors just ruin it though. Paul Walker and Vin desiel can not act at all so everything seems so fake and unbelievable just because of them.<br/><br/>This movie is about an undercover cop who goes undercover to infiltrate an underground street racing ring. Though as his friendships with these people grow closer and closer he slips from being a cop to being a criminal.<br/><br/>This movie was still pretty good even despite the robot like acting of walker and deseil. Overall I still think its worth a watch."
"Extraordinary_Machine","4","1","4","7 March 2005"," The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction
","The Fast and the Furious <br/><br/>Every week, trucks containing valuable electronic equipment are hijacked by the expert drivers of super-fast, unmarked cars. In their investigation, the FBI and the Los Angeles police force begin to suspect participants in the vicious, illegal nighttime street-racing wars of committing the crimes. The almost cult-like following that this activity attracts is led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, 'Pitch Black'), whose more sensible sister Mia (Jordana Brewster, 'The Faculty') is beginning to fall for Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker, 'She's All That'), a new face in the street-racing circuit. But, unbeknownst to Mia or Dominic and his entourage, Brian is an undercover cop who has been assigned to infiltrate their group and try to discover the culprit behind the thefts. But as Brian spends more and more time with the Torettos and their companions, he finds himself torn between his duty as a police officer, and his loyalty as a friend.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that 'The Fast and the Furious' is based on a Vibe magazine article about street-racing written by Ken Li, the script isn't anything special, and seems more heavily inspired by the mediocre Jerry Bruckheimer-produced 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' remake from last year, as well as a 1999 Hong Kong action film, 'The Legend of Speed'. I can forgive the lack of brains presented here, but some actual characters would have been nice, as would capable actors to fill their shoes. Paul Walker does not convince in the lead role, and fails to truly express the emotional byproducts of his character's internal conflict of interests, while Vin Diesel is all too content to let his muscles do the talking. Michelle Rodriguez, as Diesel's moody love interest, is the bright spark within the tedium, but it seems as if she wandered onto the set while filming 'Girlfight' and was instantly hired on the spot. For a mainstream breakthrough, this gifted actress deserved better.<br/><br/>The saving grace of 'The Fast and the Furious' are the highly charged racing sequences, but even those are punctured by Rob Cohen's berserk direction. The soundtrack is way off, the camera cramps too close to the action, and what's with all the CGI? <br/><br/>~ 4/10 ~"
"marshall89","3","1","4","22 December 2002"," Extremely laughable surge of hormones
","Now, I have a question: Why did people even bother to see this movie? Come on, this is so bad it makes the first Rugrats Movie and Lilo and Stitch look like Lord of the Rings and The Spy Who Loved Me. I know I'm not the type for this kind of movie, but that's not going to let it off the hook. This film is loaded with despicable one-liners and a horrible soundtrack. I don't even know the plot. It's just about a bunch of racers in L.A., and one of them is an undercover cop who's looking for a bunch of hijackers or something like that. It's nothing to take you away. Oh, and starting the movie with two guys arguing about a tuna sandwich? Ooh, that's genius.<br/><br/>
Even if that wasn't enough, the cast sucks, plain and simple. Rick Yune delivered a very good performance, but the performances of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, and Vin Diesel (Blech) are pretty bad. This film is nothing but a bunch of street homies showing off their sports cars to impress a bunch of stupid girls. In fact, the title of this movie should be something like ""Raging Hormones"". There are its good points though. The effects of day changing to night are cool, the settings of L.A. for the first 20 minutes or so are pretty good, and the race scene is captivating. But most of the other action is pretty lame. There is some stuff to grab you, but nothing to entertain you. I can't believe I stayed up until midnight watching this when I could have been doing something more fun, like dusting mothballs off my clothes or washing dishes. I think I'd rather watch a movie called ""The Telemarketer"" than go through the living heck of watching this monstrosity again. Please spend your time watching a real movie like Star Wars, the James Bond movies, or Lord of the Rings. I think the only believable reason anyone would watch this would be to laugh at how bad it is. My rating for this: 2 out of 5."

","It made me laugh so often. I really wanted to get into this Franchise and it got me good: at laughing.
There was no real Story, no acting nothing but fast cars and hot 90's Babes.
When Sean was introduced into the gang there where females who wanted to be males. The only racing Girl of course had a barby colored car.
It made me cringe everytime they switched from on Driver to another everytime trying to get out a cool setence like: you're next. I´'ll Show you what I got. Eat my dust, Boy.
I can only guess they financed all those expensive cars and stuff because of the product Placement.
Als the animations made us snort into our drínks when they hit the red button on the driving wheel. Everyone always got smashed in their seats but so badly I was reminded of the early star trek series when the actors shook themselves instead of the camera when they where hit by a Meteor shower.
The safety precautions came quite short in the movie. I haven't seen any seatbelts, or safety clothing. Even when they crashed, nobody got hurt.<br/><br/>I had to admitt It often looked like, it's ok to take risks in driving. Nothing will hapen, no one gets hurt or arrested. Women will always offer themselves willingly, even if your are mean and ugly. There is always Money to build new cars. Have I mentioned that women will always offers themselves willingly?"

"The-Sarkologist","3","1","5","2 December 2016"," Pretty Substandard and full of clichés
","At first this movie came across as being really really boring and completely unoriginal. However, after watching it for a little more it because a little better, but it was still incredibly unoriginal and in the end just an excuse for illegal car races and some good old action scenes, which actually weren't all that fantastic either. Okay, sure, there were some stunts, such as jumping from a car onto a truck and back again, but that doesn't mean that the film was any good. Well, the fact that it has since spawned six sequels indicates that there is money to be made out of the franchise, but then again that isn't all that surprising because it does involve racing cars and a bit of typical action thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>So, the film is basically about illegal drag racing in Los Angeles with a plot thrown in. The plot involves trucks being hijacked by a bunch of people in cars and the contents of the trucks being stolen. So, surprise surprise, a cop is sent to go undercover into the world of drag racing to find out what is actually going on, and to make an arrest. However, surprise surprise, he ends up getting a but too caught up in the scene, and the people that he is working with, and eventually has to make a call – his career or his friends.<br/><br/>This is pretty typical of your American cop movie, raising the concept that being an undercover cop isn't actually all that easy. Mind you, this is pretty glamourised as well, especially with them operating out of a rather flash house that they have confiscated. Okay, I'm not really sure how undercover cops actually work, though apparently they do go in pretty deep, and will even do things that are effectively illegal. Whether they actually get too emotionally involved, or even end up going off with the bad guys is another story all together.<br/><br/>As for the film, well, it is what I would call your typical 'guy' film, and more so a typical 'young guy' film – you have fast, and hotted up cars, lots of girls that are scantily clad, which is pretty typical of this type of movie, and Hollywood in general. Personally it really isn't a scene that I am all that into, and I am not sure why I am all that keen on actually watching any more of them, however I do have this desire to do just that so I guess I will see how this series pans out. Oh, and the car races are pretty ordinary as well."

","I believed all the hype when The Fast and the Furious first came out as everybody was talking about how awesome the movie was. Upon hiring this out on video I felt totally cheated. The Fast and the Furious is one of the most overrated and over-hyped movies I have ever seen. As far as I'm concerned this is just brainless, action packed, testosterone fueled eye candy designed to attract teenagers who need lessons in how to act cool. Following the total disappointment of The Fast and the Furious, I vowed never to watch any of the sequels.<br/><br/>If you have seen Point Break (a far more enjoyable movie), you get the idea of what the whole movie is about. Basically it is about a police officer played by Paul Walker (for a police officer in his late 20's, he behaves like a teenager who is too cool for school) who goes undercover to infiltrate the illegal street racing scene in order to investigate a series of hijackings led by Vin Diesel, who is the leader of the street gang responsible for the hijackings as well as the undisputed king of the street racing scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are nothing more than one dimensional testosterone filled, swaggering gangster show offs and super sexy bad girls.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is peppered with many lame one liners. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"", takes the cake as one of the worst one liners.<br/><br/>Although The Fast and The Furious is still a popular movie with a large fan base, there is very little to like about this overrated, brainless and over-hyped rubbish. I'm very surprised the franchise has continued on, however I still think that surely it would have run out of petrol by now.

","One of the most overrated ridiculous franchises ever? well you get what you pay for right, you see the trailer, you see fast cars and slutty girls, you know what you're gonna get. Apart from the visuals, you see who directs this and you know not to expect a great deal, Rob Cohen...a low rent Michael Bay who makes trashy flashy CGI filled flicks. But who knew how far this would go, how long this dumb adventure would last and why is it so popular?<br/><br/>I imagine it appeals to the young generation, fast cars, hot chicks and lots of huge stunts, I guess you could say its 'The Dukes of Hazzard' for the modern era. Unfortunately originality is not on the menu, the plot...a gang of fast car, street racing adrenaline junkies/petrol heads are hijacking trucks utilising their driving skills. Undercover cop infiltrates this street racing world posing as a fellow fast car petrol head to try and find out who is behind the hijackings.<br/><br/>Wait a moment...a gang of surfer adrenaline junkies are robbing banks (although not utilising their surfing skills). An undercover cop infiltrates their surfer world posing as a fellow wannabe surfer to try and find out who is behind the robberies. Yep, this film is 'Point Break' but with cars instead of surf boards.<br/><br/>None of it really makes any sense though, Toretto seems to own garages and a property yet never has any customers or does any work, yet he's clearly loaded. He owns an array of cars that are all worth a fortune, all heavily modded and would cost loads to maintain and insure yet he treats them as if they were meaningless and crashes them left right n centre. Money seems to be no object to the characters in this film, oh I just smashed up my Mitsubishi with about 20K worth of modifications to it, oh well I'll just turn up in the next scene with another. Oh my Dodge Charger means everything to me cos me and my dad built it and put tonnes of money n love into it...meh I'll just race it against a train, no worries.<br/><br/>Its also amusing how all the street racers drive around in car posses, taking up the entire road, yeah like that wouldn't attract the police. Oh and the police clearly have trouble catching these guys and their cars, OK, well why not drive around the suburbs and look for the houses with top line modded Jap cars parked outside. Yes they park their illegal fast cars in the street outside their abodes...oh dear.<br/><br/>Now as I said you can't expect much from this film, its clearly style over substance, half the film is merely imagery of car porn and scantily clad ladies hanging around next to them. The acting is hilariously bad from everybody, I've haven't seen so much posing, swaggering, hardman attitudes and general showing off for a long time, (usually reserved for gangsta hoodie type flicks). Hordes of wannabes crowd around the main actors in the street race scenes all looking desperate to get on camera for five seconds...and its obvious. All the young super slim females look stunningly sexy (err kids film?) yet have no clue what on earth is going on, oh and then we have a sweaty looking Michelle Rodriguez...yikes!<br/><br/>Despite all the high fives and god awful bling the main crux of the film, the cars, is pretty sweet. If you are into cars such as myself then its fun purely for that, if you like Japanese super saloons then even more so. Take note kids this is about fast cars, no BMW's, Mercs or Audi's required. This is probably the only area of the film which is remotely interesting, there is a really good range of modified Jap cars here and not just top line models either, some nice retro gear. Of course this is a Cohen film so there has to be a bit of CGI in there somewhere, blasting through the engine as it ignites, not a bad idea but it looks hokey.<br/><br/>The sequences where they hijack these big rigs are stupid, they don't make much sense, why not just stop the thing? The finale is even dumber, again just stop the truck! or shoot out its tyres maybe geez! Everything is naturally predictable and cheesy, plenty of tight vests, muscles and tattoo's. Vin Diesel shouts a lot, Rodriguez scowls a lot and Walker does his best Keanu Reeves impression. All this and hardly any guns in sight! that's because its a watered down action thriller folks.<br/><br/>The big crash stunt at the very end involving Vin Diesel and his souped up Dodge Charger is admittedly very cool, best little sequence in the film really...I had to watch all this just for that?! Well...the scene where they smoke the Ferrari had me smiling, Italian rubbish!<br/><br/>5/10"

","Last year I rented FAST FIVE despite not really caring about the previous flicks. I had only seen the first film when it came out and some of TOKYO DRIFT on TV. I gave the fifth film a shot anyway because the trailers made it look really fun and it got good word of mouth. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It was a nice fun stunt car heist flick with no pretensions of being anything other than it was.<br/><br/>So here I am, watching the first film and I quickly realize why I didn't embrace the series during its initial films. This first installment is basically POINT BREAK with cars, but without The Buse. The first race is pretty fun at first but after that it just didn't do much for me. It takes itself too seriously and Paul Walker isn't really much of a leading man to carry the drama this flick tries to inject with the whole thing with him being torn between friendship and duty. Boring."

","Paul Walker gets his breakout role as an undercover cop, one with very little interest in actually doing any police work, who falls in with a crew of enterprising gear heads on the midnight street racing circuit. Vin Diesel, the headline costar, takes on his usual character: a growling, flexing, ultra-chill bro with shady connections but an open heart. Neither are particularly likable or interesting. The whole thing is shallower than a toilet bowl, ticking so many ""cool point"" boxes that it mimics a rich, forgettable, three-minute music video. We've got fast cars, gorgeous sex objects, adrenaline-rich action scenes, loud radio hits (juuust a bit dated) and a posh location or two. Not much in the way of meaningful character arcs or deeper substance. It's a true ""what you see is what you get"" experience. Big and dumb and gruff and insecure, with a plot that varies from meaningless to pointless and a versatile cast with nothing to do beyond gripping the steering wheel (or each other) and looking sexy. On this first go-around, at least, the action retains some passing association with reality. Points for that."

Vin Disel was very weak as Dominic Toretto and he's just not a very good actor. People say that he 'keeps this franchise together' but I argue it would be better without him. It's been proved he can't act and that's never been so obvious that these movies. <br/><br/>I liked the ending. The premise and overall story, however, were very stupid and didn't work.<br/><br/>I liked the cinematography for the most part but I feel like the actual RACE sequences were very poorly done and looked incredibly stupid.<br/><br/>The effect were pretty poor. The actual set and costume design was nice.<br/><br/>This movie was entertaining from start to finish and that is what it set out to do so I will assume it succeeded in that respect. It also introduces all the characters well and gives them reasonable roles in the story. <br/><br/>I will say that the dialogue in this movie is actually not terrible and 'You can have any drink... as long as its a Corona' is just a fun quotation. I will also say that the music didn't fit for the most part and felt out of place.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed the movie all the way through but its not something I can see myself going back to constantly because I just don't see much point to it.

"MaximumMadness","6","0","1","9 April 2017"," ""The Fast and the Furious""- While the sequels have gotten better and better, the original feels a bit dated and ""safe."" Fun, but not as entertaining as future installments.
","The interesting thing about the long-running ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is that series fans seem to fall into one of two camps. Those who feel that the series started off decent but has gotten progressively better with each passing sequel. Especially as they take themselves less seriously and simply aim to entertain their audience more and more with increasingly insane and physics-defying action. And those who far prefer the earlier and slightly tamer installments for their slightly more grounded realism. And they tend to lament the fact that the later sequels have gone in an increasingly unrealistic and over- the-top direction. And as a result, I feel I must warn certain audience members... I'm most certainly in the former of those two groupings. <br/><br/>Yes, I am somewhat sorry to say that to me, the franchise as a whole really didn't start picking up steam until about the third or fourth chapter. While by no means terrible, the earlier films haven't aged particularly well at all, and feel quite... docile and bland. Even the subject of this review- the original 2001 release from director Rob Cohen. It's a standard story and spends so much time on a plot ripped straight from ""Point Break"" (only substituting cars instead of surf-boards), that it doesn't really entertain to the same wild extent that later installments eventually reached.<br/><br/>The film follows detective Brian O'Connor (the late Paul Walker), as he goes undercover to infiltrate the underground world of illegal street racing in Los Angeles. O'Connor and his superiors suspect that the same men and women who hold these illegal events are also responsible for a string of crimes throughout the city. He eventually forms a sort-of friendship with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), one of the most famed of the underground racers. O'Connors conflicted feelings about whether or not to bust him are further complicated when he starts to fall for Dominic's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), and eventually his investigation will lead to a complex and wild finale through the streets of LA.<br/><br/>The highlights here are the wonderful and at-the-time relatively unknown cast and the high-octane action that crops up here and there. This is the film that really put Vin Diesel and the others on the map. Everyone gives it their all, and everyone comes across very likable and endlessly cool in the film. Especially Diesel and Walker, who both shot to stardom in the months following the film's release. I also really liked Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a supporting role as Letty, Domonic's girlfriend. She has that tough- yet-sexy appeal and works really well in the film. Brewster and fellow co-stars like Rick Yune and Chad Lindberg similarly do admirable jobs. On the whole, just a great, fun cast.<br/><br/>Director Rob Cohen, fresh off of a string of 90's hits including ""Dragonheart"" and ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"", does a phenomenal job handling the action and adventure with his kinetic camera-work and unique use of color and saturation. Say what you will about the mixed quality of the films he's made- the man can make a thrilling sequence. You really feel the speed in the races and each crash hits you right in the gut. This is amongst his best work as a visual storyteller, and he delivers the action full-throttle. When the film goes into full- blown carnage, it works marvelously.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film falters quite a bit thanks to the aforementioned stock-screen writing and for being a bit too dated when viewed in comparison to the rest of the series. For all intents and purposes, there's not a lot going on ""under the hood"" here. Every twist and turn is telegraphed from a mile away, characters fall into broad and undeveloped clichés (usually given a single ""quirk"" to define them, which is lazy screen writing 101), and you'll know how it ends pretty much immediately. It takes away a lot of the experience. The fact that the film is also basically a photocopy of the superior ""Point Break"" is also distracting at times and can occasionally lead to a lot of unintended giggles. In addition, this film feels very much a product of its time. This has ""Extreme 2001 movie!"" written all over it. From the music to the editing to even the slang used in conversation... the film is dated to the point it even occasionally feels a bit cringe- worthy.<br/><br/>Still, I don't think it's a bad movie. Just a troubled one. And I do think it is still most certainly worth seeking out, especially as a prerequisite to viewing the entire series. It sets up a lot of characters and context that are expanded on in later films, and there's a lot of fun to be had with the great performances and top-notch action. For my money... It's one of the weaker ""Fast & Furious"" films. But it's still a ""Fast & Furious"" film through-and-through. And I say give it a shot.<br/><br/>I give it an about-average 6 out of 10."
"ThomasDrufke","7","0","1","4 April 2017"," A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest
","16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.<br/><br/>A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.<br/><br/>They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, ""possible"", will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.<br/><br/>In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.<br/><br/>The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here. A guilty pleasure movie at its best<br/><br/>+Stunts/action<br/><br/>+All about family<br/><br/>+Ridiculously goofy/fun<br/><br/>-Horrible script, and passable acting<br/><br/>-Takes itself a little too serious at times<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","0","1","26 March 2017"," One of the 'better' cool car style-focused action flicks of the turn of the century
","""The Fast and The Furious"" was the ""Point Break"" of the 2000s — a cop goes undercover to bust up a group of criminals who are into a specific ""sport,"" but he becomes attached to the very people he's trying to bust. ""Point Break"" is the better film, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" was the start of a multi-billion-dollar franchise. Go figure.<br/><br/>Paul Walker plays the cop, Brian O'Conner, but the screenplay doesn't reveal this card until Brian has not only won the respect of top street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), but also the viewer. This small betrayal of our trust is writer Gary Scott Thompson's shrewdest move as the film goes from somewhat interesting, albeit cliché, to more interesting, albeit cliché.<br/><br/>The screenplay — co-written with Erik Bergquist and David Ayer (""Training Day"") based on the ""VIBE"" magazine article by Ken Li — is not the focal point of the movie, of course. This was 2001, the peak of the MTV Spring Break era. The point was to show hot foreign cars, hot foreign (and American) women and a lot of burning rubber. The rock, rap and techno music of the time feature prominently, and even rapper Ja Rule had a supporting role as a racer, a reminder of how the start of the 21st century was also the beginning of the music business starting to infiltrate the movie business.<br/><br/>All this to say, director Rob Cohen understands this is a style over substance situation. Quarter-mile races, chases, fist fights and criminal heist activity are the featured attractions — as are the beautiful cars and beautiful people. If this film can be given any credit for originality, it belongs to the merging of heist/crime movie and drag race aesthetics. Cars had of course been featured in movies and television before, but this movie more authentically plays to the car aficionado, as a handful of films did in this era (e.g. ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""The Italian Job""). There's a certain grittiness that this film has featuring real street-racing cars compared to James Bond, for example, driving something too cool to believe.<br/><br/>The movie isn't 100 percent shallow from start to finish, however. A genuine effort is made to build chemistry between Walker and Diesel's characters. The story works best when it builds and tests that relationship. Nothing else about the movie feels worth our investment, but somehow we desperately do not want Brian and Dom to turn on each other despite all the reasons they should. Both Walker and Diesel bring likable dimensions to their characters and their chemistry is likely to be the bedrock of future films. (This coming from someone who has yet to see any of the other films yet.)<br/><br/>The supporting cast, however, doesn't offer much. Dom's girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), brings nothing to the story, and the other guys in Dom's gang aren't given the chance to be anything but meatheads. The romance between Brian and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) exists for formulaic reasons, but the fact that both of them feel kind of like outsiders to the street-racing culture gives their relationships some legitimacy.<br/><br/>But enough about characters. ""The Fast and the Furious"" delivers some solid action sequences, especially the ones involving street cars and semi trucks. The racing scenes don't allow for much dimension, and the editing is decent to optimize suspense, but the CGI and green screen elements pull us out of what should feel like a very realistic, gritty street race. <br/><br/>There are enough quality moments for action fans in ""The Fast and the Furious"" to overcome the MTV Spring Break music video world its characters inhabit. The 2000s were full of glossy movies with inferior story lines, and while comparing ""The Fast and the Furious"" to these films would obviously make it seem like a great movie when in fact it's an average one, it could be a suitable enough ambassador of its time and culture to movie watchers of the future.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"Uriah43","6","0","1","2 January 2017"," Fast-Paced Action and Drama
","Set in Los Angeles, this movie focuses on a team of thieves who hijack trucks operating a high speeds from optimally powered race cars. The cargo is then taken and sold on the black market. Needless to say, the FBI and local authorities are anxious to capture and prosecute these criminals before the truckers take matters into their own hands. To help them on this case a young police officer by the name of ""Brian O'Conner"" (Paul Walker) volunteers to go undercover and infiltrate the most high-profile illegal street racing team in the area which is led by a man named ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) who also has a prison record for violence due to his explosive temper. However, in order to investigate this case Brian first has to get inside this close-knit team and that is more difficult than anybody realizes. Additionally, this particular team is but one of many and it might not be the one responsible. But one thing is sure-action needs to be taken soon before violence erupts on the highways. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film has enough fast-paced action and drama to satisfy most fans of the genre. No doubt about it. On a more critical note though, I thought that some of the characters-most notably ""Letty"" (Michelle Rodriguez), ""Vince"" (Matt Schulze) and ""Hector"" (Noel Gugliemi)--were much too pretentious and almost to the point of being downright annoying. Likewise, some of the previously mentioned action scenes were more than a little unrealistic as well. But that's Hollywood for you. In any case, from what I understand this film has turned into a profitable enterprise for Universal Pictures and since nothing succeeds like success has bred numerous sequels in its wake. That said, despite the flaws just mentioned I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
"CinematicInceptions","6","0","2","17 December 2016"," Cars and crime. Everybody needs a hobby...
","If I had seen this before any of the sequels had come out, I would never have thought that this summer action crash-test movie would have gotten enough attention and revenue to spark a series that is working on its eighth movie fifteen years later. It was not all that impressive. The script is slightly less than mediocre in a craft sense, and it isn't helped by the mindless action sequences and sub-par acting. The ending was good, but aside from that the story was pretty flat. However, I can see how it might have had some resonance with people who go crazy for cars as well as the Hispanic crowds. If nothing else can be said of this franchise, it is perhaps the only one that combines big budgets with lower class people. Most action movies involve middle class government workers or high class assassins. But with the FAF movies, working class characters get big action treatment, which is nice in its own way.<br/><br/>Though there is some substance to the story with Brian having his mission to arrest Dom, much of the movie exists for the purpose of establishing the world of drag racing. One in which people love cars and love the thrill of racing them. This is what they live for, and while it may not be the greatest hobby to have from a safety and legal standpoint, it seems to have some real emotional value to Dom. It may be a community run by criminals, but it still has its own pride, and this same theme is carried into many of the sequels.<br/><br/>Even though much of the plot is driven by action sequences and car races, there remains the human conflict beneath it. It isn't a great emotional story line, but there are some decent character conflicts within it. The progression of Brian's relationship with Mia is not that great, but it is good in how it impacts Brian and Dom's relationship. There are a number of minor characters who help give us a sense of the world of car racing. Letty falls into this category, having some prominence, but no real arc of her own. The only larger function she serves is being part of the original ""family"" that becomes more established as the series goes on.<br/><br/>If you have seen the later movies (fast five and on), but have not seen the original, just know that you're in for a different kind of movie. This first installment, though it does not have action of the same grand scale as the later movies, is much grittier and more violent in its own way. I sensed that it wanted to be an R-rated movie, but they held back enough for it to retain a PG-13 rating. If you feel like you have to see the movies in order, I can tell you firsthand that the more recent installments still make plenty of sense on their own. It may be better to see them in order, but it's not necessary. Overall Rating: 7.3/10"

"Leofwine_draca","5","0","10","11 July 2016"," Good race scenes lift a fast-paced thriller
","Here's a throwaway popcorn flick that manages to be engaging thanks to the central storyline, that old chestnut of the detective going undercover and becoming friends with the man he's supposed to be sending to jail. The old, old plot is given a new spin with a fresh cast and an interesting backdrop – illegal street racing. Given the MTV expectations, the film is as flashy as you would expect thanks to director Rob Cohen, packed with pumped up loud music to drive to and enough testosterone to fill three football fields. Still, have no misconceptions: this is a high-octane thrill-ride and professes to be nothing more and nothing less.<br/><br/>The film certainly satisfies on the action front, with some madly exciting car chases and stunts, although there is a definite lull in the action around midway which is a bit surprising. Thankfully things finish off with an expertly done, extended set-piece involving a truck and an amazing car crash to finish things off (ludicrously spoilt in the trailer). Even cooler, the DVD allows you to rewatch the stunt from EIGHT different camera angles, a feature which has made the format for me.<br/><br/>The characterisation is a bit thin on the ground but the two leads are strong: Paul Walker does nothing wrong as the young undercover cop, and Vin Diesel manages to be effortlessly cool and a natural born leader again after PITCH BLACK. The supporting cast is ho-hum, but it is interesting to see DIE ANOTHER DAY's Rick Yune without all that makeup on. Not a perfect movie, but fast-paced and interesting enough to be worth a look."

","""Classic of the series. I always enjoy throwing back and watching the dynamics of how the characters became."" Paul plays the undercover part perfectly. Vin is the ultimate bad boy but also the head of the family. Terrific cars scenes and camera angles capturing each rev and turn to its fullest degree. I have to say the beginning of one of the most favorite movie series ever. Timing is everything and the chase and race scenes are packed with so much action it will leave you on the edge. A thrill ride like no other probably the movie that stunned a lot of people with it's plot and smooth rides. If you ever see a movie 2x or more it is most likely this one."
"StevePulaski","8","0","1","8 December 2015"," A fine example of cinematic adrenaline and incredulity
","The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.<br/><br/>What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.<br/><br/>Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.<br/><br/>No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.<br/><br/>But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Starring: Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster. Directed by: Rob Cohen."
"HelenMary","7","0","1","28 November 2015"," Point Break, the remake or an homage
","Paul Walker playing Keanu Reeves, even down to his voice and choice of sandwich (albeit different bread); Point Break is one of my favourite films, and I really enjoy Fast and Furious but it is more or less a play by play copy of the surf-ace movie ten years on. Vin Diesel is the Bodhi-esque sensei-master surrounded by his acolytes and is convincing; it's one of his best roles (along with Pitch Black 1). He's a powerhouse. The film is attractive, stylish with a hot soundtrack and showcases the street-racer subculture in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Paul Walker isn't just an ersatz Reeves, he is glorious in his own right; beautiful, sexy, tough, controlled and engaging and his chemistry with Jordana Brewster (Dom Toretto's little sister) was nice, but is overshadowed by the bromance between Dom and Brian. Michelle Rodriquez is a great female foil for Diesel; she's gorgeous and convincing as a high-octane junky.<br/><br/>Hey, F&F is never going to win awards for the most intelligent film in existence but it's pretty, amusing in places, a little cheesy and poorly dubbed but good cinema and must have had something to spawn itself into one of the largest grossing film franchises of all time. It plays like a music video, with touches of CSI in the filming but much of it is a little pointless and OTT. Vin Diesel is perfect as Dom and his chemistry with all the characters is sparkling. He plays the showman well. Paul Walker is gorgeous, he really is a loss to the acting world, and this film is his magnum opus. Walker and Diesel were obviously buddies and as such it makes this film all the more special. It's great cinema but is definitely flawed, especially in the realm of script. Don't take it too seriously, strap on your petrol-head and enjoy."

","Brian O'Connor is a Los Angeles police officer who is working undercover to discover the identity of a group involved in a series of truck hijackings. To this end he tries to get in with the street racing community. To do this he will not only need to take part in the races he will have to impress the other racers. His bosses are convinced that one Dominic Toretto is behind the crimes but as Brian gets to know him he becomes less sure and is soon convinced that a group of Chinese racers are the ones involved is this really the case or of Brian becoming a bit too friendly with Toretto? He has also fallen for Toretto's beautiful sister which leads to some friction with another one of the group who also has the hots for her.<br/><br/>If you are looking for the 'Citizen Kane' of action movies this isn't it; however if you just want some good mindless fun with fast cars and a good looking cast you could do much worse. Early on I thought this would just be 'Point Break' with street racers instead of surfers in many ways it is but there are as many differences as similarities. As one might expect there are a succession of action set pieces; this include several races, fights, shootings and a spectacular truck robbery that goes horribly wrong. These are pretty exciting even if they are a bit unrealistic at times an example of this is the truck hijacking; it takes place on what appears to be a main road but we don't see a single other vehicle for the entire scene if you can ignore this sort of thing this shouldn't detract from the film. The cast might not be Oscar contenders but the do a solid job. Overall this is a solid enough brain-in-neutral action film."

","This movie was my favorite movie growing up as a kid. Ever since i was little i loved watching this move. This move is a good film to watch if you are into the car scene as much as i am and also if you like the action genre. Paul walker did an amazing job on this movie, this movie is the reason i first got introduced into him. I soon became a fan of his. The scenes are pretty well done although at some parts you cab tell the voice audio was added in after wards. The music was good and always fit the scenes perfectly. This movie in my opinion was the best one in the entire series. The 7th one has a pretty good place in my heart too seeing it was the last film Paul walker worked on before his passing.all i can say is that this movie has aged well and is one of if not my favorite movie of all time"
"AmyJenson1995","7","0","1","4 October 2015"," Cars, speed, babes, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker
","Some would love this movie, others wouldn't but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.<br/><br/>The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.<br/><br/>The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact."

","I love FAST AND FURIOUS movies, so I thought, ""What if I reviewed these movies?"", so I will review each film from the original film to the new film.<br/><br/>So, I begin my second franchise review with the original 2001 film, The Fast and the Furious.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious was not only released on June 22, 2001 to financial success and mixed reviews, but it also launched the careers of nearly all of it's stars, including Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, who would later become household names, as well as Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Rob Cohen with a screenplay by David Ayer, who wrote the 2001 film Training Day and co-wrote this film with two other writers including the creator of the franchise, Gary Scott Thompson.<br/><br/>The film follows undercover cop Brian O'Conner who must stop semi-truck hijackers led by criminal and wanted fugitive Dominic Toretto from stealing expensive electronic equipment while developing a relationship with Dominic's sister, Mia Toretto and forming a friendship with Dominic.<br/><br/>That is just a quick summary. I won't go into too much of the plot, because a lot of people should know what is the main premise of the story in this film and the other Fast and Furious movies. The franchise would later go to move away from the underground street racing plot into a plot much more cooler with the heist of $100 million dollars, gun fights and brawls and the movie that would change this franchise and bring new life into it would be the fifth entry in the series, released in April of 2011, Fast Five.<br/><br/>The story is just really cool and amazing, but is not Oscar worthy, but the dialogue is the movie can get a little weak on a few occasions, but not throughout the whole darn movie.<br/><br/>The action is just top-notch and the car chases in this film is as intense and action-packed as they would be later on in the franchise. My favorite car chase is at the beginning of the film and at the end of the film involving Dominic and Brian driving.<br/><br/>The acting is just dreadful, but not all of it is. I will give credit to Vin Diesel, who plays Dominic Toretto and he pulls it off wonderfully, but while it's not Oscar worthy, he does show emotion, drama and laughter into his character. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz, is great in this film and she would remain in that part for the other films and she would play in James Cameron's groundbreaking special-effects extravaganza Avatar and in the 2002 action-horror / zombie movie film based on the survival video game, Resident Evil.<br/><br/>The other two that also does a great job is definitely Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto, and they do a very decent good job with the material written for them and they have such a great chemistry on the screen.<br/><br/>Dominic Toretto's team members are just good. The actors who play the people in his crew is just incredible, with the exception of Matt Schulze as Vince.<br/><br/>The music and soundtrack is really cool and Ja Rule is in this film, playing the role of Edwin and he provides music on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, The first and original FAST AND THE FURIOUS is really good, but can get a little confusing in a few areas. I give it a 6 out of 10. It's not the best score, but certainly not the worst. This film is worth the watch and worth buying on DVD and Blu-Ray or watching on basic cable and Video on Demand or Xfinity Streampix."

","A surprise hit of its year whose unexpected success spawned a franchise that continues to churn out sequels even to this date, The Fast and the Furious is the sole reason why both Vin Diesel & Paul Walker are a household name today and even if it seems a bit dated now, it's still capable of delivering a cinematic ride that's thrilling & fun for the most part.<br/><br/>The story of The Fast and the Furious is set in Los Angeles and follows an undercover cop who's assigned to find the gang responsible for stealing expensive electronic equipments, and uses his cover to infiltrate into this world of illegal street racing but soon begins having doubts about where his loyalties lie as he becomes increasingly enamoured by this lifestyle.<br/><br/>A finely directed film, the dialogues of which may sound a bit corny now, one of the reasons why this street-racing thriller works is because of the testosterone high it provides with the high-speed racing & chase sequences it packs in, which wasn't an everyday phenomena in movies back in those days, in addition to the plethora of style it oozes from the first frame to the last.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Fast and the Furious is an exciting blend of an interesting storyline, kinetic direction, energetic camera-work, fabulously edited chase sequences & top-gear score that's fun, enjoyable & entertaining for the most part, while the committed performances by Diesel & Walker do provide the boost it required to propel itself beyond mediocrity. Definitely worth a shot."
"willcundallreview","6","0","2","6 June 2015"," A racing movie with slight depth
","Rating-6/10<br/><br/>The Fast and Furious is a racing movie, with crime, that also serves thrills and spills all over the workshop. This is the kind of movie we so often dislike but for me, this isn't dislikeable and is actually an OK piece of film, a kind of ""give it a go"" kind of movie. The whole show is pretty well made and no one can deny the stunts involved aren't fantastically done, and the plot is actually not half bad at all.<br/><br/>Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) is a cop racing in street races, trying to infiltrate racing gangs and the like, and to be fair Walker does it kind of nicely. I did feel out of the main cast that Walker feels the most uncomfortable, but he still manages to lead the movie out well enough. Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dominic is OK too, he actually outshines everybody here and his acting skill really comes through for me here, proves what he has in the locker.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen directs this a bit OK, not great but he steadies it, the film could have been more on point at times but nevertheless he still catches the right feeling the script gives off. And on that note the film Is written much the same, missed opportunities here and there and massive cheesy lines can harm it, but I think by the end of the story, your hooked on the adrenaline junkie action, rather than the wording choices. <br/><br/>The movie has a glitzy look about it, this is Hollywood through and through and yet that doesn't matter, it feels raw enough to be believable and the stars of the movie are not famous enough for this to be yet another big budget action thriller movie, that tries too hard to be cool. The cars are for me not that nice, the one thing that really gets annoying after a while is bright green cars etc with racing stripes of fire, the cars go fast and this is good for petrol heads, but the look of it is pretty awful.<br/><br/>I said about the stunts and there is no denying the stunts are good, there not gravity defying like so many of the sequels(Fast and Furious 7 has just left cinemas at the time of this review), they are well done and basic, sure the effects used in the cars whilst racing is ridiculous, but the fast crashes and kind of crazy things that go on, make this exciting and personally I enjoyed it quite a little bit.<br/><br/>You know I hear a lot of people claim this is ""only for the boys"", but please disregard that, not only it being sexist but also that this actually contains depth in the story, not just mindless racing. I mean the depth is pretty high up, this only just scrapes the surface but it still has more than the cars. I felt the plot which I will not ruin for those who haven't seen, is good and it makes this kinda fun but at the same time thrilling, you honestly don't know what will happen, and although the story does play out rather basic, It still contains a fun story.<br/><br/>Overall this is one fast paced movie I can recommend, now don't be won over by it like so many can, this honestly isn't a masterpiece of any kind, but still worth a view. I didn't feel bored at any times, all my focus was on the characters and how they develop and I think that you too can enjoy it, If you focus on one particular part, and not the cheese that this movie truly is."

A few flops later and nobody remembered why he was called the new Action Hero, but watching this (and of course the superb ""Pitch Black"") might remind you why you liked him in the first place (or could be a reason to discover him for a younger audience).

I grew up in the 80's, so I love Muscle Car and TV shows and movies staring Muscle Cars, 1979 The Dukes of Hazard, staring The General Lee 1969 Dodge Charger, 1982 Knight Rider, staring KITT 1982 Pontiac Trans Am, and 1981 Cannon ball Run staring? I have to give it to the Black Lamborghini Countach. So to nobodies surprise my first car was a 1973 split bumper Camaro, that I still own today. <br/><br/>So when The Fast and the Furious came to theater I refused to see this movie. I hated the idea of Tunner cars that much. It was not until about a year later that I was sitting at home up late one weekend when this movie came on HBO I was hoping this movie would board me to sleep but instead I stayed up loving every minute of this movie, so much so I later had to up grade the 350 in my 1973 Camaro with a 383 and when it came time for me to buy an new car I bought a 2007 Honda Civic.<br/><br/>Why I loved this movie, the race scene were awesome like nothing seen before, it is amazing what they did with the camera angles, special effects and the sounds. The plot worked well with the race scene environment and yes it was stolen from Point Break another movie I loved. The movie relied on a good mix of both the action from the races and the emotions and history of the characters to keep the views involved, the main focus on Dominic, but giving enough of the other characters so the movie was not just all about Dom. Finally there were a lot of awesome cars, some were a little over done with graphics but they made up for it with the 1970 Dodge Charger at the end.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is a great combination of a good plot, good character development, and great action and cool cars."

Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is an officer for the LAPD and goes undercover, joining Toretto's highly skilled crew of racers, taking part in many illegal late night street races for high stakes.

Also starring Michelle Rodriguez as Toretto's girlfriend Letty, Die Another Day's Rick Yune as Johnny Tran, Chad Lindberg as Jesse, Johnny Strong as Leon, Ted Levine as Sergeant Tanner, Matt Schulze as Vince, rapper Ja Rule as Edwin, Space Jam's Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins and Bruce Almighty's Noel Gugliemi as Hector. Diesel with his gravely voice is cool, Walker is blank most of the time but a reasonable hero, and supporting cast members Brewster and Rodriguez do fine as well. To be honest, the storyline going on is not the thing to pay the fullest attention to, as the title suggests it the pedal-to-the-metal stuff, all the colourful and cool cars fuelled up, with extra rocket boosters and switches, that speed and crash their way around, and the explosions and stunts along the way keep the pace up as well, all in all it is a worthwhile action thriller. Good!"

","When the Fast and the Furious first appeared it was an awesome film to watch. The cars and street racing scenes were new and exciting. After watching Tokyo Drift and Torque a couple of years later it is clear that the original spawned an entire new genre of action film. The new genre clearly plays on the clichéd teenagers dream of racing fast cars through busy streets. Street racing in real life is sadly lacking compared to these films and fatal accidents seem to happen a lot more frequently. While the original and Tokyo Drift have upped the ante, the other films such as Biker Boyz and Torque are very disappointing. We should probably be used to that now though because its the ultimate Hollywood cliché..."

Anyone that likes fast cars and cars racing and cars crashing will definitely get their share from this film. All of the racing scenes are expertly filmed with the camera examining the engine and the exhaust pipe as the car speeds up. There's also the fact that the film involves cops and robbers, so there's violence and gunfights as well. Unfortunately, that's about it...<br/><br/>The plot isn't terrible, but it could have been better developed. It isn't complicated enough. The plot is really simple. I don't want to say that not enough happened, because it did have enough, but there was just something about it that didn't seem complete. And the acting? Well, as you can expect, the acting wasn't that great. Paul Walker looked bored half the time, like he didn't want to be there. Vin Diesel? Well he's just a bad actor anyway. Overall, The Fast and the Furious is a fun action film, but if you take it seriously...It sucks.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Karri_Koivusalo","5","0","1","27 April 2006"," Rather weak crime movie with superficial street racing elements
","In an ironic sense, this movie is like much of the car tuning business these days. That is, cheap and fake, like the plastic hood pin replicas you attach on the hood with foam tape. <br/><br/>This movie has plenty of things to make a car enthusiast cringe; the way which this movie bunches car tuning, street racing and organized crime tightly together isn't exactly the most pleasing approach. The stuff about double-clutching, failing to use proper terms and very loose involvement on events in a race gives an impression the writer gained all his knowledge about race driving out of a five-point bulletin list on how to drive a Nascar racer. Finally, the movie practically drops out of street racing premise after 1/4th way through.<br/><br/>The street racing theme is only a facade to a substandard crime movie. It's soon obvious the movie is more about blasting away with guns than racing on the streets. Making a distinct good guy - bad guy -scenario and thus having the police to sanction the main character's actions, the movie did not have to deal with the legal and moral issues of street racing or the dangers involved. Pure street racing as such would probably have been too difficult a subject to the writer and too controversial for the producers, so they put guns, explosions, hi-jackers and an oriental gangster mob into the movie, none of which really belongs (well, except perhaps the gangster bunch, but they were made OTT, big time). <br/><br/>The race scenes aren't that well made either; they're about driving a straight line and when to hit the nitrous (or Nnnaaawwwzzz as it's called in the movie) for victory. It's not about who's the best driver, it's about who has the most $$$'s under the hood. There's not enough car stuff to keep enthusiasts interested, the plot pretty much sucks rocks through a garden hose and the bulk of the movie is generic crime movie material. The latter half of the movie is almost completely disconnected from the first, the two elements (racing and crime) support each other in a truly superficial way, and the dialog is awkward."

","This is a movie which is obviously aimed at the teenage male. Its dialog is far from deathless and it has patches which are memorable -- only for triteness. Nevertheless, I found myself swept up in the races and concerned with whether Vin Diesel would discover Paul Walker's reason for wanting to hang with him. Is Toretto (Diesel)behind the high jacking of the contents of trucks on the highway? The opening scene showed such a robbery but by the time you see all the cars driven by Toretto and his friends you can no longer remember what the cars looked like in that exciting scene. All in all I enjoyed the film and its resolutions (Then again, I watch Patrick Swayze in ""Roadhouse"" every time I can.)

I think it came out shortly after Gone in 60 Seconds. Which was a good movie. This one is, well, a movie. Your call as to whether it's good or not.<br/><br/>Brian O'Connor (Walker) is an undercover cop who poses as a street racer. His assignment right now is to watch Dom (Diesel), who is the main suspect in a high-tech ring of highway robberies. We don't know who the bad guys are in this movie for a while, but eventually we find out that it is in fact Dom and his crew doing the highway robberies. If you haven't seen it and I spoiled it for you, my apologies. Hopefully that'll keep you from watching it now.<br/><br/>I don't think the plot goes much deeper than that which I have just mentioned. This movie is about two things. The babes, and the cars. There's quite a few of each that are very good looking. For the most part the cars are better in this one though.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what else to write in this review. That's how much the plot is weak sauce. I mean, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have to hold this movie on their shoulders. And who do they get for backup? Ja Rule. Good grief people. Couldn't we find one decent actor? Guess not. Really, if you ever bother watching this movie, realize right from square one that this movie is not about the plot or the acting. It's about the big zoom zoom that the cars make.

Jesse ends up dying, Vince ends up with a life-threatening injury, Leon and Letty are not seen again, Vin escapes the L.A. scene and nobody really knows whats happens to Mia. Brian was meant to be working for the good of things as a police officer and he feels the guilt of making their lives fall apart and that is the reason why he lets Dom go at the end of the movie. 2 Fast 2 Furious however, does not tie the loose ends up that this movie leaves behind, which is rather disappointing. 8/10"

But came away with a feeling of, well, not quite satisfaction, but definitely not discomfort as the haters (aka Internet movie nerds and ""critics"") bring forth in their reviews. <br/><br/>Sure there is action, explosions, chases, hot chicks, etc. but that's to be expected from a film called ""The Fast and the Furious."" Indeed, it is fast with its MTV style editing with furious undertones of rage and violence and crime, but hey, it's a movie about criminal car racers for crying out loud.<br/><br/>Yes the visuals are impressive and the sound is good too. The editing, lighting, cinematography and all the other technicals are well done. The acting...not so well done but not awful - there really isn't a whole lot, nor dialogue for that matter. But what makes the story compelling is its (simple yes, but intriguing nevertheless) character relationships which form the plot.<br/><br/>Is this film over the top? Yes. But it is done in such a way that keeps you interested, and besides, since so few of us actually do know about the undercover world of streetcar racing, who are we to say what is real and what isn't? Besides, if you haven't been paying attention, this film is a male fantasy - muscles, guns, money, cars, women...like every other video on MTV (which explains the annoying soundtrack).<br/><br/>This film is not a great movie, but it has no pretense of being one, and that is refreshing when so much crap out there does. It is a popcorn flick, instantly forgettable but watchable over and over nonetheless.

","After seeing the Fast and the Furious a couple of things came to mind. First off, who ever wrote this movie should be shot, and second Paul Walker should be banned from ever starring in another movie. I reolise that this film has a lot of fans, but i just don't see why. Sure there are a couple of good action parts, and i must confess that Vin Diesel has a bit of a powerful presence on screen. <br/><br/>Still, this does not make up for the lack of intelgence that went into the making of this film. It looks to me like someone said, 'Hey lets pull a Michael Bay here,' and then started brain storming: What do teenagers want to see: Fast Cars, Good looking girls, Cops and robbers perhaps, Then they pulled a screenplay out of there ass, and casted Paul Walker as the lead. I cant tell you how boring I find Walker as a leading man, and how ridiculous I find this movie.

","Rob Cohen's ""The Fast And The Furious"" has been a box office hit, but is just a disappointment. It's much sight and sound, but like switching through the TV channels with a remote control with no contents at all. There's no hint of a story, just something about some bad young guys driving around in very fast cars, doing illegal and cool things like car races, tuning their turbo killing machines and doing very male stuff like beating the s*** out of themselves. There are some pretty girls as well in sweaty black t-shirts and a good guy who's in fact an undercover police officer who's searching for something and falls in love with the girls of the gang.<br/><br/>Director Cohen's doesn't care at all about a script, a good story and good actors, he's just interested in the straight, fast and loud action of popcorn cinema, and you're getting a lot of that. There are dozens of well-shot car chases, showdowns, gun and fist fights, etc., but it all remains a heartless spectacle with too many stupid dialogues that should be only used in a Spinal Tap movie. The villain is bald and bad and played by Vin Diesel, the hero is blond and bright and played by Paul Walker, the other gang members have beards and are shouting like hell, and the girls are just there for completing the crew. Even the conflict of a policeman investigating undercover and becoming fascinated by a counter culture isn't developed well and explored at all like in William Friedkin's ""Cruising"" or Katheryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" - it's just one more vague cliché presented on an assembly line, fastly running of course.<br/><br/>If you like some mindless highway action you might find some good and entertaining scenes in this movie, but there are lots of better movies built around car chases and vehicle action - check out cult movies like the groovy ""Vanishing Point"", Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", Walter Hill's ""Driver"", Norman Jewison's great ""Rollerball"" or the odd ""The Cars That Ate Paris"" by Peter Weir. ""The Fast And The Furious"" mainly quotes scenes from these movies and from other car chasing classics like ""French Connection"", ""Bullitt"", the ""Mad Max"", ""Terminator"" and ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and even James Dean's legendary car race in ""Rebels Without A Cause"" is ripped off here. But all in all you're just asking what it is all about and will find the answer in Shakespeare again - much ado about nothing."

","I first became aware of this movie when the first annual Taurus awards for stunts aired.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of action movies, but this one was really something.  Not only fantastic stunt driving around 18-wheelers, but one female character actually drove UNDER a tractor-trailer!  Add to the stunts the great editing and amazing camera work.  Not to mention visual effects.  And just before the street racing, I thought they showed the equipment in the cars quite effectively.  One more thing:  in one of the race scenes, which wasn't an event with spectators, these two guys tried to beat a train!  And one didn't seem to think life was worth living so anything could have happened.  It was something to watch.<br/><br/>Still, the music was too loud, there was more violence than I care for, and there wasn't much to the plot.  At least I saw a version with the language cleaned up. But I felt there was good acting.  For this kind of movie, anyway.  Vin Diesel may not have been Oscar caliber here, but he showed potential, especially when talking about what happened to his father and how it changed his life.  Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker were pretty good too. Ja Rule wasn't bad.<br/><br/>This was one to keep me on the edge of my seat.  I don't watch a lot of movies like these, but this was definitely one to see."

"dust-7","Null","0","1","15 February 2004"," The Clanton gang as long haul truck thieves and . . ?
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Bad acting. Bad script. 'Hot babes'. Etc. Etc. That could be a typical review. But there's more to it, in my opinion.<br/><br/>On one level, a movie about drag racing . . 'rice rockets'? The NHRA has a new 'sports compact' division. And Harley Communications felt, in Sep 2002, that 'sports compact' racing was the ""future of our sport"". That's a bit disheartening. 9-11 second lil mini-mouse motors with turbochargers instead of big blocker supercharged race engines. Some future. The trick isn't knowing when to shift, but when to push the button?<br/><br/>On the other level, it's a film about gangsters, of various sorts, and particularly the main 'crew' of commercial track hijackers. It's the latter that tends to dominate the film. And I think the film is making its points not about the 'street racing', as such, but about its suggestions and 'lessons' when it comes to armed robbery. The twist on the film is that you don't really learn the identity of the 'crew' until the end, though it's suggested all along. Meanwhile, it's a cop backstory, which in the voice over the director, Cohen, said he personally found boring, compared to other scenes. He said Ted Devine (Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs, and Luca's 'muscle' in the old Crime Story tv series) did 'his best', or something, with the scenes. It's can't be good when the director is describing the movie in this way on the DVD commentary.<br/><br/>As for the film, some things do ring true. Diesel, as best customer, phones up the 'speed shop', or whatever they now call themselves, and demands the undercover cop be fired. And the store owner reluctantly refuses. A power play. But it rings true to life. Same for the refitters, and job shops, that profit off these 'rice rocketeers', who don't ask where the money comes from. Just - sir (as from, sire) - sire, how may I serve the king? Just put the money on the table - integrity, we don't need no stinkin integrity (to borrow a line from the famous movie). From real estate to whatever, to government bribes, that does ring true. All money is 'clean', or dirty and no one cares.<br/><br/>The Vince character is the 'roid rage' guy, of the 'crew'. Give him a dirty look, and he'll play Billy the Kid and push you in the back. If he had a gun he'd come up and shoot you in the back of the head. He's the lovable psychopath that the undercover cop risks his life to rescue at the end, as Vince attempts to rob a truck at high speed, saving him from a terrified trucker with a shotgun, who becomes the 'bad guy'. The Vince character is real - little men with 10 ton chips on their shoulders, and desire to hurt people.<br/><br/>Another member of the 'crew' is the stereotype of the all-around 'genius' who flakes at the last when he loses a race, and makes off with the car he forfeited. I think they make him out to be MIT. Why they never pick Cal Tech for these films, I don't know, particularly since the story is in LA. And this is the point when the undercover guy starts to lose cover, and events are forced in other ways, as well. The 'genius' returns before the final chase to say - gee, I'm sorry. And, okay guys, it's time now the final race scene, off ya go!<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is decribed in the commentary as a 'rising star', or something of the sort. Good for him. He portrays an ex-con who runs the little band of crooks. His cars wins. He doesn't flinch when the undercover guy is caught by Vince, and Vince wants to blow him away with a shotgun. He's supposed to be 'honest', 'self-possessed', 'responsible', in some fashion, when he should be back in jail.<br/><br/>So when it comes to 'mini' racing, when it comes to gangs, this film is a clean, black and white, no consequences adolescent fantasy. This is World Wide Wrestling brought to a director's vision of import car 'turbo-racing', I guess you'd more properly call it. And will Vince makes it through you wonder? Poor ole misunderstood Vince. He just came from the wrong side of the tracks. Have pity on him. It's not his fault. He didn't choose this life. But, at the same time, be sure to throw the book at that shotgun wielding trucker. If only he'd known what a decent guy that Vince really was, deep down. I tell you - even though the director didn't want you to, I was rooting for the trucker.<br/><br/>I suppose one wonders about the popularity of Billy the Kid and John Hardin and others as popularized in serials of the day. How could people be caught up in such behavior. Maybe because it was far away, on the frontier? Maybe because it was always the guy sitting at the table, next to you, who got his head blown off for giving 'the kid' a dirty look? I don't know. But that's what this film calls to mind, for me. It's a simplistic, exaggerated glamorization of gangsterism, calling to mind the east coast 'penny dreadfuls' of generations past, and where the gang bangers are all nice, kind, good to their mothers, and always ready to be a friend to the poor and despised. In one form or another, this sort of fiction has sold well for over 100 years. And I think it's silly."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD. YE BE WARNED!<br/><br/>I expected stupid action, but with the emphasis on the ""action"" part of that phrase. The director took this movie in so many directions that I think he got lost somewhere. The <ahem> ""plot"" twists were stuck on at random in a misguided attempt to add depth to this puddle. Lose the undercover cop thread completely or actually do something with it, beef up the Tran rivalry or drop that too, add to the romantic interest, tone down the macho a**hole rivalry between the meat-head and the new guy (or at least make her a bit sympathetic to the poor loser who obviously has had a crush on her since they were kids), make the kid do a bit more to prove himself, add a couple more driving scenes with some turns instead of just straight-line acceleration, and you might just have a decent movie.<br/><br/>Of course, it would be a close copy of ""Point Break"" (substitute drivers for surfers, Vin Diesel for Patrick Swayze) with DriveTime(tm) special effects lifted from ""Driven"" and a plot that would make ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" look profound, but it would be more watchable. I found myself actually checking my watch several times. I made it through ""Pleasantville"" with only a couple of watch checks. Whoo. Yay. They hit the nitrous buttons...yet again. How thrilling.<br/><br/>Almost the only good scenes in the movie were due to the real street-racer extras who lent this movie some badly needed fun. Hotties and tricked-out cars as eye candy were great bonuses. The fast driving scenes were also well done, but a bit sparse. There was more driving around town than driving fast and furiously.

Yes sir, this movie is pretty wack, for lack of a better word. Think Point Break with cars instead of surfboards and you get this mindless fungii of a movie. To be fair, there are positives. But to be fair to Point Break, Point Break is at least a hundred thousand times better than this sludge. The first street race in the movie is pretty intense. I've gotta say it. I saw this movie on DVD and I have a pretty decent setup, so when I popped this sucker in and watched it in DTS, I was blown away. There are several other interesting action scenes but nothing that comes close to the energy of the street race. Vin Diesel was the best thing about this movie next to the ""tricked out"" rides.

","It would be easy to dismiss this movie.  But the easy choice isn't always the right one, and it isn't here, either.  Yes, there are similarities to Point Break (a good movie).  But many good movies have borrowed from other movies (check out 1980's The In-Laws and compare it to Meet The Parents if you want to see major imitation).  Lots of the characters here--but not all--seem kind of stupid, but I don't think they were trying to present rocket scientist car racers.  I think the dialogue and acting and writing actually rings true, if you pay attention.  It is nice to have an action movie that at least allows you to pay attention without feeling ridiculous for having done so (contrary to XXX, where you know from frame 1 that thinking is not welcome).  The action scenes, while not plentiful enough, are also good.  Don't let the hoard steer you away from this movie because it is ""dumb"".

","I didn't expect too much from this film.  I respect the presence Vin Diesel generates (most notably in Pitch Black, the only other film I'd seen him in besides Saving Private Ryan).  The previews of this film made me believe it was another dumb, illogical car chase movie.  I've always had a spot in my heart for the heat of street racing, having a 67 Camaro as my first car and muscling it whenever I could.  It looked like another dumb, overproduced action film.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>While Diesel and Walker definitely jelled nicely and played off each other very well, credit to this must go to Rob Cohen and his team of photographers and soundmen.  What's impressive is the feeling of speed this flick generates, and I saw it on HBO.  I regret not seeing it on the screen with a major digital sound system.<br/><br/>The plot is so-so and rather predictable, but the real stars are the cars and the races, as well as an adrenaline pumping chase sequence during an attempted hijacking of a big rig.  This has the best driving sequences since The Road Warrior.  The attention to detail, from the design of the cars to the chirping of car alarms as drivers scatter from a police raid is inspired and humorous.<br/><br/>If you were skeptical of this film, give it a chance.  It's not The Hours and doesn't aspire to be.  It's 90 minutes of well paced entertainment I couldn't shut off when it started.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen is one of our most talented action directors.

","I have always loved movies which involve fast cars, so naturally I had to see this one. I definitely think that it's better to see it on video than in the cinema. I say this because I DID see it in the cinema, and I was sitting right next to a speaker at the time. My eardrums got a thorough assault, due to the roaring of powerful engines and a pounding heavy metal and techno score. But I still loved the picture. There is no shortage of action here and the performances are rather good, especially the rapidly-rising Vin Diesel as our anti-hero Dominic Toretto. Paul Walker may be listed above him in the credits, but for my money, Diesel is the main man here. The goods are certainly delivered in this film!<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Walker plays undercover cop O'Connor who infiltrates Toretto's gang of street racers in order to find out if they are involved in a series of hijackings which look like the work of skilled drivers. He at first is unwilling to believe that Toretto may have something to do with it due to the fact that Toretto appears to be a civil type (plus O'Connor is falling in love with his sister). It first appears that Toretto's rival, a violent, and quite psychotic, Triad-type named Johnny Tran, may be the guilty party. But this may be the easy solution. <br/><br/>I had seen this picture before I had seen the earlier POINT BREAK, but as soon as I saw POINT BREAK, I could see similarties between the two. As with POINT BREAK, the easy answer is proved wrong and the truth turns out to be what you hoped wasn't true. The ending also has a similarity to POINT BREAK, which I won't reveal here. But these similarities do not mean that this film is not original. Far from it, the story is great with inventive twists and turns and you eventually find yourself rooting for Diesel.<br/><br/>The two leads are brilliant as is Jordana Brewster as Toretto's sister Mia. In addition, Toretto's racing team are well drawn (well, three of them are anyway). There's Letty, the tough chick (and Toretto's girlfriend), Jesse, the geeky but lovable mechanical expert, Vince, the violent nutjob (who takes exception to O'Connor) and Leon, the other one (he has very little distinguishing characteristics). A pre-DIE ANOTHER DAY Rick Yune is truly menacing as the sadistic Tran. <br/><br/>The cars are also brilliant. The real great ones are the Supra which thegang restores for Walker to race at an Arizona race event, the three black Honda Civics which are used for the hijackings (when did they actually start making cool-looking Civics?) and the black Dodge Charger Dieseldrives towards the end. Toretto states that he never drove the car before because itscared him. According to him, this car has 'so much torque that thechassis twisted when it came off the line', and it certainly proves itself in a final drag race near the end of the film. <br/><br/>The music score may not be to everyone's taste, but the film is overall excellent. The sequel's not too bad either!"

Vin Diesel is the head of one particular racing gang that enjoys stealing DVD players off trucks, preferring to do so while the truck is moving at high speeds, perhap for the sheer thrill of it (and spending countless money on NOS, no less).  That's just one of the movie's many idiocies, which would be forgivable if the movie was consistently entertaining.  It's not.<br/><br/>Instead of high-octance action, we get too much focus on a plot that's sleep-inducing and actors who look more comfortable posing for a magazine than enunciating dialogue.  Only Vin Diesel makes an impression, though he's certainly not aided by the giggle-inducing dialogue (""You break her heart, I break your neck"").  As for the story, it can be summed up as Point Break with fast cars and the idiots who drive them.  Lead Paul Walker is thoroughly unconvincing as the undercover cop and he shares zero chemistry with Jordana Brewster, the girl whose only purpose in the film is to make him lose his edge.  There are a couple of chase scenes near the end that are reasonably fun, but it's too little too late by then.

","It's cool that they named this movie after one of the early episodes of the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote (The Fast and The Furry-ous). I'm also amazed that it's a PG-13 (read: movie made for maximum box office appeal) that's pretty good. This review is for the Collector's Edition DVD.<br/><br/>Starring rising stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jordanna Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez (a true Hispanic hottie) and directed by Rob Cohen, the film takes us on quite a ride through the illegal sport of street racing, where combatants in souped-up import cars race at high speeds for money and the cars themselves. This interesting look at a dangerous aspect of driving is padded by a story of an undercover cop looking for criminals who steal high-priced electronics from truckers.<br/><br/>The movie has a great hip image. Whether it's the hipster clothing, the soundtrack, the men and women, or the cars, I think lots of teenage boys and girls should fall in love with this flick. As a 31 year-old, I wasn't as impressed but I still liked this film. The acting is very good and the dialogue is a lot better than most PG-13 films. Of course, you'll feel like you've been for a ""Hell of a ride"" in these amazing cars. You wish you could own one for your very own.<br/><br/>The Collector's DVD is filled with a whack of stuff. Commentary from the well-spoken director Cohen, a making-of-documentary, deleted scenes, an article called Racer X that inspired the film, three music videos, storyboards, multiple angles of scenes, and tons more. I guess after seeing it, it deserved its success in 2001. You have to respect Diesel for giving up 20 million dollars to be in a sequel. I don't think a sequel would be right for this kind of film."

The only reason that this movie has a decent rating is that it aims ENTIRELY for the 15-30 market of dumb kids (and adults) who dream about having a fast car of their own.  It also aims for sad males who like to see women in skimpy clothes who hang around men with fast cars.<br/><br/>And, as you can see by the votes, it achieved what it aimed for.  I just warn you, that if you have any level of intelligence, or you are NOT entertained by fast cars which you will never own and women who you will never meet, to stay FAR away from this movie.  It has NO story (NONE at all), terrible editing, awful dialogue, poor direction, shoddy acting and it is PACKED with random scenes which seem to only be in the movie to show more cars and women.<br/><br/>Problem with my review is, if you had any sense, you would have stayed well away from this movie, and would not be at this page.

","Okay, I know this film was aimed at the 18-25 year market, and I watched it fully aware of the fact it would be filled with roaring supercharged cars and equally supercharged attitudes, but there was one glaring oversight that ruined the total effect for me.  During the street racing scene, where the contestants successfully blocked off about 100 amazingly straight blocks of downtown LA with no apparent notice by the police or unsuspecting motorists, didn't anyone notice that the same supporters, friends, and female groupies were at the finish line RIGHT AFTER the racers arrived?  I mean, no sooner had these guys pulled up than their adoring fans, who had been at the starting line, were piling all over their cars.  What, did they follow them at the same 100+ mph speeds, or did they take the side streets?  And I'd still like to know how they managed to block off all those intersections with hundreds of spectators without tipping the rest of LA off.  For my money, I'd still take ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or the classic ""Vanishing Point."" ""Fast and Furious"" was not a bad movie, but it was about as believable as ""Cannonball Run."""

","This movie's been called a rip-off from Gone in 60 Seconds. Well I'd add up No Man's Land (1987) to the list; minus the unhappy ending. Same story: undercover cop goes into the biz, gets the thrill of racing. Difference is that this flick looks ""cooler"" because of the cars, the hard rock, the chicks ... even though this clandestine drag-racing exists, it was pushed to the ""way too unreal"" world. I doubt any street racer would have his car filled with ""Verisign"",""Verizon"" and other propaganda; it would bring even more attention to the cops. Its street racing, not NASCAR.<br/><br/>It is mildly entertaining, but there is merely ONE car chase scene in the whole movie (more like a ""chase the bike"" scene). The dialog's cheesy, the plot's swiss-cheesed (full of holes), and there is no real action (except for the aforementioned scene). There's not even enough racing, for the movie tries to develop the ""plot"" ... without success.<br/><br/>If you are looking for car chase movies, go get No Man's Land (1987), The Driver or Ronin.

","I remember watching the trailer of ""The Fast and the Furious"" in cinemas. After watching the trailer I decided it maybe a decent enough movie, with plenty of thrilling car chases through huge cities kind of like ""The Italian Job"" and ""The Driver"" style...<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious feels more like a two hour music video than a movie. What we have here is a load of loonies thinking their really cool in their powered-up Honda's with hi-fi systems so loud that they could probably wake the dead. Add in a load of muscle-bound punks, girls who try their up most to look sexy and tough and we have this dumb minded movie.<br/><br/>
Confusion also reigned during this movie, whats with the fight at the start of the movie? Lame.<br/><br/>As for the car chases...they weren't what I was expecting, it's just drag racing in flashy cars. A lot of people have praised this movie for having fantastic stunts and yes there are a few decent one's towards the end but they aren't that mesmerising  ...I've seen better.<br/><br/>The directer obviously thought he was creating some kind of ""way cool"" movie for the youth of today. With the likes of Limp Bizkit booming in the background, it's a shame this movie will seem old and out dated within a few years. <br/><br/>If your looking for a decent car chase movie watch either ""The Driver"" or ""The Italian Job"" the cars didn't look as good...but at least those movies had a plot and decent actors.<br/><br/>4/10"

But we're good guys, our leaders dad died in a car crash and that's why we are the way we are. And the truck drivers that get robbed are the bad guys of course - along with the cops. And what's with the cars???? Why are they all basically Asian or Asian-looking in America??? And those colors...yuck. What about the green light from under car....kinda cool in the races maybe, but when robbing a truck??? Get real! Everything sucked about this movie...including the actors.

","Ok I avoided this movie like the plague. The trailer made it look like nothing but stupid stunts, and sex...all while Limp Bizkit played. They made it look like a movie about car freaks, and who the heck wants to see a movie about idiots who spend thousands on something as stupid as a car?<br/><br/>Well I gave in and rented it (after a recommendation from a friend), once you get past the first 15-25 minutes of pure hollywood crap, you basically have a B-movie plot with A-movie stunts.<br/><br/>The first 15-25 min. (I didn't keep track) are pure torture. They start off with the illegal street racing scene, which is something out of the 1960's. The latinos are all in one group, the Asians are all in one group, and the blacks all hung out in one group. Apparently their love of cars brings them together, but not enough to intermix socially. And of course all of the guys in the movie look like they have been working out in the gym daily since they were five years old, and all the women look like they just got off their Playboy and Maxim photo shoots.<br/><br/>
Then of course to bring in more kids, we have to watch Ja Rule, a very annoying rapper, who should not act, or rap for that matter, get swooned over and offered a threeway. Apparently all Playboy and Maxim models are crazy for guys who will spend thousands on car parts and win at illegal street racing. And then of course it turns out that the Asians in the movie are a gang of low life thugs, another bad movie cliche.<br/><br/>And of course there is Vin Diesel's gang, which follow all the typical gang stereotypes. Vin is the cool leader, who all in the illegal car world look up to, and everybody respects and listens to. Then there is Letty (Rodriguez) who is his tough girlfriend, who is presumed frail and then kicks all male butt she comes in contact with. Then Vince (Schulze) his hot-headed right hand man, whose temper has to constantly be kept under control. Then Leon (Strong) who has no role in the gang what-so-ever, yet they make him seem important. And finally Jesse (Lindberg) who is the smartest out of all of them and has the usual ""smart guy, frail body"" physique, and is the youngest one.<br/><br/>Eventually the story is about Brian (Walker) being an undercover cop and hunting down the robbers of trucks full of electronic equipment. The dialouge and acting is cheesy, but for those who can stomach b-movie fodder, it's no big deal.<br/><br/>Basically the big payoff is the last 20 minutes, which feature amazing car chase scenes, and very cool stunts. My jaw was on the floor through some of those scenes, because you could tell that none of that was faked, no CG, just stunt drivers (maybe, I don't know if the actors did all their own stunts) and well choreographed stunts.<br/><br/>Basically I recommend you rent it, laugh at the cliches and bad dialouge and acting, and then let your jaw drop when you get to the final scenes."

","there is, actually, a reason to see it again. Or at least, to not turn off the TV when there's nothing else on and it's on cable for free, which is how I ended up watching it.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS (OF THIS FILM & OTHERS) WITHIN, PLEASE TAKE NOTE******<br/><br/>The thing to watch for here is not the extended music video B.S. that creates the excuse for whatever plot there is, to occur. What you want to watch, if you watch it again, is the rather poignant (tongue in cheek, here) love story that develops --not between Brian and Mia (who in the world thinks bland and boring Jordana Brewster is hotter than the kick-ass Michelle Rodriguez?), but between Brian and Dom! Yes, it's true --the whole Brian/Mia thing is just a front (and a very shabbily executed front, at that) to fool the ultra-macho ""target audience"" into thinking that Brian's conflict and eventual fall from grace in the eyes of the law are the result of his feelings for a girl. What feelings? What happened between Brian and Mia was a walk-through of a budding relationship. No chemistry, no romance, no sex --just some friendly eye contact and jokes about tuna fish. Yes, they do go to bed together --but you only know that because Brian gets a phone call from his boss afterward and she happens to be lying next to him when he answers. She really does not need to be in this movie at all --not even as the catalyst for the animosity between Brian and Vince, because Vince seems just as jealous of Brian's growing intimacy with Dom as with Mia. It's Dom who really inspires Brian's admiration, his respect, his friendship, his loyalty and his devotion. And Dom, to an extent, returns the favor --he takes Brian under his wing, treats Brian more as his equal than he does his motley band of punk friends; he shows Brian his special secret muscle car, exposing his sensitive side by admitting that he's scared to drive the car, telling the story of his father's death and sharing how he feels when he races. And the train/jump scene at the end --a pretty damn cool stunt, granted; but note the ""Thelma and Louise""-esque moment as they look into each others' eyes and make that death-defying jump in sync, together. And what everyone seems to forget is that Dom does not crash the black car jumping the train tracks --he gets broadsided because he's so engrossed in sharing that post-jump bonding moment with Brian that he doesn't see the other car coming. Then at the end, you'd expect there to be some sort of conflict in Brian's mind as he could either make his big bust and put away a legitimate criminal, or let Dom go. Hell, even Jennifer Lopez in ""Out of Sight"" shot George Clooney when she had to. But Brian doesn't hesitate. He not only lets Dom go, but gives him a rather expensive getaway car.<br/><br/>In short, trust me: this movie is very (and I'm sure, unintentionally) amusing to watch, in the proper light.<br/><br/>That all said, Vin Diesel --even in this shallow sort of offering-- is crazy/sexy/cool, and I wouldn't blame anyone of any gender or persuasion for following his scrumptious ass around."

Both Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are really hot but the acting wasn't to great, but what can you expect when  you are dealing with such bad dialogue with my personal fav being ""Smoke 'em"".  I think the music helped out a lot since the plot was lame.<br/><br/>
(SPOILERS):  In the last hijacking scene, how could there have not been any other cars on that highway?  They could have at least shown a couple of other cars get run off the road.  And why didn't Dom race Johnny Tram at race wars? The race wars was built up to be this big event, but then hardly anything happened. We only saw 2 short races there.<br/><br/>
And I would have liked to seen a better ending. At least show Paul Walker get led off in handcuffs. I mean, those guys robbed truckers and could have killed people on the road, and the cop just lets them go at the end because we(the audience) are supposed to see the Johnny Tram gang as being the really bad guys.  Dom's gang was just as bad, and I can't believe a real cop would just let them get away like that.  And another problem I had was if someone wrecks a car going 160 mph, I don't think they could just get out and walk away with a little cut on the head. If they didn't get killed, they at least would have a bunch of broken bones or be knocked unconscious.(END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>

Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil) is okay. She was better in Resident evil. Somehow though, all these combinations were horrible.<br/><br/> The plot itself is just stupid.

The rating board must have been pressured by the company who released THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS into a PG-13, because this film should've been rated R. I was reading a review a critic wrote, and he said that two male teenagers in front of him said, ""Man, that should've been rated R."" The critic said he couldn't agree more. Same here. Not even the small amount of violence in this film should make it R, but the language(I counted at least 3 F words), and the street racing. After this movie was released I saw on the news that some percentage of car accidents had gone up. I forget how much though.<br/><br/>
Still, does all this make the FAST AND THE FURIOUS a pass? You can decide for yourself on your own taste. I personally, even if it was stupid, am glad for watching it just for the races, cars, and the HUGE stunt at the end. Other than that, I wouldn't watch it. But if you like cars and stunts, and really big, adrenaline pumped guy movies, than I wouldn't pass THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS UP just for the stupid stuff. It's not incredibly bad, because the above I mentioned makes up for it. It's a hard vote, but I'll give it a 3. Not for a film as a whole, but for the small sequences I loved in it. 3/5 stars."

","Cross Point Break with Gone in 60 Seconds - and you get this one. Boring, predictable, unoriginal; good-looking good guys, bad-looking good guys, really bad bad guys and really good bad guys. BORING as boring can be. The dialogue is so pathetic, one feels sorry for great actors like Diesel who probably were not allowed to change the dialogue and say it better. I CAN'T BELIEVE this film... I have to admit though that most of the actors are pretty good (should be especially hard with a dialogue that primitive and the film so predictable in every single moment.) Also, the last few scenes are much more dynamic and interesting and dramatic and have at least SOME degree of unpredictability (not like anyone wonders in the last few minutes about Brian and what he will do, huh?) Also, Jordana Brewster after an incredible start in The Faculty never got any good roles (I hope someone will make a Love Story remake - she would get an Oscar for that probably), but COME ON - one hears/sees Yale and her intellect in every sentence, body move, smile, etc. - what the... would this girl be doing as a waitress/homemaker to her driver brother? Anyway, I'm pretty disappointed but I don't think the film is bad - it's just average - nothing one would expect from these actors - would have been pretty good for category B movies. I hope Brewster and Diesel get better in picking scripts (or agents) next time. I still think they (and Walker) are really good actors. Good luck to them but not to the folks who made this film.

","As others have already said, I didn't have an interest in seeing this movie, even though my friends always made a big deal about it. The only way I was seeing this movie was if I didn't have to pay for it, which I didn't.  I enjoyed the fast cars, because, I like fast cars.  I am sure that this movie, and the sequel which is scheduled to come out next year, will forever be a cult classic amongst the import-race car enthusiasts.  Yet, those people will watch the movie not for the amazing acting or directing or writing, but for the fast paced car scenes.  This is the way I would only watch this movie again, just to see the fast cars. Vin Diesel was boring, monotone, and simply unbelievable as a person.  His speeches were well rehersed, but they came off as phony and unemotional. Paul Walker was perhaps the best actor in the movie.  I have seen him in other films so I know this wasn't his acting high point. I would have to blame the director and/or the writer for this.  Walker had his moments, but there were some very lame ones too. There were too many points in the movie that left me hanging. Diesel's character and the leader of the Asian gang exchange some words early on in the film which builds the tension and the excitement for the rest of the movie.  The whole time I am thinking that we are going to see a hard core drag race match-up between the two characters- and we never do.  We see a fist fight between them, but it isn't what I wanted.  It wasn't what the film pumped up.  The final scene was just about pointless and useless for the film.  Nothing was resolved. A drag race and a car is demolished.  Out of everybody, we know that one person is dead, another wounded, a couple MIA, and nothing is certain, or even hinted at what the future has for the two main characters.<br/><br/>It had good editing, and good cinematography, but that can't make the movie. Bad acting, bad directing along with a bad script simply made the movie bad.  I give it a 5 out of 10, only because I wanted to see the cars, and wanted to see if it was going to get any better. I was really anticipating a nude scene, or even some more skin with Michelle Rodriguez, yet that never happened either. I was disappointed by her role as well, since I had heard all this excitment about her in the movie."

Paul Walker wasn't a bad actor but Vin Diesel underacted his part so bad that it ruined the movie for me (man did that guy sound like an idiot). Ja Rule's scene was one of the most pathetic piece of movie i have ever seen in my life. He couldn't even see above the steering wheel he was so short (were talking Honda Civics here). The plot was okay, but since it had already been done in Point Break im not going to give this movie any points for it.

Quite frankly if they were travelling that fast in those type of car, the cars would have tore themselves apart. Vin Diesal sounds like he's talking in slow motion and thus sounds very dumb.

","I'm a big fan of cars, being an avid player of games like Gran Turismo.

But that's not the only thing wrong with this movie. Let's forget for a moment that the plot is really thin, the dialogue horrible, and there's no acting to speak of. The racing is just plain unrealistic. A car speeding by at over 100 miles/hour, spinning out of control and stopping within 20 yards is just not possible. And you can't possibly survive a collision at over 100 mph when you're not wearing at least seatbelts and preferably a helmet. And if you would, you would never be able to get up, get into another car and speed away. There's a lot of action in the movie, but it's never involving. To be honest I had expected more from the director of ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"". I suggest you watch ""Driven"" or ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" if you want to see some real exciting racing."

","""The Fast and the Furious"" is basically your standard summer blockbuster - stupid, loud, and lots of explosions.  Amazingly, this movie sinks to depths that most summer blockbusters have never reached.<br/><br/>The story surrounds an undercover FBI agent (Paul Walker) who is trying to find out who has been stealing electronics equipment.  This leads him to a group of underground street drag racers.  Despite the numerous plot holes, such as the idiotic way in which the criminals go about stealing the equipment, and Walker's inexplicable behavior, this movie actually could've been good.  The premise is interesting, and the drag racing scenes are fairly exciting.<br/><br/>Where this movie falters is the characters.  None of them are interesting, and despite the script's best efforts, they are all two-dimensional.  The performances are awful, with the exception of Vin Diesel, who is merely average.  Walker delivers his stupid catch phrases inconvincingly monotone. Perhaps the script is much to blame here, for I've often believed that good performances are highly influenced by the script, i.e. a good actor can give a bad performance if the dialogue is bad.  Well, anyway, the dialogue is simply some of the worst in any big budget movie I've seen recently.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the action sequences are pretty good.  However, this simply cannot make up for a senseless script and horrible acting.  Not really worth seeing, unless you really like action, with nothing to back it up.<br/><br/>* 1/2 out of ****"

","This is a B movie to the ""t""!  Bad acting (except for vin diesel), cheesy lines, unoriginal story, but a fairly original subject matter for a movie... Street racing.  And did I mention revolutionary/AWESOME direction of action and racing scenes.   The last 5 minutes of the movie alone are worth the money to see this movie.  It leaves you with one hell of a WOW feeling. The movie features ""new"" car racing, that is mostly Asian Cars suped up with nitris oxide or premium engine modifications to make them extra fast. Only at the end do we see the highlight of the film an old hot rod that leavez you droolin at the sound of it's revving. This movie is pretty much an exact remake of Point Break except with Street racing the subject matter instead of surfing.  But the storyline and plot are good enough to get you through to all the action/racing scenes which are incredible and groundbreaking. The director does an awesome job with the action/racing scenes.  The new cool way the race scenes are filmed can be compared to the new cool way the fighting scenes were filmed in the matrix (except no special effects here). The movie has a certain element of pazzaz and the race scenes and the action scenes in general are well done and suspenseful as hell.  You gotta see this movie."

The last great ones that come to mind are Days of Thunder and The Wraith. Even though the plot seemed very familiar (Point Break), I was very impressed.<br/><br/>The action did not stop. Lots of Laughing gas and tricked out cars going 140+ mph. Although I am not a big fan of imports, I liked to see they did things the right way. Most cars I see like that are all show and no go. These really moved! Granted they had to drop like $80k to get them into the 10's... But there is a lot of work that needs to be done to a small engine to turn that kind of power.<br/><br/>My hands were still shaking from the adrenaline rush 20 minutes after the movie ended.

The movie starts off promisingly enough, but quickly degenerates into a poor copy of 1991's ""Point Break."" All they did was substitute cars for surf boards!  Of course, ""Point Break"" actually went through the bother of explaining Keanu Reeves motivation. Without giving away a small surprise, ""The Fast and the Furious"" never adequately explains why Paul Walker's character wanted to enter the world of racing.  Was he trying to advance his career?  Did he simply love the smell of new cars, and who doesn't!?!  In any event, his motivation, and several other things are left to the audiences imagination.<br/><br/>So is this a terrible movie?  No, not really.  Plot deficiencies aside, the racing scenes are really quite well done.  On many occasions the camera moves inside the engine, and we are able to see and hear the pistons roar!  The movie plays like a two hour music video, with a soundtrack that rarely screeches to a halt.  With a deft touch, this movie could have amounted to something.

I'm glad the scene has crossed over into all racial groups but this film p***ed me off for demeaning asians as being gangsters and having money,guns and being wimps.

This may seem overly critical but either the writer was seriously obsessed with fast cars, had an acute case of testosterone poisoning, or both.

The cars may have changed, but not much else. Street racing has always been and will be, a part of our culture (if not a somewhat darker part) as long as there are automobiles on roads. The acting is ""average"", although Vin Diesel is beginning to make it very plain that he is coming into his own as he gets more work. -Very cool in Pitch Black by the way. I give the action scenes a high score as they do give the viewer an excellent impression of the speed experienced behind the wheel of these cars. Special effects and stunts are ""well toned"" and placed where they need to be. By now you might guess that I really enjoyed this flick.

","This movie is for all the young punks in their late teens/early twenties who spend all their hard-earned money from Structure or Banana Republic on air intakes and turbo chargers for their Honda Civics. It's an action flick glorifying the lives of these young punks who drive their souped up pieces of s***.

It came as no surprise to me that I was probably the oldest person in the theater when I watched this.  And I am 26 years old!<br/><br/>This film has the architecture of a porn.  The spine of the movie is the action, but there always seems to be a token plot.  Ok, so this undercover police officer is trying to bust these car-racing hoodlums, and falls in love with the sister of the leader.  The writers seemed to put something into that aspect of the story.  So what happens to the couple at the end? Nobody knows.  And why should we?  It had nothing to do with the fast driving.  The writers tried to develop a character for Vin Diesel, but they forgot one thing: a story that actually needs a developed character!  The ""emotional"" scenes were thrown in randomly, as were the personality traits of the characters.  Presumably, just so that they could say that ""The Fast and the Furious"" is really a ""movie"".

The locations were great to shoot a car race on due to the hills in California. It's good to see that the female mechanic and racer were depicted in this movie, although they could have come from another form than Michelle Rodriguez, who probably doesnt know what a spark plug is let alone a transmission, motor, engine, radiator, suspension, shocks, etc. just due to her looks. It's a good movie if you can get yourself over the embarrassment of how bad the acting is.

"baugust1","10","0","1","24 June 2001"," Incredible!
","Being a part of the import scene, I was extremely nervous about the release of ""The Fast and the Furious"".  Visions of riced-out Civic's running 7 second quarter miles danced through my nightmares for weeks on end.  We even went out and rented The Skulls (with Paul Walker) and Pitch Black (with Vin Diesel) just to see what the acting was going to be like.  We had already seen The Faculty, so we knew what a hotty Jordana Brewster was.<br/><br/>You cannot imagine my relief on opening night, as we emerged from the theater.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  There were very few ridiculous antics to be seen anywhere in the film.  My beefs are as follows:<br/><br/>Civics driving under big rigs.  Totally unrealistic.  But come on, this is Hollywood.  It looked cool, just let it go.<br/><br/>They lead you to believe green non-turbo Eclipse is turbocharged.  Anyone associated with the industry knows all about that Eclipse.  It has been in magazines and is well documented.  The film makers even admit to the fact that it is a non-turbo, yet still proceed to tell you it IS turbocharged and even dubbed in blow-off valve noises when it shifts.  But again, its a MOVIE.  We have actors pretending to be things they are not, so what is the difference if they pretend the car is something its not.<br/><br/>Paul Walker's acting.  From time to time in the movie, he really nails a line and conveys incredible amounts of emotion.  (Like the scene where he and Dom are eating lunch alone together)  But other times his delivery is just plain flat.  (Like where he offers up his pink slip to race)  If you just focus on the acting of Vin Diesel (which was just awesome) you should be able to overlook Paul Walker's short comings.<br/><br/>They had to bring something illegal into it.  Well, apart from the fact that street racing is illegal in the first place, that is.  I am sure there is someone, somewhere, who street races and IS in fact a criminal.  But the way it is portrayed in this movie is just ridiculous.  But again, this is Hollywood we are talking about.  If there was nothing like that going on, there would be no plot.  Just be happy its not drugs.<br/><br/>Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.<br/><br/>So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.<br/><br/>The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.  The action is great AND believable (if you can overlook a few minor things).<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS MOVIE!  In fact, I am about to go see it again right now."

","(contains minor spoilers)<br/><br/>I saw The Fast And The Furious opening weekend. I loved the previous year's high-budget car movie, Gone In 60 Seconds, so I was looking forward to this one. It was ok, but I was pretty disappointed. I was looking for something that would really push things a bit and add something new. Instead, you get this mediocre cliched undercover cop movie.<br/><br/>The only two scenes that stand out after seeing the movie are the first street race where Paul Walker kills his car off and the final scene. The rest, even the highway scene either have been done way too much before or just aren't very impressive.<br/><br/>This is a B-movie. It may have made over three times its budget, but The Fast and The Furious is still a B-movie. It's an action movie too, so there really aren't any demanding roles here. You could put Walter Cronkite in Paul Walker's role (maybe even Michelle Rodriguez's role) and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. That's because Vin Diesel carries the film. He's the only thing that saved this one. He adds quite a bit to the action scenes. He's a great actor too. That's always a plus. Still, he can't save The Fast and The Furious from mediocrity. Maybe if the characters and action scenes weren't so cliched, this would have been better. The car freaks may be impressed, but I'm the kind of guy who would take an old 1988 Pontiac over what they were driving.<br/><br/>6/10"

The story was pretty good, they talked like people really do in society today, and they had great stunts.  If you buy one movie in the next month it should be The Fast and The Furious.

","I loved the film I have only watched it 3 times but the first time I saw it was yesterday so I suppose it is quite a lot. All of you people who say that you didn't like it because it had no plot obviously don't know what you are talking about. And people who say that it wasn't supposed to be an interesting movie and that the best line was ""I'll have the tuna"" also don't have a clue.<br/><br/>Of course this film had good cars pretty girl and gorgeous men but then what film doesn't! Saying that it hadn't been thought out. Have you even listened to the film. One line which I love and has obviously been thought out is said by Domonic(Vin Diesel)who is a brilliant actor for any1 who says hes not ,and that was :""I live my life a quarter mile at a time ,nothing else matters.....for those 10 seconds or less I'm free"" That is actually how some people feel about racing and whatever they do.<br/><br/>This film is NOT about fast girls and fast cars it is about what life is like for people who do this in real life. It is about how people feel about their team and about friendship because come on the cop gives up on his job for his friends and his love. If you go in expecting it to be fast girls and fast cars then you will see it as that but if you go in with an open mind you will see that it is the best movie ever made. The cars girl and men are all just bonuses to the brilliant storyline! GO SEE IT AND YOU WILL LOVE IT LIKE I DO!"

","First things first: this is one shallow movie - but it knows it. The eye-candy cast, thumping music and racing glamour all follow the basic rules of pulling in the punters, but it's none the worse for it. The director has managed to bring out the street ambience of the setting, the dialogue is functional without being especially memorable and the plot is surprisingly tense at times. Realism quite clearly goes out the window within the first few scenes, but is hardly worse than most action movies. Some may find it all too familiar, but ultimately there's no denying the enjoyment value."

","In terms of the profile of the performers involved and the money spent on its production, this film seems to be a minor picture in comparison to the megabucks blockbusters the studios release. However, considering it was made by a major studio and apes the style of the blockbusters, you can't really call this an Independent picture either. It seems the best way to define this movie is as a B-Movie, changes in film convention and monetary inflation notwithstanding.<br/><br/>This is not intended to devalue the film - Assault on Precinct 13, New Jack City and some of the best movies of the 1940s were B-movies. All it means is it doesn't have stars and doesn't pretend to be a particularly original work of art, and would consider itself a success if enough people buy tickets for it to make its money back. Many such films are forgettable, some are patently awful, some are entertaining on some level, while a few manage to hit the right mixture and make for very good cinema. They also used to provide a great breeding ground for new talent to try their luck with limited resources and less risk than the big leagues, and the cinema could do with more such opportunities for new film-makers to try out. ""The Fast<br/><br/>And The Furious"" doesn't quite hit the heights achieved by John Carpenter's early work or the golden age of Noir but I'm certainly not sorry I watched it.<br/><br/>Paul Walker comes across as a blond Keanu but is engaging as the undercover cop investigating high-speed robberies whose culprits seem to hang around the illegal street racing scene in LA. Vin Diesel (who was superb as the convict in Pitch Black) is charismatic in the more interesting ""guy on the edge"" role, and everyone else does their job effectively. The familiar story follows of an undercover mission  becoming complicated by loyalty, emotions, and things not being as simple as they look, with some good high speed driving sequences along the way. The performances, direction, characterisation and dialogue are not exactly Oscar-winning but to use the racing analogies used by all the papers who reviewed this movie, it is flashy, has a good engine and overcomes a slight lack of finesse through pace and energy. Better still, you can tell from the opening titles and delirious first race that this is not intended as anything more than fun entertainment, so you forgive the cliches and occasional false move from the script. It certainly stands comparison with any of the $100m mega productions against which it was competing.<br/><br/>The whole thing plays out nicely to a big action finale, and it chooses one of the handful of recognised ways for a story like this to end. Overall, it was a fun movie and worth watching once for anyone who likes a bit of unpretentious high speed fun. Rent the video, relax and enjoy."

","Taking one of the words out of the title, I am furious that the film did not live up to its potential.  By this I mean the fact that yet again, we have a dumb Hollywood script laden with the corniest lines imaginable.  Credibility is also riding high in deficiency, when you consider the fact that Vin Diesel's character must be invincible, seeing as how he manages to escape injury, after colliding with a truck at over 150 mph.  Retreating back from the criticism for a moment, the cars in the film are breathtaking and the score certainly pumps out serious wattage--although that's the problem, the cars are the focus point and being that's the case, shouldnt Rob Cohen (the director) have constructed better action sequences, that actually had depth enough to keep his audience entertained.  You would think so.<br/><br/>Struggling to find a commendable word to say I can only consider the aspects about the film that could have been so easily improved, given the subject matter; if you think about it fast cars, babes, violence and sex should make for a solid, thrilling 90 minutes.  Instead we settle for the sluggish, dull experience that most of us would gladly replace with GONE IN 60 SECONDS any day of the week.  Let's face it at least GONE IN 60 had Angelina, not to mention action guru Jerry Bruckheimer on board.<br/><br/>Despite the distinct lack of praise from, well a large proportion of the western hemisphere, 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' still managed to be lucrative by taking $144 million at the US box office.

There are definitely many people who consider fast cars young chicks, adrenaline and all that other stuff around extremely cool. And this is a movie for them. Virtual reality, something that WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. The movie accomplished this task, no doubt about it. If you are in a target group - I would say that would be mostly men under 25 - you will probably like it. Fast cars, lot of racing scenes, dynamic music, clipish cinematography, easy-on-the-eyes chicks -  nothing important is missing. You will be attracted by the atmosphere of the movie so much, you will forgive it apparent non-senses, lame plot, dumb dialogues and unbelievability - but gosh, who cares, virtual reality does not have to be believable.<br/><br/>All of us who expect movies to reflect reality at least to certain extent, and to portrait some aspects of life in original way, yes, we have to be disappointed.

"Stealth-5","Null","0","1","7 March 2002"," Sure It's Fast...& Furious, But Wheres The Story?
","The Fast & The Furious was a great film when it came to a limited extent. That was with cars, sure the film is basically based upon Cars, Violence & Women, the film still manages to get your adrenalin puping in your system whether you are a cars fan or not.<br/><br/>Yet Fast & The Furious in depth is deeply flawed, when you look at all of it's attributes the movie can become unpleasant because there is basically a lack of plot. Every film starts off with a plot, yet one can even tell they had a problem even working on a PLOT SUMMARY of the film, because there really isn't much more to talk about other than cars. I suppose the plot summary should have been ""POINT BREAK: ON THE ROAD"". The movie bascially copies Point Break (Keanu Reeves) and just places all the action and adrenalin on the road.<br/><br/>The cars in the film are fantastic to look at, and the cinematography is simply magical. When you look at the acting, it is on a half-half par, the scenes with Vin Diesel & Paul Walker just weren't dramatic enough, even though the two do seem to do a good job at other times. Sure the car has fantastic cars, sexy women & a great adrenelin rush, it simply cant go passed the BORDERLINE/GOOD barrier in my ratings barrier, although a stronger plot really would have placed this in the rankings of excellence.<br/><br/>ACTING: Acting was mediocore in total, nothing overwhelming by any of the cast, yet most of the cast do a good enough job playing their characters.Vin Deisel & Paul Walker should have intensified their scenes.<br/><br/>ACTORS: The variety of actors in the film are good, though there were thousands of extra's in the film too, thats to be appreciated. Vin Deisel is still going strong with his career so is Paul Walker, the female leads were a good choice for their teasing roles.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Poor, i don't find how one can simply write a film based on cars, the plot line was very thin and quiet silly. The script wasn't well written, the cinematography did it all for the film, the script basically wasn't needed, dialogue wasn't good at all. Not a good attempt.<br/><br/>CINEMA: The cinematography in Fast & The Furious was quiet amazing, during many of the scenes you wander ""How did they do that?"" . The camera work is fantasic, the locations although not pretty, do set the atmosphere for the film, a great job that should be applauded.<br/><br/>ACTION: I don't really know what genre this film would be calssified as, it had abit of everything in it, that doesn't mean it passed each category. The action wasn't really intense, the comedy was low, the drama was low, it wasn't very thrilling either, yet a few scenes did leave your blood pumping for more.<br/><br/>MUSIC/SOUND: The soundtrack to Fast & Furious is great, i loved the trancey beats used during the drag scenes, excellent. The sound on the other hand was truely screeching to the ears, the cars didn't sound nice despite their looks, a good enough job though.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Fast & The Furious is a good movie, again only in a few terms, every other term is flawed, the script is thin and lame whie the Cinematography is beautiful. The acting is good, while it was low on action. I guess this movie is for hardcore car fans, although i would think they wouldn't even realise a plot is missing, i love cars...i love girls...i love things that are Fast & Furious, but i don't love this movie as much as others do, come on people, look passed the cars and the girls, there really is no story! Hence nothing to ride home about, even though it had great potential.<br/><br/>*** (3 STARS) out of 5."
"matte-13","Null","0","1","7 March 2002"," The Fast and the Fantasy
","Ok it's very easy to shoot this film down if you are over 25 and/or have half a brain.  Yes the plot is as thin as Ally McBeal, yes the dialogue is as cheesy as the milk shelf in my fridge and the characters are as false as me nan's front teeth. BUT if you are into movies there are some great things going for this well-crafted thrill ride.<br/><br/>I will say early on though that I'm a little biased as I love hot cars and women (they do exist), and I drive a modified H@nda myself, although not quite the extremely expensive machine that these people drive. I have rubbed up against that kind of 'scene' in the UK, but I have to say it's not at all that attractive.  It's more a mixture of p***ed up lager-lads in N*vas with their fat lasses flashing their tits, or for the older gen, a few meetings in depressing shopping centre car parks standing in the rain talking to some pretty obsessive people about how they got their new air intake pipe to fit properly.<br/><br/>Anyway, I would recommend the DVD as the director's commentary is particularly good and actually shows you that there was a lot more intelligence behind this movie than first meets the eye.<br/><br/>Things that interested me:  Rob Coen shot LA in a new way - using locations showing the little backstreets and the hills in its glorious SoCal sunshine (I was there recently and this is the LA I saw). He chose a multiracial cast.  This is very important here.  One of the points he makes in the movie is that in this particular scene, like the rave scene, the young people are getting over their past problems and all have this one thing in common - the love of speed.  There is an early scene where our golden boy meets a latino racer and they initially face off, you are expecting some kind of racially-oriented dialogue, but they end up joking about the vehicle's engine and showing some mutual respect. Most people will miss this subtle scene but it's very important. So the cast is interesting in that they reflect that mix - it's just a shame they were given dialogue lifted straight from the A-Team (""It's not how you stand by your car its how you drive it"".. er yeah.. ok). The film was inspired by an article about an import car scene that does exist in LA, and also around New York and many of the real 'racers' can be seen in the crowd shots.<br/><br/>I felt let down by the attention paid to detail in dealing with the machinery.  The language they use is definitely aimed at your mum who knows nothing about cars.  Yes correct emphasis was placed on NOS and electronic engine/ turbo management but was done in a way that actually made me cringe. Sorry it just was not realistic despite the director's best intentions.<br/><br/>Technically the film shines with some fantastic visual effects, a mix of CG and some pretty new stunt techniques ***spoiler - eg. using a special stretched van with a mockup car shell complete with actor slung between its axles that can be handbraked around... The sound production is absolutely awesome.  You just have to sit back, ignore the lack of cerebral material and just enjoy the ride. Hopefully in surround sound with the bass whacked up. I don't think the filmmakers had any pretentions about the type of film they were making, or who it was aimed at, so I find myself forgiving them for some of the bad points.  A little irresponsible maybe, in the complete lack of reference to safety features (seatbelts???) and the consequences of a) spending ALL your spare cash and time doing up a car and b) losing that car on a bend and seeing what happens when you hit the armco barrier.<br/><br/>So kids, great film, but at the end of the day if you want to do this for real, it will cost you a LOT of money - THOUSANDS OF POUNDS, you will pay your car's worth again in INSURANCE and that's IF you can get it insured, your girlfriend will possibly dump you, or trash your car out of jealousy (unless you find one with the same passion - very rare -good luck), and the POLICE and their SPEED CAMERAS will do their best to help you RUIN your license. So be careful out there!!<br/><br/>Oh and don't get a V**xhall, get a H*nda (your gran's C1vic is a better car than your best mate's N*va believe me)  :)"

I spent half the movie trying to figure out how these deadbeats could afford these cars.  Ok.  So, the good guy and the bad guy become friends.  The good guy doesn't want him to be the bad guy and tries to find someone else to blame for the crimes being investigated.  (I think that had something to do with the bad guys sister being the love interest of the good guy.)  I continued to watch this waiting for some kind of plot to unfold and then suddenly there was the end.  There was this very short climax that involved bad guys getting shot or shot at and lots of very expensive cars being mangled.  The main good guy and the main bad guy have a showdown.  Blah, blah, blah.  And then the good guy lets the bad guy drive off into the sunset.  We have no idea what happens to the bad guy in the hospital, the still living members of the main bad guys gang, or the (very upset betrayed feeling) love interest of the good guy, or even the very very young undercover cop himself.

","The Fast and the Furious was full of action and adventure - it's just that it was all very implausible with all these young men driving very expensive cars and betting their pink slips on one race. Yet, the main character Paul Walker is driving these expensive machines while deriving his income as an auto parts delivery boy! If I were to rate this movie on action/adventure alone it would warrant a 7-8, but then if you only watched movies for that aspect you should just rent any generic van Damme movie. Somewhat original depiction of the Japanese cars mod craze where cars are chopped and modified by teens to inject some sportiness into bland Honda Civics. Because of the originality of the cars my 14 year old son was glued to the TV waiting for the next ""sweet"" machine to emerge. If you like cars and fast driving scenes this is a movie I'd recommend, but the theme is highly implausible and the hijack scenes are borderline Jackie Chan."

The plot being a police officer who joins the gang under cover(the same),thinks its a rival gang from the same neighbourhood doing the steeling but is proved wrong(the same),makes a connection with Diesel(Bodie) and finds himself in moral dilema(the same),falls for a girl in the gang and finds it sways his judgment(the same).

","As other reviews have stated, this is a carbon copy of 'Point Break', except with cars! Only thing is, 'Point Break' was much better! The plot points are just way too similar and even Paul Walker sounds like Keanu Reeves- which is really uncanny! The difference between the two films is that 'Point Break' had better characters, more realism and heightened suspense for an action movie! 'The Fast and the Furious' is strongly missing these elements. Some of the dialogue is really bad, but also the characters are very flat and there seems to be hokey attempts to develop some of them. Dominic (Vin Diesel) is developed slightly along with Jesse (Chad Lindberg), but Brian (Paul Walker), the main character, has no real apparent motive or development! Also, Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) is completely uninteresting in a unconvincing romance between her and Brian.<br/><br/>The cars, and drag races themselves are well done and fast-paced. The editing and visual effects are great, and the cinematography is nice as well. Actually, the cinematography seems to be the core aspect of the scenes/shot rather than the performance. Director, Rob Cohen ('Dragonheart', 'The Skulls') seems to focus on action and visuals rather than drama in 'The Fast and the Furious'! The fact that the story is just too similar to 'Point Break' gives grounds of comparison for this film. 'The Fast and the Furious' lacks drama, and believability, even for an action film! The acting is nothing sensational, and is distracted by slick visuals and lame story-line and dialogue! It's okay to watch, and isn't as bad as others have said, but still I'm glad I didn't see this one at the cinemas. Average! Didn't absolutely hate it, and I was entertained with the impressive car racing scenes. **1/2 out of *****!"

Not that unparralelled realism is expected in car movies (after all, it's not like the Gone in 60 Seconds remake was filmed with REAL GT500s), but most of the cars in the movie were not ""hooked-up""... although some of them were (Vin Diesel's love interest's red 240SX is quite famous in the import community and sports an SR20DET; the Supra has a very impressive build sheet and has been featured on ebay several times, etc...)<br/><br/>The movie's not only fake in terms of the cars featured, but its' portrayal of street racing and the sport compact car culture is SO far off as well. 180 mph down city streets!?  Setups which DON'T exist?  (The SR20/Civic swap has been completed ONCE in real life; T4s in DSMs are unheard-of, and the ""naussss"" references.)  The show's portrayal of asian-americans and the absurdity of many of the races setups and scenes (Jetta vs. S2000 with ""$100k under the hood""... riiiiight...) were particularily awful.<br/><br/>Notice I haven't even mentioned the (totally absurd and unrealistic) plot yet?<br/><br/>Now, I'm a big fan of imports, and I even like cheezy, special-effect-substitute-for-budget movies most of the time.

(That's better than 2 miles a minute, bucko!)<br/><br/>Second, why do movie makers keep insisting that ""Nitrous"" is the automotive equivalent of Warp Speed?   Attention, directors and teenage racer-boys: No, you can't accelerate from 120mph to over 150 in a split second when you ""get on the button.""<br/><br/>Third, is there no ""due process"" in the Califonia justice system?  Why did all the drag race spectators have to split when the cops came?  Is it illegal to be parked at the side of a city street there?<br/><br/>Anyway, those were some points that annoyed me.

Everyone knows that people who fix cars are idiots, but do they really have to stereotype them so?  Also, their sentences and word order made sense instead of trying to rearrange words arbitrarily like some kind of altavista language translator.

This was about a bunch of cars going fast.  I was expecting something more along the lines of Sense and Sensibility, but all I got was action instead.  The characters were awful, exhibiting a range of emotions and dynamics.  If you want to see fast cars, you should watch NASCAR.  That is, unless you wanna see something besides an ovular race track populated by rednecks and West Virginians (my apologies to the cross-eyed, brilliant people of West Virginia).

","I attended an advance screening of ""The Fast and the Furious"" with high anticipation. Here, I thought, is my cool sexy action movie for the summer. I was looking for pure entertainment with just a thread of credibilty. What I got was a lopsided movie with great cars, amazing stunts, crappy acting, and bad editing. If one-fourth of the attention given to the cars had been paid to the acting and the human film story, the movie would have been just fine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie really reminded me of Point Break with Keanu Reeves, only instead of surfing, street racing is the centerpiece.Both stories are completely improbable. Both stories involve green cops sent to infiltrate gangs of thieves who use the loot to fund their expensive hobbies. In both films, the hero jeopardizes his case by gaining a dangerous level of respect for the charismatic leader of the band of thieves.  The big difference between the two films is that while Point Break works, The Fast and the Furious does not. The failing point of this film is the lead actor. Paul Walker is the sucking-chest wound of this movie. Yeah, he's pretty, but he completely unable to emote or communicate anything about his character. Even in the presence of excellent actors like Vin Diesel and Ted Levine, he is like a plank of wood. Jordana Brewster isn't too pro either.

The major flaw in the script (or lack there of) was that the movie could not decide what direction it wanted to go in.  You had the story of the James Earl Spilner (the loser ""wanna-be"" detective), Dominic Toretto (the crazy Racer), his sister (the cute love interest of Spilner), ""The Mad Scientist"" (the mechanic with ADHD), Johnny Tran (the Asian gangster) and the rest of the bunch.  The movie really neglected character development.  We never get a chance to really meet any of them.  The film just briefly touches upon them, doesn't elaborate, then moves onto something else.<br/><br/>
Another problem was story lines:  You have Spilner who's trying to nail the crime ring, you have Toretto who's trying to make money off of Racing and stealing some electronic shipments, you have Tran who's doing his own crime stuff, ""the MAD SCIENTIST"" trying to get money so him and his dad can go off and live somewhere nice, and so on and so forth.

If it weren't for his looks I don't believe he could have made it into the acting business; there is no discernment between his character in this movie, and all of his others. While I was watching ""The Fast and The Furious"" I had to check and make sure it wasn't ""The Skulls"" or one of the other extremely terrible teen movies he's been in. He is not an actor, all he does it say his lines from a script written from him...but where was the heart in his performance(if you could call it that)?<br/><br/>This movie was so terrible that the second time I tried to watch it, suggested by a friend who came over the next night, I fell asleep. The plot was so thin I thought I was watching a bunch of Anorexic(SP?) teen movie ""stars"" trying to make themselves look like actors.<br/><br/>The only other decent actor I could find in the movie was Rick Yune, whose part was not nearly emphasized enough... poor Rick. But for the racing scenes, I thought they were great... every time I listen to The Crystal Method I feel like hopping into my friend's Honda 2000, cranking up the NOS and heading for a straight stretch.<br/><br/>I give this movie only a three. In fact, it only got the three BECAUSE of the cars, the races, some of the music, and the few beautiful females. It could have received a four... but the the females had to keep their clothes on. I don't suggest anyone with a need for some intellectual stimulation watch the movie, unless you're extremely high or in need of material to make fun of.  For those of you who really loved, and got caught up in this movie...man, it isn't even worth my time to scold you."
"cgcrossont","4","0","1","5 February 2002"," ...and I thought ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" was silly!
","Let me start off by saying that I have yet to watch any believable car movie in my 33 years on earth. One would think that as time went on and movie technology improves, the car movies would get better also. Not happening! This movie makes ""Days of Thunder"", ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", ""Hot Rod"", ""CannonBall Run"", ""Dukes Of Hazzard"", etc. look realistic. I know it's a movie but how about getting some pros on the set to monitor some of the situations and common terms? I am in the racing business so I may be a little extra hard to please but I'm not that tough. I want to be entertained just like the next person but I found myself being constantly annoyed at much of the movie.<br/><br/>   Above all else, N.O.S. is one of many manufacturers of nitrous oxide systems sold in the United States. Their company name is Nitrous Oxide Systems and they are called N.O.S. for short. N.O.S. was never meant to be pronounced as a word. I wanted to put my foot through the TV everytime I heard the word ""nos"". Anyone who knows anything about street racing would know that there are many nicknames for nitrous (the juice, the squeeze, the bottle, the button, the jammy, giggle-gas, the spray or just simply nitrous) but I have yet to hear anyone say ""nos"". I guess I may hear it now that this movie came out but I can tell you it was not that way before.<br/><br/>   Another thing, I don't think Captain Kirk ever went as fast as these guys did. The movie made the racers seem as if they hit Warp Factor 8 so I was somewhat surprised that they never made it to the other side of the galaxy during the course of their race. <br/><br/>   What was that plate that unbolted itself and flew out of the bottom of the main character's car? I believe that this was another Warp speed type thing. I noticed in the Star Trek movies that when the Enterprise would hit maximum warp, things would start shaking and Scotty would have to tell the Captain that he's giving him all shes got so I assume that when the nitrous was used, these cars experienced the similar effects.<br/><br/>   Have you, the reader, ever been in a drag race? No? Well, I have and I can tell you that I have yet to see one or be in one where the lead changes more than one time (aside from an engine failure or crash). We are only talking 1/4 mile here (1320 feet), not a 500 mile circle track race. I realize that this may seem more exciting to the viewer but it just don't happen.<br/><br/>   How about that amazing wheelstand that Vin Diesel's car did? It looked like an NHRA Super Stocker leaving the line (taking off). The only problem with that is that he had street tires on it which would never grip the road well enough to transfer that amount of torque to lift the car like that. A smokey, mile long burnout would have been more true to life but then the race would have been no contest; he would have lost by a mile!<br/><br/>   I could go on but I don't want to seem like I am being too critical. I have to admit that I was slightly entertained with the storyline. The movie is really geared (no pun intended) toward 14-18 year old males and I can understand that. Not every movie is made for me. I don't need karate and fast paced action to be entertained like our medicated, hyper-active younger generation needs to be. Praise the Lord that I did not fall for taking the family out to the movie theater for this one!"

However, I was not impressed with the Honda Civics and such.  These cars are not ""muscle cars"".  They are just souped up blenders!  I guess I am from the old school and believe that if you are going to have a fast car it should be a muscle car!

"MissCzarChasm","10","0","1","23 June 2001"," The Ultimate Summer Movie
","I just back from seeing The Fast and the Furious and i have to say i have never been so pumped after seeing a film. Keep in mind from the moment i saw the trailer for this film i wanted desperately to see it. It had fast cars, Fast girls, and it guaranteed some pretty cool action sequences. Needless to say that i wasn't disappointed and this has made my list of best movie of the summer so far.<br/><br/>The plot in this film is pretty basic. A undercover cop named Brian(Paul Walker) is sent to get the inside scoop on a group of street racers who may or may not be smuggling equipment from pick-up trucks. The street racing team is lead by Dom(Vin Diesel). Brian however begins to fall for Dom's sister Mia(Jordana Brewster) and things begin to become truly complicated.<br/><br/>Why is this the ultimate summer movie? You can go into this film with no expectations and be truly entertained. It's mindless fun so to speak and it's a good way to spend 90 minutes. I enjoyed every minute of this film and as the title promises there is a lot of Furious action.<br/><br/>The racing sequences are done really well and are the best i've seen in a long while. There are some good camera shots and camera angles and these shots make the races even more exhilarating. The best sequence has to be towards to end that involves cars and one big pick-up truck.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty good. Vin Diesel is going to be huge. He is a very commanding performer and he alone carries this film acting wise. The same can not be said for Paul Walker who is very flat. I said this before in my review of the skulls the guy needs some lessons stat. The girls are really good in the film. Jordana brewster displays the sensitvity and sensuality that is needed to portray her character and Michelle Rodriguez as dom's girlfriend letty is just one big ball of sass. i loved this character and i wish she could've been in the film more.<br/><br/>All in all a good summer movie. i'm sure you won't be disappointed."

The characters are dull, there's nothing remotely interesting about them.<br/><br/>The film has no 3 act structure, the picture never builds up to the finale. There's hardly anything for the actors to do. Everything is a mess.<br/><br/>The cars are nice to look at, and we do get an excellent stunt sequence, but that's it.

","Well, I was hoping for a little more actually...I was slightly disappointed in some of the highly unplausible plot, but that's Hollywood I guess. The cars are hot, and the girls are too, which makes the movie nice from a visual standpoint (kind of a theme in movies these days) but the acting was pretty predictable. The movie kind of wraps up in an unusual way, so that is sort of a plus, but I don't want to give anything away on that front...all in all I'd recommend it IF you are into cars or action flicks."
"cassidycane","4","0","1","22 January 2002"," The longest ad I've ever seen
","I think I watched this movie for the same reason many others watched the movie: we wanted to see them fast cars. And there were lots of them. The drag racing scenes were definitely the best but after several of them it kinda gets annoying when you're sitting there wondering where the hell did these kids get the money for the cars. Finding out who's been behind the robberies is pretty easy to figure out as well.<br/><br/>Ok cars were ok but the relationships between the characters was not believable. I don't think that Dom and Brian connected so closely as to warrant what happened in the end. And the romance between Brian and Mia seemed to have come from no where. I believed  Mia and Leon's love/hate relationship more.<br/><br/>If you have time and money to spend or maybe you got a free coupon from blockbuster, go ahead and watch this film.

"izimbra","Null","0","1","21 January 2002"," CARS! CARS! CARS! oh, and lots of Corona and hair-gel.
","First of all, I'd like to say that this movie probably wasn't for me in the first place.  I do not own a Honda or Mitsubishi with really loud decals, a $10,000 stereo system, goofy neon lights underneath, a laptop on the dash, and something like ""HIGH PERFORMANCE"" written across the windshield.  Nor, do I own a pair of phat pants or date girls that look like their strait out of ""Maxim"" magazine. I knew this when I picked up the DVD and wasn't too surprised to see that sort of thing being so deliciously glorified.  Plus, I should also confess, I drive rather conservatively and don't quite grasp the cool racer lingo used throughout the script.  The guys down at ""Jiffy Lube"" were able to let me in on a few terms, plus a real good deal on 10w30.<br/><br/>But, with camp appeal aside, I found this movie to not be as exciting as the trailer indicated.  There are a few rather tense action scenes hear and there, but were hard to follow after being drowned out by the overblown score.  I found it totally unnecessary to be forced to endure the putrid sounds of untalented Limp Bizket when O' Conner (Paul Walker) is so much as stepping out of his car.  For a minute or two, I thought I might have been in the latest hip dance club and not my living room working on my second row of Chips Ahoy!  I beleive the producers tried to much to appeal to the 15-25 age group and get the clips heavy rotation on MTV.  (Hey, doesn't Fred Durst work for them now?)  Oh! I'm quite sure the soundtrack is also a hot seller!<br/><br/>But I may kid the music,  there's nothing funny about Paul Walker. I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one seeing a clear distinction between this and the Keanu Reeves opus ""Point Break."" Walker seems to be the lesser version of Keanu.  He's not.  Keanu isn't even a lesser version of Keanu! I had a tough time deciding between Reeves and Walker as to whose script sounds the most forced and weak-willed macho.  It was a tough call.  But hey, was Walker in ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey?""  I think not!  Of coarse, this film had so many young, beautiful people I lost Paul in a couple of scenes.  So at least he seemed at home.  Now, Vin Diesel seems like a likable guy... although I must warn he is a bit scary.  Some may liken him to a shaved grizzly.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's the car thing.  Again, not my forte.  The racing scenes, complete with David Fincher-style CGI, are alot of fun, though. Yet, they seem to be few and far between.  Since there is not much to the plot, the writers threw in a thin romance between Walker's character and Diesel's character's sister.  Plus, there's an Asian gang that fill in as the film's villians... I guess.  The idea of Walker as some sort of ""loose cannon"" cop is a bit laughable, as he is kind of a wuss.  But, at least his boss was very understanding and not the kind that says thing like, ""I need some hard evidence, now!"" like we usually find in action movies.<br/><br/>But, if you are a fan of import-car racing (and chugging down warm bottles of Corona) this is a movie for you!  I am afraid that it will influence more youngsters to apply those silly muffler caps and white tail light lenses to the cars their parents bought for them.  But, it's all harmless in the end.<br/><br/>Seth's rating: C+"

It's like fingernails scraping down a chalkboard.<br/><br/>I see in other reviews here there are claims that they have the cars down right. Hardly. In one race, one of the cars completely trashes his engine after using a 100 shot of NOS. A few minutes later, he races off in it. It's laughable. In fact, the movie was bad enough to laugh all the way through it except for that scraping fingernail thing in background.<br/><br/>

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","1","13 January 2002"," It is fast, but it ain't furious...
","Director Rob Cohen has made a living out of making consistently mediocre films. From his earliest attention getting feature films such as 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' to the equally unimpressionable 'Dragonheart', he has never earned my respect as bringing something new to the film industry. In his latest feature film 'The Fast and The Furious', he makes it seem as if he is bringing something new, when in reality he is not. He is simply taking a new theme in film rarely explored and cutting this film into a 106-minute music video. Filled with some sloppy editing and horrendous clichÃ©d lines, this film explores the underground world of street racing. While Cohen enjoys displaying his modified cars in many tracking shots along the sunny beaches of California, there are many elements that can be deemed detrimental to the final product.  Despite the film's horrible 'teeny-bopper' title, this film does retain one astounding element that has crept under the radar. That one element delivers this film on all levels it could not perform, that one element is Vin Diesel. Mark Vincent, otherwise known as Vin Diesel has been in many films yet never has he carried a film as he does here. From his stint as Private Adrian Carpazo in 'Saving Private Ryan' to his juicy role as Chris Varick in 'Boiler Room', this one film will solidify him as one of the fastest stars to climb the ladder of success in Hollywood. Now we understand why the Great Spielberg cast him in a small yet important role in his film, and we now know why this film isn't as bad as it could have been. This film's inexcusable plot to set up a racing sequence after another centers itself upon an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate an underground street racing circuit in an attempt to unravel a hijacking ring. Paul Walker plays Brian O'Connor, the newest member of the team joining Turetto's gang who seemingly has an agenda of his own. While Walker seems to be doing his best attempt at conveying a brute man with a deep voice, Cohen seems to enjoy shooting Walker for his blue eyes and blonde hair appeal. Contrasting these two main characters who forge a deep bond in the film, Diesel is shot in all his raw appeal as he gets himself dirty and displays his charisma at being a leading man, whether in a villainous role or not.<br/><br/>Cohen sets up the film quickly and stresses the fact that the film will be laced with fast cars, furious sequences and racing that attempts to leave viewers dizzy, yet only leaves the educated viewer questioning the logistics of such sequences. Where Cohen does get my respect is whereas in his previous films such as Stallone's horrible 'Daylight', he veers away from his conventional formula that did not work and lets the character study not tell the story, and lets the car-obsessed viewer gets their rocks off with the hundreds of modified cars that race up and down the street.<br/><br/>His aim was never to win an Academy Award; his aim was to deliver an intense racing film that perhaps wanted to rival Frankenheimer's 'Grand Prix' or that of 'Ronin'. Unfortunately, he has failed. He keeps the film going quickly enough in order to make the viewer forget about the past scene and brings us into a new sequence completely unrelated from the former. Taking into account the modified Japanese cars and coupling them with some interesting race sequences, he delivers a mildly formulaic yet pleasing film that will be enjoyed mostly at home as a rental. This film is not a work of art, nor a groundbreaking film. But what Cohen attempts to do is deliver a fast film in which the filmmakers could not think of a better title. The film is filled with imperfections and the casting of some characters may somewhat be questionable as well. Furthermore, Cohen's direction seems to be lifting off various music videos in order to combine the furious editing with the fast music of composer BT. Perhaps one of the film's other flaws is the attempt to edit a piece of music into every scene in the film in hopes of making a scene bigger than it really is. Except for the final hijacking scene, music is rampant within the film and film studies students will see how a piece of music can either make or break a film. In this case, it does neither. That is how ineffective it is. I must admit that I wasn't bored while viewing the film, yet I wasn't devastatingly impressed either. Cohen knows exactly what he has with Diesel and makes good use of him, as for the other failing elements, Cohen resorts to some tacky CGI in order to spice up the racing scenes and simply bogs down this film with his attempt at really wanting to impress - yet he does not. He has delivered a film that will appeal and satisfy the many car lovers out there with the unrealistic racing sequences and those who get a rush out of bad editing. Finally, what is conceivable about this film is Cohen's attempt at wanting to impress us so hard with his music, his editing and his CGI that he forgets to include a bit of substance. Witness the final scene for substance and one will know that the actual conveying of emotion did play a part in the film, albeit too late.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: **    (out of 4)"

I mean I like Paul Walker but his pretty boy image doesn't give him the actual tough sincere character that i think should've been played. Some of his dialogue was pretty weak too. The film though was awesome. Diesel and Rodriguez look like they got real chemistry."

","Well the action was good, but the plot was ridiculous. Bad. I love Vin Diesel (what a cool name for a cool guy!), but I would love to hear him get some more funny one liners like the one at the end: ""Not exactly what I had in mind"" (after crashing seriously with his car). He was much cooler in ""Pitch Black"". I got a little tired of the endless ""tough talk"" in the movies first 25 minutes, but after then it got better. This is a classic no-brainer so leave the brain at the door.<br/><br/>All in all it would have been a better movie with some more humor in it, just to get rid of the ""seriousness"" , which isn't serious at all."

","The Fast And The Furious is a thrill ride from beginning to end.  The heart pounding action made me squirm in my chair.  The cleverly filmed racing sequence was amazing and from that point on my eyes were glued to the screen.  Although the plotline isn't very original they carried it well. Vin Diesel, who played the roll of the street racing leader, gave a strong performance and you could really feel for each character.  I even started feeling sorry for the evil Japanese gang leader.<br/><br/>The semi-jacking scenes were awesome.  They totally freaked me out... in a cool way though.  I didn't know what to expect.  Paul Walker's acting was pretty Keanu-ish.  He was a total surfer boy throughout the whole movie. The make-up people were trying way too hard to make him look rugged and normal.  It was pretty hard for me to believe HE was a cop. He's way too boyish and cute for the part.  But, I have to admit, those looks of his were one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie. In the end it came together really well. I suggest that you don't wait for this one to come out on video because you will be missing so much.  With the surround sound of the theater, the engines mixed with the soundtrack and the plot work great together.  I went in expecting a B+ and i got blown away by an A+++++++ movie."

","The action scenes in this movie are pretty good, its a great movie to watch on DVD if you have surround sound. I'd rate the action scenes as an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the highest).  The problem with this movie is the plot and the acting.  The acting is so horrible that it almost made me sick to my stomach. Same for the plot, it's extremely stupid and ridiculous. Also, who the hell hijacks a truck by jumping on it while moving at 65mph? What ever happened to blocking the road and pointing guns at it?  This is a teenagers movie.  All what you'll see is driving, partying, and a pathetic attempt in trying to give the movie a plot.  This movie would have been much better if there was no acting or plot and just a bunch of racing and car crashes etc. 4/10."

"JJ-152","6","0","1","9 January 2002"," May not be quite what you were expecting!
","This review is intended for people who haven't seen the movie and are considering buying the DVD.<br/><br/>The best advice I can offer is simply this:  If you haven't seen the movie yet and are considering buying the DVD, DON'T.  Not until you rent it first.<br/><br/>I won't go off and say that this movie is either bad or great.  Everyone needs to decide that for themselves.  However, as a word of caution, it may not be what you expected.  Here's what I found.<br/><br/>Before renting the DVD last weekend, I had considered buying it for 2 reasons:<br/><br/>1)  Vin Diesel is one of the best new actors and I liked him in his previous films.<br/><br/>2)   I am a former high school drag racer and still love fast cars.<br/><br/>Based on the previews and the promos for the movie, I had thought that Vin played the main character.  I was wrong.  Unfortunately, Paul Walker gets substantially more screen time and the movie is really about his character, not Vin's.  One thing I think everyone can agree on:  Paul Walker is no Vin Diesel!!!! Additionally, there really isn't as much action as you would think.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, there is a substantial amount of screen time spent with the actors standing around the cars and talking smack.  There's also an unconvincing love story (which eats up the minutes) between Paul Walker's character and the sister of Vin's character.<br/><br/>As a result, I'm glad I didn't blow the $20 to buy it.  One viewing was plenty for me.  However, it wasn't a waste of time either.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars.  It wasn't nearly as good as I was expecting, but it also wasn't trash.  Sure, it's a familiar story that's been done several times before, and better, but in general I try not to let previous versions of a story influence me.  I try to let each movie stand on its own merits.<br/><br/>I hope you find this helpful."

","This was a bad movie.  Maybe 15 year olds could get some enjoyment from the cool cars but for anyone else the story was ridiculous.  Didn't a floor plate fall out of the undercover cop's car during a race?  This was the same car that Vin Deisel jumped into minutes later.  Were we to assume some kind of Flintstone locomotion was in effect.  Did anyone notice that the lead good cop was a blonde white guy and all the baddies were either Hispanics or Asians?  Did anyone notice the bullet spraying, speeding and being chased by cops never lead to an arrest?  Did anyone notice the overall tone of lawlessness was celebrated?  What an uplifting, socially aware movie this was.  The special effects were of ""Dukes of Hazard"" vintage.  Vin Deisel was passable in his role. Paul Walker was forgettable.  Michelle Rodriguez, who was so good in ""Girlfight"", played a cliched sex-object role."

","This is one stupid movie! I wasn't expecting great art or anything, just a fun summer movie. But this movie is nothing but loud -- yet excitement-free -- car races and a lot of people posing.  The plot is a note-for-note rehash of the Keanu Reeves movie ""Point Break (1991)"" although with cars instead of surfboards & parachutes, and much more ineptly done. (And Keanu, as bad an actor as he is, could act rings around the awful lead of this flick.)  This does have Vin Diesel -- but as good as he is in anything, it's not enough to elevate this mess.  With this, someone has achieved the unimaginable: they've actually made a movie that's dumber, more abrasive and more annoying than the Jerry Bruckheimer version of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"".  This is easily one of the worst studio films of the past year."

","I saw this movie in the theater and after reading IMDb reviews I wasn't prepared for anything spectacular.  But, to be fair, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought and ended up buying the DVD. I didn't mind the story as much as some others here have; I wasn't expecting a remarkable story in a car racing movie.  The acting, however, is TERRIBLE. None of Toretto's gang can act especially Toretto (Vin Diesel) himself. Some of his lines are terrible to begin with but the way he portrays them makes them one hundred times worse. (possible spoiler) I feel at times the filmmakers wanted us the viewers to root for (and possibly feel sorry for) Toretto stealing from semi trucks.  I actually found myself rooting for the truck driver with the shot gun because Toretto and his gang turn out to be scumbags.

","Well, it's a pretty slick production, and the cars were kinda neat, but I felt it lacking.  Basically, the races should've been shorter, and the chases should have been more original. The set up of cars chasing a semi was given its ultimate form in The Road Warrior.  That is the ultimate expression of that setup.  Nothing in this movie comes close to the stunt work and energy of the chases in Road Warrior or Mad Max. Now, other movies have done cars chasing a semi, such as Black Dog, but none have been as similiar as Fast and the Furious. You've a guy hanging on the front of the truck, you've got the truck driver using a shotgun, you've even got similar car wrecks. If you sat down and did a shot by shot comparison of Road Warrior versus Fast and the Furious, you'd be amazed at the similarities. Anyway, check out the original Vanishing Point, or White Lightning for some great car action."

The needed improvement: The technology stuffs are too domestic and simple. I don't see other countries' street racers (Japanese, Europeans...) using nitros and decide a driver's ability on a straight line race but the states. If they can make the races from point A to B (non-straight line) and focus more on how handling tuning is as important as horsepower, the ability of the 'well respected' group leader and the undercover would become more persuasive.

","From the very moment the meaningless title (they're fast, sure, but what exactly are they furious about?) looms on screen, accompanied by the kind of deafening music that tw*ts play when they drive their souped-up nissans at three miles an hour down the Walworth Road in rush hour, you know you're in trouble.  There's this guy, played by the worst actor in history, and he drives this green car and he fancies this girl, but she's the sister of the leader of this gang who hijack trucks full of DVD players, for no particular reason other than - hey - it beats working, and the guy, played by the worst actor in history (did I mention that already?) turns out to be - wait for it - a cop!  Yawn.  So, with a plot and characters and dialogue and acting all of a standard not seen on our screens since, well, the last terminally crap Hollywood drivel-fest, we can at least rely on the action sequences, right? Wrong.  As soon as they start drag-racing and the cgi kicks in, all sensation of speed is eradicated, and you are left with a hollow, empty feeling.  Car races/chases are exciting, aren't they?  Well, they used to be, but they aren't any longer.  Badly-edited computer-generated bullsh*t is not my idea of fun.  Is it yours?  And when the chases are done in the old-fashioned way (i.e. in broad daylight, so bad special effects have to be ditched in favour of actual film-making) you find yourself so bored by the characters' predicaments that no amount of pounding music and rapid editing can jolt you out of your stupour. Admittedly, the bald guy has a certain charisma, and can obviously act, but his presence only shows up the other fools in this film for the talentless space-fillers that they are.  Who wrote this?  Why?  Who directed it?  Was he/she awake during this process?  Who created the ""special"" effects?  Can they not tell the difference between ""realistic"" and ""crap""?  Obviously not"

","""The Fast And The Furious"" came up to Spanish theaters on October 5th. Next day I saw it. And... what can I tell? It gave me a light sour taste... This is the type of movie with a completely disorganized plot and script (Note: the script is not such, it's a strange melange made up of sequences in which cars are the real stars) in which the sucession of events is so fast and bad sequenced it ends up giving you the general idea of a bad movie. The script shows very typical clichÃ©s of the genre. Although there are two or three points I liked, like uncovering the main character's real job from the start, these show no originality, as they have also been used in other movies. But... what can I ask for in a mega commercial movie, specially aimed at youngsters and teenagers demanding an incredibly simple and void story with nice boys and girls, tuned cars and tremendous doses of adrenaline? Nothing, that's the answer. This is one of those typical films, perfect to spend with your friends a friday afternoon or wait for it to appear at the video rentals and watch it at home with your boy/girlfriend, your dog or just some pop corn.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen is a competent director whose main characteristic is that he can deal with almost any kind of genre. Let's remember he has experimented with fantasy (""Dragonheart""), drama (TV series ""thirtysomething"", ""The Skulls"") and action (""Daylight""). He certainly knows about this. ""The Fast And The Furious"" can be considered a revitalisation to his filmography, a gate to a new sector of viewers. And I have to say that he does almost fine, as he gives just what these viewers ask for! And he certainly had resources to achieve this.<br/><br/>Certainly, the best of these resources, and I admit I loved it, was the infinite exposition of tuned cars and the introduction into the world of tuning. Oh man, those are the kind of machines almost all of us car lovers would like to drive, despite the bit of fantasy some of them are gien (the 900 Horsepower monster or the easy it appears to be manipulating nitrous oxide, when certainly it isn't, if you passed your chemistry at school...). The cars, the chases, the races and the scenes in which they are the stars are interesting, enjoyable and quite exciting. From my point of view, they surpass those of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"", which was claimed to be the end of Millenium absolute car movie (what a lie...), and ended up in another exposition, more calm and simple, of luxury cars. And that's another point, because those shown in ""TFATF"" are pure fan design, autos we certainly don't see so commonly as we can see a Porsche Boxster or even a Hum-vee (also, I enjoyed more the Hum-vee scene in ""The Rock"", than that of""Gone In 60 Seconds"").<br/><br/>About the acting, I can't tell much. I only knew Paul Walker from ""Varsity Blues"" and Jordana Brewster (beautiful, I have to say!) from ""The Faculty"". Nothing about the rest. I already told the cars are the main stars, actors are the supporting cast.<br/><br/>About the music, that seemed interesting, I must say. Some nice techno and drum n'bass songs can be heard throughout the film. The good about it is that, at least, it gives rhythm to a practically sank show.<br/><br/>I think that's about all. You've seen my recommendations, it's just a movie to see, have some good time and then forget. If you need a seatbelt for this, you may grab one, but just for 15 or 20 minutes.  And a little fact: even in the translation of the Spanish title you find a total different thing, but that still corresponds to the rhythm of the film: ""A Todo Gas"" (Full Throttle)...

","I want to start by saying that this film has some beautiful cars in it that were the result of hundreds of hours of hard work.  Rob Cohen does them justice with his slick camera work and effects to really bring the cars to life.<br/><br/>However, the film lacks two ingredients to make it a truly great film. Number one, a plausible plot that flows logically.  The basic setting of an underground street racing circuit is an excellent place to start, but to simply use a plot that was dangerously similar to Point Break was disappointing.  I found the film was way too easy to predict the ending and unlike Point Break they didn't resolve the outcomes for the majority of the ensemble characters.  I thought the film needed to be about 15 to 20 minutes longer so that adequate time could be given to fill out certain parts of the film that seemed to jump from a to b without much substance, i.e. the formation of Brian's relationship to the Toretto siblings.<br/><br/>Two, Vin Diesel does the most with a script that struggled to portray all the multiple facets that his characterization of Dominic Toretto possessed, but Paul Walker simply doesn't have the talent as a leading man to carry the film.  I thought Jordana Brewster was good and I would have liked to have seen more of Michelle Rodriguez's character as I really enjoyed her outing in Girlfight, but to no avail.<br/><br/>While I have no doubt that the actors are more than capable of doing a lot better than the script allows, we were not allowed to see it.<br/><br/>I really hope that if they make a sequel, they do it properly."

Probably the best action flick of the summer, this rocks, despite the hammy script."
"gonzo-78","Null","0","1","29 September 2001"," Point Break with cars, but there's nothing special under the hood.
","The Fast and the Furious has definitely got cars. Big cars with obscene amounts of horsepower that quite clearly go very, very fast. Unlike the remake of Gone in 60 Seconds, it's also got some decent driving scenes and stunts to complement the muscle, including a superb shot from inside one car as another spins over it in mid air, though this was spoiled somewhat by being shown in the trailer.<br/><br/>Plot wise there's no worries about spoilers, as the story is not a complicated one. It's essentially a carbon copy of the '91 Keanu Reeves surf crime movie Point Break, which in itself is a whole lot of undercover cop standards, and most people will get the gist by a few minutes into the picture.<br/><br/>However, this isn't the kind of film you go to see to enjoy the subtleties of the plotline. I don't think anyone involved in the making of the film was expecting to put an Oscar on the mantlepiece, and they do try to provide the. The cars, as I have said, are big, there is a fair smattering of race girls, and a regulation hollywood drop of ethnicity, with a black group, a japanese group, and a latino group. The pacing of the movie is somewhat too speed, neither of which work particularly well, with the same amount of energy in a punch up near the beginning as the final chase scenes. The cast puts in a fairly decent performance, with the possible exception of Paul Walker who comes across as far too Keanu-like... this is not a good thing. By the end of the film you're really not too bothered on which characters if any escape, get shot, get busted or just disappear. On the plus side however, there are some of the finest driving under a truck scenes since Smokey and the Bandit.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie didn't do anything for me. It wasn't bad, as there wasn't anything particularly wrong about it, but it wasn't good either. In the right mood, with your buddies and some liquid refreshment, this movie could go down a storm, but consider saving yourself the cinema tickets and renting Point Break instead."
"shoot_the_martini","Null","0","1","29 September 2001"," Not that bad actually
","I read the reviews on IMDB last week and thought that this film would probably suck beyond recognition.<br/><br/>Yesterday I had the choice of AI and this. I wanted to see AI but my friends wanted to see this. I almost went to AI alone but they persuaded me that watching a film on your own is crap. Which it is. So I thought, 4 quid down the drain. It's not mine so who cares?<br/><br/>Then almost 2 hours later I was out of the cinema and I thought, money well spent. The truth is, the film isn't half bad. People moaning about the storyline are right in part. The storyline isn't that bad itself, but it was just executed with the wit of a mule.<br/><br/>The stunts are amazing. Really cool stunts include cars driving under speeding trucks and staying in control, plus a wheelie from a dodgy corvette.<br/><br/>Anyway the film was alright. The story of the lead guy being undercover and gaining the trust of the crooks is quite good but here it could have been better. There was one moment I will remember above all and it's the moment that I reckon was the most tense in the entire film. Most people won't remember it but I just happened to. Anyway I won't give any details but basically it's when he blows his cover to the lead crook. The look on the bald guy (Vin Diesel)'s face gave that scene more suspence than any other. But then it's just wasted after that.<br/><br/>The film ends with us perhaps not knowing what will follow but it's not hard to work out what probably would have done if it were continued a bit longer.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't actually that bad. That Vin Diesel bloke was criticised by a lot of people on this site but there's a bit where he talks about his dad's death and i thought he shined then. And the others weren't that bad anyway.<br/><br/>Overall the film is worth a watch if you're looking for a little action that's easy on the mind. Of course it goes without saying that if you like cars this film is for you.<br/><br/>If you want something more sophisticated, don't bother."

","The Fast and the Furious ranks near Varsity Blues as one of the greatest movies ever made.  Although essentially the exact same movie as Point Break, the casting brought the film over the top.  Swayze was replaced by Vin Diesel, Reeves by Scott Walker, Lori Petty by Mark Wahlberg's wife etc.  I will admit that there were some minor, (fine major), plot holes, but when Vin Diesel pumps up the fine Brocksonic stereo nothing else matters.  Scott Walker, star of such classics as Varsity Blues and She's all That, put in his typical Oscar quality performance.  His portrayal of an undercover officer looking for some lovin' brought tears of joy upon my face.  I urge all of you to see this movie at the tenplex in Paramus, there you can find the optimum crowd, as that is half the fun of this movie.<br/><br/>Also the cars are nice, but I would have prefered to see my Jeep Wrangler with the top speed of 45 mph in the film as well."

","'The Fast and the Furious' is good when it is both fast and furious.  The problem with the film lies in between.  Well, actually the problem with the film is any time an actor opens their mouth and spouts out some sort of inane dialogue.  Paul Walker delivers his lines with the same deadpan, almost non acting approach that has made Keanu Reeves famous.  His voice sounds the same too.  If I had closed my eyes I would have sworn it was Keanu. I was just waiting for him to spout out the words ""Whoa"" or ""Dude"". No such luck however.  Vin Diesel was disappointing as well.  At least acting wise that is.  He does fill in his role well, as he has the right look.  The acting and directing, still, are both horrible.  The parts of the movie with dialogue are horrible.  The parts of the movie with the cars, however, are not.<br/><br/>This movie has the absolute best, most high octane and exciting car racing(and chasing)scenes I have ever seen in my life.  The movie excels on this level.  It is a great adrenaline rush just watching it.  I wish the movie was silent with a lot of the car scenes because then we would have had a great action movie.  Unfortunately they bogged it all down by trying to incorporate a plot(a bad one I might add), your standard romances, and you standard double crosses.  It excels on one level, but on the level that makes a movie great, it completely flounders.  It is worth watching to see the car races, especially if you like that sort of thing.  But if you are like me, and you require good acting, good dialogue and a good story, well then you probably won't be that impressed.  5 out of 10."

The music, good effects with the cars, and the interesting shots during the drag races all contribute to the solid action of the movie.  Vin Diesel's strong presence also adds the thrill.  It was difficult to tell however if Paul Walker's performance was really bad acting or the result of trying to play a cop who is trying to be street wise somewhat unsuccessfully.  I suspect was bad acting though.  The script was also a little lacking.  Nevertheless  it is a fun and exciting movie worth watching especially if you are a fan of cars or Vin Diesel."

But what fantasy city is this where there are a bunch of 4 cylinders that gather and no 8cyl car for miles??? The main character drove a Supercharged lightning and races in a crappy 4 cyl.

","This is an 'okay' film, the acting is 'okay', the script is 'okay', the direction is 'okay' and so on. At no point does it ever threaten to become exciting, but neither does it ever try putting you to sleep. So it's definitely another movie from Rob Cohen.<br/><br/>The main problem is that this is a virtual retread (ahem) of the far superior 'Point Break'. The plot? An undercover cop gets involved with a group of fast-living criminals and finds himself with divided loyalties thanks to a beautiful woman. If you've seen 'Point Break' you'll be constantly comparing the two and finding the older movie to be far superior.<br/><br/>'Point Break' was well structured, there was a constant pull on the central character, dragging him into the criminal gang until he found himself deeply and inextricably caught up in their activities. Whereas 'The Fast and the Furious''s Officer O'Connor is even more gung-ho than the bad guys. Who can care what happens to the good guy if he wants to be the baddie?<br/><br/>It's also lazily directed. 'Point Break' left your heart pounding with its chase scenes or the incomparable parachute drop. Here, there is little that hasn't been seen before and done better. The first car race does work well, but the climactic car chase is far too long, not at all well edited, and falls flat. Likewise it fails to utilise the locations. If you travel through nighttime LA, you see something between a dream and an industrial nightmare - here it is a few neon lit streets that could have been anywhere. What a waste of a great location.<br/><br/>Finally the movie has a lazy ending which appears to have been lifted directly from 'Point Break', the cop who is friends with the master criminal in one final confrontation. Except that this time it is a gutless ending which stinks of pandering to focus groups.<br/><br/>In its defence, 'The Fast and the Furious' has two great points, the cars and Vin Diesel. The cars - well they are astonishing beasts and lovingly shot, Vin Diesel, once again has real presence on-screen and exudes menace. He is definitely bound for greater things, perhaps even a role where he can exercise his acting?<br/><br/>If Summer 2001 had been a normal movie year, 'The Fast and the Furious' would have done respectable box-office and then sunk without trace. With precious little competition it has done far better than expected, but that says more about the other movies than this one.<br/><br/>All in all, it's strange that a movie that revolves around cars doesn't appear to be firing on all cylinders."

I liked it most because it had a plot, it wasn't just all about cars, there was a point besides ""my car is better than yours."" It seems that way at first but there are lots of surprises that you would least expect, that was another good part about it as well. Although, the main thing is that the guys were hot, at least some of them. Just kidding:)"

","This movie will BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!!! It's got great car chases, adrenaline-pumping music, and HOT actors! The acting is very good, especially on the part of Vin Diesal- with his strong portrayal of Toretto, he manages to outshine the ""main character,"" played by Paul Walker. Along with Vin and his Arnold Shwartzanager-like body, the viewer is treated with some jaw-dropping car crash scenes, spectacular race footage, and a strong accompanying soundtrack. (also, for the men in the audience, there are plenty of good looking women to feast your eyes on). Do you lack adrenaline in your life? This movie will cure your problem!"
"mattdvs","6","0","1","31 July 2001"," Completely forgettable entertainment
","I waited a pretty long time before seeing this movie because I didn't want to deal with the rice rocket rallies during the first few weekends.  I knew, just from the previews, that it would attract a large audience, no matter whether it was actually a decent film or not.  After seeing it, I have to admit, once I turned off the analytical part of my brain, I enjoyed it. While it's definitely true that the screenplay was trite and predictable and most of the actors were seemingly hired based on looks rather than talent, this film was saved by a few things.  The most obvious of this film's saviors was the outstanding camera work during the films many chase/race sequences.  Also, Vin Diesel has a magnetic charisma that makes his even his non-racing scene watchable.  A few of the other actors, in particular Michelle Rodriguez, turn in passable performances too, although I'm definitely not impressed by pretty boy Paul Walker, who phones in a typical and contrived performance.  Overall, if, like me, you're able to turn off the part of your brain that wants you to scream ""Who talks like that???"", then you'll probably find this an enjoyable film, if forgettable, film. 3/5"

","Big dumb fast and fun.<br/><br/>I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite). <br/><br/>
Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.<br/><br/>I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to ""live outside the law"" and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in ""Girl Fight"" - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride."
"nunculus","Null","0","1","27 July 2001"," DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY it ain't
","I should've gotten off on it: the previously undistinguished director, Rob Cohen, stages two of the most amazing action set pieces of recent vintage--a nighttime drag race that approaches ""2001"" trippiness, and a car-and-truck joust that seems to smash together virtuoso sequences from DUEL and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. And the whole thing seems (deliberately or not) to be suffused with an aura of Roger Corman/AIP down-and-dirtiness. I amused myself trying to think of how it would have been cast in 1973: Jan-Michael Vincent as Paul Walker, and...Robert Blake as Vin Diesel? There's even Ted Levine, giving a fine performance as the requisite drive-in-movie Good Guy Cop in a Bad Suit.<br/><br/>So what's not to like? Well, Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster, basically. The movie has Gary Busey attitude but a Freddie Prinze, Jr. heart. Though Diesel is a good actor, he seems to have a thought bubble above his head that says, ""Hmmm! I seem to be turning into the gen-y Stallone! I think I like it!"" Walker tries hard and probably isn't worse than most male ingenues of this sort in the post-Gary Wopat era. But Brewster, a handsome, burnished-skinned, Ali McGraw type, is much too suburban and poshy for the white-trash role of Diesel's waitress sister, and Rodriguez, as Diesel's main squeeze, scrunches her face up into a just-sucked-a-lemon sneer and keeps it locked there for two hours.<br/><br/>Where is this era's Robert Mitchum--hell, where is its Michael Madsen? The movie's heart is in the right place, and it's engaging enough, but it needs some guys who seem to have never in their life, not once, touched a bottle with the word ""moisturizer"" on it."

"sharif68","10","0","1","27 July 2001"," A Thrilling Joyride!
","The Fast and the Furious is a thrilling joyride of a movie that's full of spark and vigor, even if the script is full of cliches. The movie (and it's title) is kind of a throwback those 1950's exploitation flicks that where shown in a double or triple feature (along with cartoons) in a neighborhood theatre. The movie deals with L.A. street racers and an undercover cop who's investigating the leader of this group of racers who may be involved in a string of highway truck robberies. The plot has been rehashed from other films, but it's the action that really get your attention to the point that you could really care less about the plot. It gives you everything you could ask for in a popcorn summer flick. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me was how good the acting is in this movie. The young cast of Paul Walker, Jordana Brewster, and Michelle Rodriguez do a fine job, but the real star of the movie is Vin Diesel. With his steely gaze and Lee Marvin-like voice, Diesel has a mixture of machismo and vulnerability that commands attention. He is an actor to watch."
"Rhino Rover","6","0","1","26 July 2001"," Who needs good writing when you have fast cars and big crashes??
","Depending on the age group you fall under, you may or may not like this movie. But then again, that's true of a lot of movies but this one seemed to have a very specific target audience and it seemed to be between the ages of 17 to 23 and predominately male. I fall outside of this age group but it doesn't mean a bad reviewit just means that it's not going to be a good review either. Well, it might. I guess you'll just have to read to the end of the review to find out. Typically movies aimed at this target audience tend to be high on the stunts and low on just about everything.<br/><br/>Fast and Furious is about cars. Fast cars to be specific. And not the type that belongs on the race track but the kind that gets you arrested for going a zillion miles an hour down a city street in the middle of the night. This movie is about a young man that enters the underground life of street racing. Something that happens in every city. But apparently this past time is rather cliquish and getting in with the `in-crowd' isn't always easy nor does everyone accept you. It's not that different than belonging to a gang it seems. Get in with one group and you're the enemy of another group, which means that you're going to have the typical `turf war' issues. You're also going to have your `boy meets sister of big bad brother' side story and all the other issues that go along with it. There's a bit of a twist but nothing that I haven't seen in other gang/drug related movies that have something to do with young people. In fact this movie reminded me a lot of `Point Break' except I enjoyed that movie.<br/><br/>If it sounds like I'm not really all that enthused about the plot line it's because I'm not. There was really nothing that was too terribly original about the storyline. In fact, if you look at the trailers, you'd think this movie was based on the video game `Need for Speed'. The colors used and the cars involved could have easily come out of that game and the characters? Definitely could have been taken out of a video game. The writing was full of clichés and the delivery of them wasn't overly well done. At some points I thought to myself `Did he actually say that?? That's so cheesy!' or `Please don't say that next line, please, please, please!' but they did. Not enough time was spent on developing the relationships we see. We're just kind of told about them but not in a way that really enlightens us, just that this relationship exists so accept it. <br/><br/>So far this review is sounding pretty negative isn't it? Well, I have to say that the stunts were kind of interesting. The car chase scenes (and there's a lot of them) were pretty well done and some of the scenes they do with the semi-trucks were interesting but not all that believable.<br/><br/>
So you're wondering, is there anything worth seeing about this movie? Hmmm, maybe depending on if you fit that target group I was talking about. If you have a hot car and like to see some hot cars with neat toys and some street racing, then this movie's for you. Other than that, I wouldn't really see it. The dialogue alone would make you want to get pulled over for road rage."

","B movie?  What B movie?  Either a film entertains you or it doesn't.<br/><br/>After seeing THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS with the target audience (that would be with the ethnically diverse kids of L.A. as depicted up on the screen), I'm convinced that what critics say about any movie no longer matters.  The audience I sat in ate it up!<br/><br/>As long as a movie studio can market and successfully test a movie AND it connects with an audience, it's golden (the film's release date was moved back, by the way, but only because the studio execs at Universal were confident that it could compete with other big summer movies).  I will go as far as saying this will be the sleeper hit of summer 2001. There are enough elements here (good looking stars, cool soundtrack, lots of action, and for the romantics a love story) for it to appeal to a large audience.<br/><br/>As for the rest of you who are perhaps a bit older or not into cars:  You'll probably walk out of the theater with a headache after all the bone-crunching stunts and loud hiphop and hard rock on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Personally, I was totally entertained.  Imagine taking the CGI technology of the special effects from STAR WARS and the energy of THE ROAD WARRIOR and combining them with road racing -- that will give you a good idea what the race/action scenes are like in this flick.<br/><br/>I am into cars. I enjoy fast driving. And good looking women like that cutie Jordana Brewster. <br/><br/>I left the theater with a huge grin on my face. Kudos to director Rob Cohen and his crew."

"Anonymous_Maxine","4","0","1","17 July 2001"," At least someone finally found a use for all of those ridiculous cars...
","Yes, The Fast and the Furious is exactly what the previews showed. A bunch of real charmers who race around in those ridiculous cars that you always see driving down the road, desperately trying to be cool. Here you have a gang of guys with seemingly endless financial ability to pack into these cars every kind of racing part imaginable, but the difference between these and the cars you see bouncing down the road in your local town is that they actually race these ones. The story is made up of the old cop undercover as one of the stylish bad guys, but it just doesn't work here. If you want to see a good movie with a plot like that, watch Point Break.<br/><br/>
Paul Walker plays Brian, the undercover cop in question, and Vin Diesel is Dominic Toretto, the leader of the gang that Brian is trying to infiltrate as he investigates a string of truck hijackings that are being perpetrated by a trio of extremely recognizable Hondas. Why would anyone in their right mind do so many robberies all with cars that have green lights underneath them? Is that just so that, when they get caught, the police will have no trouble linking them with every truck they've ever robbed? Not smart, guys. And besides that, you wouldn't think they'd feel too confident driving next to an 18-wheeler in a little tiny Honda.<br/><br/>(spoilers) And the, of course, you have the goofball romance. Brian falls in love with Mia, Dominic's sister, which complicates his job. Dominic himself confuses us by being the biggest badass in this whole gang of racers while dating the ugliest and bitchiest girl in the entire movie. The first race scene in the film is among the funniest scenes, because it involves four cars racing at 140-odd mph down the streets of Los Angeles, with hundreds of on-lookers. I love how they can do this without worrying about traffic or police, I guess that one guy with the police scanner was all that would be needed for such an extravaganza. Also look for director Rob Cohen as the pizza guy who shows up briefly in this scene. As far as traffic, they must have scanners for that, too, because you'll notice a total absence of any kind of traffic during the truck robberies. And it sure is nice of the truck drivers to drive smoothly and keep speed with the Hondas while they shoot crossbows into the cab and pull out the windshield. <br/><br/>This is an action movie for car people, because it is all about the kind of cars that these people fantasize about owning, for some reason. You can see the real version of this movie playing on main streets of towns all over the world, I'm sure. In Fresno, California, for example you can drive down Blackstone Avenue at 1am on a Saturday night, and in every other empty parking lot you'll see 10 or 12 guys standing forlornly around 2 or 3 cars that desperately try to look like the cars in this movie, and this is the reality that The Fast and the Furious exaggerates and tries to make glamorous - a bunch of guys trying to be cool by standing next to cars that are full of racing equipment that they don't use. <br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is all about the Hollywood version of these guys, traveling around in packs and driving cars with tremendously souped-up engines, carrying thick wads of rubber band-bound cash in their shirt pockets, and spending the night life with women borrowed from the rock stars while they revel in the tremendous financial spoils of the race wars. While it is almost amusingly obvious how fake this all is, the movie doesn't pretend to be anything else. You know on your way in that this is an action film with a low IQ, and in that sense, the movie does deliver. The chase scenes are unmistakably exciting, however unrealistic they are, and it's fun to watch this whole plot about this idiot cop who recklessly tries to make his way into this gang. <br/><br/>The end of the film is utter nonsense, with Brian finally reaching his goal that he has been seeking and risking his life for during the entire film, and he gives it up as soon as he achieves it. It ends with Dominic in his dad's old race car, the one that he's always been afraid to drive, and he is at a stop light remembering that it's exactly a quarter of a mile to that railroad crossing up ahead. The movie once again proves how much it borrowed from Point Break as he decides to race this car to that crossing, and Brian inexplicably decides to race along-side him. They barely escape from the oncoming train, as was to be expected, and then just after Dominic wrecks his father's car, Brian gives him the keys to his own car (the one provided to him by the police for his undercover work), and the film ends just before the police arrive on the scene to strip Brian of his badge send him back to the community college. <br/><br/>The Fast and the Furious is a movie for immature action fans, the type who regard Van Damme films as their favorites, but it is almost worth watching just for the racing scenes. All of these scenes are overblown in some way, but they are almost always entertaining, at least on some morbidly amusing level. Luckily, you already know the type of drivel that this movie is, so at least you will be in the right state of mind when you watch it."

","Although decent, this movie was better the first time I saw it back when it starred Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze and was named ""Point Break"".  To quote my friend, ""Undercover cops?  Asian Gangs?  What is this, the 80s?""<br/><br/>Basically, this movie appeals to the MTV crowd which needs to be stimulated every few seconds by bright lights and loud noises in an effort to maintain their short attention spans.  <br/><br/>There were several glaring errors in this movie that led me to believe that it was written by a film student who tried to take his spice up his loser adolescent years by trying to portray the teenagers who put thousands of dollars worth of rims, subwoofers and the like into their $500 car.  I'm sorry Mr. Writer sir, but this hackneyed movie does not justify your youth, back when you worked for minimum wage and later spent it on a new muffler.<br/><br/>First, truck drivers are union and the merchandise is insured.  Therefore, drastic measures are not needed to rob trucks.  Have you ever seen ""Goodfellas,"" when Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci robbed the truck?  Although my memory is fuzzy, I can be sure that they did not use harpoons.<br/><br/>Second, a Ferrari will never race any tuned car.  I know people who have Lotuses, Porsches, and Corvettes, and they refuse to race them.  Why? Because by virtue of owning an expensive sports car, you already showed the person up.<br/><br/>The list goes on (including the fact that the actors are in their mid-twenties, and the people who actually do this kinda stuff for fun usually mature out of it by the time they hit 19.)<br/><br/>But there is one positive:  The movie had a good ending, even though it was a rip-off of Point Break.  In fact, if A.I. had an ending half as good as Fast and the Furious, I wouldn't have wanted to vomit on my new shoes."

","Potential spoiler review...<br/><br/>Surf's up, dude.  Keanu Reeves reprises his role as undercover cop, Brian Spilner, turned racing demon in this fast and frenetic movie by the genius that brought us such classics as Miami Vice and 'thirtysomething.' Befriended by Bhodi, played by Vin Diesel, Spilner (Reeves) attempts to learn the identity of the Presidents of the USA who are stealing expensive electronic equipment.  Bhodi, the leader of a fast driving car crew that drag races for 2 grand or pink slips is Spilner, err Utah's ticket to cracking the theft ring.  Along the way Utah meets Tyler, Bhodi's sister played by Jordanna Brewster and Warchild (Rick Yune), the leader of a rival racing gang,  that helps to spice up the predictable plot.  Although the final chase scene doesn't involve airplanes and bleeding presidents, playing ""chicken"" with a train more than adequately substitutes.  As the movie ends, Bhodi hops in his new 10 second car (you'll understand when you see the movie) and drives off for another wave and you feel the pain that Spilner must feel as his driving mentor speeds away, possibly to his doom.  Although Spilner is not as disenchanted with Law enforcement as he was in the genre spawning Point Break I, you get the feeling that he may still cash in his badge and join the NASCAR circuit.  Overall, a fun summer movie full of mindless entertainment.  Heh, there are worse ways to kill 2 hours."

One, most of the racecars were imports (OK, ONE from Germany) except for the badass muscle car Dom was ""afraid of"".  Two, I'm surprised that the truck hijacks went off so easily; truckers are a pretty independent lot, and I doubt the ones I know would have let those li'l black Hondas stay in front of them.

And just between us, he's not very well cast as the stoic bad guy.  There's more depth there than that, and this film, and his previous films, have yet to mine it.  I think he has the potential to fill the void left by the aging of such heavyweights as Sylvester Stalone and Bruce Willis, neither of whom, you may remember, were exactly Laurence Olivier in the beginning, but who became fine actors with time.

","Ya know when you have a film that borders on A & B yet just cant quite make ups its mind? Thats my fast take on this high octane red line effort. Especially if your a youngster into the whole car group racing thing, then your gonna 'Love' this film. Yet if you look deeper to the qualities that make an all around good film, then you'll be a bit dissapointed, yet still you will be entertained. The best part about this film to me was watching for the first time, actor 'Paul Walker' Being a cross resemblance of Timothy Hutton and Rob Lowe, Paul Walker is an actor I'm keeping an eye on. Though I've never seen him, this Southern California native is no stranger to acting and will have me viewing some of his past work. The directing and some of the writing was a bit adolescent yet at times (such as during certain action/race sequences), it made good quarter mile time. No, not a waste of money, especially since finding Paul Walker, yet not a film Vin Diesel should hold up to the light. Worth the watch, worth the video rental, yet it wont be in my collection."

","This movie was about what I expected... a pretty lame plot with bad dialog but it was ""saved"" by some pretty cool race and chase scenes... the low point had to be when Dom was showing the blown hemi Charger to Brian and telling the story of his father's demise... in a movie about drag racing it was a pretty huge miscue to have his father killed in a ""first turn"" accident in a Pros Stock drag race... since there are no turns in drag racing.

Plus,if anyone ever saw the movie Point Break, they would obviously notice quite a few similarities. The whole rookie cop going undercover thing, with the adrenline junkies who like to surf, however in this case they like to drive. In Point Break he first suspects those drug dealers, and then knows that it is his friends who are the real criminals, letting Patrick Swayze ""go"" at the end. The difference is this though, in Point Break, they managed to handle the plot a little bit better.

","""The Fast and the Furious"" slams into overdrive from the get go and it doesn't stop until the very end, but well that's not a good thing this time around. Unlike, some recent mindless action movies, like ""Swordfish"" and even the horrid ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Furious"" doesn't seem to care if the audience knows what's going on, on screen, it just wants to cram as many nice cars and nice looking girls as it can, so the viewer will be distracted enough that they won't realize that this is just a bad, bad movie. The plot has something to do with expensive electronic equipment getting stolen from 18 wheelers, by members of a gang who drive really fast cars.<br/><br/> As for the cast, well there isn't much help from them either. Paul Walker sounds like Keanu Reeves, but doesn't have the on screen toughness necessary to play his role right and Vin Diesel sounds almost too much like Sylvester Stallone that it's scary, but at least he seems comfortable in his role. Well to sum up this isn't a very good movie, but judging by it's intake at the box office, ($100+ mil. in 3 weeks) the bad reviews just won't stop this film from becoming a smash hit.

","I absolutely love this movie. The stunts and cars are phenominal. The 1969 Dodger that Vin Diesel's character drives is my favorite. It stars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, and a small role that Ja Rule perfects. Vin Diesel plays Dominic Toretto, the leader of a group of street racers who also hi-jack 18 wheelers and steal their goods. Paul Walker plays Brian O. Spilner, a undercover cop who must bust Toretto and his team to get a cop badge. He ends up falling for Jordana Brewster's character Mia Toretto who's the sister of Dominic. Michelle Rodriguez plays Letty, a tom boy type street racer, and also Dominic's lover(real life girlfriend). Rick Yune plays Jonny Tran, a street racer and Dominic Toretto's rival. Spilner(Walker) ends up getting too deep with Dominic(Diesel) and becomes his buddy. He and Mia(Brewster) begin a short lived relationship. He reveals himself to her as a cop and convinces her to help him stop Dominic before he gets himself killed trying to make his big bust. Dominic(Diesel) ends up losing one of his friends, nearly losing another one, and nearly losing his. In the end Spilner(Walker) lets Dominic(Diesel) off the hook by giving him a 10 second car he owed him by losing too him in a race.

"RolloTomasi","5","0","1","6 July 2001"," Just rent ""Point Break"" instead
","""Fast and the Furious"" is largely a re-hash of ""Point Break."" The idea behind both films is similar: undercover cop infiltrates youth subculture to bust a faction of it that's committing real crimes. In ""PB"" the guy blending into the scenery is Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), who you'd easily mistake for a surfer. Johnny U. is actually interesting, actually seems to have a past, a life, a personality. But while ""Fast"" protagonist Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is heroic and likeable, we're never told anything about the guy. He wants to make detective, and so is doing his undercover tour of duty busting some auto mechanics turned bad. That's about all we're told, though. His character is defined by the circumstances he's in, not by the person he actually is.  <br/><br/>Character and plot isn't exactly director Rob Cohen's number one priority here of course. For sheer high-speed thrills, ""Fast"" delivers the goods. Cohen saves the best for last. Three big high-speed chase scenes close it out. The finest of them, also the best action scene I've seen this year, is another hijacking involving a tractor/trailer. This time the trucker is ready for them, though. An exhilarating mixture of cross-cutting, directing and stunts, this was expert filmmaking. Then the film's creators find a way to keep it going, plotting a race car versus motorbike sequence, followed by a good old-fashioned old-versus-new drag race with railroad tracks serving as the finish line. Of course, there's a train coming at high speed. That's good stuff. By the time it's all over, you really feel like you got your money's worth. For me though, without a strong plot to push it along, it's all a waste.  <br/><br/>Women in the audience might be disappointed that only one girl (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight"") gets to race (well, she wins anyway). The primary use this film has for women is showing them scantily-clad, putting themselves up as trophies for the winners of these races. Using women as props is nothing new to the action genre. Still, going into ""Fast"" I had hoped for better. Haven't we come to a point in movie history where it's safe to expect something for everyone? Whether you're a chick or a dude, you're unlikely to identify with any character in this.<br/><br/>
Even a movie as dumbed-down as this tries to grow a brain now and again. One such moment in `Fast' involves Chad Lindbergh's character, Jesse. He's a genius about anything automotive. He builds the engines legendary street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who's real name would've worked better) puts in his cars. He says the only reason he didn't go to, say, MIT, is that he suffers from A.D.D. With Jesse, the film raises the question of how a great mind may or may not be going to waste simply because he couldn't pay attention in class. He represents an entire demographic of kids with great potential on  the fast-track to nowhere. Who to blame? A society too dependent on social classes, diplomas and college degrees? Does a lack of direction justify choosing the criminal path? The film opens the issue, but has little to actually say about it.  <br/><br/>""The Fast and the Furious"" commits one too many transgressions against my sensibilities to recommend it, even on the strength of the action sequences. But do see ""Point Break"": more action, more style, much more of a plot, and better characters. It really is the whole package and besides, surfing is still cooler than street racing. <br/><br/>Grade: C-"

"Dragofan","Null","0","1","1 July 2001"," The Fast and the Hyddeous
","For movie go-ers these days there isn't much of a variety to choose from. You have the stupid Julia Roberts love stories, the stupid antics of Jackie Chan who's trying to be a funny Chuck Norris, and then the stupid action flicks with no plot. Every once and awhile you will find a movie that makes you think a little bit about society or whatever its subject happens to be. On the surface Fast and the Furious appears to be a stupid action flick with a retarded plot with awesome actions scenes as its only saving grace. Well, this is mostly true. The plot is bland and doesn't make any sense, a bunch of low down dead beats who appear to have no real jobs who can afford a bunch of crappy foreign cars. I'll take my Chevy K-5 any day thank you very much. But on to business. This movie actually has a deeper meaning than is inherently visible. This movie is actually a reversal of several biblical stories woven into a nice finish at the end. The director of this movie, Rob Colen, and Gary Scott Thomsen, adaptor of the screen story, bothattended King's College at Cambridge and this influence is once again present in this work. While studying at Cambridge both men were entranced by the works of C.S. Lewis and other great classics such as Homer's Odyssey and the bible. This story is not about car racing, love or any other stupid themes like that. What Thomsen and Colen have done here is reverse the outcome of several biblical and mythological stories. One that weighs heavily here is the Tower of Babel. ""The shadow of that Hyddeous Strength, Sax Myle and more it is of length."" This popular quote from the Welsh poet Sir David Lyndsay from his work entitled Ane Dialog, describes the tower of babel as observed in reference to the Fischer King mythology. The Tower of Babel crumbled from a lack of communication according to the myth. That could just as well happen in this representation of the system, but the undercover cop learns to communicate on a spiritual level with the racers, thus learing the importance for maintaining the honor of the racing world, and protecting the true protaganists at the end of the movie. Colen and Thomsen also appear to have taken elements from Greek mythology in the making of this movie as well. Consider these lines from Homer's Odyssey. ""Stand beside me, Athena, fire me with daring, fierce as the day we ripped Troy's glittering crown of towers down....Surely I will stand beside you, not forget you, not when the day arrives for us to do our work..."" Doesn't this sound familiar to you from the movie? The conversations held before the night street race, before the big finale. Yes, Colen and Thomsen have not only made references in this film to biblical and mythological works but succeeded in blending them together seamlessly. The only thing they forgot was to include Billy Drago in their brilliant cast of actors. This movie has a deep meaning for today's society, as we crumble due to communication barriers all over the world. But people still can stand side by side with others and accomplish great things. I know, I was in the field as a soldier for many years and can tell you that brotherhood can still run strong in this fading world. If every movie was as inspiring as this one, no one would ever want to leave the theater again. In other words...

","After seeing this film my initial reaction was one of disappointment.  Vin Diesel did another great job as he did in Boiler Room, but the lead Paul Walker reminded me way too much of Steve from the show full house and the voice of Aladdin in the Disney flick and it irritated me throughout the film.  The car chase scenes and detail put into making the cars as visually impressive as possible was well carried out but the viewer was left with a gaping hole where a meaningful plot should be. The plot summary read ""Undercover cops infiltrate Manhattan street racers to bust a hijacking ring"" but this aspect was left in the dust and replaced by Vin's muscles and fast cars.  I enjoyed this movie, and after leaving the theater definitely tried to drive in a more exciting manner but I would not call this movie a great or classic of our times. I would give this a 6.5-7 out of 10 stars."

"Quinoa1984","7","0","2","22 June 2001"," Great action and illogic make this a good B movie
","The Fast and the Furious star the always good Vin Diesel as a car racer- on the streets.  He meets Brian (Paul Walker) in a good stoke of luck as he saves him from the cops.  Then some more plot comes in into the film, but it the action that counts here.<br/><br/>Giving credit where credit is due, the film has outstanding action sequences involving car chases that haven't been this exhilarating since the infamous pod race in Phantom Menace.  Plus (and surprisingly), the film envelops you into the story, and it makes you feel some actual feeling for the characters among the blaze of the cars.  And for that I reccomend this movie for the thrill seeking audience that has chomped up the recent popcorn flicks such as Mummy 2, Tomb Raider and Swordfish (Fast and Furious is one of the best ones of it's kind so far this year).<br/><br/>However, with most B flicks come the inevitable flaws, and this has 2 usual yet still dumb ones.  1, from the looks at some of the steamy and violent scenes in the movie, it looks like as if director Cohen was making a rated R movie filled with even more action, sexual content and dare I say naughty language in the mix.  Yet, once again, it might seem, the guys up top have made this film into yet another PG-13 flick to try and up the sales.  That's why say what you will about the South Park movie, but at least they kept on trying at it until they got the R (and that is also evident from the s**t episode from 2 days ago) unlike such movies as Bring It On and Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>And 2 (illogical part), this film takes place in Los Angeles, a city that is sometimes called the city on wheels.  Then how come when the race in the streets scenes come up, you almost see no cars whatsoever on the streets (unless it's used for the plot or something)?  I have a feeling that even though this doesn't have much logic in it, at least it's better here than in New York, cause then it would be just plain ludicrous.  Anyway, like I said, It's a good action movie, though not a great one.  Kudos go to the director, stunt co-ordinators, drivers and Diesel.  B+"

","It's summertime, and that means light-as-air movies, and as they go, The Fast and The Furious is great summer fare.  Though I could have done with less profanity (PG-13?!?), I enjoyed the film thoroughly.  Hot guys and cool cars--what else do you need?  Vin Diesel burned up the screen as always, and Paul Walker's blue eyes made me melt.  Michelle Rodriguez' and Jordana Brewster's parts could have been plumped up, and the acting was hardly Shakespearean, but it didn't have to be.  Yes, this film is very similar to Keanu Reeves/Patrick Swayze's Point Break, so if you enjoyed that film, you should enjoy this one as well.  In short, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  As for the racing, I was really impressed with the technology and creativity that goes into the cars, and I think that it's too bad that these racers have so few places where they can show off their cars safely, away from ordinary drivers.  I think every town should have a designated area (perhaps outside the city limits) for this sort of thing."

","""If you need time, go out and buy the magazine."" Okay so it won't let me just type one line and be cool ;o) I must say I am glad I didn't pay my own money to see this movie. I mean the cars were nice, well one car at the end was nice, and the racing was cool. But the acting was TERRIBLE, dialog was a minus 10, story line was simply boring. There are some good looking people in this movie though ;o)"

","Making a hit Hollywood film is tough... but you need to know when to call it quits.  Or... hey, just take a movie like... hmm... Point Break and change the words around.  In fact, why don't we just keep some of the lines the same?<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I felt that this was a good movie, but the plot was very reminiscent of Point Break.  At times I had a hard time paying attention to the movie, because I already knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should go out and see it.  Anyone who liked Point Break should go see this movie.  Anyone who didn't like Point Break hey, go see it anyways it's pretty good."
"airfigaro","5","0","1","28 June 2001"," What's the big deal, oh yea, duh.
","The action was ok, and the soundtrack that accompanied was nice, very nice. But the whole thing was a bit over the top.  I understand how big street racing is, but young Asian men with rich parents acting like gangsters intimidating folks for engines, toting automatic weapons?  Hi-Jacking trucks for stereos? FBI sending in a punk undercover cop to infiltrate a $6 million dollar operation?  Why would they bother?<br/><br/>I guess I like Point Break better, and Keanu Reeves is a better actor then Paul Walker (Wait! did I just say that?)  It seemed like Walker was trying to act like Reeves in P.B.  Vin Diesel offered up a decent performance, and the cars were nice, but that's it."

"Amanda-45","Null","0","1","1 July 2001"," Never Stopped!
","I saw this movie last night with a friend. It was a movie I wasn't very interested in seeing, but, as cliche and trite as the dialogue was, I still managed to spend a rather enjoyable two hours sitting in a movie theater while watching it. The action scenes were, well, great. There were plenty of cars and fast-paced scenes to keep me interested, I hardly noticed the stupid plot until the movie was over and I was given time to reflect. There are some movies that I watch and can barely stomach what the actors are saying, so I gag in my chair for most of the film. That did not happen this time. By all means, be critical of this movie after you see it, but not during. It will take all the fun away! Just go along for the ride, and I dare you to find time to stop and think."

","This was a pretty good movie. Like others have said, dumb but lots of fun.  And the music - especially the techno - was the best I've heard in a movie.  But of all the aspects of Point Break they ripped off - befriending the charismatic leader of the gang, said gang illegally financing their endless summer\streetrace, even the adrenaline theme - after all that, did they have to gank the scene where Keanu ""gets inside"" by eating at the girl's workplace? I was just waiting for this guy to spit out a high pitched, 'dude'-heavy ""shrimp and fry""..."
"dlmiley","6","0","1","30 June 2001"," At least it was better than ""Driven""
","Silly but somewhat entertaining teen version of ""Driven"".  Vin Diesel walks thru his role as the leader of a pack of street racers who may or may not be hijacking truckers.  Paul Walker has yet to be tested in a serious role and he is not here.  This movie is mostly about the cars and action.  The actors are there simply to drive and repair them.  But as I said, at least it was better than Driven! 6/10"
"Mr. Pulse","6","0","1","30 June 2001"," Dumb- and proud!
","The Fast and The Furious is one of the most unapologetically stupid movies to come along in a while.  It's about a bunch of drag racers, but really, it's all about the drag racing itself.  The filmmakers know this, so they spent all their time on that stuff, and basically ignored usually important elements like plot, conflict, and dialogue.  The result is a movie that is extremely watchable, but nevertheless very, very dumb.<br/><br/>If you care about plot, you obviously are thinking too hard at this movie. Still, TF&TF is about a few drag racers, led by Turetto (Vin Diesel), who gets mixed up with new kid on the block Brian (Paul Walker).  We quickly learn Brian's a cop, looking for some guys who rip off semi trucks while they are driving.  Anyway, by the end of the movie the film is so wrapped up in thrills and big explosions and things smashing into one another, it basically gives up on the plot, doesn't bother resolving several of the conflicts (Including Brian's weird love interest with Turetto's sister).<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue are truly laughably bad.  When Vin Diesel says a line like ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time...for those ten seconds or less, I'm free."" I certainly laugh-how does he keep a straight face? These are lines that porn actors would have trouble delivering straight! Diesel is ideal for this role; he's physically intimidating (Paul Walker looks downright wussy next to him) and his no-emotion acting style really allows him to say stuff that other actors might actually think about when they delivered them and realize just how stupid they were going to sound.<br/><br/>Still, the racing stuff is very exciting, and a heist involving an angry truck driver is truly thrilling (Even though I didn't care one iota about who lived or who died).  Even though there's a big plot hole in that scene, it'll be hours before you realize it.  The conclusion is exciting AND humorous; yet makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  This film is in-the-moment enjoyable, groan-worthy in retrospect.<br/><br/>Rob Cohen, director of the atrocious Daylight, and the slightly-less-atrocious, but still-pretty-horrible The Skulls, is a little better here, wisely avoiding to bathe all his pretty characters in golden halos of backlight and instead going for a much more realistic look.  He's probably aided by the exciting material not the other way around.  I'm still not convinced he's a good director.<br/><br/>Anyway, sad to say, I enjoyed this movie far more than just about any other action movie this summer...as lame as it is, it stays fairly enjoyable throughout.  In a lot of places, the car-chase free parts stay fun cause the people talking sound so completely stupid.  I laughed, I was entertained, I wished there were more movies out like Memento."

","If you think that this movie is only for the male population ladies, think again. This film, The Fast and The Furious, had its female points of interest as well as the male points of interest. If you still don't believe me, go out and see it, it is worth the money the theaters are asking us to pay now."

","Not impressed with the writing at all.  The character development was weak and all in all a dissapointing film.  Vin D was good and Paul Walker was somewhat beleivable, but the scene where Walker tell of his undercover ways was just pathetic.....The movie should have been re-written at least 12 more times.  The car scenes were great and the action was solid.  No sequel please.............."

","Finaly got to see it after last night the theater was full and no tickets were left. :(   It was a good movie,had some really good parts in it but was a bit dull in others. If you like cars and racing this is the movie to see. You get to see all those expensive parts and 'cool' things that most people can't afford."
"spiritualone","Null","0","1","26 June 2001"," Runs out of agas from the starting block
","Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has a thing for Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), who serves up tuna salad sandwiches at a vacant and failing open diner that only seedy, big burly thugs like her car mechanic brother Dominic (Vin Diesel) and his crew Vince (Matt Schulze), Leon (Johnny Strong), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jesse (Chad Lindberg) eat there. Dominic doesn't like the attention Mia is getting from Brian because he buys auto parts under the counter from Brian's boss. The parts are used to illegally enhance cars for street racing.  Dominic and his crew bet on the races to support themselves. On the flip side of the racing coin is a Chinese gang led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Unknown to the general populace, Brian is really a cop investigating a series of truck hijackings that he is trying to link to the street racers.<br/><br/>Working at a movie theater, I didn't expect this movie to do the business it did. But when the movie sold out every show on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, I had to see what all the hooplah was about so I dragged myself into the theatre. Before I went in, I read the synopsis the movie studios send us and said `Hmm, this may be good'. Guys, this movie comes nowhere close to that description. It starts with one of many implied truck hijackings. From there you are swept into what is suppose to be the story.  Quite a few things bothered me about this movie. First, there is an air of fear associated with these street race gangs. They are buff and stuff and claim territory, but what I wanna know is what is so scary about a gang that race cars?  Do theydo drive by honkings or something? What is this movie about? Is it about the illegally enhanced cars and the crime of street racing or is it about the truck hijacking sting. The script really never settles on one or the other. The love story between Brian and Mia goes no where at all. I found myself asking whether if they were together or not.  There is one scene where I think the writer said ` Ooops, wait a minute, I forgot I was supposed to have a strong plot and make a point. I guess I had better clear some things up and make this one story.'  He does this ( or should I say he didn't do this) in a diner scene between Dominic and Brian.  The next thing that bothered me was the fact that even in the police scenes, you never know why the police suspect Dominic of the crimes. The movie gives you the impression that there are tons of street racing gangs and gangs of all types, so why did they focus on Dominic's gang. They try to hang the fact that he had been in fights as the reason but that is very weak<br/><br/>As for the acting, no one should call there mothers or anything because no one stood out. I will give Vin Diesel credit on one scene where in he reminisces on his father's racing days. He was cool and somber in this scene and it worked, but when he starts yelling, he isn't believable at all. His spontaneous rants are more like King Kong beating his chest rather than theatrical emoting. Other than the words, `I am a cop,' Paul Walker never proved he was a cop. Jordana was weak altogether.<br/><br/>I will give the camera guys credit for the racing scenes.<br/><br/>Ultimately it all depends on what you wish to see in the movie. If you want to see a lot of cool cars and hear Limp Bizkit's `My Way' blared loudly, then sure go see it, if you want cars and a plot, catch an episode of Knight Rider."

","Roger Ebert once wrote that there are ""good"" bad movies and there are ""bad"" bad movies.   But once in a while there comes along a truly ""great"" bad movie--a B-picture so desperately trying to claw it's way out of the confines of it's genre that you have to give it credit for nothing if not sheer guts.<br/><br/>To call Rob Cohen's ""The Fast and the Furious"" a ""great"" bad movie is a heady compliment indeed.  There have been many attempts at films with similar subject matter that simply fall into the category of ""bad"" good movies (with Renny Harlin's recent car wreck ""Driven"" coming to mind as a picture of great means yet dubious end).  The tale of rival street racers in Los Angeles, ""The Fast and the Furious"" sets itself apart with a strong sense of style and thoroughly exciting racing sequences.<br/><br/>In his past works, director Rob Cohen has displayed a journeyman-like quality behind the camera, making very professional, albeit serviceable films that have never been able to free themselves from the manacles of genre (""Dragonheart"" and ""Daylight"" are but two such examples).  But in ""The Fast and the Furious"" Cohen brings a heretofore unseen visual panache to the proceedings, turning a film that could have been a mindless exercise in action histrionics into an exciting, sardonic (yet admittedly still mindless) ride.<br/><br/>The film worked for me on a very visceral level, and the expert camera and effects-work were aided by a first-rate sound mix that added a great deal of intensity to the whole affair.  Vin Diesel gives a performance that is all steely-eyed machismo and throaty growls in the place of syllabic speech. But it's a perfect fit for Paul Walker, who strikes all of the right chords in a role meant to register, I suppose, as Keanu-Lite.<br/><br/>
Audiences will scratch their heads as motivations shift, loyalties twist, and logic is all but beaten into submission, but ""The Fast and the Furious"" is undeniably entertaining.  It is garbage of the highest order, a ridiculously fun pastiche of genres, stock characters, and well-made set pieces.<br/><br/>You may be groaning at the film's idiocy, you may be cringing at it's over-the-top action, but I can almost guarantee that you'll have a smile on your face while doing it."
