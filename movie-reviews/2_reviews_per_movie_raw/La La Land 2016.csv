","La La Land is a cinematic marvel. It's nostalgia, meticulousness and joy captured my heart and earned itself the title of one of the best musicals of all time.<br/><br/>Almost every aspect of La La Land is close to perfect making this not only one of the best movies in recent history but also one of the best looking films and a very memorable cinematic experience. The cinematography is lively with phenomenal long takes, different location and gorgeous colours thanks to the production design. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone make a wonderful musical duo with serious chemistry as if the roles were made for them. The music feels alive at any moment and the sound track is definitely consistent. After Whiplash, the stakes were high for Damien Chazelle and La La Land undoubtedly lands him a spot on Hollywood's best directors. Pulling of two films of the same genre and making both of them seem unique and originally is no easy thing to do and writing a film can be agonising so Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise he's getting.<br/><br/>La La Land is a genre defying masterpiece which I would recommend to anyone a fan of musicals or not. It's colourful joyfulness is a sight to see.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9+/10"
"wgerhardt","10","70","87","10 August 2019"," A true ode to the Golden Era of Hollywood
","The vibrant colors and use of musical scores to set the mood for scenes transported myself back in time. This movie feels not only like a beautifully nostalgic nod to Hollywood of yesteryear, but also that of a timeless love story. Gosling and Stone have a charm to their chemistry on screen during the musical and dance numbers. All these aspects lead to a raw portrayal of love that many experience in life, with still providing a sense of hope and wonder to the viewers. I was entranced from the opening scene until the final note played by Goslings piano. I absolutely recommend this film to any and everyone!"
"CalRhys","Null","244","340","18 January 2017"," Nostalgic, Colourful, Joyous CinemaScope Magic
","Do I like musicals? Not really... but damn, 'La La Land' is a nostalgic, colourful, joyful marvel!<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle gained international acclaim and recognition from his masterful drama 'Whiplash', what were the chances that he could pull off similar success two times in the row? Well, if 'La La Land' is anything to go by, then I'd say he did the job. With just three films under his belt as of 2016, Chazelle is slowly becoming the next big thing this movie industry has seen. His passion for classic movies and musicals is evident as he references and pulls influence from films like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Umbrellas of Cherborg' and even 'Rebel Without a Cause', the latter of which is one of my favourite films so seeing the nod to it was something I was pleased about.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Gosling and Stone is strong to say the least, after two previous collaborations, their already-strong bond helped them become one of modern-day cinema's finest couples. The music is bouncy and toe-tapping catchy, the cinematography is utterly stunning with gorgeous colours and impressive long takes, and the locations sum up the American dream and the passion the characters hold for Los Angeles. 'La La Land' is by far one of the finest cinema experiences I have had in the past 5-10 years, and although this isn't a film I would typically enjoy (genre-wise), Chazelle has instead crafted one of my favourite films of this decade. A film I would recommend everyone see in the cinema to truly witness the CinemaScope magic."

","I remember when I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be a sad but sweet love story and nothing more.

"lvanderwindt","8","7","7","24 April 2020"," Great Actors!!
","I thought it was a great movie. The plot did start out a bit laborious but it got better throughout. I had the feeling that there wasn't really a storyline in the beginning. But i'm glad I sat it out to see the rest of the movie because it was worth it. Obviously Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are so well played together, because they did two other movies together before this one. The music is obviously amazing, I just got new earbuds so it was even better haha. I really love how the characters kinda 'flow' with the music while their bodies move with the music, right on 'beat' every time. So even though the 'musical movie' genre is not my thing i still loved it."
"CubsandCulture","10","10","11","24 March 2020"," An all time classic musical
","This is like a great 50's MGM musical was made in 2016 and I simply cannot understand how anyone would dislike the film. It has everything a musical should have. There's the two appealing and darling lovebirds to follow. Striking and visual pleasant colors and direction that make the film a cinematic experience from beginning to end. And the score is beltable, lush and with with iconic songs. This is like the platonic ideal of movie musicals.<br/><br/>Best of all the script has a relative sophistication to it; there's a troubling ambiguity about how the film feels about Seb and him being way to into jazz. In fact the script, more or less, acknowledges that he is a bit a prig. Indeed the film leaves the distinct impression that the romance was sacrificed on the alter of personal ambition. It is annoying how the Oscar race simplified this film.<br/><br/>In the end this is one of the great musicals."

"TheMovieDiorama","10","9","10","24 February 2018"," La La Land will always be remembered as the film that nearly got Best Picture.
","Now, as most of you know, I dislike musicals. Randomly bursting into song is just not to my taste, at all. Then La La Land came along and I consistently read ""overrated"", ""boring"" and ""snoozefest"" by most amateur reviewers. After literally just watching this, I can confidently say instantaneously, La La Land is phenomenal. Oh. My. Word. I love it when I'm wrong, and I was so wrong about this. I cannot fault it. I have fallen in love with La La Land. You could say I've gone la la for it! Where to even begin!? This isn't just a musical. This is a homage to classic cinema, an endearing tribute to all those silver screen masterpieces that have moulded Hollywood to what it is today. Dive beneath the glossy surface and I found myself experiencing a story about fulfilling dreams, pursuing passions and just live life to its fullest. It evoked pure joy from me, genuine happiness. I have never smiled and teared up simultaneously to a film before, ever. Yet Damien Chazelle went and only done that. His direction was absolutely outstanding. From the gorgeous long takes to the vibrant colour usage. He deserved every award. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling both gave magically enigmatic performances, particularly the former who mesmerised me with her solo audition performance. The choreography during the dance sequences defines classy, imitating the classic pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The soundtrack will be instantly downloaded, 'City of Stars' and 'Mia & Sebastian's Theme' were the highlights. The production, costume and sound design were all perfect. The dimming of the lights to focus on the characters felt refreshingly revelatory. Urghhh I think I'm in love. This is why I adore the medium of film. To capture the magic of a whirlwind romance in a joyous perspective. It is undoubtedly rare to watch a film in this calibre. I never thought I would say this but...La La Land gets the perfect rating. Damian Chazelle...two for two, congratulations! Keep it up."
"proud_luddite","9","73","109","20 March 2018"," The best movie of 2016
","The main characters in this Los Angeles romantic musical are Mia (Emma Stone), a coffee-shop employee with dreams of being an actress; and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist who aspires to open his own club that plays jazz like it was played in the good old days.<br/><br/>At long last: a movie released during the 2016 awards season that actually lives up to the hype!<br/><br/>Early in the film, there are two superb group musical numbers. The numbers that follow are more low-key relating only to the main characters but they are still well performed and executed.<br/><br/>The stories of career struggle within the broader narrative are very believable. They include the hell of auditioning to people who are too busy plus the desire to maintain the purity of a great music genre (jazz) while too often being told it is ""a dying art"".<br/><br/>Gosling takes a while to break into the role particularly where the singing is concerned but it's not long before he fits into the part quite nicely. Stone is superb throughout the film. She is even spot-on as an actress giving mediocre auditions. She's given a full range - and not just as a triple threat - and she fully lives up to the expectations especially during the song ""Audition"" near the end.<br/><br/>There is something uniquely enjoyable about Hollywood portraying itself. The movie also gives nods to great classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"", ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"", and ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" all the while being unique and standing out on its own. In addition, the set designs and photography add further to the film's greatness.<br/><br/>The reference to ""Les Parapluies de Cherbourg"" comes through strongly in the movie's final number. This scene is probably the best scene of any movie in 2016. It leaves one with so many mixed emotions and extreme on either side. The production number is magnificent while its mood is melancholy.<br/><br/>The teaming of director/writer Damien Chazelle with musical composer Justin Hurwitz is one of the best matches since Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand in the 1960s.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:<br/><br/>1) Directing by Damien Chazelle<br/><br/>2) Acting by Emma Stone<br/><br/>3) Music by Justin Hurwitz"

The emotional changes experienced by the heroes and heroines, like the four seasons, are adorable, enthusiastic, withering, and cold. Relatively speaking, the story of ""The City of Philharmonic"" is very simple. Two young men and women with dreams, because the dreams come together, are separated because of their respective dreams."

","First film ever that made me tear up like a baby. While probably being my favourite musical, the songs in this film weren't really what stuck out as exceptional to me. It's just beautifully shot, well acted with great dialogue, and it perfectly encapsulates emotions of sentiment.<br/><br/>I must admit this film's hard to get into at first, but I quickly got past the cheesiness of musicals and was loving it from Ryan Gosling's introduction onward.<br/><br/>I also love the way the messages are portrayed. The grim depiction of conflict between dreams and relationships. The way it communicates (with jazz) how art needs to evolve to survive, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. This film itself is a modern reincarnation of 70s musicals, poetically playing into its own metaphor about helping old art-forms survive. Something about the characters just hit especially close to home though - watched it twice so far and still love it."

"Medialawman","9","5","5","1 December 2019"," La La Land by Wayne Keeley
","NOTE: There is no way that this film can be reviewed without revealing spoilers.<br/><br/>Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then
They never part again<br/><br/><ul><li>From Elvis Presley's It Happened at the World's Fair (Words and music by Ben Weisman - Sid Wayne)</li></ul><br/><br/>Okay, so I must disclose that I was biased even before watching La La Land and was positive that this review would be a rave. One of the main reasons is that I love the old-style Hollywood musicals like Singin' in the Rain, Guys and Dolls, Brigadoon, and most of Elvis Presley's musicals (yes, it's true, Viva Las Vegas being among my favorites). I may commit critic sacrilege here, but I even loved Beach Blanket Bingo with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. La La Land got incredible raves from all of the major critics. It was touted as a throwback to the old silver screen musicals. Then I heard via cocktail chit-chat that it had a knock-down-drag-out opening number. I also heard Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the new A-List triple threats (Gosling being a quadruple threat, because he not only acted, sang and danced, but did all of the keying on the piano for complicated jazz musical numbers.<br/><br/>The archetypal plot was simple and algorithmically sound; one that is as old as time itself. Two people on diverging paths in life meet and fall in love. How can that formula go wrong? Remember When Harry Met Sally? Here, Ryan Gosling plays a struggling jazz pianist who after a series of fateful encounters (or mis-encounters) hooks up with Emma Stone, a barista wannabe actress. He loves jazz - the real, historical, visceral, gut-wrenching jazz of Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, and Thelonius Monk. He wants to own a club someday where he can showcase the real deal. She, on the other hand, wants fame and fortune as an actress - think icon status like Audrey Hepburn. Despite their different dreams, they support each other and ultimately fall in love.<br/><br/>And so I began watching it with a glorious grin on my face, already thinking of the superlatives that I would use in my review. The opening number was as predicted - simply incredible - killer camera work and choreography. Indeed, the single-take-steadicam/jib-arm opening number left the long Steadicam takes in Birdman in the dust. It also far surpassed the groundbreaking Steadicam opening (amazing for its time) of The Bonfire of the Vanities with Bruce Willis. Now I was thinking of superlative superlatives to use.<br/><br/>Okay, so in the dancing department, Gosling and Stone were nowhere near Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. And maybe their singing was not on par with Tony Bennet and Lady Gaga (or, for that matter, Meatloaf and Karla DeVito). And maybe it wasn't a jukebox musical and didn't have the great musical numbers of a Man of La Mancha or My Fair Lady. At least I was still smiling.<br/><br/>NOW HERE COMES THE SPOILER.<br/><br/>Just when you think it's going to be an Elvis Presley happy-ending musical, it cuts to five years later. Not only aren't they together anymore, but she's married to a guy who looks like the boyfriend she dumped for Gosling and has a kid! Oh, and she also is a huge star. She and her husband are on their way to dinner when they hit bumper-to-bumper traffic. Just when I think this is some parallel universe and her husband is going to morph into Ryan Gosling, she tells him to turn off the highway and look for a restaurant on the backroads. Lo and behold, they stumble into this jazz club - you guessed it - owned by Ryan Gosling. They spot each other and it cuts to a meticulously assembled montage of what their life would have been like if they had stayed together. Maybe she wouldn't have been as big an actress and he wouldn't have his club, but at least they were together. So this was an alternate ending - I thought of the plays If/Then and Constellations and the films Sliding Doors and Savages. So it would be a happy ending after all.<br/><br/>Not!<br/><br/>It cuts back to her with her lame husband. They end up leaving after Gosling does a heart-wrenching homage on the keys to their past relationship. She leaves the club but not until after a parting exchange of knowing looks between them.<br/><br/>No happy ending. You know how frustrating that can be? You invest two hours in a film, are led down a garden path to what you think is a happily ever after ending and instead the hero turns into a Judas cow and gets slaughtered. I felt let down, betrayed. It was like the ending of Kevin Costner's No Way Out - a beautifully plotted thriller ruined by a cheap twist during the last two minutes of the film. I turned to my wife and co-reviewer; both our jaws were dropped lower than that of Marley's ghost's.<br/><br/>How can this be? Winner of seven Golden Globes, eight Critics Choice Awards, and fourteen Oscar nominations! Could I be this wrong about a movie after thirty years in the biz? I went back and did some research. Maybe the real ending would be released on an exclusive Walmart or Target DVD, or a digital download from Amazon.<br/><br/>I read that Damien Chazelle, the film's writer and director (who also did Whiplash) actually edited the ending first! He wanted it to end that way; meticulously planned it! How can you make sense of something like this? How can you justify it? I asked my wife and co-reviewer didn't they smile at each other at the end. She said that Gosling looked sad.<br/><br/>That was it then. I was determined to write this review with the sharpest Ticonderoga#2 possible. I was going to cut it until it bled.<br/><br/>And then SAG's promotional folder for the film came in the mail. And there, emblazoned on the cover in a frozen tableau, were the parting close-ups of Gosling and Stone smiling at each other. But it was more than that. Their eyes were beaming!<br/><br/>Like Michael Corleone being thunderstruck by Apollonia in The Godfather, it hit me: it was a happy ending. It had to end like this. There was no other way. They both loved their dreams more than each other. Their dreams were everything to them. In fact, the only thing they really had in common was that they both loved their dreams to the exclusion of everything else. They weren't compatible in the least. She didn't like jazz, and he wasn't crazy about acting (he missed her one woman show choosing a photo shoot for his band over her). While opposites attract, there must be a core compatibility. I know this first-hand because my beautiful wife is my partner and soulmate in every way possible. Even when we write reviews (which we do so independent of each other) sometimes they are eerie doppelgangers down to same verbatim lines! (In fact, I can't wait to read her review of La La Land). And finally, sometimes true love means letting go.<br/><br/>In conclusion, all I can say is that La La Land is a damn fine musical with a happy ending."

","Writer/Director Damien Chazelle, who already had a nice career going for him, explodes into the Bigtime with this delightful, mesmerizing, and completely unexpected ode to Tinseltown.<br/><br/>The opening sequence (satirized on the Golden Globes) really does not do the rest of the film justice. It is as if the cast from the FAME remake grew up, had children of their own, and then those children hijacked the Santa Monica freeway to do a 10 minute flash-mob dance sequence.<br/><br/>From that point on, the film is hypnotic.<br/><br/>We segue to a love story as pure as anything since the great dramas of the 1940s. If the film had been in B&W, you would almost have expected to see Bette Davis in a 3-hankie tear jerker.<br/><br/>Except for the musical interludes, of course, which are pitch perfect and totally wonderful.<br/><br/>Gosling is surprising as a leading man expected to do song and dance, but he delivers the goods. <br/><br/>Stone, who was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" after Easy A (2010), steals the film and possibly the hearts of the audience as well. The awards should flow like water, and she will deserve every one.<br/><br/>As I said, deep in the DNA this is an ode to Hollywood. The film industry has always had issues with endings -- back in the day they would film several different endings per picture -- and then decide at the last minute which to use. Here Chazelle pays homage to that by giving us an alternate ending, along with the ""real"" ending, along with a closing sequence designed to remind everyone that nothing in Hollywood is actually real, but everything still can be really fun.<br/><br/>Destined to be a classic. Recommended."

","Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will."
"neverever121","10","475","843","10 October 2016"," An unashamedly romantic musical, infused with intense charisma and devastating emotion
","I was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for a good musical, but I'll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I was intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique. So when I had the chance to see a late-planned viewing at the London Film Festival, I jumped at the chance (FYI, Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post- film Q&A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night before so I was chuffed!)<br/><br/>The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and 'make it', while Gosling is a jazz purist (""Anyone who doesn't like jazz just doesn't have the right...context"", he insists) who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it succinctly - ""Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams"". The musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between, with great music throughout.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about the film, for me, is just how daringly it dances between the old-fashioned ""Singing' In The Rain"" style of musical, and a bolder, modern style. The song numbers are great (the opening number received a round of applause in my viewing) and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals - a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers you'd expect from a musical in the 50s, and emotionally-wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts; there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gut-punch. <br/><br/>Stylistically the film skirts this same line; the film again looks and acts like a classic musical but frequently we see low-key reminders that this is modern day; actresses using their iPhones, a video being seen on Youtube, etc to remind us that this is set in the present day. If we didn't have these reminders, the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is the 1950s. The cinematography is beautiful and overall the film is visually stunning. There is also no doubt that it is wonderfully directed, with the same masterful control of pace and tension that we come to expect from Damien Chazelle thanks to Whiplash.<br/><br/>Gosling in particular is absolutely terrific, with a typically sardonic wit throughout. At the start of the film when his sister says she's worried about him as life seems to have him on the ropes, he responds ""I wanna be on the ropes. I'm just letting life think it has me and then before you know it - BAM. It's a classic rope-a-dope"". His delivery of these sorts of lines can't be matched, and it's easy to see why the producers said in the post-film Q&A that he was the person they wanted for the role in their wildest dreams. It's a role made for him with tons more of the above kind of lines. But more than that, Gosling captures a real emotional intensity at the film's emotional breaking points, more specifically in the sequence towards the end of the film that I mentioned earlier. He manages to convey such convincing emotion without so much as a word.<br/><br/>I'd feel bad if I didn't also praise Emma Stone, who has probably never been better. She has wonderful emotional range, from the ecstatic highs of love to the tearful, painful lows. <br/><br/>In terms of the Gosling/Stone films, this is by far the best. Their undoubted chemistry is given the full spotlight in this film with freedom to explore said chemistry without restriction. <br/><br/>The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while. I'm annoyed I'll have to wait so long to see it again, frankly.<br/><br/>Will surely win multiple Oscars and other awards."

"Jonas_B_Jensen","10","7","8","11 July 2019"," A wonderful telling of a timeless love story
","While this movie is sometimes depicted as Oscar-bait and Hollywood filmmakers celebrating themselves, I beg to differ. In my opinion, this movie is one of the best stand-alone romantic movies (musicals even?) of all time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and score throughout this movie is phenomenal. The music is extremely catchy and does exceedingly well in captivating the feelings of our protagonists and their state of mind. To prove my point; my top artist of 2016 on Spotify was Ryan Gosling. That's how good the soundtrack is.<br/><br/>The acting also has to be commended, especially from Emma Stone, which gives the performance of a lifetime. She does steal the show quite a bit, in my opinion, but the whole cast deserves a pat on the back and I find Ryan Gosling surprisingly hilarious in his role, with his temper and funny quirks.<br/><br/>The story itself is naturally engaging (in the musical way of things) and our protagonists have a wonderful sense of chemistry that is hard not to fall for.<br/><br/>The overall themes, however, are what really keeps me thinking about this movie. How the struggles of a tough career-path and your personal love-life, constantly brings you ups and downs. Do they change along the way? Would you trade a part of yourself to achieve your goals? How we deal with these situations, and the sacrifices that has to be made along the way, are challenges that most people can relate to.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Especially if you like the grandeur Hollywood-theme in and of itself or is a fan of musicals."

"ianzgreat","10","220","387","17 September 2016"," A wonderful and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world.
","When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and artists of the world. Having lived in LA and worked on both sides of the camera I can relate to much of this film's endearing observations, trials and tribulations; but anyone who's ever yearned for what seems impossible and searched for true love will also easily connect with this film's gargantuan heart. I'm a self proclaimed total movie snob not easily pleased by much of what I see, but La La Land gave me all the feels and more. I cannot recommend this film enough. It's the kind of film you leave and you don't want the buzz, the tickle, the movie-high to end. I can't wait to see it again when it's in wide release. The artist in me is inspired again."
"bob-the-movie-man","10","92","154","16 January 2017"," ""It's very nostalgic ‚Äì will people like it?""
","A little film. Not sure whether you might have heard of it yet? Damien Chazelle has followed up his astonishingly proficient ""Whiplash"" ‚Äì my top film of 2015 ‚Äì with a sure-fire theatre-filler in ""La La Land"". The old- fashioned musical extravaganza is back, and back with style!<br/><br/>""La La Land"" tells the bittersweet love story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) who first meet in an LA traffic jam but then get thrown together by chance (LA is such a small place after all!). Over the course of the next four seasons romance blossoms. <br/><br/>Mia is a struggling actress bouncing from audition to audition in a hopeless attempt to break through in LA's tough movie business. She makes ends meet as a Barista on the Warner Brother's lot. Meanwhile Sebastian is on a mission of his own: a talented musician, he is trying to restore jazz to the main stage (something the film's soundtrack will undoubtedly help do!) by opening his own classic jazz bar. As both strive for success on their own terms can love survive to deliver us the classic 'Hollywood ending'? <br/><br/>The film is technically astonishing, with clever continuous shots of the ""Birdman"" variety and masterly cinematography (by Linus Sandgren of ""Joy"" and ""American Hustle""). The lighting team in particular is superb: a case in point is Mia's 'in-Seine' (sic) song, with breathtaking fades of the background to darkness, a camera whizz-around the actress for effect and then a brilliant fade back to reality. Loved it. Overall, there are enough similar moments in the film to make cinema-lovers like me gasp with delight.<br/><br/>There's a curious timelessness about the piece which is surely deliberate. Whilst there are obvious and non-apologetic throwbacks to the classic musicals of the 50's like ""West Side Story"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" and references to ""Casablanca"" and ""Rebel without a Cause"", there is also a 60's vibe to the 'girls getting ready' sequence; an 80's A-ha cover thrown in at a pool party; and a Californian Prius obsession that is surely more 'noughties' than current. Most curiously, while everyone has smartphones no one seems to text anyone to announce changes to plans: the film is almost distancing itself from much of modern life.<br/><br/>In the acting stakes Emma Stone again shines like a beacon. She is just magnetic on the screen: (tiny spoiler) the biggest plot hole in the film is why on earth she wasn't given the part for her first audition! I was disappointed she didn't win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Birdman"" in the ""87th Awards"" (she lost out to Patricia Arquette for ""Boyhood""): but she just keeps getting better and Better and BETTER. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's confident and cocky turn also radiates charisma: in particular, it is astonishing that Gosling could play ""only a few chords"" on the piano before training for the film. A confidence boost for struggling piano learners everywhere. <br/><br/>It is actually difficult to imagine two better actors for the roles. (Emma Watson allegedly turned it down for ""Beauty and the Beast"": something she might be kicking herself for!) Are they both the best singers and dancers when compared to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds (R.I.P.) or Cyd Charisse? No, undoubtedly not, but they have an undeniable charm all of their own. (Perhaps we will see the ilk of the great hoofers and crooners rise again with a resurgence in the classic musical. Can Hollywood take a hint?) <br/><br/>The big question: now that both Stone and Gosling have won Golden Globes for acting in the ""Comedy or Musical"" category, can they convert that to Oscar glory where there is a single category in play? I'd like to think so. <br/><br/>It's also great to see proper movie-making taking place in the Hollywood studios again: during my recent visits to LA there seemed to be little other than TV work going on in the main studio complexes there (although its worth pointing out that for this film not all of the filming was actually done on the Warner Brothers lot). <br/><br/>Musicals are clearly measured by the quality of the music, and Justin Hurwitz (""Whiplash"") has produced a gem with ‚Äì notwithstanding the jazz numbers and a catchy little pop number from John Legend ‚Äì merely a handful of simple but unforgettable melodies that recur in different variations throughout the film. The soundtrack is already in my Amazon library and uplifting my mood on what is a damp and dreary Monday here in the UK.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle has delivered a triumph in both direction and original script. There is really very little I can fault the film on. In what was the somewhat patchy Coen brothers offering from last year ‚Äì ""Hail Caesar"" ‚Äì there was a standout moment of a throwback song and dance number with Channing Tatum that I raved about (you can find it on youtube). If I was being picky, then this tantalizing snippet would be a better representation of the style and vim of the original genre ‚Äì ‚Äì with the exception of the opening number, few of the song and dance numbers in ""La La Land"" quite get to that ""Broadway Melody"" level of scale and energy. This, together with a few concerns about the pacing in some places, led me to rate this as a 4.5 on first viewing.<br/><br/>However on now seeing it twice within 36 hours, it's got me well and truly under its spell! I normally emotionally resist films that arrive with excessive hype¬Ö but, in this case¬Ö I give in. 10/10.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, visit bob-the-movie-man.com)."
"mike-fisher","9","4","4","5 October 2019"," Stunningly good, to my amazement.

Romantic Hollywood Musical in 2016, give me break, I can't think of a more boring way to spend a few hours of my life. Boy did I get this one wrong.....I can't praise highly enough the performances of both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, nothing short of stunning.....is there any guy on the planet that didn't fall in love with Emma Stone as the movie progressed?

This film is a love letter to the dreamers of the world. The ending is heartbreaking and breathtaking. I highly recommend this film to anyone."
"wfjohnston14","10","333","615","13 December 2016"," The Most Charming Film of the Year
","La La Land is a triumph on so many levels. It hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end. Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be one of the most talented directors/screenwriters in film right now.<br/><br/>The film gets you with its charm. It flows from the dialogue like poetry. The chemistry between Stone and Gosling makes the film livelier. Stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with in Hollywood and now Gosling has join the ranks after his stellar performance as the jazz pianist who's main dream is watch jazz live on. Stone is a wanna be actress who can't find her way. Together, they thrive off each other's love and support as they try to accomplish their goals together. Each have a chance at their first Oscar gold.<br/><br/>What else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs. I found myself humming ""City of Stars"" all night long, already saving the soundtrack on every music platform I could. The music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of Gene Kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like Chicago. The production design helps with this with bright, vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to Emma Stone's dress. A charming film only works when all cylinders click. This one was clockwork.<br/><br/>Like Whiplash, the editing is superb, timing well with the score, making it very appealing to the eye. But the cinematography was mind blowing. Able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts made it very astonishing. Not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped. Each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the biggest ""awe"" effect, or to provide strong symbolism. <br/><br/>But the ending is what can really make or break a movie. This one makes it 10x better. It goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your dreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't your own la la land. Everything does not end perfectly.<br/><br/>When combining all these elements together, you get one of, if not the best film of the year. In a year where things became bitter, this really ends the year on a high note. Cheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic."
"bartonj2410","10","233","434","8 October 2016"," You'll be toe-tapping from start to finish
","You know when you're watching a film that you just don't want to end, and when it does end you feel as if you could watch it all over again right there and then? I had that feeling with La La Land, the new film from Damien Chazelle, who blew us all away with Whiplash a few years ago.<br/><br/>With La La Land, Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months.<br/><br/>Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress serving coffees to film stars while Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist playing a small time bar to make ends meet. The two meet and fall in love but it's their dreams of success that soon threaten to tear them apart.<br/><br/>The most striking thing about La La Land is just how beautifully crafted a film it is; the story, performances, music, dance numbers and cinematography all playing their part in making this such an unforgettable cinematic experience. I genuinely can't find one single fault in this film.<br/><br/>Chazelle proves yet again just how mature he is for such a young filmmaker, writing and directing such a touching and often funny love story with a meticulous energy. The whole feel of the film is a throwback to the golden age of musicals, a decision a lot of filmmakers would have been too scared to make yet the pay off is massively satisfying. <br/><br/>The gorgeous cinematography from Linus Sandgren brings the city of Los Angeles to life, awash with colour, while his swift camera-work, including some impressive long takes, in particular through the dance numbers, immerses the audience right in the middle of this dreamlike musical.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, La La Land features two superb lead performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, both giving arguably their best performance to date. Gosling has really grown on me as an actor, maturing into one of the best in the business today. He proved earlier this year that he has a knack for comedy in The Nice Guys and he proves it yet again here. Stone always manages to impress me and she is dazzling in La La Land, singing and dancing her way into our hearts. The pair share an undeniable chemistry and I would love to see them both get the recognition they deserve come awards season.<br/><br/>Justin Hurwitz's score and the original songs in La La Land, along with the wonderfully choreographed dance sequences, including a great opening number that sets the tone for the rest of the film, heighten the film's level of originality, maintaining that energy Chapelle's films possess.<br/><br/>I dare you to try and not fall in love with La La Land. I fell in love with it and I'm sure many more will do so too."

","La La Land is, quite simply, an absolute masterpiece. It wasn't just my favourite film of 2016, but it's easily in my top 10 films of all time. There is so much to love about the film, and I don't know where to start.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are, and I don't say this often, perfect for their roles. I really couldn't imagine any one else playing these characters, and the chemistry between the two of them is electrifying and wonderful to watch.<br/><br/>The score is beautiful, and the musical numbers are incredible. Everything is well-choreographed and I can't imagine how many hours they must have spent on some of these scenes.<br/><br/>I also really love the cinematography, and I am really glad it won the Oscar for Linus Sandgren's work. Speaking of which, I was heartbroken when I thought La La Land won Best Picture, only to find out a mix-up had happened and Moonlight was the actual winner. All film is subjective, but I find La La Land to be a supremely better film than Moonlight.<br/><br/>I have mentioned a few of the things that I love about La La Land, and they all come together to form such a great product, but my favourite thing about the film is how inspirational the story is. It's about two people who are struggling in different areas of life, coming together, forming a bond, and trying to work through their difficulties. Without giving anything away, it might not have the happiest of endings, but it was realistic and heartbreaking all at the same time.<br/><br/>Obviously, there's no score I could give it other than the one below.<br/><br/>SCORE: 100%"

","From the opening sequence, this film captivates the audience through the dancing and singing bringing to life the essence of the film in a couple of minutes. A broadway musical on the screen makes you feel as if you are watching this performance live, it really connects to the audience as it's full of energy and passion. It reminds the viewers of the beauty that is jazz music and reality of an actor and musicians' dream of becoming successful and ultimately making a choice of what is more important to them.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had a strong chemistry between them adding to the overall believability and connection to the characters. The film displays moments of comedy and changes to moments of seriousness rather smoothly. The audience feels for the characters' journey and individual growth as ""Mia"" played by Emma Stone and ""Sebastian"" played by Ryan Gosling pursue their passions for acting and music as they learn from each other who they are and what they want to become.<br/><br/>This film is my favourite musical movie as it cleverly uses jazz music in a modern and exciting way. The cinematography of the pool scene reminded me of the party in the film ""The Great Gatsby"" with all the loud music and dancing, adding to the atmosphere of the scene in both films. I recommend this movie for those who love musicals and enjoy playing a musical instrument or just listening to songs as well as those who love acting and performing. It's perfect for the whole family and a great way to feel inspired and motivated to pursue your dreams and express creativity.<br/><br/>This film will change the way you feel about jazz music and make you want to watch live concerts and shows. It has many lessons about the reality of wanting to become a musician or actor as it teaches you that it's all about learning to cope with rejection and to always look for opportunities and to never give up hope. One day your opportunity will come, you just have to push through the knock backs and be resilient. Problems may arise on the way as foreshadowed through the opening sequence song ""Another Day of Sun"" which talks about Mia and Sebastian's journeys' throughout the film but at the end, everything works out for the best no matter what they choose in the end. It doesn't always mean what's more important to them but what they need in that moment."

","This is my favorite movie ever. I love everything about it. The cast is perfect, the songs are amazingly written and performed, and the setting is beautiful. When I first saw this movie, I wasn't expecting anything special. I was absolutely wowed. I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this totally surprised me. First of, the plot is really interesting. It follows more of a real life path, with the couple not ending up together, like it does in almost every other movie. This feels more accurate, which makes the movie so much better. Second, the songs are amazing. I could have listened to the playlist over and over again. There is a huge focus on jazz, which is performed beautifully, in so many different ways, not just 'elevator music'. Also, the stars do an amazing job singing, especially since neither of the two main characters didn't start their career in singing. John Legend is great too, for his first real acting debut, and Light A Fire is performed really well. The movie starts off with a music number, Another Day of Sun, which is choreographed and filmed perfectly. Next, all of the shots are amazing, with scenery that really fills up the set. The lighting is also breathtaking, with one scene in particular which is breathtaking. Everything about this movie is perfect."

It's very hard to describe. You find yourself rooting for both main actors and their success. Not only because they are such likeable characters but because you're never sure you can predigt whats about to happen.<br/><br/>When I finished La La Land I wanted to rewatch it immidiately. I think I've never had this urge to rewatch a movie that fast again. Many things speak for this. The scenery is unique, likeable characters, engaging plot etc. The biggest reason might be how I wished this was a Videogame with different endings. It's funny because the movie has a message for the viewer how freedom and chasing for your dream are important. It gave me this feeling of freedom that I thought I can rewatch it again and change something in the plot so I get another ending.<br/><br/>So why do I want to change the ending? In terms of sending the message mentioned above the ending is perfect. A very, very strong and meaningful one.

From the opening scene you can understand that this movie is not messing around, this scene delivers amazing feelings and prepares you for an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film. It is a pure Hollywood love story that has been portrayed by two amazingly talented actors. 
The movie circles around two options. Either choose love or choose dreams. At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it, again shown in a beautiful way. It takes influence from movies like ""Singing in the Rain"" and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one. It is so perfectly crafted, but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending. That ending. Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film. 
Also, in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful. For the first time in a movie, I have cried so loudly when hearing a song. This soundtrack gives you the feels. It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song. 
The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while.

","There are many musicals that fall into my ""Favorites"" category and this is definitely one of them. For a Director to take two actors that have no singing or dancing experience, however a dynamic chemistry with each other, made it work. The opening scene immediately draws the audience in with a snappy, amazing musical number on an LA freeway! This number was worth the Theater tickets! As the storyline develops in the lives of these two people, both struggling artists in different industries we are pulling for them both to find success and an enduring relationship. If you haven't seen this yet, (what are you waiting for?) go and enjoy; you will laugh and cry (which definitely makes up a good movie. Right? We've seen it at least five times and will probably again (we grew up on Musicals)."

","I saw this on 2018, on February just before the Oscar,
Found this movie real good, very good picture
it is indeed a fantasy film, with real good dancing scenes, 
I happen to play the piano, so the jazz parts were a candy to people who like watching jazz... Mia is adorable her struggle in Hollywood seems convincing
I think this Film, makes you either hate the industry or inspire you....
It's a long movie over two hours, but they spread it over four seasons to make it reasonable. in conclusion I never watched something like this before... (34th)
imaginary yet real good screenplay."

","From the internationally proclaimed musical director from Whiplash, damian chazelle has come back strong with another musical film' LALA LAND.
storming 5 academy awards and 6 golden globes has proven how successful the movie is, besides, it gains it.
The movie starts with the song 'Another day of sun', with a group of people dancing in highway, the choreography itself is remarkable enough, but the real magic lies in the tracking shot throughout the whole song, without any editing. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren has not only stops at the tracking shot, but the use of natural lighting throughout the whole movie. The colour grading and the camera movement has created a tremendous nerves of visual sensation. Each songs blends into the music perfectly, with the camera following the choreography, showing each dancing movement clearly. 
This doesn't stop the cinematic magic of Damien Chazzele. He himself is a musician, he knows the music well enough that he understand how music may engage the audience deep enough to make an impact. He finds Pasek and Paul to be the composer of the music soundtrack, the soundtrack won the academy award forest original soundtrack. After watching the movie, the songs and lyrics keeps popping out in my head, brainwashing, this is how the cinematic magic works. 
Words can't describe how appealing the movie is. Some may say the plot is too realistic and the whole movie is overrated, but these opinions comes to be objective. Maybe the plot may not suites anyone's taste, but you can't deny the fact that this movie somehow brings a impact to people, letting people feeling nostalgic back to the 60s, where it claimed to be 'the golden age of Hollywood', after adapting ideas from 'Singing in the rain', 'the umbrellas of Cherbourg' and 'revel without a cause'. The usage of costume and colour somehow comprehend a special visual experience, making the movie colourful and strong in sense.
The special chemistry between Ryan gosling and Emma stone also reminds us of the reality nowadays, making us feeling someway desperate of the truth, where people are unable to follow their dreams, but to sacrifices lots in order to achieve our goal.
Emma stone has done a brilliant job of portraying the role of Mia, maybe she can't sing, but the acts and emotion of hers is undeniably relatable; While Ryan gosling, acting as the role of Sebastian, frankly, is a bit too ordinary. 
Damien chazzele may be the new generation of musical director, bringing new era of musical film to Hollywood. Back in the 50s and 60s, when musical film are a hit, the hype ends in the 70s. Nowadays, less and less musical films are made, in hope of Damien chazzele, wishing he may bring back the hype of musical film back to Hollywood."

","As you may be able to tell by the other reviews on this website, everyone is split on whether this is a good film, or a bad film. Think of it as this, the film is described as a Comedy, Musical and Drama.<br/><br/>This film is funny when it needs to be. I wouldn't call it an out and out comedy like a Kevin Hart or Will Ferrell film. Nor would I compare it to a Wes Anderson film where it's a witty black comedy. It's just funny when it needs to be.<br/><br/>This film is a brilliant drama. The film begins and you may think ""Oh well this is generic"" but if you stay to the very end of this film you will find that Damien Chazelle has not only proved himself as a very good writer, but is a world class director. No other director can develop characters and make you care for them like Damien.<br/><br/>This film is also a musical, surprise surprise. I don't know what people were expecting coming into a modern musical, but the Director chose Jazz. Not everyone likes Jazz, but personally I thoroughly enjoyed the music in this film, and this comes from someone who doesn't like musicals OR JAZZ.<br/><br/>I won't ridicule you for not liking this film, but no matter what you think about Musicals, or Dramas, or the film itself. You MUST watch your film."

","What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale and hearty.<br/><br/>The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resorting to sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it.<br/><br/>The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky. It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.<br/><br/>All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and it really feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's a feelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects with people's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, ""Audition"", it has a bona fide classic."
"laabstract","10","309","602","15 September 2016"," A wonderful film that begs to be watched.
","An observatory, a boulevard, a bridge, a downtown trolley, all make up filming locations of the new film ""La La Land"". These locations are iconic, yet remain unnamed throughout the film. The sum of these locations create the city of Los Angeles. Any meaningful production is a sum of its cast members and in the case of ""La La Land"" there is no difference. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) come together to create a wonderful production, but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself. Throughout the epic musical sequences, the city in its whole is either visible or represented by its historic street lights. Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man. It lends its beauty to be danced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention. <br/><br/>Mia being a minor actress in Hollywood goes to casting calls where those auditioning look the same. This image of Hollywood conformity lends itself to the character of Sebastian who has to change his performance identity much in the same way Mia has done in order to fit in and make a living in the beast that is Hollywood. With this being said the performances of Mia and Sebastian are one of a kind, lending itself to a sort of fantasy adaptation of falling in love. The imagery of the film stops at nothing to convey the idea of love and the concept of a soulmate, while the business aspects of Hollywood coupled with the necessity of survival keeps the two characters at odds. The film represents a city, a city that often times is at odds with itself; a city that identifies talent based on familiarity rather than the unique and often overlooked aspects that create it. Ultimately ""La La Land"" is a story about conforming and not conforming and the gains that can be had in between. LA is marketed as the land of dreams, yet is often overlooked and stacked on a pile of dreams that will never come to fruition. <br/><br/>The film explores the idea of ""what if"", and tackles the idea of a working Hollywood versus a Hollywood where the idea of art is paramount. ""La La Land"" focuses on the idea of money versus art, and shows that nobel aspects of creativity are often ignored to focus on the monetary aspects of the industry while leaving behind the very art that drove them in the first place. The movie is very much paced in the realm of Hollywood where the cadence of the film is action packed with all the fervor of a young person entering Hollywood for the first time, yet as Mia and Sebastian learn the inter-workings of Hollywood the film slows down to reflect the realities that are faced when having to juggle income and art. <br/><br/>""La La Land"" reignites a fire that has been lost from a Hollywood that is so focused on relaunches and reboots. It's refreshing to see a totally unique film, especially one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional way. The singing, the dancing and cinematography move in perfect concert to give the appearance of something larger than life. The long musical sequences often border on the surreal, taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars. Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring, this is quickly remedied, but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing. <br/><br/>Watching ""La La Land"" is like being awake during a wondrous dream, there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them. As he sits at his piano, Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song, a powerful couple of lines that represent love, art and life. ""City of Stars, are you shining just for me, City of Stars there so much that I can see, Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new, Or one more dream that I cannot make true."" With ""La La Land"" a dream has come true, and made its way onto the big screen."

","I love musicals, but I must have missed the stand in the theater where they were handing our the kool-aid for this one. <br/><br/>Based on the hype, I had high expectations. I went in thinking ""La La Land"" would be like ""An American in Paris"" or ""The Bandwagon,"" but once it started I realized it was more like ""One From the Heart,"" or ""Everyone Says I Love You,"" although both of those dismal failures had better music. <br/><br/>In this film, Ryan Gosling plays a supercilious piano-playing bore who endlessly pontificates about ""jazz."" Emma Stone plays his vapid love interest, a star-struck barista who thinks she should be a movie star because she has a home filled with movie posters and her aunt once showed her ""Casablanca."" Once these two ciphers meet, the audience is subjected the kind of dreary conversation one flees from in real life.<br/><br/>The musical score is deeply uninteresting. Emma and Ryan's hilltop dance is supposed to be reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse/Ginger Rogers, but comes closer to Teri Garr and Raul Julia in the aforementioned Coppola disaster. <br/><br/>By the way, the film completely fails to capture L.A. in any way.<br/><br/>Kudos to Emma and Ryan for trying to sing and dance, unfortunately proving that it takes MORE talent than they or most other Hollywood celebrities have to perform in a musical. However, I think that Damien Chazelle should be prevented from ever making another film musical. <br/><br/>If you insist on subjecting yourself to an excruciatingly bad musical, try ""The Apple,"" which is a lot more fun and has better music. To check out good-to-great musicals, see the movies that ""inspired"" La La Land--the RKO Fred & Ginger movies and the MGM musicals from the 30's through 50""s. Even the recent straight-to-video ""Lucky Stiff"" leaves ""La La Land"" in the dust."

","What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.<br/><br/>Our central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist. She falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music. He falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore Hollywood. They soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way. <br/><br/>The only problem is - she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz. (Wait - I thought she loved his music when she first heard him play?) So he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician. That seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance. <br/><br/>But her auditions are a bust. No work. Nothing changes. She has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft. Yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band - the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist. <br/><br/>He sells out to get work - and she stays true to herself and finds no work. <br/><br/>This creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction. He does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams. She does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams - and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home. <br/><br/>Our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in Nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition. They travel back to LA - she sings at her audition - and she gets the role. Both have their own careers now - so they split up. Five years later - she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist. <br/><br/>One night by happenstance - she stumbles into the club and finds him. He plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple. Suddenly, she understands what his words meant so long ago - about the history of jazz - the poetry of the musician - now everything comes full circle - and they have a longing final glance. <br/><br/>This is all cool - don't get me wrong. But the story itself has been told so many times its clich√©s are even clich√©d. The songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid. Really - do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month? <br/><br/>Also, the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good. There is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film! Mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue. Also, Ryan Gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist. It just does not feel real at all that Gosling is so, so sad in LA with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely women.<br/><br/>What exactly is the purpose of this film? What was everyone singing and dancing about? Do we live in a world where people can fly down to LA and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear? Or do we live in a world where educational alliances, corporate oligarchy, family connections, and the occasional marriage - determine who gets to shine in the lights? Are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old Hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the Oscar season? <br/><br/>I dunno - this movie does have some strong moments in the script - and it does have some good acting - costumes - and lights - but I just think it's corny and I could not care less."

"fabiaalabraba","1","339","678","3 February 2017"," Shame on Hollywood for endorsing this movie as a 'Great musical""
","This film will disappoint you. Here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>1. Its apparently supposed to be a movie musical, yet BOTH RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE SINGERS. I couldn't quite get past this point. It is astonishing that two below par singers could be casted in a movie musical? It is a heavy contradiction to the genre of film it attempts to portray.<br/><br/>2. Both RYAN GOSLING AND EMMA STONE ARE BELOW AVERAGE DANCERS. Similar to the singing complaint, i was unable to be captivated and fully immerse myself in the movie/musical 'magic' because i was too busy cringing at their dance performance.<br/><br/>3. The STORYLINE WAS NOT CAPTIVATING. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, because of respective careers they don't end up together? Fin<br/><br/>4. THE STORYLINE WENT FLAT IN THE MIDDLE. The middle of the film dragged, for obvious reasons which is that the story line was to weak to maintain the intensity.<br/><br/>5. RYAN GOSLING'S CHARACTER IS ACTUALLY VERY ANNOYING A jazz fanatic that forces it down everybody's throat, including the girl he is dating. He was superior to others because of his love for jazz. He thrust jazz upon her, and because of that i never really for once believed in the film that she had organically grown to love jazz as her love for him also developed. Instead it seemed as if she had to pretend to like jazz as a pre- condition to their relationship.<br/><br/>6. The HYPE AROUND THIS FILM DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY OF THE FILM The expectations were simply way to high for this average film. I mean, it has 8.6 on IMDb for goodness sake!!<br/><br/>Although it is subjective, in my opinion, this film comes nowhere close to a great film or musical. In conclusion, shame on 'Hollywood' and so many once respected critics endorsing this film as one of, if not the 'greatest musicals' of all time. Furthermore, shame on movie lovers and society in general not having the balls to suggest the clear truth which is that this is clearly a very average film at best. Big Shame!"

","The new Hollywood musical with the intriguing title ""La-La-Land one of the most talked about motion pictures in recent years with two of Hollywood's most attractive and popular younger generation stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, can best be summed up in a single three syllable word ~~. PA-THE-TIC!<br/><br/>-- Gosling, in spite of a name that makes one think of goose liver, is indeed quite handsome in the traditional Hollywood leading man mold, but when it comes to acting or personality he is no Cary Grant or Jimmy Dean, and as far as dancing goes he couldn't carry the jock strap of either Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire. His love interest and dancing partner, Emma Stone, a lissome (skinny) redhead with gigantic blue eyes, and no breasts to speak of, is a much better dancer, and generally a far better actor, but seems to have aged considerably since her extraordinarily vivid interpretation of a sexy young college co-ed in love with her murderous philosophy prof in Woody Allen's ""Irrational Man"" just two years ago. In this picture she is in facial closeup much of the time but looks haggard, worn, and older than she is supposed to according to the story. The dance numbers seem to be an attempt at a homage to Astaire and Ginger Rogers in slow motion, but they are so badly set and choreographed that after a while they just become annoying. One particular Gosling Stone duet set in the L.A. Planetarium is so ridiculous with them antigravitationally traipsing on thin air against a galaxy of stars that it is downright embarrassing. The young lovers are clearly meant for. each other but their divergent career dreams and aspirations, she as an actress he as a Charley Parker type serious jazz musician, keep them apart in the wake of arbitrary script manipulations that seem so phony you get the feeling the actors had to keep asking themselves, ""Hold on a sec --what were we supposed to be doing in that last scene?"" Pathetic scripting, pathetic unmotivated dance scenes arbitrarily inserted, then ineptly executed -- pathetic unfocused direction - no wonder Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) have such pained expressions on their pretty faces all the time. I actually felt sorry for Emma in some scenes suspecting that she may have been physically unwell while going through the motions. I kept looking at my watch wondering if this thing was ever going to end. The running time was 128 minutes but it felt more like five hours. The final credits with handsome art-deco lettering were a great relief when they finally came up and put this picture out if its misery. No more Damien Chazelle for me. He also directed another sado-masochistic abomination entitled ""Whiplash"". Give me Mondo Cane ... Bottom line: A film almost as dopey as its dumbbell La-dee-da title."

Shocking that this pallid film is being feted for something it is not. Emma Stone, someone who is hard to watch in long extreme closeups throughout the film and Ryan Gosling exhibit no charisma or charm. Their dancing tries to be cute and romantic but is clumsy. The music is dirge-like and not uplifting. The producers should have used more professional musical performers, ones who can inspire when they sing and/or dance. Gosling talks about jazz throughout the film, but we hardly hear any good jazz, especially not the jazz greats he talks about. So how are we to know what is the great jazz that inspired him? His friend says ""Jazz is the future."" But in reality it's the present, being created as it's played. All of a sudden, Stone, the aspiring actress who shows no acting talent whatsoever, decides to become a playwright without showing any ability or work, except for having an apartment covered with photos of classic movie stars. The banal dialogue, superficial characters and overly long scenes are embarrassments. Stone comes into her old coffee shop and asks for two iced coffees. Immediately a guy standing there puts down a tray with two iced coffees in front of her. Glaring continuity problem there. Throughout the film in almost every scene there is nary a person who is over thirty. The casting people never cared to hire people who reflected the real world, fantasy or not. If the music had been tuneful and clever, the film would be somewhat better. As it is it is dull. he characters exist in a vacuum with no backstory. Only interesting aspect to this film is some of the recognizable Hollywood locations, but locations do not a film make. If anyone still watches the self-aggrandizing Academy Awards, it will be cringe-worthy if this film wins any awards except for production manager or art director. It's a sad state of affairs that this film is considered in high esteem. That accolade belongs to ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Band Wagon,"" ""Gigi,"" ""Oklahoma,""""South Pacific,"" ""Top Hat,""""Wizard of Oz,"" and films by Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Miller, Charisse, Garland, Crosby, Sinatra, Grable, Keel, and all the great stars who truly were musical comedy class acts.

Then the film pans out its narration of an ever-typical girl-meet-boy story (in this case, it is the girl who makes the first move), divided by seasons with a winter-to-winter rotation, initially, the story bifurcates in two different forks until the two finally hit the ground running, interposed with scintillating music numbers which can hypnotically melt your heart and dazzle your mind. Chazelle adroitly centers on two protagonists through and through like in those vintage romantic flicks where you can see haloes around them, anyone, anything else in their world has all duly faded into the dark background whenever their eyes meet, their hands touch, and they kiss.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone, whose on-screen dynamism has been patently tested in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE (2011), let sparks fly higher as they plunge wholeheartedly into the torrid journey, from misunderstanding, meet-cute, falling for each other, to supporting each other's dreams, taking the middle ground or simply giving up, doubting and bickering, to the highest level of unconditional and unadulterated love - the holy sacrifice to let go of each other when their time is due, the Gosling-Stone pair is superbly amicable, adorable and charismatic, each is blessed with their own tuneful theme songs CITY OF STARS and AUDITION respectively, and satiates viewers with a show-stopping tap-dancing. Gosling, as dapper as ever, oozes with a heart-throbbing attentiveness and devotion as a talented pianist who is bent on opening his own jazz bar, a traditionalist but deadly romantic; Stone, portrays a character so naturally rooted in her chromosomes, an aspiring actress-to-be finally pays her dues after numberless humiliating auditions, her vivacity, comic timing and line delivery are top-notch, both are eyeing for their second Oscar nomination at this stage.<br/><br/>Heading to the upcoming Oscar race, Chazelle, of course, is the one who deserves all the fanfare for his virtuoso directing competence, one will be sublimely intoxicated by his vision of L.A. envelopped with an indelible mauve palette in lieu of its usual sun-dappled glamour, vibrant props and tableaux vivants, not to mention the central music elements, which is always in the veins of Chazelle's works, his cherry-picked jazz-fusion, the fluent and sleek choreography, Justin Hurwitz's overwhelmingly soothing attendant score apart from several striking ear-worms, all those above-mentioned herald that a major cinematic director, with a distinct and greatly entertaining aesthetics adorned by his music flair, is in the offing in the land of L.A..<br/><br/>Last but definitely not the least, how can one not praise for the silent epilogue in the end, Chazelle soberly let audience get a view of what would happen to the perfect-matched couple if they were living in an ideal Hollywood fairy-tale, but reality, in most times, is a far cry from fairy-tale, we have to move on without our perfect-half, but that is not to say, life will be miserable or intolerable, thanks to Chazelle's perspicuous vision, in a long run, we might be able to cherish the true happiness once we were fortunately bequeathed, and perhaps, it never leaves us, it always stay with us, to savor, to reminisce and to never give up our dreams."

","A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What I mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment, watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at my very own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren't quite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite, and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled and heaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking direction and Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, it got Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally. You don't even need to make the effort to chew; it can now just squirt directly into you via the eyes and ears, a simulacrum of nourishment, over-flavoured glop taking the name of real love, real music, real acting and real life in vain."

","In a word: turgid. Given the hype, I had expected an up-beat colourful, all-singing & dancing romp. Boy, was I disappointed! Save your money and take your loved one for a couple of beers instead.<br/><br/>The opening traffic jam song-dance sequence was a nigh-on unintelligible uninspiring mess that added pointless minutes to what turned out in any case to be an over-long film. From there on we limp though a lacklustre passionless ""romance"" until we reach an ambiguous ending. <br/><br/>There are a couple of cute songs along the way. The dancing is disappointing, especially if you're thinking of something along the lines of Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers. <br/><br/>Ironically the high spot for me was the sequence where Ryan Gosling's character is playing keyboards in a pop band, something that conflicts with his jazz-based musical values. <br/><br/>Gosling's character seemed mildly depressed throughout. which is not appealing. And although Stone can act convincingly, there's a limit to how much big eyed gazing I can take. <br/><br/>When good films end, an audience will be buzzing with conversation, with smiles on faces. This one ended with silent shuffling. There was a palpable sense of disappointment. Did wives feel guilty for dragging their husbands to such a turkey? And did husbands fume at losing 2 hours of their lives, which could have been spent watching ""Homes under the hammer"" on TV?"

","Bottom-line: Once upon a time there was the American musical which could inspire the world by wielding great visuals, music, story and characters. Today we have the perfect lobotomy instrument called La La Land. <br/><br/>I began theorizing that it would only be possible to understand the praise and delight of the general populace if lobotomy would have been performed on a universal scale. I know not of any such undertaking and I'm no fan of conspiracy theories. Alas, I have to assume that there are shortcomings of mine which do not let me enjoy this so called jewel of a movie which purportedly restores the glamour of the Golden Era of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Plus points: 1) Pretty Emma Stone, who can act<br/><br/>Minus points: 1) Emma Stone can't sing, 2) Emma Stone can't dance too well, 3) Ryan Gosling can't sing or dance, 4) Weak plot delivered in a unbelievable manner, 5) Silly and overused musical score, 6) Uninteresting dialogue, 7) No character depth and actually no chemistry between the two protagonists. <br/><br/>Overall feel to the movie was that of silliness beyond measure. My personal reaction was that of uncontrolled, roaring laughter. It is strange indeed that while I cried at the ""funny"" moments, I laughed at the ""sad"" and ""serious"" moments. I have to admit that rarely have I laughed this way during a movie. The ratings and nominations are oftentimes so unfair to real cinematic talent that I had to give a 1 (one) mark for the balance. It is really sad that the Renaissance of the American musical is trumpeted by this hollow shell of a movie."
"MisterHOH","5","16","25","19 January 2017"," What the La La?
","I've joined the hype train and I got really burned. This film was mostly bad. How in the world it won so many awards?<br/><br/>First of all, E S and R G can't sing to save their lives. E S got only one song which she really sang using her chest voice and I don't really think it was her voice because of the discrepancy of what she sang previously up to that point. This film has no plot. It's like a musical version of Fifty Shades of Grey without the ""action"", distilled for kids, reaching really cringe-worthy moments. The love story is a Hollywood clich√©, sterile and devoid of any real meaning or connection to reality. <br/><br/>I'm really confused about the music, since this is what I've been doing for the past twenty years to make a living. Most of the songs are somewhat immature in the composition manner while their arrangements are quite beautiful. They are not close to how a true pedigree musical should sound like. They feel like the cheap version for a true musical, especially considering that the film goes to great lengths to substitute the ineptitude of the lead actors / singers with many many instrumental parts that most of the time feel inadequate, even though the orchestration and the mixing, in theory, is flawless. The whole movie revolves around just one melodic motif which gets overused really fast. Most of the arrangements are well executed, yet simplistic in manner with mostly appearance over essence. It's like reading a children's book. For me, that illustrates overreaching, without the necessary experience or profoundness to fully grasp the important concepts one is trying to say. The elements that constitute the movie just don't synergize good enough with each other to make it work. However there are several jazz arrangements that stand out of the crowd, and there's even a pop song which is pretty dope. I think it was the high point of the movie. <br/><br/>The film digs deep into its technicality to recreate the look and feel of the golden age of American cinematography. It uses almost all the tricks in the book: they dress the extras in very earthy colors and the leads in bright and vivid colors so they can really stand out, the use of silhouettes, a lot of floodlight reminiscent of carbon arc lightning, classic red green blue primaries color palette which is a true beauty to behold in several scenes. They used old anamorphic lenses, they color graded the footage as to be reminiscent of the glorious Technicolor age and its 3 strip process. The sets are beautiful. All this requires tremendous work and it really shines throughout the film. The team that was in charge of the technical aspects is top notch first class hands down no question. And here lies the true sadness: what it is and what it could have been. <br/><br/>La La Land has many nods to different classic films. It clearly pays respects to Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. And here lies another big problem. Those guys were Gods with shoes on. Compared to them, R G is a world class grade A dilettante. He's a good actor, whatever, but his dancing skills reminds me of that show Dancing With the Stars at most, which I always zapped away from. The film pays respects and nods at many old classics, while itself achieving nothing except basking in a pool of mediocrity, and worse, it's getting big time rewarded for it. No! That's just wrong. It's a disturbing trend and a symptom of a much greater and complex problem our society suffers from. It's like anti-vaxers for art.<br/><br/>The ending is the lowest point for this film. I'm obviously not spoiling it, but it will leave you wanting your money back. For me it was the killing blow. If there's a word to describe this whole experience, it's kitsch. For a comedy, it's barely funny and apart from the technical aspects which are really good, there is very little of movie metamaterial that could hold up under close scrutiny when compared to the great classics, or even other modern musicals for that matter. I'm sorry."

","Words I heard from so many people about this movie prior to seeing it was epic, spectacular, classic. I was so excited to see it and had such high expectations going into this film, especially since I just adore Emma Stone. I was sadly disappointed. I don't see what everyone else saw. I did enjoy some of the singing and dancing, also the desire to bring back the amazing and inspiring classics of original musicals. This was all just so epically wrong. Where do I even begin? The plot was not very inspiring, but kinda boring. The end was the worst ending to any movie of all time. I really wanted to not only like this movie, but love it. I just can't. It was meant to bring back the dead epic Hollywood musicals of Fred Astaire, but it was uninspiring and just altogether an epic failure for me. This movie made me cry, not Notebook cry, but like George Cloony playing Batman cry."

","The dancing was average at best. The opening scene was the best routine. These actors are not Ginger and Fred. I am not sure if the talent was missing, or something else. The singing was either weak, or mixed poorly. The song writing was unique, but not strong enough to remember. The story line was predictable but sweet. I was so looking forward to seeing a musical movie. It has received great reviews because I believe those reviewers were all so desperate to see an upbeat, musical love story, as was I. So, in conclusion, it is worth seeing, if only to just to send Hollywood a message, with your dollars. More of this but better quality please."
"frendtony","3","156","313","19 January 2017"," Looked forward to seeing this film - very disappointed
","I went to this film with the expectation that I would be seeing a 'modern musical with a nostalgic twist'. <br/><br/>This expectation was delivered but generally in a mediocre way. <br/><br/>The much touted opening number was a technically accomplished cinematographic feat but the setting and choreography was rather bland and boring (I struggled to hear and care about the song for this number).<br/><br/>I found the 'repartee' between the two leads was a bit mumbled and not particularly witty or fun. <br/><br/>The dancing was very average and the songs and singing unmemorable (Mia and Seb's theme was bland and not what you would expect a jazz enthusiast to come up with). <br/><br/>Apart from the two leads, there were no other memorable characters or performances.<br/><br/>There was never a moment when I felt joy watching any of the scenes, which I suppose was the reason why I was most disappointed with the film.<br/><br/>A few interesting LA landmarks were showcased in the film but, again, the interesting settings were not really exploited by the choreography. For example, Mia and/or Seb could have danced on the round balcony at the observatory (what you would have expected a Fred or Gene to have done). If this was not allowed on the real balcony, the balcony could have been re-created on a set.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling did not convey any great passion for either jazz or Mia, most of his facial expressions made it seem that he was a martyr to mild indigestion. He spoke a lot about his passions but you need to show this cinematically.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Emma Stone's performance much more. Some of her audition scenes were good and her performance of her last audition song was good (I thought the song itself was just OK).<br/><br/>To summarize, one of the few films that I was tempted to walk out on (but I was in the middle of a row), and one that I will never be tempted to watch again."

Any attempts to recreate the chemistry of so-called Hollywood golden classics it attempts to emulate are a weak fizz. <br/><br/>Slow and contrived, the plot is weaker than a cup of tea made from a tenth dunk of the bag. An imminently forgettable score appears built around one pleasant enough motif but is bashed beyond compare. There is richness in the jazz that underpins it all but much like its syncopated rhythms, this one misses the beat. No more so than in the much hyped opening scene: I was hoping someone might get some road rage and move the story on.<br/><br/>The critical hype is clearly written by those with their heads firmly placed in la la land."

"mike5141","3","122","243","21 January 2017"," I Don't Get It
","I'm sorry but I just don't get the adulation for this very bland, very boring musical. I watched it with a lot of anticipation with my partner and both she and I were bored enough to consider giving up.<br/><br/>The opening sequence was like a James Bond opening sequence. It had nothing to do with the actual film and was the best part.<br/><br/>I'm a very big musical fan and it's difficult to think of one I haven't seen. This one has an original score and isn't a film version of a Broadway musical so should not be compared too closely to films like Mamma Mia or Les Miserables but can be compared to Singing in The Rain, High Society and to a certain extent Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Cabaret, etc., which were produced in an age where Theatregoing was a rich persons pastime.<br/><br/>In every comparison, this film fails. The music is insipid and totally forgettable. The acting is OK but the main characters dancing would not have got them past week two of Strictly Come Dancing. <br/><br/>The biggest fault with the movie is the complete lack of supporting actors to flesh out the story. The two main characters are just not strong enough to carry the movie for more than two hours without help. I'm talking about actors like Anne Hathaway (Les Mis.), Joel Grey (Cabaret), Stockard Channing (Grease), George Chakiris (West Side Story), Donald O'Conner (Singing In The Rain). The list goes on and on. In this film all we got were cameos by John Legend and a totally wasted J K Simmons (would love to have seen him sing and dance!!).<br/><br/>So!

"ronniehrubin","1","136","273","3 January 2017"," Don't waste your time!
","This movie is not good. The high reviews are probably studio people or friends and family of all the cast & crew involved in this film! I really like both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, but neither can carry a tune in this movie! I'm not saying these two needed to be Shirley Jones and Frank Sinatra, but at least find 2 people that can sing!! We know Emmy Rossum can sing and they could have cast Patrick Wilson. For a musical, it's not just star power, the leads have to be able to sing! (or at least dub some beautiful voice in, like they did for Natalie Wood in West Side Story).<br/><br/>Plus, the story is quite boring and very slow. Girl meets boy, girl gets boy. Girl loses boy. (Yawn!!) Then there's the issue of maybe only one semi-catchy tune, add that to the boring story and you've got yourself a snooze-fest. Which no self respecting ""musical"" should ever be. <br/><br/>JK Simmons is really good in the 2-3 minutes he's in the movie, but no one else is even remotely memorable. In a role any male actor could have played, they waste Tom Everett Scott. By the way, the opening production number is very clever, but the song is not good by any means. I've already forgotten the tune or even the name of the song! The story isn't worth summarizing here as it's too boring to repeat. Very, very disappointing! Don't waste your money and wait for it to hit cable."

","If a producer is going to deconstruct a genre, the producer owes it to the audience to warn them early on (like in ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" or ""Unforgiven""). This film, which has been lavishly praised, earns my visceral hatred because it did not do so, and I frankly cannot recall a movie which has ever triggered that sort of reaction even though I have seen thousands of them.<br/><br/>I went to this movie because I was in the mood for a warm, ""feel good"" movie. The promo's and a goodly part of the film deliver that ""feel good"" warmth, like The Artist, but this time, as an updated classic song-and-dance film of the 1930's to 1950's. You can also see the homages, like those to Astaire/Rodgers and Kelly, as well as a knowing glance to a key scene in ""Rebel Without a Cause"". Sounds just like what I wanted.<br/><br/>But about two-thirds of the way through, something begins to change (no spoilers here). The crack widens until the end, which at least one review has called bittersweet. For me, I felt rage. I got conned, without warning, into seeing the kind of movie I did not want to see. So you bet I'm angry. <br/><br/>In terms of the mechanics, the film does not quite follow the basic lines of an early song-and-dance musical. Invariably, there is a secondary subplot involving different characters who, depending on the film, build tension, contrast, or comic relief. None of that existed here, although there were some opportunities which never bore fruit. Perhaps some more false leads by the writer? I saw them as distracting dead ends.<br/><br/>There are also a number of plot holes which are annoying, a couple of which involve cell phones and unexchanged cell phone numbers that would have happened in real life. Any musical expects people to suspend disbelief, but the suspension of disbelief is generally in the musical parts, not the narrative.<br/><br/>Two of the best parts of the movie were the acting by the two leads-- excellent. They were also game at the singing and dancing, and clearly worked darn hard to do a great job. But to be honest, Gosling's singing (a presumed effort to mimic Astaire's approach) was not good, and Stone's dancing didn't hold a candle to a really trained, talented dancer (like the lead in the opening number). <br/><br/>You can make musicals which have twists, like the ending in West Side Story, but they don't pretend to be homages--they make it clear, up front, they are something different. So, for ruining my Sunday afternoon, I give this movie a 1."

","When i first saw the trailer, i didn't think i was gonna love it. I don't like musical film, but this film makes me look it in the positive ways.
First, the plot was awesome. It was the love story between Mia- a coffee shop servant pursuing to be an actress and Sebastian- a musician with the desire to save the Jazz an open his own bar. This love story was the combination between reality and romantic. And it encourages everyone to pursue and achieve their ambitions.
The performances and combination between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone was brilliant. They really suit the character. Quite sad that Ryan didn't win the Oscar like Emma did
The music was the best. It brings the film to the highest mood!
And i think it deserves the Academy award for best pictures more than Moonlight.
In my conclusion, it was one of the best romantic film of all time. It's worth your time watching it!"

","La la land is an amazing,groundbreaking movie.Damien Chazelle directed and wrote the shit out of this movie.This movie is filled with amazing characters filled with personality and clear goals.Seb's and Mia's romance is almost perfectly written.Their travel from hating each to having a relationship is just a blast to watch and when they break up it gets you emotionally.Emma Stone's and Ryan's perfomance ads a lot to their relationship.They last sequence of the movie is just magic,pure magic. It can make you cry,smile,and cry again at the same time.Also the music is incredible.
All of the songs are fantasticly written,they give away the plot in an unique way,they are full of personality and they reveal in an excellent way the true character of Seb and Mia.The Music from Justin Hurwitz is the key to all of this,in my opinion.He wrote amazing music for this movie.The Mia and Seb theme is amazing,and of the melodies of the songs are great also.
But everything comes down to the genius called Damien Chazelle.Now saying that he made a great job in this movie as a director would be a cliche,because everyone knows that he did an amazing job.There is a reason we won an award for this movie.He knows how to make a movie apealling to the eye.He uses colour in an unique and beatiful way,he moves the camera in an excellent way and in a result he makes a great looking movie.All of his movies have that:his unique voice as a director,but in La La Land he created a masterfully movie when it comes to the direction.I could talk about this movie for ages but that's all the main stuff I wanted to adress in this review.Go watch this movie if you haven't you have missed one the best movies of this decade."
"Java_Joe","9","3","3","18 August 2019"," Nostalgic, colorful and so much fun.
","La La Land is a callback to old timey muscial movies infused with fun and technicolor. From the opening scene where we find a group of people stuck on the freeway who suddenly break into song and dance to the closing notes it never forgets why it was made. And that's to entertain and remind us of the Golden Age of cinema when big bombastic musicals were the rage.<br/><br/>What really sets this one apart, other than the time it was made, is that the main actors namely Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, aren't necessarily trained singers and dancers. They're capable and they're able to pull it off but there's this note of amateurishness about them. Not a bad thing, in fact it makes this feel a lot more ""real"". We've all had those moments that, for whatever reason, we do a little jig or maybe we sing a bit along to the radio and honestly most people don't have any training in these things. So it's refreshing when somebody who isn't a pro does so.<br/><br/>Color also plays a big part in this. You can see it from the opening scene where everybody is dressed in bright, solid colors as they sing and dance along the freeway to when the girls go out to a party, each in their own brightly colored dress. It evokes the old films that were filmed in technicolor where everything was bright and colorful simply because they could show such a thing.<br/><br/>The story follows two individuals. One is a musician who is in love with jazz and dreams of opening his own jazz club. The other is a struggling actress who loves old cinema. Again, these are call backs to older movies and musicals. It follows them through their life as they chase their dreams and fall in love. It's all rather charming and it leads to a conclusion that a lot of people found offputting but I felt suited the tone rather well.<br/><br/>It's a shame this didn't win the oscar but it did win multiple awards so that's something."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","3","3","8 March 2019"," A must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life.
","In a world where people worship everything and value nothing, I have found that I value the many messages present within La La Land (2016). While simultaneously shining a harsh light on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and showing how our dreams and passions move us to make tough life decisions, I found myself deeply moved by the narrative presented within this film, not only as a lover of movies but as a creative artist myself. This film is for the dreamers. It's for the people who never give up in pursuing what they want out of life. It's for those who have a talent screaming to be noticed by others.<br/><br/>Aside from literally being the best musical I've seen in nearly more than a decade (Chicago (2002) is the only recent one that comes to mind), what I found most impressive about this film is that it is only the second directed by Damien Chazelle. For those who may have missed it, his previous work, Whiplash (2014), was an extreme look at the commitment a musician will take just to be a part of something bigger. With this in mind, we find that Chazelle has a passion for music that is easily grasped through his use of expert cinematography.<br/><br/>Much like The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967), La La Land makes me feel like the world would be a much better place if people sang and danced at the drop of a hat (or stop of a car). But even with the almost cliche ""romantic comedy"" beginning, where La La Land differs from these films is the depth that it explores the relationships between two dreamers. While we always want our life partners to succeed in their dreams, it can be difficult to find a balance between somewhat contrasting goals.<br/><br/>A must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life, I give La La Land 5.0 stars out of 5."

But the most important theme ,I think, is LOVE. When it isthe love for sounds, it is music. When for theatre, it is acting. When for a person, it is romance. And through the love, the 2 character grow up and purchase their dreams.
This movie inspired me into loving acting and standup comedy. When you love something , that could be your dream.

","I'm not a expert on musicals , The only classic movie musical I've seen is Singing in the rain , I can't say i liked it very much. It all seemed too simple , too clean, dare I say, Too romantic . It did satirize aspects of the film industry , but that's it.
Where this movie wins me over is with it's layer of modern story-telling. it's messy , It's complicated but at the same time it's pure film-making in my mind . There's no unnecessary baggage bringing the film down, which is what I loved about Damien Chazelle's other film Whiplash.It feels personal but not in a obsessive way. It's joyous , but not in a pretentious or oblivious way . I'm what you'd call a cynic, but this film brought a smile on my face, But at the same time, left me sad and melancholy (In a good way)
Another thing is I really like the music in the film. The songs and the score are just awesome to listen to if you're in a good mood and go perfectly with the film.
This film is not for everybody, not everyone will enjoy this film or have the same experiences with the film as I had , Specially if you didn't catch it in the theater . My hope is that people just give it a Shot."

I thought there would be more songs but the ones in the film are so catchy and upbeat.

As much as I was happy that Mia and Sebastian achieved their dreams in the end, the fact that it was technically an unhappy ending breaks my heart every time I watch it."
"mmaggiano","2","179","366","12 December 2016"," Fundamental problems with conflict and story logic. Music is hit or miss. Tons of motion blur.
","In Whiplash, Chazelle's first feature, excellent cinematography, editing, music and design combined with great acting and gripping scenes. However, it was marred by some serious disconnects with realism while purporting to be essentially realistic: some of the character psychologies and story logic were stretched too thin. Ultimately, one could enjoy the acting and the edit/shot rhythms, and forgive the flaws.<br/><br/>Those same flaws from his first picture absolutely devastate La La Land, and they aren't counterbalanced by much more than two very good set pieces (Gosling and Stone's number while he walks her to her car, and Stone's audition number).<br/><br/>There is not an interesting conflict in a scene for the first ninety minutes of this movie. Much of the early tension is based on two good-looking 'characters' who ""don't like each other"", and on them coincidentally running into each other a few times. ALL of the later conflict between the two main characters hinges on conveniently concocted scene logic that boils down to fighting and breaking up instead of simple solutions like a) sending a text or b) getting out of a work thing or c) saying ""I'll see you in a few months"". The logic flaws and wholly unearned story points are so bad that it's not really a story; it's more of a unpolished frame to hang a bunch of set pieces on. It intends to be a string of pearls.<br/><br/>But when half of those set pieces are mediocre, particularly the opening number, one is left with uncomfortable waits between the good parts: the story and characters are nothing, and half of the scenes neither deepen the story nor wholly delight. It makes you aware of your butt on the chair in the theater.<br/><br/>Maybe worst of all is this movie's attempt to do with motion blur what Easy Rider did with lens flares. The difference is that 'avoid lens flares' was just a rule about 'professional' cinematography that was broken by a few rebels in the right movie for that. Motion blur is a fairly upsetting thing to look at, let alone on a big screen for shots that last two or three seconds, repeated seven or eight times in the movie. One of them is quite effective: up to some palm trees, 180 degree twist, and back down to the leads as they walk around a fountain. And there are some simple whip pans that are too fast to be upsetting. But this leaves multiple medium-speed motion blur pans, and the movie loses more than it could gain, multiple times, by breaking this rule. (If you feel that there is no 'rule' that says not to do long motion-blur shots when they don't add anything, I'll grant you your point, and counter by saying that the movie looks hideous and nauseating during those shots)"
"lisamba","1","12","18","1 May 2017"," So Boring!
","I saw this movie on the airplane and it was so boring, it wasn't the dancing that was boring or the singing but the script. The movie just dragged on with no real story to follow. The dancing was o.k. the singing was o.k. but the story was not there, I finally ended up changing movies because after a hour or more it should have plot or some sort of goal. It was just a sorry guy with no motive and girl who been hurt and gets more hurt and after that I lost interest, too bad it seemed like a promising movie but the script was just a very sorry story and boring."
"imaxyou","4","12","18","1 February 2017"," Best not get carried away
","The excitement that comes from news of a new movie in the pipeline, in production or about to be released is palpable. It has you searching for as much info as possible. The cast line up can make you smile or say 'Oooh, interesting.' Then the blue ribbon festivals announce the premiere of said new movie and you can't wait for the reviews, the reactions, YouTube snippets of the stars being interviewed on the red carpet. All in all, you are a magnet to the hype and your own wishful thinking that the said movie is going to be great.<br/><br/>'La La Land' could not be classed as a great movie and just about sits on the fence for being a good movie. Was I disappointed given the leads were Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who had a blistering chemistry in 'Crazy, Stupid Love' and that the director was Damien Chazelle. There was an instant 'Snap, Crackle and Pop' to direct Damien Chazelle's feature debut WHIPLASH. Yet there is none of the 'snap, crackle and pop' to 'La La Land' just as there was no chemistry or joie de vivre in watching Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.<br/><br/>I am a fan of movies be they dramas, comedies, musicals, etc. There is no snobbery. A great story grabs me and anchors me firmly to the seat and my romanticism endears me to the cast of a movie with a great story. Am I watching the same ""la la land' as many out there and not getting it ? I think so. Part of me is dismayed that 'La La Land' and all associated with it are sailing on the 'sea of Hype' where the conditions are just perfect. One can also comment that the 'love' for 'La La Land' does have something to do with the current state of affairs here in the States and across the Ocean in Europe. That said 'La La Land' is a miss with much of the non-English speaking movie audiences. Where 'The Artist' was charismatic and a joy to watch, 'La La Land' misses the mark on so many levels. Just as we invest ourselves in the need for good news and feeling good by supporting our favourite sports teams, similarly it is the same need that has the 'La La land' hype alive; that need for being amazed, being excited, being wooed, being content.<br/><br/>I know there is no need for me to go into a synopsis of the story as the plot summary is there for all to read and plenty of people have had conversations about the film between themselves. There is no doubting the sumptuous cinematography, production design and art direction but that's about it when it comes to being worthy of so many nods and nominations. Chazelle fails to deliver in the writing and direction as the story drags and at many points whimpers.<br/><br/>As a romantic movie, 'La La land' fails to deliver the cinematic honesty, belief and likability in the characters of Sebastian and Mia especially when they connect. Maybe the movie needed input from the likes of writer Nicholas Sparks to give the romance and romantic leads much needed oomph. The capacity of dialogue when sung to carry you away and invest yourself in the characters is never met by the singing of Gosling and Stone. I don't think it has anything to do with the songs of the movie as they don't blow your socks off and neither do they have you humming or wanting to buy the CD when you leave the movie theatre.<br/><br/>The movie is certainly a throw back to musicals of old where the likes of Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds sizzled on the screen with their dancing, singing and songs. Lets not forget the wonderfully choreographed dance numbers of these classic musicals. Yes, a lot of these musicals hired ghost singers to sing for the stars and it could have certainly helped 'La La Land'. The lack-luster romance and musicality of 'La La Land' does make it slow and you almost wish you had a remote to fast forward. It is only the last five to ten minutes of the movie, before end credits, where the movie's bitter sweet ending grabs your interest. Overall, 'La La Land' lacks the originality, direction, performances and gravitas of it's musical predecessors"
"rickcote","10","88","172","17 September 2016"," Golden age of Hollywood cinema re-imagined for today
","Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) led off its 2016 weekend film festival with La La Land, a captivating film that hearkens back to the golden age of Hollywood cinema yet remains firmly embedded in present-day Los Angeles life. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring a startling depth and nuanced feelings to what could easily have been another trite variation on the theme of falling in and out of love. The film impressed me on so many levels, for the quality of the direction and cinematography, the seamless transition between musical song-and-dance numbers with a powerful narrative, the inventive choreography, the authenticity that Stone and Gosling brought to their portrayal of their characters, and the amplification of the intensity of their romance enacted through their singing and dancing. This film is not-to-be-missed by anyone who loves the classic Ginger Rodgers-Fred Astaire movies and who longs for a modern re- invention of this genre."

The fact that it would be a musical with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just made me super impatient to watch it. Oh I also love jazz so that just made it pretty much perfect. Expectations were sky high from this team and boy did they meet them...and then some. <br/><br/>The trailer was beautiful, from its colours to the soundtrack to the fact that it didn't give away any of the story and it really was just the trailer since the movie and it's music totally blows you away. The themes it explores , though not new, are relatable for anybody and the way the story is told really makes an impact. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were really impressive with their dancing and singing. I've always loved how natural their acting is as well and this movie was no different. Thoroughly enjoyed both their performances.<br/><br/>The lead characters may be struggling in certain fields but it is their dreams they are chasing at the end of the day...Something we all have done or are in the process of doing. This makes you quickly feel like you know these people and what they're going through. Throw in some comedy, love, drama and magical soundtracks as well as sequences and you have yourself a masterpiece. I really haven't seen anything like this in a very long time. Damien Chazelle has proved himself again and is definitely someone to lookout for for years to come!"

And I have got to say, why did I wait so long?<br/><br/>Beyond the absolutely gorgeous cinematography, the fantastic lead performances and the undeniably awesome musical numbers, what earns this movie a place among my very favorite is the message it delivers. It's a film that gets me excited about the future ; I am nineteen years old as of writing this, and I'm getting to a time in life where I have to choose what I'm gonna do with it. La La Land inspires me to go after my dreams, as corny as it may sound, and to create the life I really want for myself.<br/><br/>It really is a movie for the fools who dream, and a very good one at that."

","Nothing I have ever seen captures the wonder of love, music and hope quite like La La Land. At first glance, it seems like any other romcom with above average visuals, La La Land is more than just that. La La Land is a masterpiece that should be on everyone's radar.
The performances of Ryan Gosling and Emma Gosling are one for the books, and their chemistry together absorbs the audience, especially Stone, who won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for the role. Damien Chazelle masterfully directs a flawless combination of the Hollywood musical along with a beautiful romance. Winning the two well deserved commendations of Academy Award and Golden Globe, the film is visually spectacular. The music, composed by Justin Hurwitz, is my favorite score of all time, fitting the feeling of the scenes like a puzzle piece.

I love you when you talk about your dreams, and I do n't love you. I am busy, and I have my dream to work hard.
I love you, so let me go.
Sebastian let her go after her dream because he loved Mia. Because only he knew where her brightest eyes, the most gorgeous smile, and the most energetic look of the whole person came from.
Because I love you, I am not qualified to imprison you by my side. I can never tolerate you doing anything wronged for me.
""About us, just wait for the answer."" Sebastian said as he sat on the bench on the top of the mountain, Mia nodded in conscience.
Even the farewell is full of tacit understanding, and at a glance everything is understood. There is no bitterness and hatred, no complaint.
These are two independent personalities who hold the right to choose. In the bright future, there will be no more lovers like you who appreciate me, but I have a complete dream and myself.
After maturity, Mia became a big star, with a mansion, children, gentleman husband. Sebastian opened a jazz club, the venue was full, the name she gave was the same. Love is the most regrettable, the most indecent, the most shining, the most incomprehensible, the sweetest, and the most grievous, making life in your hands trivial.
Reluctant to say something later, miss is to miss.
We have a calmer and more mature life at the cost of losing each other. But if we did not choose to say goodbye, we will not arrive safely on this shore now.
Dreams seem to be the killer of love, but without dreams, she will not be attracted by the piano sound until the downfall of genius falls into her arms.

Webster's dictionary define ""La La Land"" as the following: ""an euphoric dreamlike mental state detached from the harsher realities of life"", that is, a blissful mental state that is general in dreams and free from cruel reality. In my opinion, this seemingly cute and unintentional word describes the story in the film very accurately and concisely, and also summarizes a message that the film wants to convey to the audience. In addition, La La Land is also an alias for LA Los Angeles where the story of the film is located. Los Angeles, the city of stars, countless young people come to Hollywood to find their dreams, and the dreams of countless people are shattered here. However, there are always people looking for dreams, and some people are young. The starlight in this city will never be dim, and it seems that it will always be so beautiful.<br/><br/>

In the end, Mia's fantasy surprised all the audience. This is the fantasy of all sweet love, and it is the most exciting meaning of this movie. I dare say that if there is no final fantasy, or the hero and heroine are together again, this movie will eventually become a second-rate love song and dance drama. Only if you can't get it, can you fully understand the bitterness and sweetness of youth. After all, the most beautiful love is just a flash in the pan. I love you, but I can only wish you happiness.

","A changeable and free creation who once loved jazz, but chose to compromise as a keyboard player in order to give his girlfriend a stable life. One was a waiter who used to envy others in a convenience store to resign and wrote his own role. The script, and later became famous. Sometimes the path of chasing dreams is not so ""romantic"". Dreams need material support and spiritual encouragement.
When the two sat together and played the city of stars, it was actually the beginning of their upcoming separation. This song is not only a summary of the period from acquaintance to love, but also the sense of fatality that will eventually leave. From the last sentence "" i dont know where i go, i think i wanna to stay "". The most touching thing about this song is that while he points out love, he also expresses the sense of parting fatalism. There is another more wonderful point, that is, the embarrassment of the embarrassing dream chasers. When I saw this three years ago, I simply thought that the song was nice and the love was beautiful, but there was no such experience at all.
Another hidden theme-the sympathy of dream chasers, but this is what contributed to their love. This friendship of Bole is obviously more profound than love. It is also what Chamion wants to discuss.
Chamion had studied jazz drums for ten years. In high school, he met a very strict teacher, which brought him a lot of inspiration and help in jazz music. It was equivalent to his Bole. At that time, Chamion himself His dream is to become a jazz player in the future. It can be seen that jazz is simply integrated into his bones, so many people may not know why there are so many jazz elements in the film, even very professional aspects. In fact, it comes from his own experience. . His movie audiovisual language is very good, and his movie language is very rhythmic, so it is very sensation to watch the song and dance films he directed. The rhythm of the film comes from the subconscious consciousness of a drummer.
The film uses a lot of long shot scheduling. The most admirable thing about him is that he can shoot the long shot rhythm. The stage scheduling of the stage drama really makes me want to applaud in situ.
At the end of the film, the director spent a few minutes fulfilling everyone 's dream. If they did n't miss it for the first time at the beginning, if later they encouraged each other and support each other, then it 's them who built the family together today, and it 's them who have the children, They are going to play together, it is a happy ending. However, reality always lacks ""romanticism"". Reality needs idealism but often does not become idealism.
Looking at the whole movie, my favorite clip is that the male host drove to the female host's house to tell her that there was a casting interview. The female host told him that she had had enough failures, and the male host firmly said ""you can"". This kind of trust and encouragement is another kind of rebirth switch given by God. It is not perfunctory, but tells you the facts-you can, you will take this role.
In addition to the content, the film's photography and color use are simply stunning, especially the color matching is really beautiful, and it is the ultimate enjoyment of the senses.
Finally, to those with dreams, you will have city's stars"

It just feels so wrong and out of place. I hate musicals down to a molecular level! A musical must have killed me in a previous life or something, I cannot explain it.<br/><br/>But this... This is something else. Its a masterpiece. After a year of putting of seeing the movie, I could no longer deny the IMDB score 8.0 from 428000 people and the fact that this was also the writer and director of Whiplash (which I loved!), so I gave it a chance one evening.<br/><br/>I was awestruck.<br/><br/>My greatest regret is that I did not get to see it in the cinema with a large screen and with a great audio.

"elsadjuralskare","10","5","6","6 December 2018"," It's perfect
","I am guessing there is already a lot of reviews here that talk about plot, setting, acting etc. So I am only going to tell you one thing; However cheesy this may sound, La La Land made me feel everything. Happiness and sadness, hope and hopelessness. Whenever I see the title I instantly want to watch it again. The only reason I do not is because I want to forget it first, so that I can experience it the first time again."
"eduardo_fernandes_17","10","5","6","14 May 2018"," When the words 'The End 'appeared on the screen, I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud!
","It may not have the depth, meaning or questions that some seek in the seventh art, but cinema is, above all, a spectacle and La La Land is absolutly that. A visual and sonorous spectacle that has not been seen for a long time and will hardly be seen again. This ""musical"" is not one of sing-a-longs (attests to this fact the existence of only 4/5 songs in a film of two hours), so to speak, but of music that is a constant throughout the film. There are in fact 3 cast songs, that are a little meaningless and sung in studio which, not being to my taste, ends ups being understandable as an appeal to the nostalgia of the old musicals that, truth be told, were the first blockbusters. These three more flourished numbers occur in the first 20 minutes of the film, and then what is, in my view, the best film of the 2010's actually begins. The interpretations are excellent, having the main actress more opportunity to shine in great height . The screenplay appears to be simple but develops in such a way that it looks like something of Woody Allen at his best. A story about two people who fall in love and come together to achieve their dreams, open a jazz club and be an actress. But, as I began to say, La La Land is a visual and sonorous spectacle so that the technical characteristics of the film gain even more relevance. The color of the film is extraordinary at every moment and the play of lights in each scene plays a decisive role in that which is transmitted, the background cinematography is a luxury that makes of this a film of obligatory visualization in a theater. As for the sound, no movie ever sounded so good. At any point in the film the viewer sits within the scene thanks to the sonic realism that transports anyone who is watching this play from the audience of a screen to the audience of a stage. Concerning music itself, it is a constant and never below excellent, playing an active role in the unfolding of events and not just a prop to the scene. In this film the song is one of the characters, and is so relevant that the only scene where it is not ""on stage"" gains an impressive dimension.<br/><br/>Besideds all these attributes that are well above average is an immaculate directing effort that transforms this cinematic experience into an extraordinary journey through the imaginary of what is a relationship, with love, goals, anger, commitment, happiness, and sacrifice.<br/><br/>To finish I leave just one more personal note, when the words 'The End 'appeared on the screen, I had to contain the urge to stand up and applaud such was the feeling of immersion that the film caused."

","As someone who loves classic musicals like Singin' in the Rain, West Side Story, Sound of Music, On the Town, and others, I had low expectations for this film. A film trying to replicate the joy and wonder that the old musicals brought to so many sounded absurd and would probably fail in its attempt. <br/><br/>I WAS WRONG!!
I loved this film! It was a wonderfully fun and has phenomenal score to back the energetic dancing. The production design can not be overstated with the over-saturation of colors to reflect the once brilliant L.A and when there is a conflict between the characters, the colors become more pastel and faded. The cinematography was amazing, with a very fluid camera during dance sequences, defying the stereotypical wide, stationary shot that would include all the dancing and singing. Acting was great and included real emotion from Ryan Gosling that did not involve him eating cereal. <br/><br/>TLDR: Takes all of the amazing aspects of the old musicals and Broadway and compliments them with surreal emotion and story-telling. Must see if you enjoy musical theatre or looking for a film to watch and have fun. 9.6/10"

","First of all, let me just say! This movie deserved every ounce of the Oscar award for best picture! It is a full-package in music, cinematography, story, and production. Hands down, best movie of the 21st century. I doubt any movie or musical can come close to this one in terms of its connection to our human emotions. <br/><br/>Even though Mia and Seb did not end up together, they are still happily successful in their lives, so I do think it is a happy ending in a way. Despite the melancholic epilogue scene, Seb and Mia are both happy living in harmony with career and family (She might not have the ""true love"" she had with Seb with her husband, but she seems very much in love with her husband). If they restore the relationship they once had, their lives would become disorderly once more. Somehow, everything fits at the end and that's how life is. It's all about the timing. <br/><br/>I will keep watching this movie from time to time to remind me how much having a dream is important and how the ""flame"" really can save your life."

Gosling and Stone melt into their characters with honest dialog and compliment by emotions revealed through expressions.

"elicopperman","10","5","6","13 February 2018"," Here's to the Fools Who Dream
","In 2016, writer/director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, scored big at film festivals and theaters during the holiday season with one of the biggest hits of 2016, La La Land. Regarded as a luscious tribute to musicals of the 40s and 50s, this film has become a critical darling and audiences have warmed up to it ever since it played theatrically in December 2016. Not only that, but it broke a new record at the Golden Globes by winning almost if not all the categories, from best motion picture in the comedy or music section, to best actor and best actress, to best director, to best screenplay, etc. While the movie is still a phenomenal piece of art, it's also the perfect movie to watch on valentine's day. How is it better to watch it on that said holiday as opposed to just any other day? Well, it's quite simple really.<br/><br/> The movie is a romantic-dramedy about two struggling artists, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). The former is someone trying to bring traditional jazz back to the modern day crowd whereas the latter is an aspiring actress who comes close to giving up from failed audition after failed audition. After several dates and discussions about the magic of motion pictures, music, and acting, Mia is convinced to make her own play and even do more auditions, where Sebastian gets a gig with a hip-hop/jazz group that soon become a hit. The perseverance from these two can really make one root for them as their dreams are quite common to several artists who just want to entertain and do what they love. Even with countless struggles and failures, it's best to not give up, for you will still rise like Maya Angelou even when you feel like there's no point. While their relationship does have its troubles, it's meant to be a more realistic yet intriguing approach to two artists learning about each other. Their passions are what really give the movie its heart and soul, both in style and in substance. The aspiring musician and aspiring actress may have different views of entertainment, but they're still artists who care about making a difference nonetheless. <br/><br/> Mia and Sebastian have a lot of chemistry together; while Mia is more into theater and acting than music or jazz, Sebastian shows her how jazz musicians speak thru their instruments whether it be from their practice or improvised performances. When Mia gives Sebastian a tour of Hollywood movie sets, that's where they begin to express their passions to each other and begin to warm up as a couple. Sebastian advises Mia to make her own play, but that doesn't mean he can be there with his fame and music gigs. The real emotional side of the film lies in the conflicts between their passions. Due to their passions being different, their moments of glory sadly intertwine their relationship and it even toggles their hopes for getting their own careers in the first place. <br/><br/>As my 12th grade creative writing teacher once said, ""As old fantasy Hollywood musical as it seems, it's also realistic in it's portrayal; it doesn't always work out"". That's why the emotions of the movie really pay off, it deals with something many people may go through. Just because one has a decent career going for them doesn't mean they can always be with their loved ones, and that's where the realism in the romance angle pays off. Love is not like a Disney picture as it's more complicated to sustain for some, but the heart from both characters are still there, and caring is what got them their dreams in the first place.<br/><br/> And then there's the film's tribute to classic jazz, theater drama and Broadway, and musicals of the 40s and 50s. The musical numbers were composed by the film's composer, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics written by musical theater composing team, Pasek and Paul, and they really understand the beauty and amazement of Broadway and motion picture musicals. The musical numbers from Another Day of Sun, to Someone in the Crowd, to the Oscar winning City of Stars bring out the movie its upbeat, whimsical, and timeless feel that will make this film worth being up there with classics like Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story that would really make people dance in their seats. The Fools Who Dream really creates an emotional and character driven arch for Mia as well. <br/><br/>The singing from Gosling and Stone is nothing fantastic at first, especially with the song A Lovely Night, but it warms up as the film goes on, and it fits as they build up to persevere in their dreams and to support one another. The Planetarium segment is pure visual delight and is ""pretty referential by trying hard to refer back to those old Hollywood films"" stated creative writing teacher. But the one musical number that really shines throughout the continuation of the film is Mia and Sebastian's Theme, as it progresses the optimistic tone of the film while giving Ryan Gosling a real showcase of his piano talents. Don't be surprised if you find a lot to enjoy in terms of the musical numbers, let alone dancing to them.<br/><br/> But I think the main reason this film is the perfect film to watch on valentine's day is not only because it's a love story, but it's a more optimistic and hopeful one. Since this film is about two rising entertainers who despite constant struggles and dilemmas still make it big one way or another, it ends up being quite relatable to anyone who started off struggling at the bottom before making it to the top. The determination and bravery Mia and Sebastian have really sells the movie, and the theme of never giving up and always finding support really pays off. Support is the best thing anybody can use when trying to make a name for themselves, and that's why it's best to not look down upon your closest friends when they help you make it somewhere, everything happens for a reason. And that's why the film feels like such a love letter, it says that you can still make a living out of whatever passion you have just as long as you don't forget about the ones that helped you get there. Complete with a special ending of realization and wonderment at the end that won't be spoiled, take it upon yourself to view this optimistic and bright feature with your soul mate anytime you choose."

It draws inspiration by classics like Singing in the rain and West Side Story but it can't compete with any of these masterpieces and it doesn't offer anything new in the genre.<br/><br/>In terms of acting Emma Stone is very good, showing seamless transitions between opposite emotions but nothing special from Ryan Gosling who adds to the sad tone that the movie will eventually reach.<br/><br/>The plot it starts as a satire of todays (and past and maybe future) Los Angeles, which is full of waitresses who want to be famous actresses and struggling musicians who have their own dreams to make it in a very competitive world.<br/><br/>Later it becomes a romantic story (not only for relationships but also for dreams and wishes) but in its final act the movie takes a serious dramatic turn where the two ""happy"" endings are combining to a depressing conclusion, that even the final two reassuring nods can't repair. Add to this an alternate timeline flashback that the director/writer wanted to incorporate to his vision, and you end up with an overall depressing movie that actually ruins the optimistic feeling and the romance that initially had.<br/><br/>Overall: Depressing. Mediocre forgettable music. A classic story that ends up in a melancholic, yet pragmatical, way.<br/><br/>."
"Fedgirl","2","118","237","30 December 2016"," All the hype had me fooled
","My summary basically says it all. I had so been looking forward to seeing this movie particularly as l love musicals - but am sad to say that I was hugely disappointed. It started brightly enough with the traffic jam dance scene - but from there on in it was all downhill for me. I felt the whole film was terribly disjointed and it felt like they were trying too hard to recreate the magical musicals of years gone by. The singing was poor - and the 'dancing' - if you could call it that - equally uninspiring. Some reviewers have even gushed about this being one of the 'greatest musicals' of all-time. What?? Have they never seen West Side Story, Grease, or any of the old Hollywood greats? Obviously no, otherwise they would never have made such a stupid statement. For me this was 2 hours of ZZzzzzz."
"stevepat99","2","109","218","1 January 2017"," If only I had not just watched Singin' in the Rain
","Thought this would be a dandy New Years film. Just days before, when Debbie Reynolds passed away I spent time watching the classic dance/song numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Yes, the film's opening number was a fine homage to musicals of the golden age. Then, I could not help but compare Ryan and Emma's lack luster amateur dance efforts to the amazing talents of such as Debbie, Donald and Gene Kelly. Blah versus excellence. Next, I had to endure Ryan trying to sing, total failure. Emma a notch better but again not ready for prime time. No one left the theater humming anything close to an unforgettable tune. Time for me to again start humming Singin' in the Rain.<br/><br/>The 'story' moved at snails pace for the most part. A major plot whole when a character makes a major, life altering decision which is totally ignored as if it never happened. Perhaps there is a missing scene on the cutting room floor since this then permitted an alternate ending which, of course, made no sense.<br/><br/>Finally, many others are right to note the lack of chemistry between Ryan and Emma.<br/><br/>To vote anything close to an 8.9 you need memorable songs, great chemistry, ever greater singing and dance talents plus a story that makes sense rather then contradicting itself. Sadly, I found all these qualities totally lacking."

Not just that but all the 'singers' in the film were far too weak, Gosling and Stone didn't have powerful enough voices to carry off the lead parts.

The whole movie hardly has any story so don't expect any amazing story or something, there is none. Just couple fall in love had one fight and separates.

OK so there are some talented performers in it but the story line is shallow and trite and the music is so dated - they deserved a much better script than this! It might be considered to be a tribute to Old Style Hollywood by some but Singing in the Rain it ain't! It's not even close to that standard.

"redzeno2","4","14","22","22 January 2017"," Had potential
","I cannot remember being so bored in a theater. My wife, who loves romances, told me later she considered leaving after the first 30 minutes. Which is sad, because there are many good elements in the film and the story line, though thin, could have given us more reason for caring about the characters. Two young struggling artists meet, fall in love, but choose fame over love. Okay. Except there was no struggle. Unlike the thousands of people who do struggle to live a life in art, these two must have had trust funds. Every sequence that could have given the characters more depth was swept away in a song. Which brings me to the other problem. Great musicals have great songs, but the film had none (though the jazz scenes were very entertaining). The film did attain a level of excellence in the final scene sequence - a wistful musical imagining of what could have been. If the film as a whole could have reached this level, it would have been an excellent musical. Unfortunately it took an hour and a half before the film created sufficient context for the music and dance to have this level of relevance. Perhaps the film's popularity can be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the genre. Music Man or Cabaret it was not."

The story line was weak and it had me hoping it would improve. It did not improve and I walked out with about 40 minutes of the film remaining. Considering the exceptional reviews and ratings this film has been getting I was sorely disappointed. Films like Singing in the Rain are musicals. This is not even a fraction of a musical. I am an avid film goer and consider that I have enough musical knowledge, coming from a musical background, to give such judgments. I notice one other reviewer stated this could be classed as a poor man's Woody Allen film and I totally agree.

"Lejink","5","15","24","11 March 2017"," Lost in Hollywood
","My wife and I were really looking forward to watching this Oscar-festooned movie. I personally love Golden Age Hollywood musicals and had read all the press about its revamping the genre for the present - day. Somehow though it just didn't connect with us.<br/><br/>I did like the cinematography with its Hopper-like depiction of low-rent Hollywood, from film-sets to restaurants and jazz-clubs. There were no sex-scenes, the camera work was fluid throughout and I appreciated the references to the past with the old-style titles and old-fashioned scene-changes too.<br/><br/>But after that, I struggled to relate to the characters. Ryan Gosling's character is determined to make his actress girl-friend like jazz and by extension the viewer but I know what I like and I didn't warm to the live club scenes with Gosling immersing himself in his music. Likewise Stone's travails with her acting ambitions as she flunks screen-tests and takes a waitress job as she seeks her big break. I didn't hate them, I just didn't care for them. <br/><br/>The songs were okay I guess but sitting here a day after watching it, none of them is still in my memory. The set-piece choreographed numbers are likewise easy on the eye but again aren't particularly memorable especially compared to those from yesteryear. Gosling and Stone are okay in their roles and work hard at their singing and dancing but I didn't sense much chemistry between them. I certainly didn't think I was watching Hollywood's best actress of the year. It probably helps to like and appreciate characters like this if you're in the entertainment industry otherwise they can come across, as here, as precious and vain.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too critical in invoking the great films it seems to draw upon for inspiration but the fact that it got decorated with six Oscars the other day for me says something about the quality of competition today compared to earlier times.<br/><br/>No, if I want to see a movie about a struggling jazz musician and his ambitious girlfriend, I'll go back and watch ""New York New York""."

It is full of clich√©s and a it has a fake aroma of nostalgia.<br/><br/>The beginning does have neither weight nor meaning. The director only wants to tell us here, in case we don't notice afterwards, that this movie is a musical. Good for him, because who could have guessed that with all the bad singing and the bad dancing!<br/><br/>The love story is completely predictable and fake for the first hour or so, until the first fight.<br/><br/>Somebody has said that this film is a super-white film about 2 ""baby-dreamers"", and I completely agree. Where is the Art? Where is the real struggle? There are today millions of people dying from hunger, wars, violence, and incurable diseases, and to sink because a play didn't turn out how you expected or you cannot be the jazz pianist number one is really childish. <br/><br/>Good things: the cinematography and the flashbacks are very good. The end is the best. That turn is actually original but does not make any sense any way. Let's not forget that the girl and the boy are where they are because she was depressed for her career failure. So, the turn does not actually make any sense. The jazz is good too (I mean, the REAL jazz musicians). And Ryan Gosling (who is OK in the film but not amazing) is actually playing the piano, which, in a Hollywood movie is already a lot. <br/><br/>Annoying things: the worst is, in my opinion, Emma Stone. I never understood her ""talent"". She is just a ""pretty"" face with a skinny (anorexic?) body who seems to think she is too good to prepare for her roles. Her singing & dancing are awful. Let's remember that in Irrational Man (I love Woody Allen!) she didn't even bother taking a piano lesson for her role of ""pianist"". Her hairdo is very annoying (she always seems to have just come out from the hairdresser) and I never understood why she cannot appear in even one frame without make up. How this mediocre actress won the Golden Globe for BP by an Actress in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of the amazing Meryl Streep or the amazing Annette Bening shows how Hollywood is losing it. And the fact that she won the SAG Award (Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role) in stead of Meryl Streep or Natalie Portman shows how this movie has blinded Hollywood. The most hilarious thing would be that she wins the Oscar (and, sadly, she probably will), being in the same category as Ruth Negga (who made an stunning performance in Loving), Meryl Streep (always amazing and always great), Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert (one of the best European actresses of today). But, hey, if Sandra Bullock got and Oscar in 2010, Stone could definitely get one too!<br/><br/>Gosling can play the piano but he definitely cannot sing: his voice does not have any power and it sounds like olive oil. His dancing is, as his partner's, mediocre. How come he ended wining the Golden Globe for BP by an Actor in a MP - Musical or Comedy in stead of Hugh Grant (who gave his best performance ever in FFJ) is a real mystery. Luckily, and for the sake of Art, he didn't get the SAG Award (who went to the amazing Denzel). The clich√©s of LLL are endless: girl meets boy and at first they hate each other but after they like each other. The detail with the famous actress who enters in the Caf√© is also predictable. And how rude (not cool) is to refuse an invitation! There are lots of holes in the movie. Boy and girl keep bumping into each other in a city as huge as LA, and many more, but I am not going to tell them because I don't want to reveal the plot and turns of the movie. <br/><br/>14 Oscar nominations? Give me a break! As somebody said, it's the endless story about Hollywood in love with itself. Pity, I will definitely not watch the Oscars this year. There were lots of really great movies this year and they did not get 14 Oscar nominations: Collateral Beauty, Loving, Hidden Figures, Lion, Moonlight, Elle, Florence Foster Jenkins, Smrt u Sarajevu, Fences... LLL should have got 1 Oscar nomination only (cinematography, Sandgren).<br/><br/>The whole movie, even if it features some great black jazz musicians, has a white-ish taste that is unbearable. I don't care AT ALL if the actors are white, black, yellow, orange or green. But this cheesy movie with 2 black actors definitely wouldn't have got 14 Oscars nominations. Why? Because from the 6,000 Academy members, 73% are men, 27% women; 89% are white, and only 11% are people of color. The age average is 60 years old (that can explain the love for this mediocre musical (I would not call it a musical, because in the musicals the actors actually know to sing and know to dance). The world is, sadly, still very racist. That's why many people are calling this film White White Land for a reason. <br/><br/>That LLL is stealing all the awards and probably will also steal many Oscars shows the decadency of cinema today in the US. Either that or people are really bored and need an empty and cheesy love story to be entertained. I think that Hollywood should learn from that reality that European cinema knows to depict, away from clich√©s and empty love stories, away from pretty actors with fake hairdos and plastic bodies. If LLL has achieved something is that: a new line of decadence, clich√©s, and cheesiness in American cinema."

","It was such a below average movie. One thing expected of a musical is great music, music that you come out humming, but it could not give me one. There are only occasional pieces of piano and Jazz which were nice.<br/><br/>The opening score was so long and horrible.<br/><br/>I really hated the motion-blur effect in the movie. The characters were the typical LA artists, struggling. There was nothing to the characters, no complexity with the characters, no complexity in the relationships between characters. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling was a really bad singer. It was too long for the content, I kept watching my phone to know the time. Almost slept during the movie."

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are as likable as can be, and the staging of the production numbers is amazing.<br/><br/>Ah, but there's bad news. There's just no chemistry between Gosling and Stone, and since their relationship drives the movie, this is a serious problem. Another problem is that neither of them are very good singers.<br/><br/>And then there's the musical numbers, which just feel amateurish. (""My mom can make the costumes, we'll use your dad's garage, and we'll write the musical numbers!"")<br/><br/>Last but not least, at 2:18, it goes on forever.<br/><br/>There's no good reason to see this movie at all.

","Saw La La Land a week ago and I needed time to process how little impressed with it I ended up being. It is a sparkly superwhite depiction of LA in an utterly apolitical, hipster way that scratches it's soles to the beat of eras when most things were just that - self-centered posh people having ""dreams."" It is, underneath the personal story of two people trying to ""be something"", an embodiment of ""make film great again"" as the dictator down south's mean-spirited and ignorant slogan about America itself is. It is a throwaway film, most certainly does NOT deserve any Oscars, and is actually quite forgettable, except for the City of Stars song. The dancing isn't just off, it's terrible, dare I say, utterly lame. Emma Stone's charm only got me so far through this puffed up piece of cupcake dust. The use of Griffith Observatory becomes goofier than even the worst parts of Titanic. Arrival, Moonlight, even Manchester by the Sea are far, far superior films. This of course means La La Land will win big time. I enjoyed Warcraft more. Seriously."

","Disappointing, definitely not worth the acclaim it's getting. I love Emma Stone and Gosling though, both great actors. However, they can't sing which make it sometimes a bit painful. Also, you start with a very ""American style"" movie with all the flowers, the group singing, the happiness, the dancing and jumping. So I guess you expect a movie that is going to at least end on a positive note. Well it doesn't and I don't think that separating the 2 lovers at the end brings anything special to the movie. Either you focus on the story line and you make it interesting, moving, fun and then you can create a bit of a drama at the end. However, everything was to be expected from beginning to the end, so please give the spectator at least a bit of relief and let's them be happy together with a kid!!! <br/><br/>It's a shame it could have been great !"

","I'm completely baffled on all the hype around this, the awards. And it beats me why people write those 10-star reviews.<br/><br/>I love these actors, music, musicals, old and new settings, classics, good jazz, romance -- practically everything that was used to mix up this film. Yet it fell short of being enjoyable by a mile. Or ten.<br/><br/>The musical part has just one song really. And while it returns 3-4 times can't carry a 2+ hours sitting. And there are good parts, not even few, but put together add up to maybe 15 minutes. Definitely less than 20.<br/><br/>2016 was a really bad year for cinema, but even there 15% good content can not put you on the short list.

And beyond a handful of minutes of piano and jazz parts even speakers are not to be missed.<br/><br/>So if you absolutely want to watch it, I recommend do it at home equipped with food, partner, other distractions and a fast-forward button.

","Did someone say last year's Oscars were too white ? So let's award most of this year's Oscars to something that looks like an explosion in a paint factory where every primary colour is splashed across the screen . LA LA LAND was being touted as the film to beat even before most of the other contenders were announced and its domination at the Golden Globes confirmed everything . Looks like the 2017 Oscars will be the most predictable event of this year <br/><br/>Romantic musicals aren't my thing so my dread was realised in the opening scene with a California highway turning in to a song and dance scene so camp I thought I was watching a forest of pink tents which hints at what you're going to get - feelgood factor whether you want it or not . It was at this point I seriously considered giving up on the movie and going on youtube to listen to proper love songs by the likes of The The and Joy Division <br/><br/>As the film continued the narrative did expose itself to being what you expect , two young people , a man and a woman , who are embarking on fulfilling their careers in respectively jazz music and acting . There's not a lot here we haven't seen before but what sells this movie is the visual work director Damien Chazelle has put in to it . The language of cinema is very much to the fore especially the stunning cinematography and my abiding memory is the scene where the two protagonists meet and an impact aesthetic is instantly created by the way the lighting changes . Many scenes are similarity beautiful but if there's a fundamental problem remains that no matter how well made a film is if you've no interest in the genre then you won't become a convert . As it stands LA LA LAND will dominate the Oscars like the French film THE ARTIST did five years ago then become quickly forgotten"

Sorry, the main actors are not singers.<br/><br/>The drama part may have been the best where we find that following your dream takes away from REAL people and real relationships so in that way it was sad, so sad.<br/><br/>Calling this a comedy is wrong. Only once in the theater did I hear others laughing and that was only for a brief moment. Maybe is was the kind of people in the audience. My wife and I were talking about where is PeeWee Herman and the two guys in front of us told us to shush during where Ryan was whistling on the pier. Really? Did we take away from the whistle sound track that much guys? Don't think I missed the two times the piano was not played correctly either. However one of the grand's was nicely tuned. That may have been the best part of the movie. You got to hear the difference between a real piano and an electronic one.

Let's just say that if Emma Stone wins an Oscar I will not longer respect the academy. I've seen better acting in TV commercials! It was so bad that I felt that I was watching an actor playing a character playing another character (and not in a well down way). Also, the way that the story was told it was really hard to connect with the characters and the somewhat romantic story of the movie.

I wonder if anyone here giving this movie a 8 or a 9 has watched Chicago or Moulin Rouge. Both had incredible Cinematography, plots AND had lead actors who could sing/dance the hell out of their movies. And now here come Ryan and Emma who are mediocre at best at this musical. I'm kind of disappointing at their casting as lead roles because I think that with different lead actors (two who can actually sing and dance) this movie would've been breathtaking. On another note, it was a charming film with beautiful cinematography and a pleasant vibe. I did not mind the blurs, as someone mentioned, or thought there were plot holes. I would recommend it to other but only to realise that Emma and Ryan should've not been cast."

Some of the musical sequences during the first half of the movie are truly wonderful. <br/><br/>But it feels like this movie is in two halves ‚Äì the second half of the movie is sad, depressing, unengaging and devoid of any of the lustre or magic of the first half. The story becomes clunky, the characters are not interesting anymore. It was turning into 'Blue Valentine-The Musical' - I started to question the motives of the filmmakers, what exactly are they trying to achieve here? Get people to see a modern movie musical and then turn it into a slow, protracted break up movie? <br/><br/>The icing on the cake was the end musical sequence, showing what 'could have been' if the two main characters had stayed together. I was thinking, 'what's the point of this' ‚Äì it doesn't matter that they didn't stay together. They both attain great success, they both followed their dreams ‚Äì why then show an extended sequence which comes across as 'if only they had stayed together look what would have happened'? It seemed pointless and really unmoving considering what I think the filmmakers were trying to do. <br/><br/>But in the end, it doesn't matter what the director was hoping to achieve. It's already a huge success. It's a star vehicle with A-list actors and it will win all the awards because it's an ""oscar winning movie"".

The movie is a musical, but half way through it decides to suddenly stop being a music and just turns into a boring drama with a dull plot. Although the movie started with decent momentum, it quickly just falls apart and gets really boring in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>Musicals often don't have very strong plots, but makeup for it with music. La La Land did not do this. Instead they just have a few songs and a boring plot. Also, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were terrible choices for this movie. They both are mediocre singers (especially Gosling) and terrible dancers (the dancing scene seemed so forced and unnatural). There are literally thousands of amazing theater actors and singers out there, but for some reason they chose two people who have zero experience in show theater. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Critics need to stop judging movies based on production value. This movie was mediocre at best and doesn't deserve any special recognition."

As much as I like both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, neither of them can sing or dance well enough to star in a musical. It's mind boggling to think of all of the talented men and women on Broadway who could have really nailed these roles. <br/><br/>The opening musical sequence is embarrassing. And way too long - kept looking down to avoid watching the screen. Also, much of the plot is a rehash of another crummy musical, New York, New York (1977) At least that one had Liza Minnelli to sort of save the day whenever she started singing. The ending, especially, is the same downer. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>So catch this on a rental if you're curious, but it was not enjoyable.

Firstly, as actors and people I enjoy Ryan and Emma's work, I think they are both incredibly talented and work well together. However, their styles and talents were not suitable for this movie, this was a musical-I would expect the actors to be better than sub-par singers. The dancing element, albeit abrupt and highly unnecessary in many cases, was well done, the routines were quite abstract and I enjoyed them. The story line was nothing more than predictable and in the end rather disappointing. I saw this movie with friends and the only reason why we didn't walk out was simply out of worry that one of us was enjoying it. (We weren't).

","Wow. I have rarely seen such disparity in viewers' opinion about a 'critically acclaimed' movie.

For the most part, it seems that people either love ""La La Land"" or dislike it, many intensely! Note, out of the first 50 reviews the film has been given a rating of 1 on 21 occasions. This is not a bad movie by any means. For the main part, it is a very well made production - editing, lighting and direction are very good. Emma Stone gives a great performance and Ryan Gosling, if not equal to her in this department, surely deserves huge accolades for his faultless mastery of a number of keyboard instruments.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is, that as a musical, it lacks zing in the dance routines and vocal renditions. Both Emma and Ryan sing in tune which at least is passable but they are not vocal performers. Emma's singing is so brittle - understanding lyrics was difficult at times. Neither lead actor, thankfully, was vocally challenged in any way at all.The dance routines are really pale imitations of the greats of Hollywood's past. Most obvious to me was the absence of any memorable tunes. ""City of Stars"" is the best of a very bland selection although I must admit that if any song could possibly have success as an energetic, well performed number it would have to be ""Start a Fire"". John Legend's rendition was the musical highlight of the entire film.<br/><br/>While I was not inclined, like some other reviewers, to walk out of the film, it was most disappointing, especially after have read rave reviews in the press. Surely, it could not win best film Oscar, For fans of the two lead actors, you will at least be rewarded. Emma is terrific whilst a more subdued Ryan Gosling will really impress you with his musical talent."

","Dear Damien, I really had great expectations for this film. I waited for a year to see this film. I was so excited that I walked ten minutes in the rain to go see this film. I am going to tell you what I felt about the film as I watched your film, so that you can learn something from my letter.<br/><br/>I was very happy to see the initial traffic jam and the first song. I was thrilled to see what happens next? As soon as the film started, I started to feel there was no story line to keep me interested. There were no plot points. Who wrote this script? I could not relate to Emma Stone's character because there was nothing to look forward to regarding her goal. She was just an aspiring actress who was lost in Los Angeles failing auditions. Whats interesting about that? The film was dis-jointed. It was a big mess. <br/><br/>The biggest mistake you made was to cast Ryan Gosling. This actor's face is bland. He is probably angry with someone on the set and it shows on his face. This guy has no expressions on his face. He has no idea how to act in certain scenes. He just keeps his face expression-less so that nobody can relate to him in the film. Deborah Aquila should have helped you find a better actor. Who selected Ryan's wardrobe? There was nothing interesting about his bland clothes to go with the musical. His emotions on his face do not match the flow of the story. Ryan, you are not a face for musical or romance or hero for a romantic comedy. You are a face of a villain or a boxing film. You should do those films. The way the director have these two characters meet is so weak. There was nothing romantic about how they meet. Emma Stone is a good actress but she kept (emotionally)staring in space in lot of scenes which were not removed in editing and it affected her performance. Acting with Ryan Gosling also affected her performance. There was one scene in the film where she goes and stands right in front of movie theater full of audience and nobody reacts or shouts as she stands in front of all of this audience while movie is playing. How unbelievable! <br/><br/>I wanted to like something something in this film. I tried very hard. I wanted to like a scene where they are about to hold hands in movie theater but even Damien ruined that romantic scene by doing something stupid. I wont forgive you for that. Then someone gave you a museum to shoot in. You should have made best use of those scenes but you did not. There was nothing exciting about it. There were sound problems with car horns. It was so loud that I had to put fingers in my ears. Out of the blue an African American guy (John Legend) gives Ryan a deal and music contract. There was no development for that plot point. Damien you need to really work hard on screen writing skills. I wonder who gave you money to make this film for such a weak screenplay. At one point the African American guy says to Ryan.. you are pain in the as. Ryan! honestly you are pain in the .... <br/><br/>I, so badly wanted to like this film and wanted some scene to touch me but when that moment came where Emma is called back for an audition. I thought she will tell her own story which was so powerful, she tells some aunt's story which made no sense to the story line. What a disaster! Emma says at the end...It hurts a little bit. You know what, I am hurt. I need Damien Chazelle and Ryan Gosling to send me apology letter for making such a bad film which I had to go and see . I was in tears when I left the theater. I am sure you will read this and you know where to write me. My IMDb email address. Best Regards, Z"

But when raising expectations this much, it is just impossible to give a better grade than 1!<br/><br/>The movie is one of the most boring I've seen in the past years. the first scene is sooo embarrassing I was so close to leave the theatre. I should have. The story line is flat. It can be summarized in two lines.<br/><br/>La la land is cheesy and unlyrical. If you want to produce a musical, teach your actors how to dance. I mean an average dancer could probably do better.<br/><br/>The cinematography is supposed to be wow, but to my eye they completely overuse the use of colours. For me a good mise en place in a good movie is the one that your eyes like without you realizing which elements make it this way until you stare for a moment. La La land was too obvious to me. The use of widescreen is hollow. The whole thing is gimmickry.<br/><br/>While adding an old Hollywood look to a modern day movie is original, it just isn't my thing. What's the purpose? to connect to the old musicals? he wishes...<br/><br/>Also a small detail, why the hell is Mia's dressing so ugly?????"
"davidcapelaa","1","11","17","12 February 2017"," A painful movie, in a bad way
","One of Hollywood's worst clich√©s. It is, in my opinion, a film without content made just to create box office receipts. The music is painful to hear, the performance of the actors leaves much to be desired and is full of errors not acceptable for a project of this magnitude, the film is based on inspirations from other films, which gives the sensation of already having seen it. A film that was more concerned with its propaganda that the content itself Even more revolting is knowing the attention and supposedly good criticisms that the film received, which I don't understand the foundation of them... A film that will surely be quickly forgotten, and that will not change the world of cinema or the world itself."

","My goodness, what a disappointment! Good actors, good director and rewards all over the place. Also I really enjoy the musical genre, so I thought nothing could go wrong.<br/><br/>But this film is so long, boring and self-indulgent. No songs or dancing scenes will make a fond memory and you won't be humming any song on your way out.<br/><br/>All the jazz bits are pretentious, I felt no passion of sharing like I had felt in Whiplash. Here you just have to accept that Jazz is this big and sacred 'thing' (frankly that the worst thing you can say about anything...) and get that idea hammered through your head throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>The story is bland, with lazy writing taking over and being the main star.<br/><br/>This movie just got me bored and happy to see the 'End' sign. First time I felt that way after a musical film, usually you come out of those with enough energy to get you through a couple of days."

","The story is inconclusive, narration is broken: we have start of the plot, just a piece of culmination and then final. What happened between? Am I myself must invent the motives of the two heroes? This gap in narration also makes the kaleidoscope of ""what if..."" senseless. Tapdance is muted by music - nonsense, this dance is supposed to be heard! Main hero walks in the same shoes for tap-dance till the end (what for? he will never tap again). This movie reminds me of Cafe society but simpler and with dancing. The music is good, but ""Whiplash"" had good music too and it was also stronger in many ways. Though I liked the scene in observatory and what the hero of Ryan Gosling told ""Mia"" about jazz. So, This movie is nice to watch only once. I will certainly re-watch ""Hello, Dolly"" or ""West side story""... but La la land? never again!"

As for the story, it can't be less original...Girl meets boy, they follow their dreams together, etc etc etc. <br/><br/>I give it a 7 being generous. I liked it as an entertaining little film, but it's not a classic by any stretch of the imagination. In a few months, when the hype has passed, nobody will talk about it.

"talldancer","1","84","173","17 November 2016"," This is a poor man's Woody Allen movie!
","I've read 8 great reviews on this film. I went and saw the movie last night, and I'm usually a very positive person, but was very disappointed. The highly ranked reviews must be from Sunshine Pumpers who are desperate for a comeback of a 1940's musical, or don't have a clue about a great musical:(""Chicago"", ""West Side Story"", ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Grease"", ""Singing in the Rain"", ""Cabaret"", ""Oklahoma"", ""King and I"" etc. etc. etc.) None of the songs were catchy or memorable. The good: Emma Stone did some very good acting. Also the sets were creative, and colorful. Miscast: Ryan Gosling, he can't sing. (think of a 25 year old stoic Kevin Costner) He would have been better type cast in a sports, western, buddy movie, mystery, gangster, or in a drama. Most likely cast as eye candy for the 18 to 24 year old gals. The opening scene is a hot, sweaty LA traffic jam on the freeway, where 50 or more people jump out of their cars, and start dancing and singing. It's a long non-stop shot that is VERY difficult to film. (think of Orson Welles: ""Touch of Evil"") but we have all been there, no fun, brought back bad memories of heavy traffic jams, and I just couldn't see the fun in a traffic jam. It's like I wouldn't want to see a song and dance scene of a ER room or of Anne Frank. No memorable classic lines: ('Show Me the Money"", ""You'll Shoot Your Eye Out Kid"", ""There's No Crying in Baseball"". Folks, this film will be forgotten in a year. Don't expect the next coming of ""The Sound of Music"". This is a poor man's Woody Allen movie!"

","This is simply the worst 'musical' I have ever seen. It was clear to my wife and I, about 30 minutes into this, that the actors, director and composer where too young to remember, or too young to understand the old musicals, and just how much talent went into those productions.<br/><br/>The music was dreary and unmemorable, the story was uneven and made little sense. I think Emma Stone is a delightful actress, but this was a huge overreach for her. Ryan Gosling was stiff and bland (as he is most of the time).<br/><br/>My advice to people who gave this a 10, please go watch:<br/><br/>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- WEST SIDE STORY -- THE WIZARD OF OZ -- THE SOUND OF MUSIC -- CABARET -- MARY POPPINS -- A STAR IS BORN -- MY FAIR LADY -- AN American IN Paris -- MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS -- ON THE TOWN -- THE BAND WAGON<br/><br/>Start with that line up - then come back and watch this rubbish, and see if its still 10 stars."

Not even 1 element in the movie that is new, that brings to life a new point of view, that hasn't been treated before, in a better manner, in so many movies. Nothing that makes you wonder or dream.

","Positively one of the worst movies, never mind musicals that I have ever watched in my entire life and I am now almost 64.<br/><br/>I am not only amazed at the mediocrity of the movie but also by the response from those movie goers who see fit to rate this production as 10 star.<br/><br/>One reviewer suggested that it was the best movie they had seen since Star Wars when they were a kid. What planet is this reviewer now living on? He/she could not possibly have seen the same movie that I endured just a few hours ago. <br/><br/>It lacked story-line, pace, memorable songs. It had one simplistic tune, melody or whatever which was constantly repetitive. The characters lacked depth and credibility. And the actors were poor in the art of song and dance. The backdrops and sfx were abominable and B- movie like in execution.<br/><br/>If this movie succeeds at the Oscars, it is further proof of how out of touch America is with the rest of the world in both politics and the arts. <br/><br/>The only saving grace is that neither can get much worse and that in the spirit of hope great things will arise from the ashes."
"carly_hope","2","24","43","24 January 2017"," Great pretender
","It is flashy and colorful and the acting is good - the dancing and singing not so much, some of the music is really well placed if forgettable. But it is a movie that pretends for 128 minutes to be something it is not. <br/><br/>It is not a musical. It tries to be. But it forgets 20 minutes in and then remembers in the end for one wonderful classical musical scene that would be brilliant if it was all that La La Land was. But the rest, is not really a musical. Mostly because while it doesn't lack music it lacks music numbers. And the ones it has feel mostly out of place and there only so a bland love story can be called something more interesting. It is a movie with music. Not particularly good music either. There are two numbers that stuck with me for longer then the length of the movie. The rest might work within the story but doesn't manage to stand on its own.<br/><br/>The movie also pretends to be original. Which it is not. There has been stories like that. And better ones. <br/><br/>The characters are not sympathetic either. He is snobbish and self-centered and even in his growth remains a jerk. She has no idea what she wants and while she pretends to grow she remains a child. If the actors were any less charming and worked less well together I would be rooting for them to get slapped for half the movie. It made caring if they stay together or not and watching their struggles and their happy moments much less involved. And uninvolved audience is not something you are striving for as a story teller. <br/><br/>And the ending of the movie, don't even let me start on that. I was somewhat looking forward to it despite the movie's flaws and then the movie slapped me in the face and spit on itself and me as well. I ended up feeling lied to and took for a fool. <br/><br/>I have seen two wonderful movies that same week and going out of La La Land it was everything a movie should not make you feel. Disappointed. Mislead. Empty. Just like the movie is."
"michael-901","2","24","43","16 January 2017"," What an awful movie
","What an awful movie. Are the rating a joke? The movie cinematography was so tight and out of balance that it was disturbing. Talking heads that themselves get cropped off from time to time. People bumping into the edge of the screen or looking off the screen. It was out of balance and dizzying as they panned between the characters.<br/><br/>Then the story is supposed to be about love but ends up being about narcissism. Achieving maximum career success is better than true love. In the real world love is about compromise and working towards mutual success. Of course this movie is about Los Angeles and Hollywood so maybe that is the way it works there looking at the divorce rate for celebrities. But this is not the reality that exist in the other 99% of the country so I do not get the appeal of this movie.<br/><br/>I did bump the rating to 2 because there is a good scene with John Legend singing in a night club."
"drrap","3","24","43","5 January 2017"," A sad echo of a great genre
","I see the universal adulation this film has had, and there's much to admire. To my ears, though, it's sadly lacking in the one key element every musical needs: great songs. With the possible exception of ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream),"" there's not a memorable tune or soaring line to be found. It doesn't help that neither of the two leads has a strong singing voice, and as for dancing -- the steps are limited, and even within that scope, not particularly well-executed. Dancing, in a musical, has to be over-the-top good to carry the energy of the film.<br/><br/>But the worst thing, really, is the lack of structure. Musicals are selective in the parts of the story that they take to build the three-act structure; the characters have to be established before we can care about them, have to face an obstacle so that we care more, and have to overcome it or die trying, at which point the big numbers come out. Here, we start with a big number -- the dance on the LA freeway -- but there's no reason for dancing as of yet. The love- not-at-first-sight motif is a good old one, but here it's so choppily presented that we're not sure whether we should care or not. It could be a slow-motion screwball comedy, or a musical revue punctuated by little life-dramas -- but to be a musical it must soar. This one is leaden, forced, and was painful for me to watch, despite much admirable production work and cinematography. <br/><br/>After I got home, I watched ""Singin' in the Rain"" as an antidote, and felt much better. It's not impossible to revive the moribund musical genre -- it was done in 1981 with Pennies from Heaven, and several times over by Baz Luhrmann, who even managed to make some of his non- professional singing stars sound pretty darn good (see Moulin Rouge). But despite all the hype, this film, to me, felt like seeing an old friend imperfectly resurrected from the grave, with none of the old lively exuberance for which -- once upon a time -- he was known the world over."
"filipeluke","1","23","41","9 March 2017"," Mediocre at best
","I don't usually bother to write reviews but I just couldn't stand by passively on this one... This film simply does in no way, shape or form deserve above 6, and that's why I'm giving it a 1 now (it is at 8.4 currently). In a word, LLL is mediocre. The dancing and singing are poor. The plot is clich√É¬©d yet contrived. The characters are charmless and lack chemistry. The music is OK, but not great at all. The acting is alright, but just that. I could go on... The only plusses are on the technical and production sides. I thought it missed a great opportunity to tell a more important, original and uplifting story about when you don't ""make it"", even if you're good. It decided not to do so in a really forced and lazy way. I don't even know if this is a musical, a Nicholas Sparks type film or a feel good comedy. It tries to be all and is mediocre to bad at all as well as in the overall end result. The movie says nothing worth saying, is a bit depressing and very boring (which is no small feat considering it's supposed to be a musical). Well, here's the thing Hollywood: to make a great musical you need a good or fun story with great actors who are great singers and dancers. You also need at least five great compositions and choreographies. Oh, I see... you don't, because people are increasingly sheeple and stupid. All you really need is a great marketing machine...

The dancing and singing of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is OK, but far from exceptional or ground-braking. I have no idea how anyone could spot magic or authenticity in this highly superficial, totally overrated movie. The only really authentic about this over-hyped piece is, that it is a true reflection of today's Hollywood: self-absorbed, totally superficial, full of hypocrisy and unable to even consider any other view than that of their own echo chamber. There are, obviously and luckily, some notable exceptions to this among the myriad Hollywood stars and starlets, but they are far and few between. It says a lot about the Golden Globes that they have been awarded in bulk to this movie. Maybe the competition was even worse? If this film gets Oscars as many predict, it will simply be fitting. After all, a Hollywood in their castles and mansions being totally detached from reality, from the life of ordinary people in this world, from ground realities, they will likely love what they see here. Even though it is just praising and celebrating its own echo chamber. This movie is Hollywood-narcissism at its worst. Oh, and btw: these are the same people who mock Trump for his narcissism?

And both have embarrassingly weak voices...yes, sometimes their weaknesses border on the touching, but give me Ethel Merman, or Bing Crosby or Ethel Waters or Hoagy Carmichael.

None of the ""stars"" are the expected style or quality. The story is grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I was left with the desire of someone who closes the keyboard cover in their hands, the voice of the stones allow you to pray for a good dose of pharyngitis.

","I'll be honest. Musicals are probably my least favourite genre. They simply do not interest me. After hearing the acclaim this film has gotten and the fact that it's directed by Damien Chazelle, I decided to give it a go. This is the best musical I've seen so far.<br/><br/>La La Land follows Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a pianist, who fall in love whilst trying to achieve their aspirations for the future.<br/><br/>Before seeing the movie, I wondered what all the hype surrounding La La Land was. After watching it I was extremely impressed by Chazelle's vision for the movie as well as the performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. This movie starts off with an amazing song and dance number that looks like it's done in one take and lasts for five minutes. This is just one of many astounding musical moments. Not that just but the way each scene flows into a musical number was handled immensely well. Usually when people burst into song and dance, I tend to roll my eyes but I loved every single song and dance in La La Land. The long takes, stunning camerawork and choreography made me realise how passionate Chazelle was towards filmmaking and music. It wasn't just the aesthetics but the actual songs were memorable. It's been a while since I watched the film and the songs are still playing in my head.<br/><br/>If that already wasn't enough, the performances are stellar. I believe this is a career best performance from Emma Stone. She was fabulous. Ryan Gosling is always a win and his chemistry with Stone is perfect. Their romance is believable and you root for them through the entire journey. There is an iconic dance sequence involving them both and seeing them dance for the first time was exciting.<br/><br/>Whilst the story isn't anything new and rather quite predictable, the message that it's trying to tell you has so much heart. Many people say this film is a love letter to LA and that is evident through the gorgeous cinematography of the city but I think it's a film for people who have dreams and want to achieve their goals to be successful in the future. Plus the film pokes fun at Hollywood through its representation of Hollywood parties and auditions.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle deserves all the praise for his creative vision on this film. He's slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today. With Whiplash and La La Land, I feel he will go very far. La La Land is filled with incredible musical numbers, beautiful cinematography and terrific performances by both leads that culminates in a finale that will bring out the tissues."

But one movie stands out for me: La La Land.<br/><br/>It's perfectly shot, the acting is underplayed in a time when most cinematic blockbusters overact like they are on stage with Jerry Springer. The music is exceptional and the colour is something out of a fairytale.<br/><br/>I understand why people don't like musicals. That's your call. Don't rate it then. I don't rate superhero movies because I know the good guys will defeat the bad guys in a predictable monstrosity to chase revenue. This movie doesn't have fight scenes or a shootout or car chase - it's about one basic premise we all face in life - do you follow your dream or your heart?<br/><br/>It's a combination of everything that's great about the movies and it shows restraint at the end when it could have easily chosen a different path for our couple.<br/><br/>It's funny in parts, excruciatingly sad in others.

I loved Whiplash (Damien Chazelle's previous work) but this one is something special. ""La La Land"" is about a couple and their love story, which I have to admit isn't something too particular or too original, even if I liked a lot the ending because it was something different but nothing that was never seen. The real merit of this movie is the way in which everything is portrayed, starting from the magnificent direction by Chazelle to the score by Hurwitz, including the great cinematography and all the cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were both exceptional (in particular in the last 20 seconds) considering they also had to dance and sing, in which they were pretty amazing. Generally I don't like musicals but ""La La Land"" is different because first of all I found more contextualised the dancing and singing scenes than a usual musical, secondly they are gorgeous. And all the movie in particular is highly poetic because of its bright colours that warms the heart, of the music which is fantastic and so thoughtless that brings you away from your dimension to make you live two hours in this pocket universe in which you feel light and without any mass. And you look around to the bright colours and you listen to the music played and you elevate yourself like the protagonists in a memorable scene. I know that it seems like a very good trip but I wasn't high, it was just the movie that provoked me all these feelings and emotions. For this reason I loved every single moment of it and it's one of my favourite movies ever. So if you haven't watched ""La La Land"" yet, be sure to check it out. It's unlikely that everyone loves it as much as I do, but the poetic aspect of it really touched some cords in my heart, maybe will do this even for you. And if not it is however visually stunning, sweet to hear and it has an enjoyable story, so it is worth watching anyway."

","A masterpiece in editing, cinematography, sound design, composition, and production design La La Land is a timeless showcase from director Damien Chazelle at his best, breaking new ground with its tragic story while simultaneously being a love letter to years past musicals led by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.<br/><br/>The technical qualities of La La Land are superlative. Damien Chazelle expertly crafts the choreography with the editing and sound design. The song and dance numbers throughout the film, especially during the opening at the road interchange, are flawlessly directed. Employing long continuous shots do not distract from the singing and dance sequences. In terms of cinematography, shooting the movie on film rather than digital, and using the widescreen CinemaScope aspect ratio gives La La Land a classical look. Low-light photography in select scenes reflects each character's emotional state. The cinematography is contrasted by brightly lit scenes which further reflects the ambitious and high-minded themes of the movie. Every technical quality fits and transitions so perfectly and fluidly that it heightens the audience's connection to the characters. La La Land is such a beautiful looking movie, deserving of every technical award it receives, best experienced personally.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are once again dynamite and electric as an on-screen couple from their previous roles in Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad. Built on the back of their performances, La La Land could never succeed as a romance film without the two protagonist's chemistry. Instead of looking like speaking rehearsed lines, Stone and Gosling convey a sense of genuine love and likability as their characters undergo development.<br/><br/>Stone plays Mia Dolan, a barista aspiring to be an actress. Gosling plays Sebastian Wilder, a pianist with a passion for jazz. Their life and ambitions are intertwined in Los Angeles. Mia continues to audition for roles, without success. Sebastian somehow achieves stardom and financial stability when his former classmate Keith, played by John Legend, offered him to be the pianist of his jazz fusion band. The part requires him to be on tour for months or years, away from Mia. His commitment leads to a fight against Mia when she protested his acceptance of the role, which is against his musical philosophy. Earlier suffering an embarrassing performance due to low attendance, leading to the inability to pay back the theater, and Sebastian's absence, Mia breaks up with him, moving back to Boulder City to continue her studies and abandon acting altogether. Receiving a call for an audition, Sebastian travels to Boulder City to inform Mia who returns to Los Angeles. After the audition, both confess their love, but uncertain of the future. In the boldest move of the movie, 5 years are skipped. Mia is a successful actress and married to another actor, while Sebastian now owns a jazz club. Going out for a dinner with her husband, Mia inadvertently stumbles to Sebastian's jazz club, aptly named Seb, her original idea during their love life. Noticing Mia among the audience, Sebastian plays their song and a dream sequence occurs of what might have been. Before exiting the club, Sebastian and Mia share a smile as the movie ends.<br/><br/>La La Land speaks to everyone's burning desire for glory. However, do we achieve our dreams by ending our relationships with loved ones? Do we sacrifice people with whom we have an emotional attachment to achieve our ambitions? On the surface, the movie ended with both protagonists parting ways but closer inspection reveals that despite ultimately leading diverging lives, Mia and Sebastian retain their love and that it was anchored not by physical attraction but by mutual respect and the desire to see each other succeed. The overarching theme of La La Land, then, is not about the common physical attraction, but ideals of dreams and ambitions. Driven by a character-heavy emphasis, the movie allows the themes to resonate emotionally by the time the credits roll. Damien Chazelle delivers a musical masterpiece with modern sensibilities.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie is perfect; the best movie of the decade. It is impossible to watch this film and not have an emotional response. The colors, the tone, the music all work together to result in a masterpiece of film. The commentary on expectations vs. reality on the dream Hollywood promises will come true. Mia wants to make it big acting; Sebastian wants to open his jazz club, and they both want each other. Hollywood promises that they can have all of that if they want. Can they? The timing, choreography, and charisma of the whole movie is beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about this film."

Simplistic almost, benefiting from a strong start, a fantastic ending and the sparking chemistry between the protagonists, on the other hand, lacking any sort of actual substance past the forced demand to fall head over heels with the kitty- cuteness that we are being presented, no questions asked. I don't like having my arm twisted into feeling, and this is where this otherwise whimsical tale of sensory affluence hit another miss for me.<br/><br/>To sum up. I acknowledge the individuality of the project, felt the strive and artistry that is so craftily weaved into the seams of this audiovisual extravaganza and I was, without a doubt, entertained. On the flip side, the way it all translated to my reason, the shortcomings of La La Land make this a middle-tier effort, only edging ahead on account of the fact that along with the glossy couple, I got to glide with effortless elegance through a Starry Night, brush shoulders with Monet, journey into the colourful and the capricious.<br/><br/>For that fact, I will accept defeat, bump it up another star and humbly take off my fedora to it."
"aliwonder-77367","1","21","37","19 January 2017"," Where did the Golden Age of Hollywood go?
","""La La Land"" is an American romantic musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle in 2016. After its' success at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, I couldn't give a go by the musical that set a record and won seven awards, including Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, and best Original Song. What can I say after finally watching this film? Well, best wishes to the New Hollywood Era. Your Golden Age has gone.<br/><br/>The idea of recreating and breathing a new life in outstanding musicals of Golden Age if Hollywood turned out a complete fiasco. ""La La Land"" is full of weird clich√©s, awful mise en sc√®ne, poorly rehearsed dancing actions, and doubtful twists in the plot. Furthermore, the production department failed to make outstanding shots as well as edit them in a right way with a good taste. I won't even start to complain about bad color correction and sound. Seriously? For the budget in thirty million dollars they couldn't produce clear recording that is supposed to be a number one factor in musical? Bad for them.<br/><br/>The first scene on the highway gave me full understanding that this musical is just a frustration. The dancers probably failed to join one of the Step Up movies and were redirected to ""La La Land"" as a joke. Choreography is terrible when the viewer can't see it as a whole action, or focus on main characters. Choreography in ""La La Land"" is more than terrible. I was laughing. Not in a good way. And again it is one of the main parts of such genre as musical. <br/><br/>The plot itself is boring and slow. There is no progression and no drive that brings the will to continue watching it. Half of actions and scenes were added and shown with no particular reasons to show them. Actually, there is no evident chemistry between the two protagonists. What is kind of shameful, especially because of the fact that it is not the first project, where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play together. Come on guys, show some love for each other. Some drama at least. Their relationship on stage was more comedic than tremulous.<br/><br/>Acting. One of the strangest things for me is to watch the Golden Globe's Best Actress in a movie where she can barely act. On the one hand, she was supposed to be a failed actress, who went her journey and reached her goals. But on the other hand, Emma Stone haven't done a good job in the general scenes also. Regarding Ryan Gosling, his passion for Jazz was overacted, as he has no passion at all. Besides, as a musician myself, It was a pain watching his performances. It was so obvious that he just can't play piano. I almost closed my eyes, so I can only lose myself in music. As well as in their dancing scenes. It looked too lame. <br/><br/>To sup up, ""La La Land"" is a pure frustration mixed with some dramatic comedy. I can't call it a musical with a capital ""M."" Actually, I can't call it a musical at all. No good music, no good sound, no good dancing."
"rdnyscott","1","39","75","21 February 2017"," Every other movie ever made deserved the Oscar more
","I went to see this movie only because of all the Oscar nominations, but when it turned out to be so cheesy that I would send it back if it was a pizza I'd ordered, I read the fan reviews, hoping somebody would explain what I had missed. None do, but I've learned something I had not wanted to know about IMDb reviews. Musicals like Annie and Grease understood that there needs to be a plot line between the songs, and some songs should be decent enough to not need a movie to sell them. Unfortunately, La La Land was only created to prove Mel Gibson's paranoia about Hollywood correct. The racist screenwriters wanted to ensure we all knew that they thought the teacher in the movie Dangerous Minds was too nice (they hammer on this twice in the movie). They then try to hide their racism behind portrayal of the main character having black friends and liking jazz, but only long enough to end the movie with a drawn out scene about this same character deciding he was wrong about those choices and regretting that he ever made any black friends. Somehow, Hollywood's elite thought this message was more important than reminding Americans about a forgotten war hero who singlehandedly saved nearly a hundred American lives on the battlefield in WWII, or the true story of an Indian boy's struggles to find his family."
"stuart-600","2","20","35","8 February 2017"," Over-hyped
","I must be missing something here. I went to see this expecting something fantastic given that it had 14 Oscar nominations - including Best Actor and Best Actress. I left feeling very disappointed and wondering what all the hype was about.<br/><br/>A song and dance movie, with stars that could neither sing nor dance. How does that work? The answer is very plain - it doesn't. The best dancing in the film was the one where the dancers were in silhouette. There was a nice flowing movement to it and the two dancers moved gracefully. This was meant to be the two leads dancing, but I suspect that this dance was performed by 'proper' dancers - it was so different is class from the dances where Gosling and Stone were visible.<br/><br/>With competent performers, it might not have been half as bad - but I still don't think it would warrant all the accolades it has been given. The story was a bit predictable, and the whole film about 20 minutes too long."
"Harhaluulo54","5","20","35","15 January 2017"," This movie changed my life
","Since La La Land won 7 Golden Globes, here is me comparing it to 7 well-received movies from past years. Also, giving my own awards:<br/><br/>1) It is like Boyhood (2014) in terms of average. If you don't know, Boyhood is the most average movie ever made. La La Land gets the ""Most Average Movie Since Boyhood"" -Award from me.<br/><br/>2) In terms of characters, it is lot like another romance from 2012 called Silver Linings Playbook. If the characters from that movie didn't have personalities, they could be main characters in La La Land. <br/><br/>3) In terms of songs, it is the opposite of Les Mis√©rables (2012). The OST is either popular meme songs, original content which lacks completely and utterly in lyric creativity or Jazz which varies from ""this is why I don't like jazz"" to ""I should listen to more jazz.""<br/><br/>4) The second award I will give to La La Land is ""I Will Forget Everything That Happened In It In A Week"" -Award. This movie is about as memorable and live-changing as James Cameron's Avatar from 2009. It lasted some hours and later on the time spent watching it is worth as much as random hour from 15 years ago when you were bored and kicked rocks while waiting school buss to arrive. It happened, but can you go into details about it? No, most likely not. Time spent averagely. <br/><br/>5) In terms of conclusion, the movie is like Whiplash (2014) -they both even have J.K. Simmons. The main difference being that Whiplash's ending was the pinnacle of the story where La La Land's ending was flat like earth -according to some. <br/><br/>6) In terms of atmosphere the movie is like Caf√© Society (2016) from Woody Allen. Except La La Land's changes from ""this is supposedly cheerful"" to ""supposedly emotional"" while Cafe Society was more like ""if you see any differences in atmosphere during these 1.5 hours, you most likely have serious case of paranoid schizophrenia."" <br/><br/>7) Now this is acting. How did Emma Stone beat Meryl Streep? Her performance in Florence Foster Jenkins (2016) was easily the most impressive sole performance seen in 2016. She carried that whole movie alone. Emma Stone only impressed me twice while trying to convey feelings by directly starting into the camera during jazz scenes. The second time wasn't even that good because it was just repetitive. <br/><br/>Also, I lied. This movie didn't really change anything."

What story was there to see? I watched the movie on disc and found the dancing in the traffic jam at the start, a load of rubbish and hurtful to watch. I battled on watching, but after almost half an hour, scanned through to the end. The flashing picture before my eyes, was no different when watching the movie! The same scenes over and over again.<br/><br/>If the movie had anything in its favor, I missed this completely. Oh well, I saved about 2 hours of pain.

"davidgee","6","14","23","20 January 2017"," Zings ain't what they used to be
","After rave reviews and the Golden Globes there's now an Oscar/Bafta buzz attached to LA :LA LAND. Sorry to rain on the big parade but I was not blown away. Yes, there's some charm here with all the homage to the Golden Age of romantic musicals, and Ryan Gosling remains the most charismatic of today's young stars, but the music simply isn't musical enough. Gosling and Emma Stone can just about carry a song and do a bit of amateur hoofing, but really the singing is nearly as ragged as it was in the screen version of LES MISERABLES and the dancing is about as far from Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly as the first round of 'Dancing With the Stars'.<br/><br/>OK, Kelly and Astaire (and Ginger Rogers and other co-stars of theirs) did not have great singing voices, but they were fantastic dancers and the song-and-dance numbers in their movies were never less than dazzling. The closest LA LA LAND comes to dazzling is in the final routine, a low-rent tribute to AN American IN Paris, but it just doesn't have enough dazzle. As musicals go, fings ain't what they used to be. <br/><br/>The jazz club scenes hit the only high spots. Gosling really looks as if he's creating magic on the piano, but there's no magic in his singing or his dancing ‚Äì nor in Stone's, who alas doesn't have her co-star's redeeming charisma. The love-story has a certain amount of charm but, like the music, it could do with a bit more 'zing'.<br/><br/>The Golden Age nostalgia also extends to a clunky tribute to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. But nostalgia just isn't enough and there's too much clunkiness on display here. They say there isn't the money to create great musicals like we had in MGM's heyday. Surely it would take only a fraction of the budget for a CGI-heavy action movie or space opera to hire some first-rate dancers and singers who can act - or, if we must, actors who can sing (or mime to a better singer)? SINGIN' IN THE RAIN cannot have been a big-budget production, but it's still the greatest of the greats."

","I do not like musicals, but there was so much talk about this film, that I saw it and I must say that I repent deeply. It's one of the worst movies I've seen lately. The stereotype of the musician who lives almost defeated and scratching the poverty is a sin in which the director had not fallen in the masterpiece Whiplash. Besides, it shows the woman as a completely unstable and shameless human being, who without showing us a background of his relationship with Greg, falls into the infidelity easier a fly in a dump. And to finish off, she lives so unhappily, that years after being married, she can do nothing more than imagine what her life would be like with her old adventure. Pathetic. It shows some more forms of human misery than the possibility of seeing something pleasant, something endearing, that makes you see it again. <br/><br/>Some mentions about jazz that do not transcend at all. Actually, I will forget this movie."

Why not just watch an ACTUAL 50 year old movie? Most of them are better than this anyway. I haven't felt so strongly about such an absurdly crap waste of time since that dribble ""slumdog millionaire"" won every award going.

Unfortunately, my expectations were disappointed. Just because everyone says that the movie is great, it doesn't mean it is.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is not very interesting. Mia (Emma Stone) works in a coffee shop but wants to become an actress. She falls in love with jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) whom she meets roughly 10 times ""by chance"". Sebastian tries to save jazz and convinces Mia that jazz is the best music in the world. At the end, Mia gives up her dream while Sebastian creates a successful jazz club. Since there is so little action, much of the time there's boring conversation and a lot of clich√©s. At the end a different, shortened version of the movie is presented where the protagonists are always successful. It was so hard to watch it to the end.<br/><br/>Second, the singing and dancing was mediocre. Emma stone performed better than Ryan Gosling, but that isn't hard. None of them are professional singers or dancers.<br/><br/>Third, there's the music. Google says there are 28 songs, but some of the themes are used in very many different songs. Maybe I would have been overwhelmed by the music if it wasn't that repetitive. But 'City of Stars' or 'Mia and Sebastian's theme' were played so often that I was really annoyed when I had to hear it the fifth time.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't recommend this movie. If you are a jazz lover, there are some music scenes that might interest you, but you can also watch them on Youtube."

Apart from all of the gloss, there's nothing left but a plain storyline with half developed characters that seems to be working aimlessly through a clich√© plot. The on screen chemistry is what struck me as missing at first but then you realise this is largely due to a flat dynamic between characters. How do they truly feel? What do they truly love about one another? Why couldn't they work it out? It's not in there. & We can't guess, because we don't KNOW them. By the end they're as much strangers as they are to us in the beginning. Much like a roller coaster that accelerates to the top only to slowly descend and safely pop us back to 0.<br/><br/>It's overrated, boring and sad because there was great potential for a cutting edge take on an old comforting theme.

It was trying to had to hearken back to the days of Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers and failed miserably. The singing wasn't that great either. I like both of the star actors, but this just wasn't the right vehicle for them. Their singing was just OK. The songs were nothing memorable that I would want the sound track for. The only really good song was the one sung by John Legend. The City of Stars was a nice little ditty, but that about it. The whole movie from beginning to end was just underwhelming.

The plot is juvenile, clich√© Hollywood struggles, about making it 'big'. Grow up! The plot reinforces racial stereotypes about the white guy being the purist and the black guys work for him. What the! The main characters can't sing or dance (I had to stop myself from laughing- what an insult to the greatness of past musical performers) Needs extensive editing. So many unnecessary long pensive moments. Filler shots. The special effects were so lame. (Eg you could see Emma Stones harness bulking up her waistline). Couldn't make out the lyrics in the jumbled mess of the opening number. Contrived pause to allow the audience to applaud. Unrealistic coy behaviour of the two leads as they fall in love- what the!

Emma Stone is without a doubt the most annoying actress I have ever encountered. She is so horrible that I will make sure she is not an actress in any film I watch again. I wouldn't even see her films on a bet. I would go if paid to do so, but only with earplugs and an eye-mask.<br/><br/>The plot is a typical boy-meets-girl-over-and-over-again til they become a 'thing'. Which is fine, if it's pulled off well. This wasn't, for the reasons I named above.<br/><br/>I can't believe this movie got good reviews at all. I had to walk out after 30-40 minutes. I waited until my very tiny (thankfully!) bag of popcorn and beer were finished (which I downed as quickly as possible so I could get the heck out of there), and then I got out of there like a bat out of h-e-double-toothpicks.<br/><br/>You might want to watch it if you don't consider Emma Stone the worst and most annoying actress ever, and/or watch Ryan Gosling desperately try to keep up with her poor acting (he had some trouble, but he managed to be a bad actor as well).<br/><br/>Anyway, good riddance to bad rubbish. I'm glad I got outta there and that I didn't go with a person who wanted to stay.<br/><br/>Find a film that isn't annoying, and go for it. Well, that's my recommendation anyway."

","Musicals have always been of my favorite movies. I owned the Albums (yes vinyl's) of ""West Side Story,"" ""The Sound of Music"" ""Music Man"" and more. ""Les Mis√É¬©rables"" is my favorite movie of all time. So when the critics went CRAZY for this movie calling it the Academy Award Movie of the year and nominated for the ""Golden Globe Award"" I was excited. I did notice that only two theaters chose to show it the week I saw it, meaning the theaters weren't very impressed with its appeal. The theater owners were right. This is the most disappointing movie I've seen this year. ------------------------------------------- Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) & Mia (Emma Stone0 ""are"" the story and they are ""ok."" As always I liked J.K. Simmons in his (very) small role and I liked John Legend in his small role. That's it! I didn't care for the music, the story or how it was told. An hour and a half into the movie I thought that even a great ending wasn't going to save this movie. I didn't need to worry. The ending was the worst part of the movie. The critics are going on-and-on about the 31-year old writer and director of this movie. It looked like it was written and directed by an adolescent to me."

","I really wanted to like this movie... It had so much potential but it's a lack of everything it wanted to be... First, I like both actors, I really do..But I don't think they did justice to dancing or singing.It simply didn't look real or serious enough.Either they're not talented enough or they should've work harder and longer for it...I'm not a professional dancer but you can see from the sky that the way they move their feet isn't real dancers alike! Idea of bringing old Hollywood style, step dancing and singing is brilliant but there is no much story..Scenario is somehow cheap.John Legend I love your music..But casting him was more desperate than necessary..The buzz over this movie is just so over-hyped, they're even mentioning Oscar nominations which it obviously doesn't deserve..You simply can't put this next to Titanic,The Lord of the rings or I don't know... Brave Heart or Gladiator category...It takes a better story.It needs to be more original,more breathtaking..It needs to to give you goosebumps and be something to remember! There isn't much to tell about this movie,cause even tho it wanted , this movie simply doesn't give enough! I'm sorry but it's six from me!"

","It seems not too many know the French director Jacques Demy's films, especially his musicals like 'The young girls of Rochefort' or 'The umbrellas of Cherbourg' or 'Donkey Skin' - nor Michel Legrand, who scored these as well as many other films. Those were made in the late 60ies and 70ies. They are available on Netflix - highly recommended!<br/><br/>Obviously the director of LaLaLand watched them over and over again but he failed totally in recreating them and transporting them into our times. <br/><br/>I find the music of LaLaLand with the exception of its main song rather forgettable, the same with most of the choreography. The lead actors are OK, but I don't see any depth. The story line is rather thin, very cookie cutter and weighed down by too much sentimentality."

The director could have done something about this. there are scenes in between, why you start feeling the protagonist is acting in the movie. Its a good movie no doubt, but i was comparing this to all time classic musical hit ""The Sound of Music"". Director should have retaken some scenes to have a smooth flow between the events.<br/><br/>for ex, the way Mia ditches her ex makes no sense. She just runs away to see a movie with a new guy ? crazy. Sebastian is having dinner with Mia...the dialogues look so forced on to the audience :( <br/><br/>compare the other romantic movies...the notebook or 50 first dates. The ""feel"" that you get after watching the movie...it stays on for few hours. I liked the idea of the ending, but again, looks very disconnected. 5 years not in touch ? what came in between them for those 5 years ? ego or plain interest lost between them ? don't try to pull a Nolan here."

","What an over-rated film. The opening sequence on the L.A. freeway was nearly unbearable with its artificial, Politically Correct nonsensical 'this is L.A.' vibe. I'd say the only fun thing to watch in this film was Ryan Gosling. He really does justice to well-fitting clothes, he must have a perfect body. Emma Stone was fish-like to me, her bulbous eyes like a flounder in the beautiful briny deep. The director deserves credit for trying to make romance happen in the digital age, but in general, it's too late: everyone in privileged America is pretty much a soul-less zombie drone driving a Prius and numbly staring into the glow of their iPhone. In a fantasy world where people dance and sing, only Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen and Jacques Demy could do that possibility justice. Don't believe the hype, this movie is flat, dull, wishful thinking for a bygone era. It will sweep awards, no doubt, because, in a soul-less 21st Century, this film is the closest anything released by a mainstream film industry will have resembling 'heart.' A flounder Dead On Arrival, wrapped in pretty yellow paper, in my humble opinion. Two stars for Ryan's well-fitting pants and tight shirts."

","I was excited to see this movie, but as soon as it started I could tell it wasn't going to be great. The costumes/clothing in the movie were utterly hideous. I have no idea who dressed these people, but whoever that person happens to be I want to ask them what the hell they were thinking?? Could they dress her in any more unflattering clothes?? It looked like an anthropology nightmare. Ryan and Emma also had absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. Yes, the dancing was OK., but I would hardly call what they did singing, it was more like talking. Lastly, the ending was pretty awful.. 2 hours of my life wasted. The only people I would recommend this movie to would be ppl who like jazz or people that like musicals. Across the universe was slaughtered by reviewers and critics, but it my opinion it was ten times better than this supposed musical."

This is neither a musical nor a feature film seriously lacking a credible plot or great acting. Ryan and Emma are just stone-faced monuments but moving! My time at the theater did not last for more than 30 minutes and I just followed the exodus en mass! And I am warning you guys - do not get conned by the critics and those who give 10/10 here. It should go down history as a worst movie made ever! All this hype is ONLY because it IS made about Hollywood. I am so shocked and aghast that this crap made 11 nominations for GGlobe and won 7 but not a single for 'light between the oceans' - one of the best movies in 2016! <br/><br/>This craziness is all created and driven by the corrupt Hollywood prop machinery to boost themselves and their favourites!

","I so looked forward to this film and was greatly disappointed. I find it hard to believe that it is being spoken of as an Oscar contender. Ryan Gosling was fairly good in his movements but rather weak in singing. Emma Stone is awful; I do not comprehend her popularity at all; she never seems genuine to me; I feel I can tell she's acting and cannot get into her character. Some of the dancing scenes were downright silly and the songs unrealistic, thereby giving a feeling of falsehood. The main premise was believable but depicted poorly. The cinematography was fine as were the period artifacts displayed, lending authenticity to the era. However, overall it was simply a letdown and I cannot recommend it to anyone at all."

","Most boring movie ever... As is normal with movies today, the worst, most sleep- inducing movies seem to get the best reviews from professional critics.<br/><br/>I have to say that the requirements of ten lines for a movie review is ridiculous. If you don't like a movie, why does one need to write so much? Liking a movie makes it easy to write a long review, hating a movie doesn't take long at all.<br/><br/>Knowing Hollywood, this movie will probably be nominated for a million awards, even though it doesn't deserve anything. What it deserves is to be forgotten completely."

The musicals scores are the best part of it. Other than that the movie is unique. It's not the kind of movie you've already seen. Don't hear what the people have to say about it.

"mhorg2018","1","51","104","26 February 2017"," Overrated
","Much like Arrival, which the critics went gaga over and was a drama disguised as a science fiction film, the critics went gaga over this as well. Perhaps if they'd had some musically inclined people in it, rather than the cast they did, it might have kept my attention. But it didn't. I find Ryan Gosling bland, and really while I like Emma, she needs to stretch her acting muscles. The big eyed earnest waif act is wearing a bit thin. Her character in this could have been her character from Easy A, there's that little of a difference. Some critics have compared this to Singin in the Rain, but there is no comparison. That's a classic and this is just another over-hyped Hollywood movie. I'm sure some people love it. But I'm pretty sure just as many didn't."

","My wife and I found this movie dull. We even dozed off a little. It appeared to me to be strictly a vanity vehicle for the two stars: their undeniable good looks and their mediocre dancing. <br/><br/>The plot was superficial with a pedestrian ending. Before the ending, the story line dragged on without much excitement, or even interesting twists. It stretched an oft-told story of romance into a boring feature-length film.<br/><br/>This movie's award performance says more to me about the Hollywood awards themselves than about the movie.

","I am usually mistrustful of over-hyped movies but, on this occasion, I was in the mood for a feel good musical with an upbeat message - not something I am usually drawn to. The Sunday Times reviewer said that ""Hating La La Land is like hating a puppy"" and gave it 4 stars. Well I like puppies very much but this movie was a massive disappointment. Bad singing; bad dancing; and a mediocre script, made this movie, in my opinion one of the worst movies of the last 12 months. How this can be considered as Oscar material is beyond me but then clearly I am in a minority - although judging by many of the reviews on here - not that small a minority. The second half, in my opinion, was better than the first half. And, yes I did get most of the symbolism and the attempts at pastiche and various homages to the past. This definitely won't be on my 'best of' list."
"gshakespear","7","46","94","8 January 2017"," Blah blah BLAND
","La La Land is summed up in it's title, and is a direct reflection of celebrity obsessed America. It will rate highly with those who don't have a real job, are highly over-paid or the anti-deplorables (elitist gentrified sanctimonious city folk). It is bland, directionless scripted dribble with good actors playing bad parts, and acting badly.<br/><br/>Hollywood has lost its way, repeats of old ideas, a plethora of movies without real plots, without good scripts, having any real meaning or with mediocre TV learned method acting talent. Not all films have to be great films, everyone likes escapism at times, and we don't expect a Citizen Kane, a Godfather, or Blade runner all the time, however, what is criminal, is if we treat this film above its real status, which, unfortunately, appears to be the case based on its IMDb rating."
"hammad0095","10","8","12","7 May 2017"," Best Movie Ever!!!
","When I first saw the trailer for La La Land my expectations were set high. The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. La La Land is a triumph on so many levels. It hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end. <br/><br/>The film gets you with its charm. It flows from the dialogue like poetry. The chemistry between Stone and Gosling makes the film livelier. Stone has slowly shown herself as a force to be reckon with in Hollywood and now Gosling has join the ranks after his stellar performance as the jazz pianist who's main dream is watch jazz live on. Stone is a wanna be actress who can't find her way. Together, they thrive off each other's love and support as they try to accomplish their goals together. Each have a chance at their first Oscar gold.<br/><br/>What else helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs. I found myself humming ""City of Stars"" all night long, already saving the soundtrack on every music platform I could. The music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of Gene Kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like Chicago. The production design helps with this with bright, vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to Emma Stone's dress. A charming film only works when all cylinders click. This one was clockwork.<br/><br/>Like Whiplash, the editing is superb, timing well with the score, making it very appealing to the eye. But the cinematography was mind blowing. Able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts made it very astonishing. Not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped. Each scene was extremely well thought out to cause the biggest ""awe"" effect, or to provide strong symbolism. <br/><br/>But the ending is what can really make or break a movie. This one makes it 10x better. It goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your dreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't your own la la land. Everything does not end perfectly.<br/><br/>When combining all these elements together, you get one of, if not the best film of the year. In a year where things became bitter, this really ends the year on a high note. Cheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic."
"catherinewoodward-16527","6","8","12","15 February 2017"," Over Rated or Over Hyped?
","La La Land sent the cinematic world into a frenzy, and I can't quite say I understand the hype. A musical in 2017 is bound to send people into a frenzy of excitement, anticipation and nostalgia. However, I think it was a bit over done. The beautiful dance scene after the party was a scene well though out enough to get all of our 1950s musical senses tingling, however didn't the iPhone ring just ruin it? I can see what the filmmakers are trying to do here, but isn't it a bit overbearing and too ironic? Irony is best served subtly. Although, the songs were captivating and both actors delivered beautiful performances and I won't forget about it any time soon. Worth seeing, even if it is to just be a bit confused by the concept."

"pansypansies","3","8","12","30 January 2017"," A film of a promising concept and exciting potential that was poorly executed
","What's bringing this film praise and attention is how this type of movie has not been created in recent years. But beyond this fact lies the qualities of a great movie that were just not present.<br/><br/>Sacrificed plot line, superficial, weak casting, obvious techniques, convoluted range of styles and random classic film references.<br/><br/>Casting: Come on! Emma Stone is no Debbie Reynolds. Neither Stone nor Gosling are dancers. Which means they would've had to learn how to for the role. Albeit it was not a disaster but it was certainly not memorable, which it be should for a 14 Oscar nominated musical. Musical. Remember JK Simmons from Whiplash (2014)? Was his role in La La Land a cameo? Not quite, but it was an absolute waste.<br/><br/>Protagonists: I thought (seeing from the trailer) Sebastian was going to be the energetic, doesn't-care-about-the-rules-just-cares-about the-passion kind of guy who encourages Mia, which he is at the beginning of the film. However this attitude fades and the reason wasn't made clear enough (miscommunication between Mia and Seb). Halfway through the film, we never see his passion anymore. Inconsistency? Growth? But from what?<br/><br/>Everyone else: Either the director was deeply trying to focus on just Mia and Sebastian or all the other characters in the film were swept aside equivalents to NPC's from The Sim's. <br/><br/>Dancing: Was not abundant nor top notch. Revolved around head turns and fancy running.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: The best component of the movie; I love nothing more than Mia and Sebastian's 'Epilogue' theme. Every other official theme of the film was also absolute brilliance; simple, dreamy, elegant, sincere, potentially iconic. Was also a beautiful motif. <br/><br/>Plot line: Between predictable and difficult to recall. Predictable due to it's romantic genre, difficult to recall because it was overshadowed by the film's aesthetic focus. Sebastian's scene where he sang ""City of Stars"" - a 4-5 minute scene of just him singing on the pier - had no meaning and said nothing about anyone or anything (great song though). About half way - 2/3 into the film, all excitement was lost and I was bored. Boredom peaked at Mia's audition where she spoke about her aunt. All in all, not memorable nor something someone would compliment the film on (excluding it's twist ending).<br/><br/>Twist Ending: The ""what could have been"" sequence was truly emotionally significant, honest and genuinely bittersweet.<br/><br/>Moral: I was impressed by how intensely the film focused on the reality of stardom in theater and the arts - even down to the nuances of rejection - when Mia's audition is rudely interrupted by a casting director wanting a sandwich - it truly touches the core of how quietly brutal it is to receive nothing after giving it your all, in complete vulnerability. Which is why I was disappointed when the writers abandoned this message nearing the end by slapping on a ""Five Years Later"" time skip, giving Mia the life of a successful movie star, Sebastian his Jazz Club, to dwindle the moral of the film to something like ""love doesn't go the way you imagined it would."" Because romance is everything. <br/><br/>Film Techniques: Effectively supported the popping visuals of the film. However at times, purposely or not, it didn't deliver what was comfortable for audiences. A full body shot that dragged on, never cutting closer to the actor's face; a close up of the actor's face for too uncomfortably long. The use of crescendos cutting to black were over used (became annoying). See when Whiplash (2014) used this for it's sudden ending? That was perfect and it was the only time it happened. The main tune motif was almost over used. See when Sebastian plays that tune at the end when he spots Mia in the crowd for the first time after 5 years? That was a perfect use of it. Can't say the same in all the other insignificant parts when it came up. <br/><br/>Motifs: Library, honking horn, main tune - awesome, clever. <br/><br/>Visual Effects: The cloud scene was awkward to watch, worst part of the film. Scenes where reality turned abstract became too obvious, sudden lighting changes (which were okay but then it happened too often), characters sweeping across settings etc. <br/><br/>Design: Spectacular retro feeling, yet is clearly set in the present day therefore the 20th century car models and primary colour dresses were too clearly contrived (unless we just happen to be viewing the lives of a minority population stuck/obsessed with the 60's) <br/><br/>John Legend's appearance: ???<br/><br/>Verdict: Overrated. This film had a lot of potential. It was an exciting concept. Films like this don't exist anymore. But in truth it was flawed and overall weak. However kudos to the hard work put into orchestrating and capturing mass choreographed dances in single shots. Truly visually stunning, great film techniques, successfully immerses audiences into it's dream-like world. Intensely honest look at the reality of love and artistic career paths. Original soundtrack - deserves the praise; <br/><br/>In every other area, it could have been more."

The story here ‚Äì trying to make it big in LA ‚Äì has been done a million times and this attempt failed to show us anything new. I respect Ryan Gosling as an actor; I think he has great range and has shown this in many vastly differing roles (Drive, The Big Short, Crazy Stupid Love, The Place Beyond the Pines, Gangster Squad, Lars and the Real Girl, Fracture), but he is not a song and dance man. Emma Stone is a competent actor; I've never seen her do anything badly, but nothing that would promote her to my A list, and she should leave song and dance alone as well. Even the fantasy scenes were nothing new or special. I thought the ending was something new and very well done, but that's about it. The story, boring and ordinary, was presented at a snail's pace (I overheard someone near me, in a packed theater by the way, say, ""Oh, come on, get on with it."")<br/><br/>If you want to see a real musical, dig through your old DVDs for ""Cabaret"" and ""Sweet Charity"", both musicals that owe nothing to anything that came before and stand as living tributes to the genius of Bob Fosse.<br/><br/>I'm not listening to the Hollywood hype and marking this at a 3 (barely worth watching on DVD)."
"RolanD7000","3","23","43","2 January 2017"," Unoriginal
","La la land i was curious to watch this one as i am a big fan of musicals. Well i was disappointed all this movie did was make me nostalgic of old classics like Singing in the rain. This film did not have anything new to add to a long line of amazing movies of this genre. I felt like all the clich√©s from the cinema history were recycled in order to create a plot-line for La la land. Although the acting on both protagonists was really amazing there was not much they could have done to begin with because the story lacked so much depth. I liked the concept that this was a story about finding the courage to achieve your dreams but the script was just poorly written. The director tried to combine digital effects with the musical atmosphere of the old Hollywood, but all this did was make the film even less unimpressive. Instead of focusing on effects he should have put as much effort to create realistic characters. Honestly the only thing i enjoyed about this film was the dancing scenes and although i liked them it still felt unoriginal and lacking. It felt like they just copied one of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers's movies. Also one of the things that really bothered me was the cinematography. I was really amazed they filmed the opening sequence with such hard natural light. If they had filmed the same thing a few hours before when the sunlight was softer the results would have been a hundred percent better. As for the constant hard lightning at the piano playing scenes it didn't allow me to see the actors facial expressions and that annoyed me especially at the emotionally charged moments. I felt that the director of photography had not an ounce of artistic touch here. The cinematography of this film is completely forgettable. To sum things up in my opinion all this movie did was copy old classics poorly. It was not executed well and it lacked the most important element of all film magic.

","I'm a big fan of musicals - on film and in the theater - so I had high hopes for La La Land. Combine its genre with the fact that it seemed like a love note to the great city of Los Angeles, always a rich backdrop for a film, and I was eager to see this movie. <br/><br/>I was sorely disappointed. <br/><br/>First, the casting of Gosling and Stone is all wrong. Neither can sing, or at least certainly not well enough to make the many musical numbers enjoyable. The dancing in the film is basic and didn't hold my attention, including in the much-lauded opening number. <br/><br/>So, if neither Gosling nor Stone fit the bill based on their musical abilities, maybe their on-screen chemistry would explain their roles in this picture? Not even close. I couldn't believe for a second that these characters really loved one another. There was no credible romance between them; I'd go so far as to call their relationship awkward. <br/><br/>Stone, for her part, delivers her lines very well and has much more range as an actor than Gosling, who, no matter how many movies I see him in, always seems to be playing a caricature of himself. But her talent isn't enough to save the film. <br/><br/>Then, there is the plot. There is very little of it. The movie, clocking in at just over 2 hours, feels like 3. So little attention was paid to story, and so much paid to fetishizing mid-Century Hollywood filmmaking, that I couldn't help by feel the film dragging and stumbling from one poorly written set piece to another, without succeeding at captivating my interest at any point. <br/><br/>For example: Gosling's character is set up as a down-and-out struggling musician without an ounce of opportunity or luck on his side. What, then, explains his seemingly effortless rise in the film as he scores a gig playing with musicians he used to swoon for as a spectator, or the way he suddenly hops into national stardom by partnering with John Legend's highly successful band? There is nothing that really explains his character's quick transition from bitter failure to jazz superstar. <br/><br/>There is a charming final song-and-dance number in La La Land, but it comes too late to save the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, La La Land is a half-baked pastiche of a movie with forgettable music, lackluster dancing, thin story, and insincere character development. <br/><br/>SKIP IT!"

","When do I finally realize that I'm not enjoying a particular movie? This realization usually comes when a scene in the film reminds me of some other movie and I find myself longing to watch that film instead of the one I am desperately trying to enjoy. <br/><br/>In the case of La La Land, this didn't take too long.<br/><br/>During the duo dance scenes between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I found myself longing to watch Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell. <br/><br/>During the jazz music scenes, I found myself longing to put on some music from Miles Davis or Dave Brubeck. <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle's souffl√©-light screenplay made me long for some sort of story with substance. Let's face it; even your longest allowable tweet would carry as much storytelling weight as this script. <br/><br/>When considering Chazelle's direction, I found myself longing for a musical directed by Vincent Minnelli. <br/><br/>And while all this longing was going on, I was longing for a shorter film. La La Land is not a long production when compared with West Side Story or The Music Man (and let's not make any further comparisons with those great films) but, it sure as heck seemed like a long, long movie.<br/><br/>Dictionary.com defines the phrase ""la la land"" as ""a state of being out of touch with reality."" I won't disagree with that definition. About halfway into this flick, I was beginning to drift off into Dictionary.com's interpretation.<br/><br/>Luckily, I had some severe arthritis pain in my right big toe that kept me alert long enough to long for some relief; algesic or cinematic, and to keep me awake long enough so that I could make a valid critique of this picture. <br/><br/>Finally, I long for the day when someone will make a musical that's even half as watchable as the last good Hollywood musical ‚Äî Hairspray (which really wasn't all that long ago, was it?)"

She can't act if her life depends on it, has no charisma, no presence, and in this movie she has the same mannerisms she had in that stupid teen movie ""Easy A"". No effort at all.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling deserves the nomination, but definitely does not deserve the award. Though his performance is convincing and pleasant, it's not amazing enough to be awarded with an Oscar. <br/><br/>That being said (spoiler alert), the plot is basically this: girl meets guy. They fall in love. Girl wants to be a famous actress. Guy wants to have a jazz bar. They both make bad professional choices in life, which eventually make them fall apart. Years later, girl is already a famous actress, married, and meets the guy in the jazz bar he founded (boring Casablanca reference, anyone?). She obviously does not stay with him and the ending implies that they never saw each other again. The end. <br/><br/>Basically, this is the plot in a nutshell.

","While La La Land is certainly entertaining, it isn't up to the level of expectations that critics and awards have been creating. The first half hour suggests that this is going somewhere fun--among others, the scene of Gosling playing the 80s piano man at a pool party is hilarious--but then it turns out to be an emotionally flat movie. Gosling and Stone are great actors and superb at their jobs but... the script turns out to have no ""tension"" and you find yourself not caring for whatever happens to them. Regardless of how much you may enjoy the dancing scenes (which are clever to be ""correct"" and cool), Emma Stone can't sing and I felt embarrassed at times; Gosling didn't bother me as much but the songs are really not interesting or catchy, I can't remember any of them so as a ""musical"" I'd say FAIL (of course, I hadn't watched the trailer a zillion times). The only scene were I could feel some emotional involvement with the story was at the very end with the ""parallel story"" thing...

","La La Land makes me upset because I feel like there is a great movie in this film. <br/><br/>It starts off great with a big sweeping musical number that's a lot of fun. As it progresses, the movie slowly falls apart. The pace breaks down. More songs become arbitrary (The first song is arbitrary too but I'll let it go because it's just the opening number). And there are many threads that don't go anywhere and lack any meaningful moments. (The couple getting married, they showed up three or four times, we don't care about them, they have no character, they are simply there to make Sebastian, who we also don't care about sad)<br/><br/>The John Legend scenes, although they progress the story, are awkwardly paced and weird. 'Oh, Sebastian uses an electric keyboard now, whoa! Amazing.' It came across as awkwardly placed as the song scene in Birdemic.<br/><br/>What I'm about to say is not criticism but thoughts on the characters: Mia is a terrible character. Sebastian is also despicable at points. The character I related to most is the writer character at the party and he is trivial at best in the film.<br/><br/>Therefore, the criticism is that there are no characters that one can get involved with and relate to in this mess of a film.<br/><br/>Other than the lacking characters, clumsy plots, lack of good music (besides 2-3 songs), awkward conversations that lead to nothing meaningful, the movie is well done. Damien Chazelle is a good director and has an eye for film.<br/><br/>Essentially, people 'worship everything and value nothing' and that is no truer than this film. People worship the superficial of this movie. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The beautiful shots. The colors. The sad music they play fifty million times.<br/><br/>And the fact it's different. Critics love things that are different because they watch 100s of movies. Thus, La La Land is different and they freak out. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.<br/><br/>The movie is way too long. It could have cut out multiple scenes and wouldn't be missing anything ---> That is the definition of terrible pacing<br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie. I wanted to feel everything at this movie. I was told it was 'the best movie ever' and 'will make you sob at the end'.<br/><br/>All I have to say is all these 10 star reviewers are in La La Land. <br/><br/>I walked out of the theater and said, 'really?' Overall, this film is a solid 6-7."

","La La Land, is a strange movie. There, I've said it.<br/><br/>It seems to leave the viewer with a somewhat split attitude, and will leave you pondering long after you've seen it.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've seen a movie which has inspired me to write any sort of feedback, but La La Land has done just that... <br/><br/>Depending on which review you read on IMDb, you'll either find a 10/10 which tells you that it is a musical masterpiece, hankering back to the old cinematic masterpieces of Kelly, Astaire and co, or you'll read a 1/10 which criticises each and every little detail of the movie.<br/><br/>Let's be honest, neither review is of help.<br/><br/>La La Land is a good movie. It has some great tunes, and for large parts leaves you inspired. There's no denying you'll come out of it feeling a bit of an urge to jump on top of the nearest car and dance.<br/><br/>However... it is not the masterpiece that is so widely reported.<br/><br/>There are times when both Gosling and Stone characters are infuriating, mildly pretentious and really rather whinny. Neither actor is perfectly cast, but simultaneously it is impossible not to be impressed by the fact that they've obviously trained hard at singing, dancing and (for Gosling) the piano.<br/><br/>It's a strange film. It really is.<br/><br/>I want to love it. I want to come out singing the praises and looking back at it with the fondness of old school movies, or even the more recent Artist. However, I can't. Something feels wrong about it. The cinematography is a bit off, the tunes don't always catch you, the story-line isn't always clear. It almost feels like the film tries too hard to be good. It knows there is potential, but it tries to force this ability, and subsequently lets itself down.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Jazz, and there are scenes I look back on fondly. I want to watch it a second time, to give myself a greater understanding of it, but simultaneously I've not come out of the cinema and thought ""I need to see that again."" This is a bad sign.<br/><br/>You'll read a lot of praise for this film, you'll read a lot of criticism. You'll also read reviews a lot more detailed and knowledgeable than this one. I guess what I'm saying is that the film is not as good, or as bad as anyone says.<br/><br/>It's a film you should see. You'll need to make your mind up. Does it deserve the Oscars? Personally I don't think so. Will it win them? Probably.<br/><br/>Give it a go, but go in with an open mind. The critics can't help you with this one."

","La La Land (2016) Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, and that's the problem. A textbook example of the folly of letting a writer direct his own script. I've rarely seen such a pretentious, muddled, incoherent mess. The basic problem is that Chazelle doesn't know whether he's written a romantic drama or a musical romance. An independent director would have cut and rewritten the script to be firmly one or the other. Either way, it would have been a good movie. As it is, two fine actors are wasted, as are some fine musicians and dancers. Worst of all, the movie was boring. Only plus: some well done jazz."

Right from the opening scene you are confronted with actors who wouldn't make it past the first casting round of a Broadway show. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong....I like Emma Stone but she doesn't fit the role of ""young, aspiring actress"" anymore which makes her something of a miscast. The story is plain boring and the dialogue is bland. Who wants to see Gosling agonizing about the nature of Jazz music in long scenes drawn out like old chewing gum followed by semi-neurotic ""love interest scenes"" which seem to pass for convincing romance these days? I guess two people who qualify for couples' therapy sessions after just having met is the new normal. <br/><br/>The cinematography is great and the director really knows how to ""paint"" moving pictures but it's all form and no substance making it the musical equivalent of a Michael Bay action movie.

"pmhebert","3","12","20","29 January 2017"," ""Dancing with the Stars""
","""La La Land"" is NOT a top-notch musical in the company of great musicals like ""West Side Story,"" ""An American in Paris,"" ""Gigi,"" ""The Sound of Music,"" (I could go on and on). It's a wanna-be musical that seems to owe its appeal by being seen as an homage to these earlier musicals -- without being a worthy musical on its own merit. Apparently, given its high rating, it's also being rated by people who haven't seen these great musicals (to realize how bad ""La La Land"" is).<br/><br/>On the positive side, Emma and Ryan are very nice ""eye candy"" and do some nice acting which helps to redeem this movie from being a complete waste. But this is a MUSICAL where leads need to sing and/or dance. And perhaps our culture has gotten so used to watching non-singers sing and non-dancers dance in TV shows such as ""Dancing with the Stars,"" that it's completely appropriate to have the two leading characters be people who can neither sing nor dance. But let's not pretend -- Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling cannot sing or dance. <br/><br/>Musically, there really isn't a ton of music. Although it started off looking like a musical with a big production number, there's very little music in the middle of the movie. A few of the songs are appealing, but none are show-stoppers or particularly memorable (no one would hum a tune from ""La La Land"" when leaving the theater). And although musicals tend to have songs that reflect the story-line, ""La La Land"" has mostly done away with that convention. (Oh, that must be why it's gotten awards!) Instead, we have a few songs used as themes that are repeated in the movie. <br/><br/>What about the story? It's really a fairly standard romantic trope, but without the standard ending. (Oh, that's got to be worthy of an award!) <br/><br/>The movie is also rather long -- someone should have edited it (a lot). The cinematography seemed fake (too much color?), and I hated the camera work -- hand-held dizzy-work in some scenes and too too many close-ups of Emma.<br/><br/>Most people feel compelled to see ""La La Land"" given the number of awards and nominations, but it's not really worth the time. Go rent ""Grease"" or ""Cabaret"" instead."
"neyenna","6","12","20","27 January 2017"," For some reason over-hyped
","Right with the studio logos this movie takes us back to the golden age of cinema - and then it immediately turns into a ridiculous, lovely, dancing-upon-cars, lively song.<br/><br/>In general, I liked this movie. Sadly, it is way too over-hyped. It has a lot of fun songs, the cinematography is beautiful and I certainly understand what the movie wanted to do - but I didn't connect with it.<br/><br/>Another movie looking back fondly at ""the old movies"" was ""Hail, Caesar!"" and many people disliked it but somehow they love ""La La Land"", even though it tried to do the exact same thing (apart from the love story, of course).<br/><br/>What was the worst about this movie for me was that the main character - Seb, played by Ryan Gosling - was basically just a singing and dancing Noah (from ""The Notebook""). I thought Noah was an insufferable prick and Seb is no better. Basically, he is the quintessential mopey, entitled, ""romantic"" artist, who is just so poor because everyone ignores his ""art"". Oh, woe is me. And Mia is just a musical version of Allie, just as annoying and entitled as well.<br/><br/>This movie is very pretty to look at and it is a good example of how to make a nice, nostalgic piece with great tunes that will undoubtedly bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>The characters are just too unbelievable, though. Are we really supposed to accept that Seb is simply a misunderstood artist and Mia, despite never having put any work into playwriting despite once watching ""Casablanca"" in her early youth, suddenly is some dramaturgical prodigy? All while the two of them have the most basic, pretentious, ""oh-look-at-me-I'm-so-edgy""-type conversations, that if heard in real life would earn nothing more than an exasperated eye-roll.<br/><br/>The fact that most of their relationship went unshown was explained to me as ""mental shortcuts by the writers"" but truthfully, if all I get to see from a relationship is a quick montage, a fight and a weird galaxy-dancing scene I can't really regard it as anything but silly.<br/><br/>Not to mention that ""La La Land"" followed two plot tropes that I just can't stand in movies (especially romantic ones), them being: a) cheating on your man (you're a woman in love, it's fine), b) overhearing a conversation and then assuming things.<br/><br/>Regarding a), so Mia's had this run-of-the-mill uptown boy and of course he deserves to be left at a dinner because he's just not Noah. Why couldn't Mia just have been single? Would it have really made such a difference? It perhaps would've shortened the picture by 10 minutes and saved me from my projected guilt.<br/><br/>Regarding b), there we have Noah, listening to a conversation that Mia has with her mother about steady jobs and artistry and he immediately assumes that ""yes, that means she wants me to take that (for some reason OBVIOUSLY bad job) that I don't want and I'm not gonna talk to her about it, only months later will I flip my sh*t over it when she mentions it"". Good logic, there, Noah.<br/><br/>Despite this movie trying it's hardest at being cool and artsy and all about the dreamers, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief. People like that don't act like that and they don't achieve things like that - not even in movie (""la la"") land. The best thing real life Noah and Allie (the musical versions, too) could hope for would be shattered dreams and bitterness.<br/><br/>All of this is not say that movies about pretentious, misunderstood dreamers can't be inspiring and brilliant. They can, and they often are, as it seems that a lot of movies challenge this topic. ""La La Land"", for me personally, just tried too hard. They were too targeted, they pandered too much. Ironically, all I could do is advise them to ""get more real"".<br/><br/>Regardless of my qualms with this movie, anyone who is finds really nice music and golden-age nostalgia entertaining will certainly enjoy this motion picture (as did I, in the end). It's not as bad as some people suggest but it's certainly not as good, either."

","Ryan Gosling: They may as well of had a piece of driftwood ""acting"" opposite Stone. This guy is so useless I was embarrassed for him. To start with, he sounds retarded (is he?). His 'serious face' makes him look constipated (I was half expecting him to let one rip the entire way through). I've seen stroke victims with a wider range of expressions than him. He's so vanilla, lame, boring, possessing a total lack of charisma. The best reviews he ever had were for roles with barely no lines, ""moody"" films like 'The Place Beyond the Pines' and 'Drive' when all he had to do was sulk!. If he wins an Oscar for on the back of this performance it will be an absolute travesty! He can't sing, he can't dance, and literally sucks the life out of every scene he's involved in.<br/><br/>Now Emma Stone is lovely, She's 'sweet' but one dimensional in that she's always playing the same character. This was a gross miscasting. you can't help but pity her when she sings, it's like your 5 year old niece at a school play, but worse, no depth or range at all, completely drowned out by the music in every scene. She has some rhythm when it comes to dancing, but the set pieces are so laughably childish it's hard to gauge her true capabilities (clearly dumb-ed down to accommodate Gosling's lack of talent). To make matters worse, time has not been kind to Stone. Whatever youthful looks she may or may not have had are long gone. Her face is beginning to morph into yet another plastic Hollywood mess. She's not hot, she's not sexy, but neither is Gosling so I guess in that respect they're evenly matched...<br/><br/>The script was OK. Stone's character begins and ends the same with no progression mentally and Gosling;well he's so boring you just give up caring. However; the rest of the cast were stellar. John Legend has some smooth vocals but he is rather oily. Had they cast people with real talent in the lead roles then I think this could have been magnificent. Worth mentioning;The cinematography was excellent, visually stunning, an orgy of colour bursting out from the screen in each and every scene; and the songs, although forgettable, had a certain unique charm to them. I predict a theatre production in the near future.<br/><br/>To sum it up, If your date makes you chose between this and Titanic, I'd chose this. Just don't go expecting it to live up to the hype.

"alexscarb","5","12","20","23 January 2017"," Selection of terrible points about the film
","I do believe this is a really poor film with great budget and little artistic value. Poor script, poor acting, terrible consistency, poor dancing & average music.<br/><br/>The reasons why the film is bad are so broad it's hard to write an integrated bad review, I will simply point a few selected terrible points of the film, there are many more.<br/><br/>* Script & story is poor and predictable. I spent half the film thinking the script was being ""ironic"" and that at some point the ""good stuff"" would start. Good stuff never came, except maybe for the last 15 minutes which was an obvious crowd-pleasing but it was pleasing indeed. * Music scenes are not memorable and often it's hard to tell when they decide to shove them in and why. No iconic dance or move will be remembered. * Ryan Gosling pulls the same face throughout the film. I found his comments on jazz shallow & hard to believe. By no means he conveys proper love for anything. He's Ryan Gosling playing himself and reusing his own set of Gosling clich√©s. He's believable or at least charming though when he tells Emma to follow her dreams. * Emma Stone has great acting moments (for instance, when she's auditioning and someone interrupts her) but it's only a few great glimpses in an incoherent ensemble. Her character is meant to be insightful and dreamy, full of values, and yet she has the shallowest of friends. She forms a kind of tribe of husband hunter-gatherers who just meet to go out together so they don't look like weirdos. They only reappear for applauding in a play. Regarding her pre-Ryan love life, when you find out she's going out with the guy she keeps rolling her eyes on & who is consistently depicted as charmless and lame you just can't believe it. They're artificially put together to create her an epic I-can't-put- up-with-this-anymore-the-jazzy-guy-is-my-guy scene in the restaurant which is embarrassing due to its impossible built-up. This is an obvious one, but the film is full of hard to believe stuff. * No dance scene is memorable. No twists, no nuances, no pushing limits, no art. * Plot is childish - they're both meant to succeed (no success = you're lame) at different paces. * Scripting is poor. They go from a rough start (total time of interaction = 2 seconds in two episodes) to 1 encounter where she's a bit funny and suddenly they go for a walk and switch from almost insulting each other to almost kissing, just to be stopped by a telephone ringing. No build-up, no understanding of what's going on in their feelings.<br/><br/>I could keep going on and on. A film that would be average if it was shown after lunch on TV but is turned bad by artificial marketing expectations.<br/><br/>Excuse my English."

It was clear that the story, supposedly about Jazz or Theater or something, was aimed at pasty White people who don't know the first thing about Jazz or Theater. Mix in a lot of forced chemistry-free smiling, brutally crafted ideas for singing and dancing, and a couple of out-of-place 'f' words to make it seem that this is supposed to also be a film for adults and you have a recipe for a bloated overrated piece of glittery junk that looks more like a thrift store basket filled with cheap deceased people's jewelry than the most amazing film in decades. I kept waiting for Mary Poppins style cartoon birds or penguins to show up.

Why did they pick non-dancer, non-singer Gosling and the only marginally better singer dancer, Emma Stone, for this? Why the hell didn't they use Channing Tatum? At least he can dance. Why didn't they get some A list talent to write the score? <br/><br/>Frankly, any one of the'Step Up' movies, even with their cheezy plots and sometimes embarrassingly bad acting kick this movie's ass.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the banter between Ryan and Emma. It seemed the only time there was a real spark of romance. I thought it was going to explode from that. instead just like the romance, the movie fizzles.<br/><br/>In a few years people will wonder what the fuss was all about."

","I've given 3 stars, one star for each $10 million of the cost, and also because I found this production as a musical third rate. The colors, sets and film shots were interesting,even imaginative, but beyond that, I was disappointed that this was the best Hollywood could come up with in the musical genre.<br/><br/>The script had abrupt transitions between scenes and time lapses. The dance scenes by professionals were choppy and didn't show dance moves. The story didn't get started until halfway through the two hours.<br/><br/>The scriptwriters took the easy way out toward the end by skipping over five years that I could imagine were more dramatic and emotional than the movie up to that point. The viewer is cheated out of better story lines, with no transition at all to bring the movie to its conclusion. The last half-hour had more flair and drama than the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Standards have been lowered, and the younger generation must see oldies to get educated. There was nothing exciting or inspirational in the dancing or the music as performed by amateur leads. In all of this world are these the best musical leads that could be found? You can find better singers, pianists and dancers on TV competition shows or in community theater. Were these the best actors for the leads? Emma Stone is charming as an actress, but Gosling's profile was the only attractive attribute he has going. He had no expression on his face for two hours, other than sullen. <br/><br/>It's very impressive that stars with no background in music and dance could take a crash course to prepare for this movie, but the results were passable, only. <br/><br/>If the director wanted to show how average people sing, dance,and play instruments, he succeeded. But the public deserves to see and appreciate the best musical talents around."

I am not a great fan of musicals but remember Grease etc for some great dancing and singing. I went with my wife and 3 friends. Usually our perceptions and views on a film are quite varied! In the case La La Land we were all in agreement that the film had nice scenery and photography and good acting from the two leads but overall was a very ordinary film of a sentimental love story. The backdrop is the taken for granted opulence of the California wealthy where even an actress searching for work drives a new Toyota Prius (probably hybrid) and the lead male character, apparently short of money, gets a suit made to measure and somehow buys (?) a bar/nightclub. In conclusion the film is over- hyped, overrated average romantic tosh. Don't waste your money on this but instead go see a much better film such as Manchester by the Sea. This is my first written review which I felt compelled to give as IMDb's average score and critics have got it so wrong."

","Lets set the parameters. An Oscar-winning film, or any above-average picture for that matter, needs to fulfil criteria that sets it apart from the 'average'. It requires a breath of innovation, story-line, integrity and impeccable acting that levitates the subject above the norm. It needs also to vault hype and financial remuneration. To create a musical, which, I believe 'La La Land' aspires in many parts to be, there has to be a synergy between book, score and choreography. Sadly, for this viewer, not one of these three elements can be considered by any stretch of the imagination,'exceptional'. It's triumph is evident in it's cinematography and lighting, which were largely outstanding. But the remainder? The story is typical Hollywood fare - predictable without significant twists or intellectual excertion. Essentially, nothing out of the ordinary happens and the blandness creeps to a predictable end. The acting is OK. You would expect as much from someone of Gosling's ability, but I hope that one day he'll be provided with a script that alienates him from the type-casting that befell Hugh Grant, with a diversity that De Nero was astute to select. Choreography? What choreography? That brief moment with the bench is all that taunts the memory. Singing - best not go there. Marni Nixon could have played both roles.<br/><br/>And I read today that it's up for 14 Academy nominations. Figures. Trump was successful so there's no reason this will not win.<br/><br/>Emperor's new clothes 'n all."

I believed all of the praise was deserving and from reading all of the summaries I was sure I would love this film. However, I was WRONG. While the cinematography was wonderful and the colors were incredible, the story for me fell flat. I felt like I was waiting forever to witness some kind of climax or even rising action. I wish the film would have allowed the characters to display more depth and maybe I would have had the connection with them that I needed to have or at least found them some what appealing. It missed out on having any logic or purpose for the characters actions and seemed inconsistent in exactly what it was trying to tell. While I like Emma Stone and think she is a great actress, I failed to recognize the chemistry between the two characters. The musical numbers were cringe worthy. Although, the score was fine.

","""La La Land"" has been receiving dozens of accolades about its look, its stars, its love of musicals, and its ability to transport us to a world long gone from the American movies. Damien Chazelle exploded in the movie scene with ""Whiplash"", a movie that burst with emotions, music, and strong performances. In fact, music was a living character, a force that captured the protagonists souls and bewitched the audience. It seemed only natural that Chazelle would try a more ambitious project, a full-fledged musical, inspired by the golden age of musical, and that somehow would keep his feet on the ground.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play a couple of dreamers who fall in love in the city of dashed dreams. By the time they meet, she has been to too many auditions which led nowhere. He's a lover of jazz, a form of music that doesn't really appeal to the masses, but it is his obsession, and he doesn't appear to be the compromising type. He finds himself often, and he chooses to ignore practicality over dreams. Maybe that's what attracts him to the aspiring actress, or maybe it's the fact that she is a looker and a charmer, with a dash of innocence.<br/><br/>The film has them going to parties full of vapid personalities and possible contacts. These parties are at best hollow, expendable, and also serve as backdrop or props for the next musical number. There were times when I wondered how these two characters managed to even become guests in those settings. There are many ""holes"" in this musical, and too many instances where one feels like the team is trying too hard to show creativity. He drives an old, loud, and hip convertible. She somehow can afford a Prius with what appears to be a part time job as a barista in, check this, a movie studio.<br/><br/>Musicals are about dreams and don't stress reality and accuracy over dreams and the magic of its music and sets, but even ""Singing in The Rain"" didn't hold back in its portrayal of the negative in Hollywood. It didn't hold back when showing the prototypes in the parties, and at best, you were part of the help if you ever made into a ""party"". We have seen spontaneous and magical musical numbers take over reality in many films, the ones in here fall short in many ways.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the ""freeway"" opening number, and I wanted to like it a lot, but there was no fire in the performances, the dancing, or the quite boring setting. There wasn't any particular challenges in the dancing, and the lyrics felt amateurish at best. It wasn't a good beginning for a musical because it didn't even hint at better things to come.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" improves as it goes on, but the quality of the lyrics remains a problem. The melodies in the smaller numbers fare better, almost approaching lovely a couple of times, and since it's a fantastic with touches of realism, it's pretty sad. The only time I felt like I was really witnessing magic was the bit in the Observatory, conveniently opened after closing hours, and when we're given the alternate ""take"" on what their lives could have been.<br/><br/>Emma is lovely, and Ryan does a good job portraying the jazz piano player. Romance and chemistry register, and there are moments that show the director and writer understands the world of entertainment, but it also reveals that there's a limit to what he knows. It pains me to compare it ""Singing in The Rain"", but that other movie had its heart and mind in the right place, an exuberant song and dance piece that had insights on what lied in the heart of the beast, showing the duplicity in the hearts of some of the members of this world. Dreams came across loud and clear, in vibrant colors. The hunger to belong and be more successful was apparent in the physical routines. ""Fame"" which portrayed the world of the aspiring singers and dancers bursts with physical force in all of its numbers. It never needs to call attention to itself.<br/><br/>Maybe the problem is that for a musical about making it and trying to keep dreams and love alive in the city of dreams, it does not offer much in the way of magical settings. The brush around the Observatory is not pretty, especially the first time we see them dancing. There are hints of greatness, but they come too far in between.<br/><br/>Maybe we want to like it too much, but let's be honest it scores big in effort. It doesn't do too well with the finished project. I kept having flashes of ""The Artist"", ""Fame"", ""Singing in The Rain"", films that delivered in quality both lyrically and visually. I wasn't angry, just disappointed because I wanted to like it more. Maybe a bit more time rehearsing, getting a better lyricist, focusing more, etc. could have made its heart beat with a stronger, more interesting form of energy."

It is not a movie to rival any great musical or comedy film. The movie is of a basic boy meets girl story-line; with a weak plot to follow. It is in no way in the same league as a ""West Side Story"" (1961) motion picture.

Entertaining in parts, but not memorable. Some of the scenery of LA and surrounding area was well shot, but much of the cinematography was fast moving and narrowly focused, like the movie's plot. This writer's movie guest of the evening developed motion sickness from the jumpy and out-of-focus scene-to-scene action of the camera(s).

Ryan Gosling who plays main protagonist is a good actor but this role is not for him; he is extremely clumsy and when he dances around a streetlight it resembles a parody on Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain. His voice reminds one of a whining mosquito. Concerning Emma Stone, she also cannot sing or dance. At least she is not as clumsy as Ryan.<br/><br/>The film's choreography was made with the imagination of a kindergarten teacher.

","One can say many things about writer-director Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" and, indeed, the critics' plaudits and accolades have already infiltrated our national consciousness: it's a valentine to movie musicals; it's a musical for people who don't like musicals; it's a feel-good movie for all audiences; it's a tonic for our national malaise. The story--separated into seasonal chapters--is pretty basic: Emma Stone is a barista on the Warner Bros. movie lot who aspires to be an actress but can't get passed the audition phase; Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist who longs to play his own compositions. They encourage each other to follow their dreams, which doesn't necessarily mean taking the financially lucrative road (although having money in the bank would certainly be an incentive for a better future, even if the 'artistic value' isn't there yet). Yes, Chazelle is in love with movies--he steals enough from the motion picture past to tell us that--and, certainly, the opening musical number on a jammed Los Angeles freeway is full of contagious acrobatic joy and celebration. The trouble is, these two young people aren't willing to compromise (perhaps that would be allowing for too much realism). Chazelle attempts to show us that success doesn't always lead to happiness, yet his protagonists don't see the big picture; starry-eyed, they want instant gratification through artistic expression. The dancing is polished (too polished, I thought) and the early numbers (such as one with Stone and her girlfriends) have a sprightly quality that is old-fashioned in concept and charmingly lacking in pretension. Still, the hardships of a romantic relationship pulled in different directions isn't all that interesting here, mainly because Gosling and Stone seem so charmed and picture-perfect. She trembles with a beginner's desperation during her auditions and is convincingly unhappy when her one-woman show doesn't pan out, but watching her out to dinner with an affluent date and his friends reveals nothing more than a princess eager to try another throne. Gosling has a moment or two when he's able to give us a natural response to a line or situation, but his concern for Stone seldom registers. The brightly-painted film is reaching for a certain height--a plastic paradise, a movie heaven--that will flood us with good feelings in its attempt and break our hearts with its climax. However, if you are not invested in these characters by the midway point, it will all seem like a glossy charade. ** from ****"

First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together."

","From the very first scene, La La Land captures your interest in a vice and never lets go. It was so magical, visually stunning, and the songs will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. And, despite La La Land being a musical, when people weren't singing and dancing it still had the feeling of a regular movie, which made the story itself captivating. 
I don't think Emma Stone has ever given a better performance than this. She was good in Birdman, sure, but she soared in La La Land. One scene in particular that sticks out to me is ""The Audition"", during which she was able to sing a beautiful solo while the camera circled around her; all in one take. On the contrary, my only criticism is that Ryan Gosling wasn't doing much acting while he was singing and dancing. He is a very gifted singer, and a lovely dancer, but his face remained a little deadpan during musical numbers. 
But the whole movie is damn near perfect. It was interesting story-wise, the music was fantastic, it made me happy, sad, and made me dance in my seat. 
But what really makes this movie, to me, is the ending sequence. That was what made La La Land ""perfect"". It tied everything together so beautifully, but also left some room for the viewer to do their own thinking, and it even made me, who has cried during only one other movie ever, shed a tear. 
La La Land is surely going to make cinematic history. It's new and exciting, and it's an experience you surely won't want to miss it."

","The musical romantic comedy-drama film was directed by Damien Chazelle and is set in sunny Los Angeles. It is based on love and life's wishes. The story centres on the relationship between Mia Dolan, an aspiring actor and Sebastian Wilder, a struggling jazz pianist. The main characters are played by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
 
The film opens with the main character, Mia, who is disheartened from her subsequent acting audition. That night Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills, promising her that somebody in the crowd will start her film career, but in the end she left this party in disappointment. During a musical gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a passionate jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play songs from a traditional Christmas setlist. While going home, Mia overhears him playing. She enters the restaurant, but Sebastian is fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off.<br/><br/>For many people, the best thing about La La Land is the melodious music, which is presented throughout the whole musical. For me, however, the film succeeded because it has an important and strong message. I can't see anything negative about the film, I was absolutely delighted.<br/><br/>I would recommend La La Land - it is so emotional, if you like to reflect about life."
"TheOny13","10","4","5","23 December 2017"," City of Stars
","La La Land is a wonderful musical movie that tells the story of Mia (played by Emma Stone) and Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) and how they follow their dreams while also falling for one another. <br/><br/>This movie reminded me of the musicals I saw when I was little (since I haven't watched one in years) and why these kind of movies are so lovely. The performances are on spot and of high quality, really gave me the sense of realism. Also the soundtrack is marvelous with songs like ""City of Stars"", ""A Lovely Night"", ""Another Day of Sun"" or ""The Fools who Dream"". The cinematography was a delight... so many wonderful pictures and the mood that they were shot on gave the movie more realism (as if it didn't have enough already). The story was good... but sometimes felt a little bit sudden. And this is my only issue with the movie. There were some scenes that just happened without some good context to them... and I was like: ""ok how did we get here?"" but it didn't bothered me so much so that it could ruin the experience I had with this movie. Also there moments in which I was like: ""This is gonna happen next!"" Buy again it didn't bothered me or made me feel I was wathing a predictable movie. The execution was what made me enjoy it, even though some scenes were predictable. There was even some comic relief in it but it never seemed forced or in there just for the sake of being in there (like most of the recent Marvel movies). There is a scene at the end that will make most people cry... no spoilers here... I almost did and it was so surprising to see this type of scene done like it was done here, in a musical movie but it worked wonderfully to enhance the heart that this movie had.<br/><br/>Overall a wonderfull movie that I longed to see it for quite some time now since it won 6 oscars this year. I would highly recommend it to musical movie lovers and to anyone who wants to watch a movie with good story and good acting by both the leading actors. 10/10."
"bux-87049","10","4","5","12 November 2017"," People are missing the point!
","I had to write this review as so many musical purists are completely missing the point. I'm fed up of reading that the lead actors can't sing or dance and that that makes it a bad film. This is nonsensical as this film is an evolution of the musical not a musical made in the 50's. I would argue that most of the classic musical greats, contain awful and hammy acting which do not resonate with a contemporary audience and do not make them bad films. By having actors perform a musical in a real and raw way is what drew people in and made the film relatable; we look at Emma stone dancing on the screen and think 'I could do that'. <br/><br/>To judge this film on the actors singing and dancing is missing the point - just as some did with Les Miserables. The beauty of this film is the drama, humour and romance created by talented actors, acting their socks off. (Ok apart from Ryan gosling who looks like he could tap dance through a terror attack and I mean that as a compliment.) the musical numbers are endearing and are tools used by the director to make you feel for the characters, not as a recording for an album! <br/><br/>I can normally find a small fault, with even the best films, but I could not for La La Land which is why I have given it a 10. Needless to say the cinematography is gorgeous, while the costume design has inspired me to make an appointment with my tailor. <br/><br/>Lastly, the ending reflects the authenticity of the performances by being based in reality, ironic considering the location of the movie, and again relatable. Interestingly I watched this film at a specific time of my life and it reminded me that there is not just one route to a happy life. That is what I took away from la la land. Oh and that I want to be Ryan gosling."

","I love musicals but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I walked out with just ten minutes left because I couldn't take it any more. It was a long boring story line with OK acting and unmemorable tunes. Bamboo shoots under my fingernails would have been less painful. I don't get all the awards and nominations."
"mel_portela","Null","15","27","16 January 2017"," ""Cute"", but ordinary
","I'm not a fan of musicals. Obviously there are exceptions, such as ""Singing in the Rain"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", and, more recently, the great ""Sing Street"" (not the regular American musical, where people seem to feel an uncontrollable urge to sing and dance in the middle of the street for no reason at all). However, even going against all my instincts, and because of all the fuzz, I decided to watch ""La La Land"". <br/><br/>I arrived; I sat down; I settled down; I waited. The movie begins. Suddenly, people singing, reproducing a choreography perfectly rehearsed, almost mechanical, an explosion of colors as if the world was painted in Technicolor in a long take (?) - practically perfect. I could no longer stay put, every position was already bothering me after 3 minutes.<br/><br/>Then we have the first glimpses of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. A bad start. How shocking! At first, we are introduced to Mia (Stone), and later we become familiar with Seb (Gosling). In a third moment, we finally have the two together and, from there, inseparable (but not so much). And here, I must say, the fact that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are extremely charismatic helped me a lot so I would not go into a catatonic mode and stop paying attention to the screening unfolding in front of me. But not even the enormous charisma of the two was enough to make me enjoy ""La La Land"".<br/><br/>I like Emma Stone, she's a good actress. She does not have much depth, let's face it, but she manages to do her job in a decent way. I think ""Birdman"" was her less ""Emma Stone moment"" of all, because I could see a little beyond the wide eyes and the half-open mouth, her trademarks. Well, neither Emma nor Ryan are singers, much less dancers. However, it seems that all the reviews minimize these details, especially due to the forced exuberance the director displays throughout the film and the chemistry between the protagonists. The harsh reality is that Stone is no Debbie Reynolds, let alone Gosling a Gene Kelly. I could not minimize it. It was strange, it was uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The whole experience was uncomfortable. Chazelle is a good director, who has impressive technical skills. But, for me, he tried to take a step way longer than his legs. Perhaps, he was overconfident because of what he achieved with ""Whiplash"". I don't know. All I know is that it lacked humbleness. ""La La Land"" is pretentious and, at the same time, ordinary, it hides behind the right light and a good art direction.<br/><br/>Although the film is ""divided"" by seasons, it gets a little tricky to realize this when its set is Los Angeles. Apart from the captions on the screen indicating that we have passed from spring to summer and so on, nothing else alludes to what seems to be something important for the narrative: neither the set nor the cinematography. So, be it summer or fall, all that hovers is the love between Mia and Seb in gaudy colors.<br/><br/>Not that the cinematography itself is bad. Quite the opposite. It's too beautiful. As I said, the lighting is right, almost perfect. Do you see the problem? When I watch a movie photographed by Lubezki, for example, I do not need to be constantly reminded by light tricks that he is a master of cinematography. But Linus Sandgren is not a Lubezki. It is not innovative, it is not exceptional. <br/><br/>And this leads us to the script: girl meets boy; girl falls in love with boy; girl and boy live unforgettable moments; problems happen. I have to admit that, here, Chazelle even tried to skip the usual ""and lived happily ever after"". But it backfired. I'm not going to tell what happens at the end cause it would be unfair to those who have not yet watched it. It is enough to say that, even if he wanted to do something different, it was nothing that we had never seen before. As if it was not enough, he decided to teach us about dreams, expectations, determination and reality. Not necessary. Too unnecessary.<br/><br/>I do not doubt that many people really liked ""La La Land"". It was made to be liked. I just do not understand how more experienced eyes have been fooled, giving a masterpiece status to such an ordinary movie. The directing is almost convincing; there are some interesting metaphors (Jazz + Hollywood + Golden Age)¬Ö Even so, ""La La Land"" is miles behind the great musicals ever made; it's beneath its fuzz and beneath the expectations of someone who wanted, from the bottom of the heart, to have liked this film (myself)."

","I saw a trailer for this and was pumped for it. I love Jazz. I love modern jive. I love dance. I love theatre. But for me it fails miserably. After watching trailer, I was expecting something along the lines of Grease, Mama Mia or a good old fashioned Singing in the Rain type affair. If you are an 'arty farty' type person it may be your thing. It was long. There was a lot of material that just felt like 'filler'. It felt disjointed. There was nothing memorable about it. Most of the time we were wondering where it was going. The ending was abrupt. It was clever, but after such a long film, I felt this bit was neglected. It felt rushed. I love the actors but this one is easily forgotten. Won't be watching this again. Disappointed."

","I was expecting a wonderful song and dance extravaganza with a great story. Wow! Was I ever disappointed! I wanted to leave half way through it was so cheesy! The big song and dance routines in particular were embarrassingly stupid<br/><br/>I endured until the end, but sadly it didn't even begin to recover my anticipatory enthusiasm. <br/><br/>The jazz was great, John Legend was great, Ryan Gosling is a very attractive man and I enjoyed his singing and dancing and found his character very likable, but that's all of the positives. <br/><br/>Emma Stone's character has a vacuous, narcissistic and superficial personality with little talent and no idea of real values. I could not identify with her or feel any empathy at all for her plight. I suspect many of those voting for the Academy Awards may be cast in a similar mould and therefore may have found it appealing. There must be some explanation! <br/><br/>I can't believe anyone with roots in the real world would find this film particularly riveting or enjoyable hence my one star rating."
"Matt-Canalcon","10","13","23","6 January 2017"," Finally ending 2016 on the right note...
","Yes, ""La La Land"" is a perfect movie and it's destined to be a classic in my opinion. I went to see it last night and I had to go back today because I kept thinking about it and humming the songs. This is a perfectly crafted film, I have only have positive things to say about ""La La Land"", the movie I needed all year long. Just by watching the trailers I could smell something special with the amazing cinematography and the beautiful music. No need to say the movie exceeded my expectations. <br/><br/>The casting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is simply genius, I heard rumours that they initially had Miles Teller in mind for this movie, but it wouldn't have been the same without Gosling/Stone. This is the third movie with them together as the leads, with the underrated 'Crazy Stupid Love', and the disappointing 'Gangster Squad'. You can tell they were made for this musical, even though Ryan Gosling is not a natural born singer, the performance and the dance numbers wouldn't have been the same without their chemistry. Pretty sure Emma Stone is a lock for Best Actress.<br/><br/>Obviously, the production design and the visuals are breathtaking, this is a movie I'm going to watch over and over again for the musical numbers. Most of the times it feels like you are watching a dream and I think this is exactly what Chazelle was aiming for, he succeeded at every level. The synergy between the music, the colours, the camera-work, the editing, the costumes and of course Gosling/Stone made this experience incredibly unique. There is also a lot of layers to 'La La Land', the story was essential to bring those numbers alive. Without spoiling anything, the ending was beautiful.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of 'Les Mis√©rables' and 'Chicago', but 'Singin in the Rain' and 'The Sound of Music' are the best musicals ever made. La La Land deserves a place among them, of course we will give the movie some time to breathe, but to me this already is a classic. There's so many things I have to say but I will let the smarter people talk about it. It's funny, engaging, beautiful, don't miss it!<br/><br/>10/10"

","There was a time that to be in a musical you had to have talent. You might be able to dance like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. Or at least if your dancing were suspect you might be able to sing like Sinatra or Streisand or at least like Meryl Streep. But La La Land is a perfect Millennial movie where everyone who shows up gets a trophy for trying. Today we tend to confuse talent with fame. As long as you have the right ""Q Score"" and can pull in the right demographic then that's all you need. Even in the day of the dinosaur when they made West Side Story they at least made sure the featured players were made to look good by surrounding them with professionals Gosling has the requisite bona fides as heart throb, especially when paired with Emma Stone, and has some musical skill but he is dancing on his fame here, which is probably enough for today's audiences. The movie looks good and if you like splashy over saturated color then there are some visuals for you to enjoy if you were a fan of the TV show Pushing Daisies. No doubt this film will be a fav wth would be auteurs and wanna be Broadway dancers; However, I found it a romantic yawn but the ""chic flic"" crowd will drag their dates to see it.

","A massacre. This is bad, this is really bad. I really haven't' seen a movie that bad and god there are number of them every year, in a long time and so outrageously awarded. Every possible clich√© is present. The traffic-jam encounter, seen that in For the love of the game; the people dancing on top of the cars singing about Burritos, i've seen it already: the start of the relationship in front of a movie, seen it a hundred times already, it's like two people collide into each other on the side walk or at the park and they fall in love. It's funny because just a year ago, Woody Allen did a musical and La La Land is a clear copycat. And the ending is predictable by a mile ""and they met again at this bar and he played the song and they wondered if whatever had been different"". Please, this is overdone ! <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that the hype, the campaign, the distribution of awards, the columnists who are bought out, is actually real. The whole 'modern day musical' and 'an incredible bet !' is a joke.<br/><br/>This is not a musical. This is a caricature of High School musical, it's on the same level as any other sitcom out there. But, has any of these members of the jury of the Golden Globes and Academy Awards ever watched The Sound of music ? Want to hear an actual musical performer ? Julie Andrews. Not Emma Stone. Julie Andrews.<br/><br/>Ryan Gossling ? I'm sorry but i just don't understand what was going through the director of casting's mind. When I think of male performers, yeah Astaire, Paul Robson. But what is Gossling doing in a musical ?I thought a musical was supposed to be a movie with an actual score and performers ? <br/><br/>Chazelle's lone motivation: building a famous couple. He wants the girl he's the most attracted to, that's what this movie is all about. It's to propel Gossling/Stone duo right up there with Betty/Dunaway, Andrews/Van Dyke, Costner/Sarandon, and say, ""I created an iconic couple!"" No you didn't !<br/><br/>This is a lazy script, that doesn't give homage whatsoever to the great musicals, its romance is as insipid as the romance in Creed and cheesy as in My all American. <br/><br/>Who does Chazelle think he is to believe that he is the first to draw four girls in a red, yellow, green, blue skirts ? <br/><br/>The camera work is terrible, it loops, it takes detours - it wants to be creative but there is no discipline to it and that's why it looks bad. The fundamentals were not respected. To be honest, you feel like screaming throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>I remember when Moulin Rouge came out, I was unimpressed by the lack of depth and flavor of the characters but the montage in the format of a video-clip, was quite entertaining. This however, does not back up the hype."

"spsarkar","6","11","19","28 January 2017"," Decent Movie- More Fitting in BollyWood than Hollywood
","BollyWood is the nickname of the Indian film Industry, largely centered in Bombay (now called Mumbai). It produces a steady stream of pisi-kaka every year. So much so that it is in Guiness book of World Records in some category. Most of BollyWood films are in that sense musicals because it has a lit of music and dance, and they are absurd (the song and dance sequence) but cleverly done.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, I think the reader can figure out why I chose the above heading. If you have seen the movie, not sure why are you reading it (although I read reviews after I seen a movie to just check out what other people think) and if you have not, I would suggest you do go watch it. I have been meaning to ever since it came out and been postponing it because I wanted to be sufficiently depressed so that if the movie sucked, which it kinda did on many levels, then my day could not get any worse. And it did not.<br/><br/>It is a strange movie. Almost like Seinfeld. A TV show about nothing. Although there is the loose connection with one's dreams, how dreams are almost difficult to pursue, bla-blah-blah and of course ends with the hackneyed clich√© where boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl go separate ways and boy and girl meets 5 years later to think what could have been. Boring. So BollyWood.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is not even pretty but she grows on you and looks cute in the middle. Gosling is in equal parts good looking, good actor and does a decent job. Neither his performance, nor Emma Stone's , or for that movie as a whole is nothing to write home about. So aptly (if I may use a symbolism) summarized in Emma Stone's (Mia's) phone call to her mother describing Sebastian, her new boyfriend ('he is not anyone yet'). There are hardly any other characters of any significance in the movie. The guy who plays Kevin, or Keith- besides perpetuating the clich√©' 'White Boys Can't Jump' (You have to have Black People if you are talking Jazz), do not see what was his role in the movie. I hear he is some kind of a musician of some fame. My advice would be (not that he needs it, or cares) that do not give up your day job. Talk about 'Product placement'!<br/><br/>Acting is ordinary, sets are great and THAT dance sequence (with the Canary Yellow Dress) which is plastered all over the promo material is really good. Besides that, not much. Why it is so much of a craze, I would not know. Why 14 nominations, who knows? I don't get to nominate. And frankly who cares besides the folks who made the movie? It does not deserve the 'hate' (did not even know it had hate till I stumbled along the boards), nor does it deserve 14 Oscar nomination or 7 Golden Globes (surpassing One Flew Over Cuckoo's Nest- seriously?). <br/><br/>My wife watched the movie with her girl-friends on release day and described it as 'Magical'. I knew then I better not rush to watch it. It is a 'chick-flick' but with a sub- text. The queen of unrequited love is the man. How BollyWood! A solid 6."

","And here's to the fools who dream Crazy, as they may seem Here's to the hearts that break Here's to the mess we make...<br/><br/>I really, really love to discuss such heartwarming movies, which deliver the full specter of positive to melancholic emotions, but no negativity at all. ""La La Land"" from Damien Chazelle is indeed an awaited masterpiece after his break performance with Whiplash. So much energy and genuine talent is represented in his scripts, directing and music, that I am truly inspired after watching his every film. His producers are really joyful after working with him, describing him as a very young visionary, who really lives with his work, and tell that after he is done with a movie, he lingers on it long after the shooting is done. Maybe because for any true auteur every piece of art is like a new baby born by his imagination and hard work. So this time he chose a more familiar cast - Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone (the latter can Really sing!). I think that they both got talent and am really a fan of Gosling's film project choices. He truly does not have a failure (yes, I am looking at you newcoming Blade Runner movie!). So having also the chemistry between them two, the director can only pinpoint the amazing, yet pretty often used storyline. <br/><br/>I prefer not to speak so much about script, rather than music and performances. The feel which we get from this movie is rather energetic, fresh and warm. Life is really nothing but a sequence of events which we truly must welcome and embrace, not matter the costs of mistakes and misses. The passion of the main characters for what they love and do is indeed great, but it pales in front of these rare moments of togetherness in creativity which they have. And that's why the third act is the strongest one. When they break out, they estrange from each other, but not to the point of losing that connection which they have from the beginning. And although people are born alone and constantly move on and change, these two characters really resemble our ever lingering spirit of dreaming and high hopes. Even if the reality crumbles, even if Sebastian and Mia choose separating paths, they are bound to be together in their dreams. And when those dreams come true, they are happy despite the physical distance between them. <br/><br/>There is much wisdom in this film. And the beautiful shots are really complimentary to the exact directing of the motion. Los Angeles is a really nice scene for the story and the color palette of the movie is truly positive. I want to point out the song which Mia sings at the last casting - ""Audition"". It truly made me smile, because it represents a spirit, which I don't really show, but which I love. And reminded to me of a very special person of mine. Also, I want to express my deepest respect of the conclusion song and montage. I really turned this 9/10 movie into 10/10 for me. Love and Creativity are truly strong forces in our lives. They show our spirit and souls like nothing else. And even our mind and perception are puzzled by the disappearing boundaries which are torn down by everlasting art."

","The music was enjoyable, but not memorable, the professional dancers were were excellent. The leads - OK. Gosling & Stone did a good job as far as acting, but singing & dance are not their talent - at least in this movie. The story line was pretty routine, nothing all that dramatic. I had a hard time keeping awake for most of it. The ending helped redeem it, but not enough to give it more than 5 stars - for me at least. The dialog was a trite. I still remember many of the songs from the old musicals. I don't think I will remember much of anything from this. If you are looking for a nice evening with a simple , sappy story line and pleasant music, you won't be disappointed. Just don't go in with high expectations. If you disagree and love it, great.

","I had been anticipating this movie since i am such a big fan of Whiplash, hearing that it would be a musical only made me more curious to see what Damien Chazelle had in store for us, so i was really excited when i was able to score tickets to a screening at Tiff.<br/><br/>I came away very impressed, I'm not sure if i would call this a masterpiece (yet) but its certainly close, Damien Chazelle has brilliantly crafted a beautiful film, a great achievement and truly deserves to be seen by even the harshest skeptic, Chazelle is starting to show that he is one of best directors and has quickly become one of my favourite film makers in Hollywood. <br/><br/>The Cinematography is fantastic, this film is beautiful, the scenes pop out of the screen and feel magical at certain parts and while i was watching i couldn't help but think that this is the type of ambitious film-making that we have been missing lately, i wish studios would take more chances with original material and realize that it doesn't just have to always be reboots/re-imaginings.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays (Sebastian) a jazz musician and does a good job doing so but make no mistake, this is Emma Stone's film and she truly excels in her role as (Mia) an aspiring actress. Stone's portrayal is absolutely wonderful and will most certainly be recognized by the Academy. The rest of the cast are also excellent and even though J.K. Simmons part is relatively short, he still manages to steal the scenes that he is in.<br/><br/>The Musical numbers are great from the exciting opening highway number to the closing somber look at what life could have been for ""Sebastian and Mia"", but its Emma Stone's rendition of ""Audition"" that truly stands out.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film remind me of the reasons of why i fell in love with Film-making, but La La Land did just that and definitely brought me back to the early days where i was truly discovering just how Spectacular film-making can be.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10."

","This film is mercifully forgettable. In fact, I saw it just a couple of weeks ago and already almost all I remember is counting the ways I could have put my 11 quid to better use, such as staying at home with a take-away and re-watching Chicago, Moulin Rouge, My Fair Lady, or any other musical with actors who can actually sing and dance (not to mention act), lines which make you laugh, songs worth listening to, and characters not all of them bland yet obnoxious narcissists. To be rigorously fair, Emma Stone's performance, despite the dreadful script, does push the production up a notch (i.e. to notch one), together with quite good technical features. But the nauseous aftertaste you are left with as you walk - at last - out of the cinema is of the triumph of packaging over content. That so many people apparently loved this film is flabbergasting. Has postmodernism finally broken free of its stuffy academic niche and convinced a generation that life is nothing more than a shallow pretence to be self-referentially broadcast, or could it be that few are willing to decry the absence of clothes on this appalling mediocrity of a film?"

","The opening scene showed promise with an expansive dance scene but after that the film took a nose dive. There were no memorable dance scenes apart from opening and closing sequences. The dialogue, story line were mundane. I wanted to leave the cinema half way through but felt that my wife preferred me to stay, though afterwards she agreed it lacked any good music or dance and was awful!If you have memorable memories of great musicals from the likes of West Side Story don't waste your money. There were no memorable songs. Today I don't remember any which says something. One song they flogged and played throughout in different ways but it wasn't a strong piece. The lead characters failed to dance to any high degree of skill though it could be argued in their defence there was little opportunity for them to dance. If you enjoy the musical genre and have memories of West Side Story,The King and I, South Pacific etc you will be so disappointed. Each one of those musicals has a list of memorable songs that stay with you years later. This film had none. The film will disappear into the ether and be forgotten. Hollywood hype and exposure has won over film quality."

","I'm giving this film a three for the opening scene. The rest was room temperature unsalted oatmeal. I tried to like Ryan and Emma's characters but they were empty vessels, partly due to bad writing and partly due to their lack of commitment to the roles. Ryan looked like he was about to soil his undies at any moment, whether because he was righteously defending his bachelorhood, or jazz - his go to expression appeared to be constipated. Emma, whose face looked oddly proportioned in tight close-ups was a wisp of a character, ungrounded, and therefore unbelievable. The aspirational lecturing about jazz and watching ""Rebel Without a Cause"" came across as pedantic. Overall, it all felt tepid and safe and soft-shoe i.e. no passion. I was bored and felt time weigh heavily on this film. The music was bland as well, dreamy, goopy, overly-sweet, generic, and also boring. I can't say I would ever be inclined to recommend this film to anyone, for any reason. It just never got going. I actually can't believe it won as many awards at the Golden Globes as it did. Now I understand why Ryan had such a look of surprise - or was it constipation? Who cares..."

","I went into this expecting a really fun movie, and ended up alternating between watching it and reading a short story (and I finished most of the story.) It had great potential, but even allowing for the fantasy during the musical numbers, which I personally enjoyed, it simply wasn't developed well enough and the plot had a lot of holes. If people don't like jazz these days, how is he going to get them to come to a jazz club, no matter how ""pure"" the music is? Or especially if it is rarified? Do people really show up at auditions with so little attention to their appearance? If she doesn't like jazz, why is she so struck by his jazz music?<br/><br/>The worst problem is that the singers all have weak voices, which detracts tremendously from the songs. I didn't find the music memorable, but I enjoyed it at the time. The stars aren't great dancers, either. I never came to care very much about them; they didn't have a lot of chemistry and were only intermittently likable.<br/><br/>I would have liked most of the musical scenes, except for the amateurish singing and dancing. I don't see a lot of movies, so I generally didn't get references, if that is what the people who liked the movie were charmed by. The romantic and professional angst scenes were too long and too many. Isn't it o.k. if Gosling ""sells out"" his music until he can earn enough for his club? How else does he expect to get the money if his preferred art form is dying? That was when I started reading on my iPhone (the ringer was turned off.) I thought that the final scene was very well done, although it didn't tie into what went before too well. It doesn't really connect to the decision point that preceded it.<br/><br/>I see by the reviews that some people hated what I loved, and vice versa, so good luck deciding whether or not to see it."
"jaypereda-10731","4","10","17","11 January 2017"," Spoiling the predictable
","This film didn't fool me. For a minute I felt like I was watching a tourist promo spot. Traffic, Stanley Donen's street dancing, even skaters that projected how clich√© Hollywood falls when it no longer can teach the world how to live, think... Decades ago, through movies Americans saw the world through a peephole and now it revives it with Cinemascope and predictable dialogues. Banking this time on the simplicity of ""selling the dream"" paradigm. The unsung jazz pianist struggling to be reckoned with. An aspiring actress working as a barista beating the audition circuit. They used to fill in as waitresses or party musicians,working in obscurity, yet still in awe, revering showbiz and stardom as their lives' goal. Not much has changed from the day when studios used to capitalize on similar scripts selling glitzy but deluding rags to riches stories. <br/><br/>This movie was much needed to the Hollywood crowd. Hence all those overrated accolades and much hype. This film was promoted and marketed to add on the collective auto-suggestion and make them feel that showbiz is the ultimate quest of them all. It's an ego booster to feed the masses that they should keep dreaming, quit school, college or other utilitarian goals and move to Hollywood land to pursue an infinitesimal share of the vast wealth of the industry which equates to a mere 1% of what the movie distributors and production companies rake in selling movie tickets and later DVD sales. <br/><br/>However, I didn't have to go to the movies and contribute to that 1%. To get the gist of it, I streamed the film and FFW through the musical parts to skip the commercial overload in the hopes that I could extract net dramatic quality. Performances were superb but the script/story failed us all. I hope members of the Academy and SAG/non-SAG actors can see how detached the film was to the real life of a struggling performer who will never taste notoriety or come even close to make it big in this town. A salutary warning to those who still dream big and must face the sad reality that 99.5% of their guild are still waiting for that call back or a friend of a friend to pull them up on the main stage. Trying to depart from the original mission of enlightening the way to an already pre-convinced (sold) audience, the producers can't hide behind the ""telling the story"" excuse. Instead they should admit they were just selling us the 6th St Bridge. Hollywood ain't paved with gold."
"RLTerry1","10","10","17","27 December 2016"," A Modern Motion Picture Musical Masterpiece!
","Simply dazzling! A beautifully produced motion picture musical that is sure to delight audiences around the world. Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) and Emma Stone (Mia) shine brightly in this self- reflexive modern romantic film set on the backdrop of a classically composed movie musical echoing the song and dance numbers that Busby Berkeley brought to the silver screen through Hollywood studio system powerhouse Warner Bros. Summit Entertainment's La La Land will have you laughing one moment and crying the next in this roller coaster of emotions. Every aspiring professional who has the dream of a substantive career as an artist in the visual and performing arts--or just an artist in general--needs to watch this film. If you have ever been discouraged on your career path, or lack thereof, this film will aid in reigniting the flame that fuels your dreams of writing, acting, playing, or whatever your passion happens to be. Whereas many films similar to this one would have shot it as a period OR modern piece, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece that harnesses the nostalgic appeal of the classic musical with the power of modern cinematic storytelling.<br/><br/>Best part about Damien Chazelle's La La Land? The old-school movie musical feel from the moment the film opens. From set pieces to matte paintings to the manner in which the cameras capture the story as the drama unfolds, this is both a modern story of romance and conflict and classic Hollywood musical. While some may find the cinematography, lighting, and editing to be nothing remarkable, the fact of the matter is that it required great skill and hundreds of hours of effort to capture the essence of an old Hollywood musical. To recreate a nearly extinct film genre, is an outstanding achievement in cinematic storytelling and deserves all the 9s and 10s this film is receiving from critics and fans alike. La La Land takes pages right out of the books of Busby Berkeley (Footlight Parade) and Gene Kelly (Singin' in the Rain). Such a gorgeous combination of a classically structured and choreographed musical within a modern Hollywood. And the film could have easily rested its laurels on the technical and artistic achievements alone, but the film also possesses an incredibly beautiful love story between two aspiring artists.<br/><br/>In a modern studio system who appears all too often to be more concerned with franchise building, merchandising, theme park integration, and rebooting, this film is fresh, real, gritty, and endearing. In a climate so predisposed to the Star Warses, Harry Potters, Jurassic Parks, and Avengerses, this film brings with is a breath of fresh air that is nearly unmatched by any other film this year. While many are concerned with the lack of original stories coming out of Hollywood, may this film be a testament that masterpieces can still make their way into cinemas nationwide and not simply the art house theatre of the US' largest metro areas. Although film is a visual medium and should not rely upon the score or songs to carry the bulk of the film (i.e. Frozen), this film is very much about the music. However, unlike films that integrate music in order to cover up poorly structured and developed writing, La La Land embraces the music as much a part of the story as the writing itself. In many ways, the film plays out like music and flows like a musical score. The way the cameras moves, the editor cut, and the blocking of the characters is very much like a musical staff, like the way music is composed and performed. But at the same time, the movie is not simply about the music but about the relationship between Mia and Sebastian; and furthermore, about their aspirations for the spotlight. Solid writing and a solid score.<br/><br/>The casting of La La Land could not have been more brilliant! Both Stone and Gosling successfully bring about that 1940s feel in a modern story. That could be due to the successes of both in 1940s era films prior. Stone in Magic in the Moonlight and Gosling in The Notebook. While both can successfully carry a period piece on their own respectively, together they are a powerhouse couple like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Their performances in this film were so incredibly natural, no real, and believable. At the same time, the actors are also very much contemporary--just like the film classic yet contemporary. Even though the audience is well aware that Stone and Gosling are anything but struggling artists, they play their respective parts so convincingly that you'd swear that we were actually watching a pair of struggling artists who do desperately want a substantive piece of that Hollywood pie. A great screenplay possesses protagonists that the audience will love or love to hate, and the characters in La La Land connect so incredibly well with classic and contemporary audiences. <br/><br/>Inspirational. This film will help to inspire those who have a talent for storytelling, music, or writing to continue to work hard and remain dedicated to one's craft because that is the only way that a career can pay off. The moment you stop trying is the moment that the dream dies along with settling for less. Not that day-jobs aren't important. Certainly the importance of a day job is shown in the film, but it's imperative that the day job never cause an artist to sell out or give up on the dream. Day jobs should fund imaginative dreams not eclipse them. There is much to love about this film; so much so that you will likely find yourself with a desire to watch it again. This IS definitely my pick for Best Picture as we head into award season with the holidays coming to a close."

","How can a film be so tiring? Is it its duration, or the immaturity and naiveness that covers all of its existence? I am afraid it is the latter, simply because there have been numerous films throughout the history of cinema, of such duration and longer that have not carried all those negative characteristics like this film does.<br/><br/>By trying so much to recreate an era, a romantic era, that existed (only in films) so many decades ago and place it in our era, what they have managed to do is fill a two hour film, with clich√© and silly unconnected scenes that even for someone, who goes to the movies for the first time, will be easily seen without much thought or effort. So much dancing and fake sentiment, and so much sunshine, music and singing that allow me to say it is an offence to the real deal: true musicals that will always be remembered and will never be created again. That for a future reference...<br/><br/>Overestimated? Unworthy of such plethora of awards and nominations? Absolutely!

"Hbarker-32233","5","19","37","19 December 2016"," Strenuously enchanting
","""Mandatory fun"" were the first words I scribbled in my notebook after sitting through Damien Chazelle's oppressively whimsical throwback. This year's The Artist, La La Land is another hollow exercise striving to be a simulacrum of a thing while pretty much missing the whole point of what it's trying to replicate. Yet much like Michel Hazanavicius' instantly forgotten 2011 Oscar darling, 2016's presumptive Best Picture winner has inspired a bizarrely defensive cult of otherwise intelligent, level-headed people blathering uncritically about ""movie magic"" while hurling personal attacks at we ""bitter folks"" who dare not adore their beloved confection. In the weeks since being underwhelmed by La La Land I've been told I have no heart, no love for film and that I must be unable to experience joy. So basically it's a superhero movie for middlebrows.<br/><br/>The strain shows from the opening number, in which commuters stuck in gridlock on the Los Angeles freeway jump from their cars and begin belting out one of the film's many unmemorable tunes. Chazelle sneaks his edits inside of whip-pans to give the illusion that this is all taking place in a single, unbroken shot. But his time may have better been spent working on the choreography ‚Äì which seems to be comprised mainly of the dancers throwing their arms up in the air and then putting them back down again. As with the Full Metal Julliard histrionics of his previous picture Whiplash, there's no pleasure in the filmmaking here ‚Äî just the blood, sweat and gritted teeth of Chazelle's self-conscious virtuosity. Every frame of this film cries out, ""Are you not entertained?"" Five minutes in I wanted to pat the poor guy on the head, give him a cookie and tell him it's okay to chill out a little bit.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star as Sebastian and Mia, two mismatched lovers struggling to be real artists in a city rotten with commercial compromise. He's a jazz pianist, one so committed to his art he gets himself fired from gigs all over town for refusing to play standards and improvising like a lunatic instead. On their first date Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club and mansplains the music to her in that especially insufferable way white boys have of putting people off the entire art form. (It should also be noted that for all of Sebastian's fanaticism he appears to have no qualms about loudly talking over a live performance.) Mia wants to be an actress and claims she's an outcast because she loves old Hollywood movies, yet strangely all we see of this is her lying about a film she hasn't seen. There's not really a character here, just lots of vague idealism that Emma Stone's considerable charisma somehow manages to make watchable. As we've seen in films both decent (Crazy Stupid Love) and unwatchable (Gangster Squad), she and Gosling are enormously charming together. Their chemistry props up La La Land for far longer than it should, particularly as these two struggle mightily with the singing and dancing.<br/><br/>(Speaking as someone who still feels sorry for Russell Crowe and Pierce Brosnan, I'll never figure out why filmmakers continue to insist on casting actors with no musical theatre training in musicals. Were Justin Timberlake and Anna Kendrick really that busy? Anne Hathaway not returning phone calls? Why go with the one guy from The Mickey Mouse Club who didn't dance or sing?) Chazelle studiously mimics the candy-colored palates and elaborate soundstages of classic musicals and ticks off all the expected references without understanding that the pleasures of those old movies lie in their elegance and relaxed grace. Everything's about exertion with this dude. The writer-director's monastic bent comes up again in what becomes the movie's misguided central conflict: John Legend pops up as a hugely successful musician who hires Sebastian to play keyboards in his touring band. But this dream gig isn't artistically pure enough for Mia, who attends an arena show at which much mockery is made of the audience for enjoying it. Pretty sure I'm not the first to point out that Legend's band is treated with the derision of Ghost World's Blueshammer.<br/><br/>Okay, so it was here that I really started to hate Mia. Her guy's landed a job most musicians would kill for and she's chewing his broke ass out for not somehow magically finding the money to open his own jazz club instead. She's also still a freaking barista at this point. And let's not even get into the ugly optics of the two white leads with middling musical talent being held up as paragons of artistic integrity while John freakin' Legend is presented as some sort of sellout loser. (He's also the only black guy in this movie that's allegedly about jazz, which at least is one more brother than was in Chazelle's last film about jazz. This is progress, I guess.) La La Land lunges for the bittersweet melancholy of Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg, but has no interest in that movie's heartbreaking economic realities. The super-entitled Sebastian and Mia have amazing career opportunities fall out of the sky into their laps and both get pretty much everything they've ever wanted in the end without having to compromise or work very hard. The final ten minutes of La La Land are undeniably effective ‚Äìjust like the ludicrous ending of Whiplash was‚Äì because Chazelle knows how to work an audience over until you say ""uncle."" As for the dopey received wisdom that nobody's making movies in this genre anymore, on my ten-best list last year were both Chi-Raq and Magic Mike XXL ‚Äì two musicals full of more joy, innovation and imagination in any given number than you'll find in the entirety of La La Land's labored, freeze-dried replica."

"n-28628","9","5","7","24 January 2020"," A La La Land That Works
","Living in La La Land, that's exactly what director Damien Chazelle wants people to feel when watching this film and he really did accomplish that. A struggling actor, Mia (Emma Stone) and a passionate jazz musician Seb (Ryan Gosling) cross paths through a series of weird events that eventually bring them together. Throughout the film, I really felt like a part of the story and while the writer pulls you in with the compelling plot in the movie, many other elements including acting, the soundtrack and cinematography contribute to the overall wowing effect.
Right off the bat, the acting seems very realistic. Ryan Gosling often plays softer characters with little musical background, however when his character Seb gets fired from his job, the facial expressions he uses are striking and makes it seem like he really cares about Seb's passion for music. During this moment, the audience can really see the raw emotion of Chazelle's characters contributing to the wonderful acting and emotional grasp throughout much of the film. Again with Emma Stone, you can tell she really cares about her acting within this movie because she seems very emotionally connected to her character Mia. When Mia is auditioning for her final role for a movie in Paris, she begins to cry and have various flashbacks and fantasies. Again, I really liked the acting in this scene because it made the characters seem more real and connected me to the plot. Overall, the acting in this movie was great and really added to the likeness of the film for me.
Also, the soundtrack throughout this film continues to show this fantasy effect of a sort of La La Land as well as tie in elements of a theatrical production. Usually in musicals, the soundtrack can be very cheesy and contain almost all love songs. La La Land definitely has some of these and at times I laughed because it was very dramatic and unrealistic. But maybe these moments weren't supposed to be funny and laughable? Sometimes it seemed as if the soundtrack didn't add the right emotion to the movie as the director had hoped, however the songs are very catchy and provide an avenue for soliloquy. For example, after Ryan Gosling meets Emma Stone he walks onto a pier to what it looks like reflect on the moment but instead he sings ""City of Stars"" which although a sadder song, does not portray all of the emotions he is feeling at that time but instead adds to this theatrical style that Chazelle creates.
Lastly, the cinematography really emphasises the style of this movie. Without it, it would break the film to be honest. During many moments of emotion or theatrical expression, the director does a really great job of capturing it by zooming in to gain a more personal affect and zooming how to get the full picture. Also the colors they use in this film are amazing and make it seem as if you are apart of this floating setting the director creates. However, sometimes I thought the way they filmed it seemed childish because they were so focused on the color and show-like atmosphere that some of the deep character development is lost. Even though it could be taken as childish I really do think for the most part the cinematography added to the film.
In conclusion, La La Land surprised me because of how great it was and how connected I felt to it when I watched it. The acting, soundtrack and cinematography in this film very much made it an impactful one."

","At the very beginning of every year, I write a list of all of the movies that I've been anticipating for a long time (mostly based on comic-books) and those that either have a good premise, a good director and/or a good cast. La La Land didn't have a release date in January (I think), but even if they had, I'd have probably left it out (maybe I did). I don't have a least favorite genre, I enjoy watching every type of movie, but musicals are by far the ones that I find to be less interesting or even well-made so, even with a great director and cast, I only got the urge to watch this film because of all of the Oscar talk and the beautiful soundtrack that I've been listening to in the last couple of days ...<br/><br/>Perfect. Magic. Absolutely stunning. I don't have words to describe how AMAZING Chazelle's direction is. I mean, anyone can enjoy this film because it IS great entertainment, but the amount of work that they had with this MASTERPIECE is unbelievable. Extremely LOOOOONG takes, over and over again, with excellent synchronized choreography and an original score to remember forever and ever. Every single shot drops such marvelous quality that I kept being surprised every single scene. This is the best directing skills that I've seen from a director since God knows when. Congratulations, Damien Chazelle. You won yourself an Oscar, a Golden Globe and every other award that honors the man behind everything.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are incredible and I can't imagine any other actors portraying their roles. Gosling is the usual funny, charming and loving guy, while Emma Stone definitely has her career- best performance (even better than on Birdman), worthy of many awards. The way they interpret the songs is so captivating and emotional that they just make the music even greater (watching besides listening gives it such a more compelling meaning). The score is so beautiful and heartfelt that it's impossible to explain through words the feelings one has as listening to them ... Just fantastic.<br/><br/>My only concern with the movie was the romance and the overall story, I thought it would be super clich√© and follow the usual paths that this type of films have ... Nop. Even the story is great. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but let me just say that clich√© is not a word that I'll use to describe this movie. It doesn't follow anything, it has its own original story and the romance is super smooth as the actors' terrific performances. It FEELS real.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd say this, ever, but ... La La Land is (probably) the best film of 2016 and my favorite, for sure. One of the best direction I've ever seen from anyone (please, Damien Chazelle keep going!), an absolutely pitch-perfect duo (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a perfect chemistry), a fantastic non-clich√© original story about pursuing dreams and the most beautiful and heartfelt soundtrack that I'll listen over and over again for God knows how long ... Magical. Rememberable. I can't wait to watch it again!!!<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"victorli-36862","10","5","7","4 August 2017"," Excellent cinematography, soundtrack, and acting from Emma Stone
","La La Land really knocks it out of the park as a modern musical that incorporates elements of the classics. While its initial reception was overwhelmingly positive, unfortunately it led to backlash from others, many of whom cited reasons that suggest they are not fans of the genre in the first place<br/><br/>Even the most cynical hater of La La Land and other movies with joy- inspiring visuals and music (think Disney films) would agree that La La Land's cinematography is incredible. It's not just the colors and artistic value of each shot, but the long takes far exceeded my expectations. So we all realized the movie had two six-minute takes, which were impressive in their own right. There were actually many long takes that lasted several minutes, in scenes with just conversations/plot advancement. Completely unnecessary but an example of the kind of work and attention to detail that went into this passion project.<br/><br/>The soundtrack has been a hit with millions of viewers around the world. Not much else to say here, as the music clearly was successful at evoking strong emotions within viewers, many of whom bought the soundtrack and relived the movie over and over after leaving the theater. <br/><br/>Emma Stone is a brilliant actor and really showcases her talents in La La Land. While there's nothing wrong with Gosling's performance, his character isn't exactly written to be as emotional and expressive - he's simply Sebastian, the jazz-obsessed musician who cares about little else for a good portion of the movie.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie several times with people who otherwise wouldn't have watched it, but did hear about its critical success. Most teared up or cried - after all, the themes of love and pursuing your dreams are universal. Overall, La La Land is a wonderful work of art and succeeds when it comes to evoking strong emotions."

","From beginning to end, I've never seen a film so modern, so unique and so right for the era in which the movie was made. <br/><br/>I read critics write that La La Land is a film ""like they used to make them"" - and to me that feels a lazy and obvious description of a picture of song, dance and romance.<br/><br/>La La Land was entertaining throughout, it lacked a dull moment with each second compelling as the last."
"trentglover","3","5","7","7 June 2017"," Disappointing
","It's not that I don't like musicals. More likely it's because I do that I found ""La La Land"" as mediocre a film as any I've seen in recent years. So glad my wife felt the same. It would have been hard to fake enthusiasm for any of it.<br/><br/>The musicals of the golden age of Hollywood had singers, songwriters, dancers, and choreographers who were at the top of their game. Now in an apparent attempt to make the movies more authentic while maintaining the ""star quality"" necessary to get people to come, star actors who are amateur singers and dancers are used. There wasn't a memorable lyric or dance step in the entire 2 hours.<br/><br/>After reading the critic's reviews it really seemed as though they were so excited that Hollywood made a musical that they neglected to consider whether they had made a good one."
"McHugh1","4","5","7","13 May 2017"," Somewhat Disappointed
","I finally got around to viewing this tonight and after reading all the hype I was disappointed. I don't want to be too harsh on Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone because they are obviously not singers or dancers and it was brave of them to do this.<br/><br/>To be honest I am not a lover of musicals but I do like jazz. Many times after seeing a movie whether it is a musical or not there is some music or song that sticks with me and I end up buying the soundtrack but that will not be the case with La La Land.<br/><br/>Last month I bought the newly released blu-ray of The Boy Friend by Ken Russell which I saw in a theatre in 1971 and is one of the few musicals that I love. While watching La La Land I couldn't help but think how it paled in comparison to The Boy Friend in terms of music, dancing and amazing musical numbers."
"MihaiSorinToma","9","5","7","7 May 2017"," A wonderful musical
","A jazz loving pianist falls for a wannabe actress and together, supporting each other, hope to one day achieve their lifetime dreams. Their attempt will prove to be much harder than expected, putting their relationship in peril multiple times.<br/><br/>It's a joyful but dramatic musical which presents two ordinary people with big dreams and their struggle to achieve them. It makes the viewer pass through multiple feelings, from excitement and fun all the way to sadness and drama, keeping him into its majestic atmosphere until the end. This is a very good example of how a movie should be done, how to shoot scenes, how to build characters and how to put them into place. The music and dancing also play a very important role in the act, making it easier for the characters to express their feelings while also changing the mood of the scene.<br/><br/>It's a very good movie without any doubt, but what disappointed me was the way the producers decided to end it. You may accuse me of being old-school and a fan of the fairy-tales for preferring a predictable happy- ending but I truly think that it would have been the best approach when it comes to this one. You may like the way it ends. You might even consider it to be a happy ending. who knows? But for me, this is the part which brought disappointment from an excellent movie and made me not give it full credit for its performance."
"mowasteph","2","5","7","17 April 2017"," As A Native Angeleno I Was Kind of Insulted
","I didn't really care for this movie. It had a terrible plot. I think Gosling and Stone did an excellent job with what they were given, but they weren't given much. I didn't give one hoot about either of these people. Especially Emma Stone's character. I did not like her. Good performance but not of a likable character.<br/><br/>Not only was this movie not very interesting in the beginning or middle but the ending was seriously trite. She DOES become a famous actress. He DOES get his jazz club. Right.<br/><br/>The songs were not memorable. The only thing I liked was the small montage of various L.A. spots and at the very least they used the Hermosa Beach pier for one scene and didn't go for the over-clich√©d Santa Monica Pier. But really, this movie had NOTHING to do with Los Angeles. This was the L.A. of people who have lived here for about 2 years and haven't got a clue. This was the L.A. of people in ""the industry"" which are, in my opinion, not real Angelenos. People who work in the entertainment industry seem to think that this is what L.A. is about and it's really a very small portion of what this city is about. Believe it or not, Los Angeles is a real place, but this movie was fake, fake, fake."
"trishladish","1","22","44","5 March 2017"," La La Crap
","I'm a movie buff and I've seen seven movies this year and I love musicals. However, for the first time ever, I walked out half way through a movie as did my friend and half the audience. La La Land was the slowest most boring movie I have ever seen. I cannot believe that Emma Stone got an Academy Award for best actress. <br/><br/>It was a shocker! The story would have been best left as a nicely-told romance. Instead, his effort at playing/miming jazz piano was abysmal, their attempt at the Fred-and-Ginger dancing would have been knocked out in the first round of Dancing With The Stars. Emma's up-the-nostril close ups and very very limited singing ability were not attractive. But above all, the songwriting (repetitive uninspiring motifs) and transparent unimaginative scoring was the biggest disappointment. At last there was an opportunity for an original composed and scored movie musical, and they came up with this drivel. I apologise to those who enjoyed it, I'm sure there was merit if you weren't distracted by a critical eye."
"ilikeimdb","2","22","44","14 January 2017"," Wildly Overrated!!!
","Insipid, uninspiring and totally contrived. LaLa tries to be a love letter to LA but instead became rather dreary and predictable (and LA wasn't particularly shown to best advantage either). It was Moulin Rouge without the excitement, pizazz, or pacing (and that's not a particularly high bar). After the opening scene, which has been done elsewhere, it devolved into more clich√© with mediocre dancing and singing. The saddest part for me is that I love romantic movies and I found no genuine chemistry between the main characters. Every note rang false, except for the energetic musical performances which contrasted sharply with the low energy elsewhere."

","These five stars go only to the actors themselves, who were phenomenal, and also genuinely touching as singers.<br/><br/>This film left me feeling like most Hollywood films do - like eating several packages of skittles in one sitting. After suffering through the unbelievably nauseating script, which turns what could be a very beautiful and romantic story into probably the most boring, uninspired relationship I've ever seen, I still couldn't get one thing out of my head:<br/><br/>What does any of this music have to do with jazz or musicals? Everything I heard was thinly veiled pop music chords with trumpets or saxophones to disguise them. There was no joy in any of the melodies, nothing touching whatsoever about Emma Stones' solo, just purely banal, lifeless chord progressions.<br/><br/>This film is not art, the same way skittles are not food. But at least skittles don't market themselves as a word-class meal, which is honest, unlike this widely acclaimed ""masterpiece"" that betrays the aspirations of art entirely."
"tomgillespie2002","8","9","15","28 April 2017"," Feels both traditional and contemporary
","There was a time I remember, sometime during the mid-to-late '90s, when the idea of watching a musical was laughable. It was a silly trend that was once popular with the movie-going audience back when cinema was relatively primitive, which saw a kitschy revival in the '70s and '80s with the likes of Grease (1978) and Xanadu (1980), but died a death when the rapid evolution of CGI made anything possible on screen. Then came Moulin Rouge! and its use of modernised classic tunes in 2001, and movie-goers have been in love with the genre again ever since. Its popularity shows no sign of stopping either, and writer/director Damien Chazelle, who made a big impression in 2014 with the excellent Whiplash, has sculpted one of the best musicals of recent times with the Oscar-nominated La La Land, a film that manages to feel both traditional and contemporary.<br/><br/>The film combines two elements clearly dear to Chazelle: The lavish musicals of the 1950s (and to a lesser degree the '40s), and pure jazz. The two wandering souls at the story's centre dream of leaving their mark in their respected fields, but both are in love with the past in industries always looking forward. Actress Mia (Emma Stone) spends time between humiliating and soul-crushing auditions serving coffee near a studio lot, where she occasionally crosses paths with a glamorous star as the rest of the room whisper excitedly. Musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) cannot resist ignoring the festive playlist at his restaurant haunt in favour of some improvisation on the piano - much to the annoyance of his boss Bill (J.K. Simmons) - while he dreams of opening his own traditional jazz bar. Sebastian is quick- tempered, neurotic, and plain rude, but Mia pursues him anyway. They fall in love, and express their feelings through impromptu song-and- dance routines.<br/><br/>Chazelle knows the genre inside out, and seems to favour the lavish MGM musicals and the glamorous physicality of the era's stars such as Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Opening with a near one-shot song-and-dance routine, beautifully photographed by Linus Sandgren, it goes on to deliver many dazzling and classical numbers, which are often glorious to behold and backed by a soundtrack of memorable tunes that manage to stay in your head for days afterwards. They are performed admirably by the central pair, who have real chemistry. One of the few saving graces of the Amazing Spider-Man films was the chemistry between Stone and Andrew Garfield, and here she sizzles with Gosling. It's the movie's main strength. Rather than merely go through the motions and familiar tropes, you really want them to be together. You can truly feel their happiness every time they see each other.<br/><br/>La La Land stutters when exploring deeper, more complex themes. The second act sees the two achieve some degree of success, with Mia developing a one-woman show and Sebastian joining up with a fellow musician played by John Legend in a band making waves in the world of jazz. Will Mia ultimately degrade herself in order to make it in a brutal industry that may not deserve her, and how can Sebastian, a hardcore old-schooler, be happy in a flashy group looking to move the genre forward? It seems like a poor excuse to simply tear the couple apart to experience their inevitable rough patch, and doesn't really fully explore the characters' emotional quandaries. But this slight lag doesn't last for very long, and the final moments are simply perfect. One of the great things about Whiplash was that final, heart- pounding moment of physical and spiritual triumph, and La La Land wraps up the story with grace and genuine tugs on the heartstrings. proving itself to be much more than a mere homage."

The ugly truth is...it's rubbish mostly. Sure, the colour and editing are great but the rest is just BORING and TRYING-HARD. I didn't feel the movie. There's nothing in it that would make me feel so into the characters nor the story. The climax is missing and thus, nothing to look forward to in the ending. And in between scenes, they would painstakingly insert singing and dancing that don't go very well with the scenario. The music is unpleasant to the ears, no recall at all! The opening number is awful, who wrote that? What kind of music is that. Haha! Oh my! Emma Stone's acting is the worst! Her facial expressions were awful, you can tell she is just ""acting"" as opposed to being drawn to the character because it feels real. Hers is fake acting. No emotions, no heart. <br/><br/>If I'm given the chance to interview Ryan Gosling, I would ask, ""what made him accept this role?, Which story has more value, The Notebook or La La Land?"" <br/><br/>The story is just as awful as the acting. The plot's boring. I cannot tell where the climax is. Transition is rough. Dance movements - been there, done that! <br/><br/>If you have watched Moulin Rouge, The Sound of Music, Singin in the Rain, Grease, Chicago and the likes, you would agree how terrible La La Land is. <br/><br/>I begin to wonder.. to those people who find this the best film they've watched... Were they just been born yesterday? <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle is a lucky newbie director, the award giving bodies surprisingly liked it, however, awful it really is."

Too bad she is even surpassed on the subject by Ryan, that I also truly love (not much to through away in his career). Mel Gibson did an incredible job in ""What Women Want"" dancing with a hat in his apartment...all people loving Ryan's dancing should immediately watch that memorable scene with Mel.<br/><br/>Overall, I agree with the 1, 2 or 3 stars ratings...it is a HUGE disappointment !

","La La Land is a musical film written and directed by Damian Chazelle (Whiplash) and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I'll admit musicals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but it's been a while since I last saw one that I really got into. Thankfully, La La Land has done just that, with its memorable songs and clever choreography.<br/><br/>In the city of Los Angeles, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) meets aspiring Jazz pianist Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and the two fall in love. Throughout the course of their relationship, the couple strive harder and harder to make something of their potential careers in the fast-paced and surreal city.<br/><br/>The film plays off as an affectionate tribute to the Hollywood musicals of decades past, complete with stylish dance choreography and bombastic set pieces. Also, despite its jovial tone and brightly-coloured presentation, there are plenty of bittersweet moments that prevent the film from becoming too sappy and overly sentimental. The songs were all great and they all segued perfectly into the plot. The chemistry between both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic. Both actors seem like they were having a blast filming their dancing and singing scenes.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

Just another overrated movie. But I do want to give it up to Ryan, he did an amazing job and that he was the only good thing about this movie. Coming from an Emma Stone fan.

"Tweetienator","6","9","15","17 January 2017"," Not Bad but no Milestone
","I like musicals but I must say I am a little disappointed by this one. Sometimes it is easier to make your verdict if you compare two movies of the same genre to get your opinion straight - Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge is imo in every aspect superior to La La Land: the story more drama, the music, singing and dancing superior, also the settings and visuals - superior. Imo first of all the story of La La Land is - mediocre and so are the characters. The story of La La Land is more of a soap opera than drama and so it lacks of depth, and for a comedy, well I miss the elements of comedy mostly. I like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone a lot as actors but compared to the performances and chemistry of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman they just look mediocre - I mean Kidman dying in the arms of McGregor is more worth than all of La La Land.<br/><br/>Also if I compare La La Land with Sweeney Todd it loses - the story, the characters of the latter are just far more interesting, I didn't liked the music of Sweeney Todd a lot but at least the story was interesting and captivating enough to hold my attention. In La La Land I wasn't emotionally invested into the characters and in the music at all. Ofc I am no lover of Jazz but I remember that the movie Whiplash about the drumming kid got me invested and I liked the passion and stuff conveyed by the maestro teaching his classes and the young talented guy. I also liked the tunes. Also another recent musical Les Mis√©rables with Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway beats La La Land easy. Okay I know, Les Mis√©rables is a classic but the execution is just superb. Imho La La Land plays in the league of Into The Woods (Kendrick, Streep & Chris Pine), latter got its problems with the story but imo the tunes and singing performances are still a notch better. <br/><br/>So all in all I would say for a musical, the music, the dancing, the story is okayish, the acting good, but La La Land I would only recommend for lovers of the genre who must see them all. If someone would ask me what musical he or she should watch for an introduction to the musical genre La La Land would not be on my list, or well, far from the top. Tbh - if this is Oscar material it just shows imo that the quality of recent Hollywood outputs don't belong to the best. Ryan and Emma both already have done much better movies before."
"amexspam","5","9","15","11 January 2017"," 7 Good Scenes do not a great movie make
","I went in with high expectations and the dance number at the beginning boded well. I understood this was an ""about Hollywood"" movie with a storyline that had been done repeatedly, but that is okay and the actors should have been up to the task. Many of the musical numbers had a quality that reminded me of Les demoiselles de Rochefort which is a film I enjoy - indeed, I felt that Jacques Demy must have been a muse for this director. The problem is when there wasn't music the story was flat and turgid. The main comment I heard from others in the audience was that the movie was boring. The movie could have cut 30 minutes from the dramatic scenes and the total effect would have been much improved. My suggestion is wait until you can record it on DVR and fast forward to play the musical parts."
"jtindahouse","4","18","35","7 January 2017"," Pretentious nonsense
","I'll call it right now. 'La La Land' will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and for no other reason than the fact that the Academy loves a film about the industry. If there's a film based around movies in anyway amongst the nominees list, put your money on it to win. Does it deserve the award? No, there were many superior films released in 2016.<br/><br/>Hollywood seems to be obsessed with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a couple. This is their third film appearance together and for my liking they just get worse every time. Comparing the chemistry for example to Gosling and Rachel McAdams in 'The Notebook', they are worlds apart. Stone is a very good actress as far as emotional range goes, but she can't pull off the likable tag very well.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Damien Chazelle's previous film 'Whiplash'. In a lot of ways they are very similar films, but in the more important ways they are worlds apart. The biggest difference is the modesty that 'Whiplash' achieved. It had great characters, yet it acted like it didn't know it. 'La La Land' has very average, even poor occasionally, characters yet acts like they're God's gift to cinema.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed coming out of 'La La Land'. Even though I knew it wasn't my type of film ideally, I was willing to give it a chance and thought it might surprise me due to my low expectations. On the contrary though, it managed to fall below my expectations. My advice would be don't be fooled by the reviews and probable Oscar nominations. There's nothing to see here."
"pinokiyo","6","18","35","17 December 2016"," Don't believe the hype too much. Clich√© and overrated/bland story. Some nice songs. ""The Artist 2016"" 500 Days of Summer is way better!!!!!
","I just watched this a second time. ""Someone in the Crowd"" (very catchy and upbeat) and ""City of Stars"" (emotional) are clearly the highlight songs of this film. I love those songs. <br/><br/>It made me cry the second time watching it, especially when Ryan starts playing ""City of Stars"" for Emma. That part is very touching. <br/><br/>Sorry, there is no way this movie is a 9/10 (currently), it will definitely go down once the hype dies down. I was excited to see this, but I think it is being over-hyped too much. I think it's better if you go in with low expectations.<br/><br/>I understand this movie is ""refreshing"" than the typical usual marvel comic super hero movies or animated movies always coming out in theaters, but it's being too over-hyped as if it's the best movie/musical ever. Is everyone not really focusing on the story and just rating on the visual? It's like people criticize Michael Bay films right away because most of his action movies have a clich√© generic plot, even though visually, he knows how to show action; well, people seem to forgive the generic storyline of LA LA Land because of the visuals. <br/><br/>This is no ""500 Days of Summer"", that was released in 2009, (now that's a feel good movie from start to finish that breaks some clich√©, which is easily a way better film than this/and has a better message)<br/><br/>I can't help it but compare this movie to 500 Days because the whole different SEASONS things, it takes place in LA, some musical scenes, about pursuing dreams/romance/what if it happened this way instead and that... BUT, 500 Days of Summer is just a way better solid movie. LA LA Land, underneath the surface, take away all the dancing and nice costumes, just actually feels less magical than 500 Days. <br/><br/>This movie also reminds me of ""The Artist"", which I'm sure most people have forgotten by now - was a major overrated, over- hyped Oscar win, where it was clearly praised on the visual/technical level/homage, because there really wasn't an interesting plot and the story was just bland and generic. Honestly, who really cares about Oscar wins anymore - the people voting choices are always predictable (Will Smith did not force me to write this); like another dreadful boring overrated movie ""Spotlight"" won just because it was controversial subject. <br/><br/>This is a musical, so they will randomly start singing like in Disney movies. But the musical parts weren't as memorable, catchy, or exciting as I imagined or was hoping for from all the hype. It doesn't sound like real music, but just actors just trying to sing lines in a musical way. I don't think it's on the same level as Moulin Rouge. <br/><br/>It actually came off more comical whenever Ryan Gosling just randomly starts singing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt can sing, but I don't think Ryan Gosling has that singing level. Even though 500 Days of Summer isn't a musical, I enjoyed that film's musical parts, and is way more memorable and feel-good. <br/><br/>Griffith Observatory was underwhelming. Also, it's such a waste to see these nice large production sets/extras, yet the camera just pans fast across becoming just a complete motion blur. Again, 500 Days of Summer made LA look beautiful than it really is and felt more memorable. (They made that Angels Knoll park iconic). I just don't remember any memorable moments except the opening freeway, which is impressive on a production level, but it wasn't as legendary classic level or worth the hype, as it just felt out of place just randomly happening in the beginning of the film. Clearly they just wanted to open the film with some sort of big bang, but it's the same as throwing in a Michael Bay action sequence when there's no substance to the story. I was more thinking during that scene, why are we watching these people dance suddenly?<br/><br/>I don't feel the romance between Ryan and Emma at all; their chemistry is more like siblings. The director relied too much on Ryan/Emma's ""chemistry reputation"" from their previous films together. They're both very talented, but I didn't feel the romance at all. The part where they say ""I love you"" to each other was cringe worthy/hard to believe. In fact, for them to get together is extremely forced and clich√© in this film. I get the clich√© formula already where they act like they hate each other in the beginning, but suddenly fall in love, but this one is so rushed for them to get together. <br/><br/>It seems like the story was a second afterthought and the dancing/sets were more of the priority. <br/><br/>There's a very ironic line in the film where John Legend says about being stuck in the old (jazz) from the past being a traditionalist won't bring the wave for the future... yet this film still tries to be in the old days of Hollywood. The film was shot in cinemascope; I thought the projection, at the theater I saw this at, was really bad - the colors were so dull/faded - but apparently this was how it was shot.<br/><br/>Just out of nowhere ""sell out"" John Legend comes to the rescue. And out of nowhere, out of all things on Emma's last audition, where we expect to hear her maybe share about her whole ""magical"" experience with Ryan (which may be cheesy), instead she brings up about her aunt!? (which is even cheesier!) Like where did that come from?!! <br/><br/>In harsh reality, dreams may come true. The irony in dreams, dreams may not always come true."

It tries to be relaxed, special and weird in a good way (artistic) but it just don't and it huuurts! <br/><br/>Then there's the fact that many scenes seems to have been made without any effort of perfecting them, there's a long shot were the main characters are small- talking on a distance where they have OBVIOUSLY been doing voice-overs of themselves, the lips aren't even following their words?!<br/><br/>Then there's no chemistry between Gosling and Stone, they're just being stiff, specially Gosling who's even more stiff when dancing (he's pretty cute though). And it's absolutely outrageous that Stone won an Oscar for this?! Haven't seen the other nominated movies but I find it hard to understand that someone couldn't be better than that?<br/><br/>And what is the movie even about? It's NOT a story worth building a movie upon, it could be a sidetrack in a bigger film, it don't justify itself. Too long. Too pretentious.<br/><br/>Mr Legend on the other hand is what his name says; a legend. He's totally funny. And the music is sometimes worth the while, even if it's really not that catchy. Overall I find it weird that it's so hyped, I guess it's our generation that haven't seen the classic movies in this genre and think it's something new when it's really a poor effort of recreating a concept that used to touch."

After watching it I saw it as a collage of stereotypes from all the old musicals relaying heavily on a film model that was stale and even crusty at points. <br/><br/>That said, I was amazed at Ryan Gosling's piano shots. He was sublime on the keyboard shots and learning to play for this movie. Nothing cheap or clich√© about talent. Both he and Emma Stone did a great job of transitioning from their respective scenes into those musical numbers. I found myself amazed that she could be carrying me through a scene just to have her leave me in disbelief that that it was but an intro to a campy song. <br/><br/>This movie is nothing but a ""tribute band"" to a bye gone era put together today in some kid's dorm room.

I know you had a pure heart and wanted to make an indie film and knew it wont go far. But... Hollywood inflated it like a pretentious balloon. This is a pure Hollywood ""automatic driver car"" film .

"ethanct86","10","8","13","19 December 2016"," There is no film like La La Land
","The opening shot of La La Land shows us a jammed highway of Los Angeles on a (snowless and warm) winter morning. Almost as if caused by the evident claustrophobia, everyone exits their cars and, on cue, sings us their individual stories. This is Los Angeles, the land where dreams are made and destroyed. People hop on cars, dance in sync for miles and miles, and play instruments out in the open like nobody cares. Magnificent. This is what the rest of the movie's going to feel like.<br/><br/>Go back and read my first sentence again. I said ""opening shot."" Yes, the entire opening scene is one whole goshdanged shot. The entire movie is made out of long shots. Most of the time, longshots don't work well other than to show off some technical feat; they make you feel like you're holding your breath for an unnecessarily long time. On the other hand, La La Land's opening shot is like letting out a breath.<br/><br/>This shot sets up the chaotic atmosphere of the first meeting between Mia and Sebastian. But it's not how your typical friendship would start: Sebastian honks his horn at Mia with the what-the-heck look; Mia gives him the birdie and returns the what-the-heck look.<br/><br/>After that encounter we follow Mia around in her daily life. She's an employee at a caf√© in a major studio's lot trying to make her big break in acting. Beginning with the incident on the highway, her day hasn't been going too well. And after a party that frustrates her more than enlivens her‚Äîa funless event that ends with her car being towed‚Äîshe follows a wisp of beautiful piano music that drags her inside a bar where she encounters the pianist: Sebastian.<br/><br/>Here we jump back to their first encounter in the morning, but this time, instead of following Mia this time, we follow Sebastian and note his daily life, too. He's a jazz pianist struggling to pay his bills while his one job is in a bar playing boring Christmas songs that nobody wants to hear and he doesn't want to play. Then, in a feat of both emotional bravo and idiocy, he plays an unassigned piece, consequently getting him fired. Mia approaches him, but he violently brushes past her. It's like they were meant for each other but they don't think so.<br/><br/>The story's simple. Plot twist or surprises are lacking. It's a path that goes up and down the bumpy road of their lives. A guy and girl meet, but their careers make their relationship to struggle. Should they follow their dreams, or sacrifice their dreams to spend time with each other? The story builds(or descends, depends on how you look at it) in small episodes that lead the tension to a depressing finale. Each episode is a link in a chain, not a piece of a puzzle where the story calls back the earlier scenes for an important event.<br/><br/>The finale is surprising at first, but‚Äîthink about it‚Äîit appears that the movie has been leading up to it the whole time‚Äîwe just didn't see it coming because we hoped so much it wouldn't happen.<br/><br/>Director Damien Chazelle obsession with music is very evident, not only in the film but also within his career. His directorial debut was a musical much like La La Land; he made his sophomore product about a drummer and his violently dedicated band leader; he wrote a screenplay about a pianist who has to play a concert perfectly or else. Through his dedication that soaks through this dream project, La La Land soars beautifully.<br/><br/>Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's college roommate, composes a score so vibrantly rooted in the old musicals yet engrained with that modern 21st- century intensity (he had supposedly sent 1,900 piano demos to Chazelle before settling on... six songs). This is a guy to keep an eye out for.<br/><br/>There is no film like La La Land. Thinking revolutionary like Les Miserables? Or bombastic like West Side Story? Or oddly magical like Wizard of Oz?<br/><br/>This is the best way I can put it: it's all the great movie musicals and romances you have seen, but, at the same time, it's not. Though it borrows heavily from almost every classic, it is unique in its entirety. Don't miss this movie. Some of you probably heard me quote this paragraph from The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, and I can't stress it enough:<br/><br/>""Catch the film on the largest screen you can find, with a sound system to match, even if that means journeying all day. Have a drink beforehand. And, whatever you do, don't wait for a DVD or a download. The mission of this movie will be fulfilled only if it is seen by those‚Äîespecially kids‚Äî ¬Ö who may not know what busy thrills can bloom, without recourse to violence, from the simplest things.""<br/><br/>You won't have another chance to see it in theaters until‚Äîmaybe‚Äîit's rereleased into theaters in a couple years. But by then, it'll be too late and regret will not be enough to compensate your missed opportunity."
"alonelygreycouch","10","8","13","18 December 2016"," Sincere, Emotional and Inspiring
","I had a feeling, having seen Whiplash, that Damien Chazelle's musical, La La Land, would be incredible.<br/><br/>The film charts the careers and relationships of two characters, Mia (Emma Stone), a hopeful actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist romantic, in beautiful Los Angeles. Mia struggles to be noticed, amidst swarms of budding youths, as she faces rejection after rejection in audition after audition. Sebastian is tragically in love with the dying musical art of jazz and tries to reconcile his dreams of reviving the lost tradition whilst appealing to an audience. They connect with each in the shared pursuit of their individual dreams.<br/><br/>Right from the opening number, 'Another Day in the Sun', which takes place on a highway congested with the traffic of LA, I was grinning more than I had at any time this year. The music by Justin Hurwitz and the choreography by Mandy Moore are inspired and complement each other beautifully here as in the rest of the film. The style is grand, large, happy - to match the ambitions of the characters.<br/><br/>The acting is noteworthy. Stone is awkward, disarming, emotional when she needs to be, and Gosling is funny, charming, heartfelt. Their dancing and singing was also surprisingly good. The pair create two of the most genuine performances of the year.<br/><br/>There are several positively magical scenes. There is a wonderful, playful tap-dancing performance over the backdrop of the cityscape at sunset. There is a romantic scene in a planetarium. The epilogue sequence of 'what could have been' was surreal with its bright pastel colours and haunting rendition of the film's musical theme. But a silent nod between Mia and Sebastian as they leave each other for potentially the last time tells me that this is not necessarily a lost opportunity. Life is not a surreal fairy-tale. These characters do not receive the perfect literary happy-ending of walking off into the sunset. Life has its trials and tribulations, but despite not being together neither character seems dismayed. Perhaps we should follow our passions, reap the successes we deserve, and not fret needlessly on what could have been.<br/><br/>Chazelle himself had difficulty garnering support for this movie. It was quickly written off as a risky investment - a musical without well established songs, by a relatively obscure director. Chazelle received an offer with a limited budget of $1 million to make his film but with the proviso that Sebastian was a rock musician and that the bittersweet ending be dropped. I am thrilled Chazelle refused to compromise. It was only after the success of Whiplash that he received attention from studios to get his musical off the ground and create the picture I have just seen.<br/><br/>I was so entranced by Chazelle's movie because much like his characters, who do what they love, he unashamedly, unabashedly has created a film of his own making with little regard for what others might want. Perhaps paradoxically, we find we want it nonetheless because we love to see people succeed in what they love. The story of Mia and Sebastian's success was sincere, emotional and inspiring. This movie, however, is not simply the triumph of Mia and Sebastian but the triumph of people who follow their passions."
"EnriquePineda13","9","6","9","28 January 2020"," Fantasy against reality.
","La La Land again presents Damien Chazelle's recurring theme about the sacrifices necessary to achieve a dream, as well as in Whiplash, Grand Piano and later First Man.<br/><br/>Chazelle is aware that the story of La La Land is a story told many times, and that is why he tells it from the genre that was exploited a long time ago in Hollywood.<br/><br/>With this Chazelle brings a duality between fantasy (the musical) and reality. In fact it is the reality that as the film progresses, it is gaining prominence, that is why the musical numbers are reduced. This is warned to us from the beginning, with the station markers (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) that in addition to serving as time markers, they warn us of everything that will happen.<br/><br/>So in winter, everything is cold and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) rejects Mia (Emma Stone). In spring the love between them blooms and they have their first musical number together. In summer their love heats up, things start to become problematic, in fact this season ends with the song ""Start a Fire"". And in autumn it is when the problems get bigger and their love falls.<br/><br/>This is how Chazelle also criticizes the current human inability to make commitments to another, that is, to fall in love, and thus grow along with their dreams."

"Turfseer","5","7","11","22 January 2017"," Entertaining but derivative homage to classic film musicals
","Move over Orson Welles! Hollywood has found its new wunderkind‚Äîand his name is Damien Chazelle. Coming off his indie hit, Whiplash--a vastly overrated melodrama featuring a jazz drummer instructor who acts more like a drill sergeant‚ÄîChazelle has muted his inner bad boy and set his sights on the top prize: Oscar Gold for Best Picture!<br/><br/>Chazelle sets his La La Land in a virtually unrecognizable present with characters, music and settings that are designed to remind us of the 1950s. Virtually every scene is interchangeable so when the La La cast steps out of their cars on the LA Expressway to sing the peppy opening number, Another Day of Sun, Eisenhower could have easily been sitting in the White House and not the present day occupant.<br/><br/>The opening scene is where Chazelle introduces his protagonists, Mia (Emma Stone), a barista on a movie studio lot and aspiring A-list actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a talented jazz pianist who dreams of opening his own club. Stone's Mia is pretty much your generic aspiring actress playing a character initially done in by a lack of self-confidence; the handsome Gosling is miscast as the rebellious jazz pianist‚Äîhe's a beatnik thrust into the anachronistic modern day setting. Chazelle's unimaginative protagonists remind me of a more sophisticated set of characters from the recent TV series, Smash, also a musical that alludes to the past but is set in the present.<br/><br/>Mia and Sebastian meet up a few times before their chemistry clicks in and they realize they're meant to be a couple. This happens when they go and watch Rebel Without a Cause in a movie theater and then decide to go up to the Griffith Observatory, the site where James Dean and Natalie Wood acted out a number of dramatic scenes as star-crossed lovers. Channeling his inner Mary Poppins, Chazelle has Mia and Sebastian fancifully float up to the planetarium ceiling to the strains of a rather tuneful original number by Justin Hurwitz entitled (couldn't you guess?), ""Planetarium.""<br/><br/>The bulk of the La La Act 2 machinations involves Sebastian joining a modern jazz-fusion band headed by a former high school classmate, Keith, played by John Legend. Because Sebastian is an outright snob, a jazz purist who only likes stuff from the good old days, he ends up in the awkward position of disparaging the kind of music Keith is composing and playing. So Legend's number, Start a Fire, a rather nice jazz-pop tune, is supposed to be viewed by Sebastian as something that actually isn't good at all (but actually is!).<br/><br/>Mia's story is a bit more straightforward. After being rejected by casting agents who she comes to completely disparage, Sebastian encourages her to take a stab at presenting her one-woman show. In a rather contrived scene, Sebastian simply ""forgets"" about a photo shoot for his band and misses Mia's show. When her show is a bust with few attending, Mia simply moves back home to Boulder City, Nevada.<br/><br/>Chazelle is on more solid ground wrapping things up in Act 3. Mia gets another chance when unbeknownst to her, a big casting agent came to see her one-woman show and raved about it. But it's Sebastian who gets the phone call from the agent's secretary looking for Mia and dutifully drags Mia to the tryout. <br/><br/>Five years later, Mia is a big star, married with child. Instead of reuniting the once aspiring artists, Chazelle imagines Mia randomly instructing her husband to get off the freeway because of the traffic, and they end up at a jazz club called ""Seb's,"" owned of course by Sebastian. As Mia watches Sebastian play, she fantasizes what things could have been had they ended up together. But Chazelle brings us right back to reality to remind us that Mia and Sebastian were never meant to be. That's a nice touch since he could have ended it with a much more saccharine climax. <br/><br/>The choreography here tries much too hard to emulate the glory days of the American film musical. Perhaps An American in Paris is the film La La Land attempts to copy the most. It's all very derivative and reminds us of early incarnations without creating something distinctively new. The music on the other hand is quite nice. In addition to the aforementioned instrumental, the lovely ""Planetarium,"" Emma Stone's ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" might end up as a bonafide hit especially if nominated for the Academy Award.<br/><br/>What La La Land basically lacks are sophisticated lead characters. No there is no My Fair Lady here by a long stretch. Chazelle's narrative is entertaining enough, featuring charming performances by Stone and Gosling, but perhaps lacks the really original plot twists and turns that one might find in the classic film musicals from yesteryear such as Singin' In the Rain or the Wizard of Oz. Chazelle's nostalgia trip lacks the benchmarks of artistic greatness but some catchy tunes--and Hollywood's general desire for film musicals--might propel this decent but derivative project into the Hollywood canon of the Academy Best Picture."

","While there was some fanciful (silly?) plotting, I enjoyed La La Land while I was watching it - probably to the level of a 9 or 10 rating. It was fun and funny and romantic and beautiful and magical. Emma and Ryan are talented and very appealing, whether separately or together. The fact that they are not especially gifted as singers and dancers didn't bother me at all; in fact, I found that to be charming. The musical numbers were engaging and satisfactory, if not particularly memorable. It would be unfair to compare this movie to classic movie musicals, because it's really a whole different animal.<br/><br/>However, in reflecting on the movie afterwards, I felt a bit cheated, so I dropped my score a couple of notches, and decided I had to write a rare (for me) review. My experience was like fully relishing a whole tub of buttered popcorn and then coming to my senses afterward. My first clue that something was off was how I felt at the end of the movie - not thrilled, not heartbroken - just disappointed (and a bit confused). In reflecting on this feeling, I realized that it wasn't that the characters didn't have sufficient chemistry for me to feel something; rather, the script/plotting let them down.<br/><br/>The basic story is about two cute kids exploring their dreams in LA who meet and fall in love. The audience's dream is that these two can make it as a couple (despite inevitable setbacks along the way). If a storyteller is going to dash that dream, he or she needs a darn good explanation. There isn't one here. The two kids (rather magically, and in relatively short order, from a real-world perspective) achieve their career goals, presumably at the cost of their romance. Are we really to believe that they had to choose one or the other - and that, if so, these two dreamers would choose career achievement over love? The two breakup scenes were both totally lacking in terms of convincing the audience that this pair might be ultimately incompatible or should not keep working on their relationship and enjoying one another.<br/><br/>So, I was robbed of a satisfying resolution. I was leaning toward a 7 rating, but I think I've talked myself into a 6."

And all of this is because it deals with something we all face at some point - what is right to choose in life, when our dreams also require great compromises? I truly recommend everyone to see 'La La Land', especially in a movie theatre, to discover with their own eyes the great talent of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and the chemistry they share on the big screen. Surely, without a pair such as this one, the experience would have been much different - it is a film that relies on their performances, which are executed flawlessly from the first scene in which they appear to the very end; all of their passions, desires and conflicts are full of life. You can see it in their eyes, dance moves and gestures with each other. The cinematography is fantastic and the musical score has been part of my playlist ever since watching the movie for the first time (I couldn't resist going more than once).

","Dreams. LaLa Land is about dreams. The tag line is<br/><br/>""Here's to the fool who dreams""<br/><br/>¬Öand its truly fitting. Emma Stone was lovely, charming and bright per usual (fan of hers since Easy A), but I was most impressed with Ryan Gosling. I had no idea he was so talented! I was astonished by his grace and pure perfection as Sebastian; I mean, Ryan Gosling as a jazz musician was everything I never knew I needed. He sang, he danced, he was absolutely sublime. Like many others would say, Emma and Ryan have a chemistry that is undeniable and it's hard not to watch them together on screen. They are captivating to watch, the energy flows through them and into the audience and its really something special. John Legend was pretty excellent in a supporting role, initially it took me a second seeing him in a different capacity but he was great! Acting isn't his trade, but I liked seeing him even though I thought it was a bit brief. Having him sing in the film was a real treat for those who may not be familiar with his music. His voice is like a fine wine; like honey in your mouth ‚Äì thick, rich and sweet. His addition to the cast was smart and really upped the ante musically, because John is just so supremely talented.<br/><br/>As far as direction, Damien Chazelle was able do what so few directors can, and that is create magic on film. It's really astonishing considering the undertaking this film must've been for someone who's only directed one other feature film. LaLa Land was directed as if by a seasoned veteran, scenes were seamless and so precise, in some parts it felt like I was watching a live play. The film is the best kind of fantasy, filled with love, joy, and life. You can't help but walk away thinking about your own dreams, feeling inspired to make those dreams a reality. This film is a homage, a love song to a film genre that's been long gone and sorely missed. It reminded me of old Hollywood glamour ‚Äì the sophistication and raw talent seemed to have the audience gripped from start to finish. It was refreshing and yet envelops you like a warm blanket on a chill winter's morning. It was effortless, clean and pure perfection.<br/><br/>I did like that the film also had some clear undertones and commentary on Hollywood as well as personal growth. Without saying too much, I think that these points really rounded out the film making it very robust and multidimensional. The film was able to position itself as somewhat nostalgic while not being clich√© or predictable. One of my favorite lyrics in the film is, ""madness is key to give us new colors to see,"" and this is so true and poignant when it comes to the dreamer. The dreamer is mad, considered not to be practical ‚Äì similarly Steve Jobs once said, ""the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."" Sometimes madness and genius go hand in hand, so don't fear it, embrace it; embrace the mad chaotic beauty of having big dreams, hold tightly to them and remember that its always worth the fight to make it a reality.<br/><br/>Bottom line: LaLa Land is a must see. You must experience the songs, the dancing, the joy and happiness this film brings you. It infuses you with hope and sends you back out into the world as a dreamer. I highly suggest this film be experienced by all, it is an incredible achievement ‚Äì the amout of applause at the end of the screening I saw as deafening. This is a definite Oscar contender, no question about it. Go see it! A++"

","Powerful musicals make me feel like it's a crime to put words to them. After seeing La La Land, it was clear to me that the film was one of the best theatre experiences I will ever have.<br/><br/>I worship the beauty of La La Land. It's all so big and beautiful. And Emma Stone is brilliant. She does the best thing an actress can do: to find a way to be the most compelling woman in the room without having to be the loudest. She conveys the most power through her subtleties, and this is partly due to her wonderful chemistry with Gosling. <br/><br/>The humanistic wonder expressed through Gosling and Stone's eyes when they look at each other is enough to carry any movie. The music is the spirit of their romance. This is especially prevalent in their intense moments with one another, like in the Planetarium sequence. It's just as much about their faces while they dance as it is the dancing. <br/><br/>La La Land portrays extremely vital parts of human existence that are easily forgotten about, and given towards normality, or daily life. Stone sings that ""a little bit of madness is key"" in an ode to ""the ones who dream"". This particular song makes cements the already prevalent attitude of the film, that vision, imagination, hope, endurance and love make the impossible a reality.<br/><br/>Brutal realism, in film and real life, complements the hazy dynamics of love, making the emotion so much more powerful within the human being. The dynamic screenplay adds to the film's realism, contributing to its overall power. <br/><br/>For example, when you see the scenes like her at his concert, like him missing her play, it's clear how much they love each other but how in order to fulfill themselves and become who they are, they need to do it separately. Then their lives took them away from each other, and she met someone else and had kids <br/><br/>It all becomes clear at Seb's at the end. They still love each other but almost too much. their circumstances make it so they couldn't be together, they're too invested in each other and have to be near each other, and in their two journeys do not collide well enough to be sustainable. <br/><br/>La La Land is a movie about love and passion, the intersection and division of both within the creative life."

"TheLittleSongbird","10","16","31","12 January 2017"," Like a dream come true, one of those films that totally banishes the blues away
","Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.<br/><br/>Very few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.<br/><br/>'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.<br/><br/>It was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.<br/><br/>Visually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.<br/><br/>The musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Something that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).<br/><br/>Chazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.<br/><br/>Both of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.<br/><br/>All in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

No memorable songs either, even the much talked about opening number on the freeway was a letdown, bunch of people jumping on and over cars, a few unimpressive dance moves and some incoherent song, I doubt Busby Berkley would have given it the thumbs up? Why everyone's raving about this film is a mystery to me, I can only assume there's a lot of people out there who have never seen a musical from the 30's, 40's, or 50's? Maybe it would have worked better if they'd set it in the 50's and left out the modern non melodic pop songs? Also thought the ending was quite bizarre! A good try I suppose, but it just fell flat for me, sorry!"

The songs are all quite catchy, and I had a couple stuck in my head after watching. The cinematography is amazing; the film is incredibly colorful and a true pleasure to look at. There are many, many beautifully-framed shots with Los Angeles (obviously) serving as the backdrop and sometimes as the focus. The movie is definitely an ode to the classic techniques of Old Hollywood, to Los Angeles, and to the many dreamers who have and still do call it home. Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance, and has excellent chemistry with Ryan Gosling, who is also very, very good. The script is very sharp, well-written, and witty. Stone and Gosling bring it all to life with very convincing and moving efforts. Good singing and dancing, as well. All in all, this will likely go down as an all-time classic of the musical genre.

","Everything about this movie is remarkable. From opening number (probably one of my favorite scenes ever) to the final montage (again, probably one of my favorite scenes ever), La La Land is a mesmerizing story about following your dreams. The film starts with an energetic, catchy, and beautifully choreographed tune called ""Another Day of Sun"" which really has nothing to do with the story, but sets up the mood and the context. From there, we follow two main characters as they pursue their dreams together. For Seb, a jazz musician. For Mia, an actress.<br/><br/>La La Land's most notable features are the music, colors, choreography, and cinematography. The music, written by Justin Hurwitz, perfectly fits and forms the mood of every scene. I really have no complaints about any of the songs. There are so many different hues of colors, and each scene seems to have a different color scheme. I don't know too much about dancing, but to the extent of my knowledge the choreography is brilliant and entertaining (though no comparison to Gene Kelly). The cinematography strategically combines elements of both a Golden Era masterpiece and a stage play, while also providing space to showcase the colors and music.<br/><br/>The actors try hard, but to be honest, I personally don't like any of the actors in this. Other than my personal distaste of casting, I have no complaints of La La Land. It's a visual and musical masterpiece that I plan to watch many more times."

"virek213","9","2","2","16 July 2019"," Once Upon A Time In (And Around) Los Angeles
","There are various kinds of reality about Los Angeles and its surrounding environs. One is the decades-long reputation it has of making dreams come true. Another, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is the equally long reputation it has of destroying those dreams. And still another is one where every wacky thing that can happen to any part of the human race, good or bad, does indeed happen: televised high-speed car chases; firestorms fueled by Santa Ana winds; incredible urban flooding; earthquakes; ethnic gang murders; riots; entertainment scandals (especially the latter, because...well, there's Hollywood). But in 2016, a totally unusual film came out that tried (and in many ways succeeded) in restoring a fair amount, if not all, of the reputation that L.A. has of being a proud metropolis. That film was LA LA LAND, a film that became one of the highest grossing musicals in Hollywood history and won a staggering six Oscars.<br/><br/>Beginning with one of the most elaborate opening musical numbers ever staged for any film, done on location at the interchange of I-105 and I-110, the film charts an aspiring jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) who finds his career going nowhere, forced as he is to find gigs in dingy bars and clubs in and around L.A., and being prodded by a friend (John Legend) to adjust to the changing times of the jazz genre. And then there is an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who, in-between casting auditions that also go nowhere, is serving her time out as a barrista to the stars. No one would think that these two disparate souls with dreams that are either being stalled or going in reverse could possibly meet, let alone fall in love. But this being Los Angeles in general, and Hollywood specifically, it does indeed happen.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing ever happens without some kinks. Even as Gosling and Stone find themselves falling in love, they also see their careers finally starting to rise, which in turn leads to their budding romance undergoing as much strain as one of the region's many earthquake faults. Stone is initially not even remotely fond of the jazz music that Gosling parlays his trade in; and Gosling is himself cynical of the acting business and even the approach of Angelinos to life in general (""they worship everything, and they value NOTHING""). Still, in between these foibles and acts of dissolution and disillusionment, both Gosling and Stone engage in wily banter and some of the most incredible musical numbers seen in any Hollywood film (outside of animated movies) for decades, including the wish-fulfilling ""City Of Stars"".<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed the 2014 Oscar-winning drama WHIPLASH, was taking a sizeable risk in making LA LA LAND. He clearly wanted to bring about in the late part of the second decade of the 21st century the same kinds of emotions that one felt in past musicals like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, WEST SIDE STORY, and CABARET, but with something wholly original. But even with more recent box office hits like CHICAGO and DREAMGIRLS, musicals are as expensive to pull off as almost any other kind of film except for comic-book CGI extravaganzas; and some of the biggest ones, even if in the distant past, have been tremendous box office disasters. What Chazelle had going for him here, fortunately, were two extremely appealing leads in Gosling and Stone, as well as supporting turns from Legend, a devotee of old-school R&B and jazz music, and J.K. Simmons (who plays Gosling's boss, and who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in WHIPLASH). And even more to the point, Los Angeles and its satellite cities and landmarks serve as supporting characters themselves: the Hermosa Beach pier; the Griffith Observatory; the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena; the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood; the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena; and the aforementioned I-105/I-110 interchange in South Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Although it is at times a bit emotionally distant, LA LA LAND is still an entirely original musical in which the world, or at least L.A. itself, is the stage and the characters and the region itself all play their parts. This is never the easiest thing to pull off; but Chazelle and company managed to do it, and do it like gangbusters."

","A whimsical show of dance, song and colour will whisk you away into a jazzy fairytale that you simply cannot afford to miss. The 2016 film by Damien Chazelle entitled La La Land, features Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) as the sensational duo that tell the tale of an aspiring actress and a passionate pianist in pursuit of their dreams, and only end up achieving them by way of carefully composed choreography and perfectly penned lyrics.<br/><br/>These two starving artists meet, originally out of hatred for each other, on a congested stretch of highway that catches them both in a sour mood during their morning commute. From this point onwards an unexpected romance is slowly curated beneath the shadow of the Hollywood sign that towers over their home town, as both Mia and Sebastian spend all of their spare time outside of their crummy jobs playing small gigs or auditioning for minor roles, in hopes of catching their big breaks.<br/><br/>The actors, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have an undeniable chemistry that breaches the realms of the screen and enters the hearts of the audience. Emma Stone does an impeccable job of acting the role of an actress; a role that could be considered strange because it is a role that she, herself, would have been in at the beginning of her own career. And Ryan Gosling's passionate performance is enough convert us all into a lover of the soulful jazz scene that his character so desperately wants to become a part of.<br/><br/>The score of this film will delight your ears, the colourful costumes will entice your eyes and the overall storyline will run chills down your spine. This is a film that presents the ability to engage all of your senses, and if you feel at all lost in the pursuit of your own dream, I strongly suggest you go watch this film as soon as humanly possible. I can guarantee it will reignite the spark within you and have you dancing with anticipation to follow your dreams as soon as the end credits roll."

The music written by Justin Hurwitz is simply perfection. This is one of my favourite movie scores of all time. His music creates such complex emotions, with his mixture of happiness and melancholy. This is easily my favourite musical ever made. This is because the characters and drama are not neglected at the expense of the musical numbers. They a both intertwined beautifully. Each element is placed together with so much thought, that it successfully transports the audience into such a deep emotional experience. This film contains so much talent and creativity, that it would be impossible not to give it a 10. I know a fair few people who really dislike La La Land. This movie is not for your average audience.

","The incredible work and vision of the creator Damien Chazelle with La La Land seems to have surpassed expectations and the known problems of putting movie musicals together.<br/><br/>Another Day of Sun
A glaring beginning with song and dance on a crazy hot Los Angelas freeway bridge in the full heat of the day. The first scene opens with dancing, singing, and acrobats setting the whole mood with the first words of the song in the middle of a traffic jam, keeping both your eyes, and ears glued to a scorching bridge over the freeway. Little by little you're given a chance to peak into the lives and circumstances of two struggling creatives who find each other through some very particular circumstances not once, but 3 times. Their personalities seem to collide but they decide that there is an ironically funny circumstance driving them to be together.<br/><br/>Someone in the Crowd
La La Land is a cutely colorful para nostalgic style story that captures the unsaid hunger of those who set out on to make their way to make it in the entertainment business, and get caught in life. Some end up breaking through the bonds of normal expectation and they get a few breaks. Some end up working a low paying job with very few benefits, with just enough money to run from audition to audition for a movie role.<br/><br/>A Lovely Night
In the style somewhat of Fred Estare and Ginger Rogers, the eclectic version of the life of Los Angeles wannabe stars is played out by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. All the scenes in this almost tangible movie musical make you want to be there, you want to see the stars, you want to smell the fresh air, you want to dance and look over the edge of the hill to see downtown Los Angelas in the glowing hue of the sunset.<br/><br/>City of Stars
The solo warm tones of piano with a lonely piano player who meets a great girl brings you into the essence of a romantic interlude appreciating the atmosphere.
Gaslights illuminate the boardwalk pier as Ryan Gosling strolls and sings, offering a true performance of the professional he is. The night seems to sing along with him. He dances his way over the walk as the stars and the night become the best friend of Sebastian, the character he plays.<br/><br/>Let's Start a Fire!
The appearance of John Legend is a surprise that lends to his first debut in a movie with a speaking part. His music was impeccable for the scene. Let's start a fire!<br/><br/>La La Land
Presents to us a fantasy-like reality of Los Angeles dreamers and doers. It's a great movie musical that will stick in your mind for a long time with an eclectic version of original music by an artist like John Legend, and other music written by Academy Award winning composers like Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and more."

It is a really lovely movie."

","When you look at Musicals, as a genre, the train of thought is immediately followed by a cheesy and cheeky end, that you might've seen on any other film. This doesn't have any, this does however contradict logic a couple of times, but movie is meant not to be perfect, but to encourage perfectness. 
I despise Musicals, but now after watching this, I must refute from my claim, partially. This movie has a charm, an aura, beautiful colors, and beguiling melody. 
Jazz, is jazzing throughout the movie, the reverberations, the claps, the beats, the shakes, the chords all blend into unison to concieve a piece as great as this. 
Audio though was a little brittle (don't know if it's universal, or for the theatre I watched in). 
Watch it if you love Musicals, And watch it if you hate them."

","Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) against all odds keep running into each other very often. At first Sebastian didn't pay Mia much attention but Mia felt the energy when she saw Sebastian perform at a wedding. The two are quickly drawn together because they have the very same desire to reach their dream. Sebastian is an aspiring musician and Mia an aspiring actor so they are very much alike in the sense that they have a goal that they aren't pushing themselves to reach. They built a bond and fell in love with one another but there was still the desire to reach their goal of becoming a musician and an actress. Very briefly they both settled on being in a relationship and working jobs just to get by but Sebastian got an opportunity he couldn't allow to pass by. Sebastian joined a band as a pianist with an old friend and had to leave Mia alone. During this time it made Sebastian realize he could still pursue his own dreams and he got the courage to push Mia to obtain her goals. They were faced with the ultimatum of being committed to their relationship or allowing each other to move on so they could give their dreams 100%. In the end they both ended up succeeding in what they love but it meant giving up their relationship. 
The theme is the movie is making sacrifices if that will lead to true happiness. Though Mia really loved Sebastian and didn't want him to go on tour she knew he needed that to feel whole again. Even though that meant being apart from him for long periods of time she was willing to do that so he could reach his dreams. The theme was allowed reflected when Sebastian pushed Mia to go to that audition even though he knew it could potentially end their relationship. They both sacrificed the bond they built so they could find true happiness by chasing their dream.
The movie did a lot of close ups in the film to allow us a more personal experience with the characters. The Film was focused on two main characters so by doing close ups it allowed us to focus on them and block out the background. The videographer also used bright colors to be attractive to our eyes. The film was happy and festive and the bright colors displayed that. The music used was upbeat and allowed us to celebrate the great love they had for one another."

","La La Land is the type of movie I hate starting to watch. It's not because I hate movie musicals; quite the opposite in fact. What I dislike intensely is those films that use the old Hollywood movie genres, like those old screwball comedies or the old musicals as a basis and then proceed to get them wrong (Down With Love, anyone?). That's exactly what I thought would happen with this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. <br/><br/>The film, as well as being visually stunning, is full of characters that you want to spend time with, especially that of Emma Stone. Her character, Mia, is played fantastically. To my mind, this performance from Stone ranks with her best. That's not to say that Ryan Gosling isn't also good, because he is. <br/><br/>The songs, if not completely in the style of the old Hollywood musicals, given the film's contemporary setting, stay true to their essence, and the story is engaging too. Much like Pirates of the Caribbean and The Artist breathed life into long-dead genres, I think La La Land will give those people who don't really give movie musicals a second glance a new appreciation. <br/><br/>La La Land is a delightful modern movie musical, and I'm sorry I ever doubted it."

Emma and Ryan's connection is amazing to watch (as they've done so brilliantly before), and really sells the characters."
"krismancini","8","2","2","19 May 2018"," Majestic, enchanting and delightful... and that's an understatement.
","La La Land starts off with an odd piece- imagine the busiest highway in your city suddenly turning into a sing-along, with everyone dancing outside of their cars. Shortly after that, it bursts into a classic, magical film laced with love, the freight of dreams, and the will to not give up on them.<br/><br/>I was a little bit skeptical at first not having been a huge fan of musicals in the past-- but I was very wrong. It's more of a movie then a musical. The musical, as I think about it, is just the cherry on top of an already brilliant script. La La Land is filled with those simultaneous conflicts between dreams and reality-- hence the singing, and the musical aspect of the film. This makes it for the dreamers and the realists alike.<br/><br/>Do you want to make your dreams come true, but you're dealing with some internal conflicts? Then this movie is for you. If you don't care about dreams, this movie is still for you."
"patalingjugaeron","10","2","2","18 May 2018"," A memorable and fantastic musical masterpiece that pays homage to the classic musicals of old while standing out as unique and making as fresh and new
","As much as Damien Chazelle has impressed everyone with his riveting and compelling direction from Whiplash, it shows that he delivers an authentic, dazzling, compelling and outstanding musical masterpiece that delivers with a heart, depth, and soul. From a brilliant screenplay that resonates everyone with the theme of passion, love, dreams, and inspiration that forms an intimate connection in real life; the powerful acting and its performances, the astonishing and sensible direction until the memorable musical score and pieces, La La Land is truly the embodiment of a classic cinema that nails its perfection from start to finish.<br/><br/>Even the memorable, amazing and wonderful performances of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as well a perfect chemistry, a magnificent choreography and its gorgeous costume and production designs as well a breathtaking and sumptuous cinematography, brilliant editing, and a refreshing and touching musical score by Justin Hurwitz and its catchy musical songs perfectly composed by Pasek & Paul duo makes the experience of seeing La La Land a nostalgic experience, a feast for the eyes and a pleasurable hearing to the ears. <br/><br/>While La La Land draws its inspiration and homages to the classic Hollywood musicals of old, it stands out as a unique musical while making the musical film genre revitalized as fresh and new that also helps inspire other modern-day musical films for years to come and making La La Land as a modern classic for all ages."

","Mia is a barista: she is also an actress with endless unsuccessful auditions, as well as being a would-be playwright. Sebastian is a piano bar pianist with aspirations for owning his own jazz club. They bump into each other on several occasions and a bond starts to form. But in Hollywood the path of love never runs smoothly, does it?<br/><br/>Written and directed by Damien (Whiplash) Chazelle, La La Land tells a well-travelled romantic tale of two ambitious but unsuccessful young people on the foothills of Mount Showbiz. La La Land, by the way, is an excellent title, being a musical reference, a Los Angeles reference, and of course La La Land also meaning ""living in a fantasy world.""<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have already demonstrated their on-screen chemistry, and this is happily maintained here. They sing well, if not strongly, and the dance routines are attractively presented, if not particularly demanding of accomplished dancers. And Gosling is clearly an able pianist, even if his on-screen fingerwork is not always completely synchronised with what we hear.<br/><br/>The film starts very promisingly with a musical number staged on a freeway overpass. There is a strong jazzy/big band feel to a song which moves from a single a capella vocal to fully orchestrated mass vocals (at which point the lyrics to what was a very pleasing song get lost in the mixing). There are several very effective set piece musical numbers: the freeway number, an evening song/dance looking over LA, and a song during an audition, were all standouts for me.<br/><br/>The musical contributions sag somewhat in the middle of the film. The start promises that this will be very much a traditional Hollywood musical, with dramatic beats told in, and punctuated by, song and dance, but we then tend to get musical performances rather than integrated songs. And there is an over-reliance on the main musical theme, the one which you will know if you have seen the trailer. This pops up all the way through the movie in a wide variety of different arrangements and orchestrations. I would have been happier to have heard a more varied range of melodies.<br/><br/>This sounds very negative, yet I very much enjoyed the movie. If you're not a fan of musicals then it's unlikely that this will convert you, but I found the chemistry of the two main players delightful, they both give good performances and perform well musically and terpsichoreally, and Chazelle directs with immense verve and imagination - just look at the camera movement and the unedited length of shots in some of the set-pieces! He must surely get a nomination for this year's best Director Oscar (which, of course, he went on to win).<br/><br/>And, despite the possibility of the ending not being what you may have wanted, the film remembers to be fun."

"alexspencer-60816","10","2","2","15 January 2018"," This movie is all about the ending
","The reason why this has become one of my favorite movies is not just because of the music, the colors, or that it is directed by Damien Chazelle. The reason why I love this movie so much is because of its untraditional ending. The movie is about struggling actress named Mia played by Emma Stone and a struggling musician who wants to start a nightclub named Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling. The movie is about their relationship and how they both have dreams that they are devoted to and both want each other to succeed. Their relationship goes through many twists and turns and that is what I believe jazz represents in this movie. Some of my friends have also seen the movie and always say, ""Oh, it's just a love story with music. I prefer whiplash."" In the movie jazz represents their entire relationship. Jazz is a unpredictable type of music and you never know what will happen next and that is the way Mia and Sebastian's relationship moves. Also in the movie, you see the difference of how Mia's and Sebastian's relationship, compared to their friends relationship. Going back to what I had said before this movie is all about the ending. It is not your classic, ""and they all lived happily ever after."" Each of the characters get what they wanted but they don't end up together it is bitter sweet and not what you were expecting and was definitely not cliche. If this movie ended with Mia and Sebastian together this movie would have just been a cute rom-com, but instead it is something much greater."

"tobyfathom","10","11","20","7 January 2017"," Nothing like it
","This may be the best movie I've ever seen. It brilliantly uses the trappings of 1940's and 50's movie-musicals to make something entirely unique. I have only seen a few of those movie musicals, but this made me want to watch all of them. The movie uses a fairly unique form of nostalgia, so that those who love the old movies want to watch them, but those who don't know the old movies want to track them down. I saw it with a friend who, while he likes stage shows, hates movie musicals, and he loved it. Usually, movie musicals feel like the directors are trying to decompress a stage show, with most of the energy of the stage being lost in the process. This is absolutely not the case with this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with this much energy. This movie also does something that all all fiction should do: it tells a story in a way only that medium can. It uses the locations, the costumes, and the subtle symbolism that would be lost in any other medium. <br/><br/>First, if you can see it on a big screen, do so. I usually wind up checking my watch or looking at the curtains or thinking about something not involving the theater when I see something on the big screen, but not with this one. The format of the big screen is used to its best here. The big dance numbers feel grand, and the quiet character moments feel personal and affecting. This is to the credit of cinematographer Linus Sandgren, who should win best cinematography, hands down.<br/><br/>The direction of the movie is absolutely astounding. There are many sequences without any spoken (or sung) dialogue that are among the highlights of the movie. I don't know anyone who can do show-don't- tell as well as Damien Chazelle. A lot of character is also reflected in the truly stellar costume designer, Mary Zophres. Not only does these costumes look really, really good, but they are an important indicator of character. For example, the costume we first see Seb in clearly shows the audience that he's really into retro.<br/><br/>I would be remiss to review this show and not discuss the jaw- dropping score. The songs are all excellent, with lovely, jazzy melodies by Justin Hurwitz and witty lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. There aren't many of these songs (there's a story reason for that), but they're all gems. I would especially like to call out the final (sung) song, The Fools Who Dream. The melody is somewhat melancholy, but very sweet. The lyrics are witty, with a twinge of sadness. I will talk more about singing and acting later, but this is the song where Emma Stone gives her all. This is also the rare movie where I notice the instrumental score, also by Mr. Hurwitz. It uses recurring themes (or leitmotifs, if you will) absolutely stunningly. Mia and Sebastian's Theme is never sung, but it was one of the songs that I was humming on my way out of the theater. Mandy Moore (no, not that one) takes these tunes and choreographs them with suitably retro sensibilities. This film has drawn many comparisons to Singing in the Rain, and her choreography is a good piece of why. Also, tap dancing. I never get sick of tap dancing.<br/><br/>The actors all knock it out of the park, particularly Emma Stone. The movie is tightly focused on Mia (Ms. Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), but the smaller characters are all good. Ryan Gosling plays this role with elegance and arrogance, prickliness and sensitivity. However, he is eclipsed by Emma Stone. Her role is somewhat underwritten, but you wouldn't realize it unless you were staring at the script. Ms. Stone can express more emotion with a slight movement of her eyes than her peers can with their whole bodies. She takes the character and makes her a person in ways the script really doesn't. I will be absolutely shocked if she doesn't win Best Actress in February. The one point of the movie that has some technical flaws is the singing, but I think it's justified. If you are looking to this movie for Big Broadway Belts, you are looking the wrong way. This movie has a quieter style to its singing that works very well. As for the leads, they aren't perfect, but they suit the material they sing. I did not expect Mr. Gosling to sing like that. His singing voice is very unique. Maybe not the greatest technique in the world, but it's very jazzy and distinct. Ms. Stone spends much of the musical singing in her sweet (but slightly breathy) head voice and falsetto, but, as her final song proves, she can also belt. All of the singing is incredibly expressive. The two leads also have glorious chemistry. Every conversation, every dance break, every glance from across the room is believable, and you want these two together the moment they interact. <br/><br/>If you like musicals, if you like Emma Stone, or if you care about movies, you should absolutely watch La La Land."

","Special opening comment for IDMB.com: Honestly I just wanted to leave my thoughts on the film itself but then I saw the overwhelming amount of positive reviews on this film and praising it like there is no tomorrow. ""Love letter to Hollywood"" Really? In what way is La La Land a love letter? All it does is refer to some classics and then completely botches up the elements that makes us love the classics in the first place. If anything this is making a mockery out of everyone involved in those high quality old school musicals that were made with love and passion. La La Land is made out of greed. You better remember this.<br/><br/>Now I have this out of my system my original review (which you can read on my website Chrichton's World:<br/><br/>La La Land is a tribute to the old school musicals where actors like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and many others impressed us with their acting, singing and dancing. They were top notch in whatever they did on the screen and truly were stars all around. However La La Land is not a particularly good tribute as it lacks a lot that made films like Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris classics.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? First and foremost the musical numbers are far from memorable. When I first heard the song City of Stars I liked it instantly. It easily is the best song but at the same time a very flawed one. Why? Ryan Gosling is not a good singer. I am sure he tried his best but you can hear that he can't sing that well. In another version of the song Emma Stone chimes in and I don't like that version at all because she is even a worse singer than he is. Both also can't dance and it's so bad that it was ruining the enjoyment. You can tell that they are struggling and their movements were far too slow. In the opening musical number you have a bunch of unknown people singing and dancing and they obviously know what they are doing as they move very swiftly and gracefully. They also do a lot of impressive stunt work very reminiscent of what was shown in the older musicals. And while this scene was good it exposed the flaws of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as leads. Especially in the first dance scene featuring Emma Stone it becomes painfully obvious she is not a match for anyone in the opening scene.<br/><br/>Another huge problem is the story. Or lack of. Nothing in the story was remotely interesting and pretty by the numbers and the one supposed conflict was so predictable and forced that destroyed all the hope that was left. What hope? For this film to redeem itself. And it never does. Instead it gives us an ending opposite of what is expected since director Damien Chazelle is pretentious and very full of himself. I guess the fame and success he achieved with Whiplash has gotten to his head. And Whiplash wasn't that good in the first place. And no I don't need predictable endings. What I do need are endings that are logical and are written well. It has to make sense why characters behave and act a certain way. You have to give the viewer reasons to make their actions believable. Chazelle never even attempts this. He only gives a motivation out of convenience. Also I am failing to see how anything in this film could be seen as comedic. There maybe were one or two moments that were genuinely funny but enough for this film to be advertised as a comedy? Not in the slightest.<br/><br/>Also just referring to the classics is not enough. You need to add something of your own to make it unique or entertaining. I mean these songs were the best they could do? At points they showed L.A. in the background and it looked like more was going to be done with the scenery like Michael Mann did in Heat. I think more beautiful shots of L.A. at night would have surely made some impact. But of course that would have required real effort.<br/><br/>I don't feel like writing anymore. Truth be told I was very looking forward to this film since I really was in the mood for some old school fun and all I got in return is anger and disappointment since this film is nothing like the classics.<br/><br/>I do think I have been very fair as this film is advertised as one of the greatest musicals / films in a long time. And this simply is not true. Even with all the good will this film has no redeeming elements whatsoever."

The last two movies, including La La Land, had ridiculously high ratings. Ratings that exceed some of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>While we didn't hate La La Land it certainly doesn't merit a score of 8.9!

","How can anyone claim this film is so compelling? Neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone can sing or dance, and this is a so-called musical. And when either tries to sing, it's painful to watch them struggle with every note. Emma Stone talks through her teeth to obscure her lisp, which is just too annoying to ignore. To put this film in the same league as West Side Story and The Sound of Music is laughable. It's a movie which can't decide exactly what it is, so we're given alternate endings so that you can just take your pick of which one you prefer, a manipulative gesture that demonstrates no confidence in the writing, which is totally lackluster. And it's way too long. Don't bother."

A tissue thin ""tinsel town"" story attempting to pass itself off as a musical. Not a single memorable song, with a nice ""theme"" of half a dozen chords (a few bars even), repeated (almost ad nauseum), and not a suitable vehicle for the actors. Perhaps it would have been better if the singing had been dubbed by professional singers. Sheer self-indulgence by and for Hollywood narcissists, with nothing to redeem it, not even its nod to past real musicals."

","I ventured to my local cinema to see this movie on the basis of a number of excellent reviews by critics and patrons on here. I will admit that a musical is not my normal preference for a movie, but as I love both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and with these reviews in mind, how could I not go and see it? The opening sequence was quite impressive, and I also knew from the start that the cinematography was going to be to my liking old style Cinemascope, with great coloring. Unfortunately that's about where it stopped. The ongoing story line was very weak, and the music was even weaker - its not that Gosling and Stone performed awfully, but Moana has better song list than this. The movie limped along through its two hours, becoming more and more predictable as it progressed.....very disappointing.<br/><br/>I have to really question how this movie could have been nominated for 11 Golden Globes (and actually won 7), when there are movies such as Hell or High Water and Arrival and Nocturnal Animals out there - all of which were considerably ahead of this. My only assumption is that, like The Artist a few years ago, this is a result of a wrist kissing exercise by Tinsel Town - aiming once again to congratulate themselves on how wonderful they think they are. Seriously peeps, whilst its not absolutely awful, its also nothing special, and certainly not as special as this critics are making it out to be. to be."

"st-shot","6","8","14","6 January 2017"," La La starts fast, crawls at finish.
","With its gangbusters intro, appropriately taking place in an LA traffic jam, La La Land looks like it is about to serve notice on the American film musical with an exuberant energy informing the audience it is in for a fun ride. The energy level however begins to waver when the dependence switches from music and dancing to melodrama and the film, divided into seasons (like LA has them) begins to stumble just before Autumn. <br/><br/>Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) first meet in less than amicable fashion on the everyday bumper to bumper existence of the LA freeway. Actress Mia works as a barista on a film lot and spends time off going to casting calls that end in disappointment. Sebastian is a quirky, purist, jazz pianist and his own worst enemy when it comes to being employed. The two cross paths again, hook-up and continue their artistic struggle for recognition. When success knocks on both doors it threatens the future of the relationship. <br/><br/>La La Land offers up a handful of well done musical numbers, imaginative dance scenes as well as a some early comic friction between the leads but the story line remains banal. Director Damien Chazelle attempts to circumvent this by adding some ""what if"" moments to the story to give it more life but it only packs on more minutes to this already overlong musical.<br/><br/>As bargain basement Fred and Ginger the duo offer less than fancy footwork along with pedestrian singing voices but that is part of their charm. Stone at least looks like she is enjoying herself while digging deep enough dramatically to hold some of the films more torpid dramatic scenes together. Gosling is simply a lightweight whose abrasive character offers little to like to begin with and his singing and dancing along with a series of faraway stares grows tiresome by the second half and what started out with the promising chops of another Cabaret eventually degenerates into the mawkish graceless excess of New York, New York."
"Laakbaar","7","8","14","27 December 2016"," Sorta slow. Didn't feel the magic.
","It's very strange to me that I thought Passengers was quite good and La La Land rather slow and boring. The critics saw it the other way around. Disconcertingly, I just don't agree with what the glowing reviews are saying about this movie. I was checking my phone throughout. <br/><br/>I didn't see the magic here. This film didn't blow me away, despite what the critics were promising. I didn't get it.<br/><br/>I won't say that I wasn't moved, because it was moving near the end, and that's always a sign of a good film. I particularly liked the song about the aunt jumping in the Seine. More of this please. However, the people I was with didn't even appreciate this scene. They thought the whole show was a waste of money.<br/><br/>I can see Hollywood as a metaphor for ""following your dreams"". The theme of ""follow your dreams wherever they may lead you"" is a noble one. I loved ""LA Story"", including the surrealist bits but maybe that's because of the character development. I'm into movies, but I'm not particularly into Hollywood. I hated ""The Artist"". <br/><br/>The singing and dancing just weren't that great. The surrealism and overt Hollywoodness here felt cheesy and excessive to me. Did it go too far maybe? Perhaps I wanted more psychological insight, more realistic character development, and less Fred and Ginger. This movie was a little too artsy and contrived for me.<br/><br/>Still, I might see it again, just to try to see what all the critics are seeing."
"piercetownson","10","8","14","27 December 2016"," Here's to the fools who dream.
","Wow, wow, wow. I have now seen this movie twice in theatres and I guarantee it won't be the last.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? I had been anticipating this film for months; the fact that it was written and directed by the same genius that brought us ""Whiplash"", the talented actors involved, the colour palette showcased in its trailers and the name itself: ""La La Land"". It had me intrigued and I am so happy at how it turned out because this film exceeded my expectations and more.<br/><br/>The opening sequence throws you in the deep end and takes your breath away with a statement: ""Prepare yourselves for an experience"". I was locked in instantaneously. The choreography in this film is inventive and never lacking in energy or substance. Chazelle manages to pull off seemingly impossible shots of Los Angeles and has you begging the question of ""how""; able to capture those big production numbers with long swift cuts. Not a moment seemed overlooked or underdeveloped, LA has never looked so beautiful. The editing, the cinematography, the directing is flawless and the movie presents this on a silver platter for the audience; an absolute pleasure for the senses.<br/><br/>Everyone will tell you it's a musical and on some level I agree but I see this film as a romantic comedy/drama with music propelling the story to new heights. The song and dance is so well infused into the narrative they simply whirl together into a delightful cocktail that sparkles with emotion in the form of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Like ""Whiplash"", the sound editing/mixing is superb, timing well with the score (which is mind-blowing). The lyrics are intelligent, clever and takes the audience seriously since it is key in progressing the plot. The production design is stunning and encourages characters to flourish; you feel as if you are dreaming on cloud and yet grounded in reality, simultaneously. A rare, charming film only works when all the clogs link in harmony. This one is clockwork. <br/><br/>The coupling of Emma and Ryan could not be more perfect. They are oozing with passion and charisma and I never doubted their chemistry for one single moment. The actors were able to shine brilliantly and I can see Emma Stone holding an Oscar as she has several powerful stand-out performances from high to low and never fails to surprise, which will cement her as one of the greats; also Gosling is awesome with some excellent comedic lines brought to the table. <br/><br/>One of the most important constructs of a film, if not the most important, is the story you are telling. Is this story original? Not particularly (classic boy meets girl) but the way of telling the story definitely is. The choice to make this a musical love story was risky considering the Hollywood of today is always concerned about making a blockbuster action hit but it paid off. Damien Chazelle has a unique way of expressing his love for storytelling and his love for jazz which sets him apart from a lot of directors today as it opens our eyes to fresh experiences and makes it feel like one of a kind. He is not afraid to play with the tropes that comes with this genre of film and that is daring. I was astonished that the feelings and emotions accompanied with ""La La Land"" were still there the second time around, the movie is full of sensations and is bursting at the seams.<br/><br/>Again, back to Chazelle, the same masterful control of pace and tension that we now come to expect from him is there. Stylistically, the film looks and acts like a classic musical but often we see sudden hints that this is modern day (modern cars, phones etc.) to remind us that this is set in the present. If we didn't have these reminders, the visuals would almost have you thinking that this is based sixty years, or more, prior. The opening of this film had me believing this (old B&W logos, shot in CinemaScope) and it is clear that it's a homage to the classics of which is it inspired but with a twist.<br/><br/>There is scene where Mia says she hates jazz, so Sebastian takes her to witness jazz live and shows her how he hears the music. It is a riveting scene and when Sebastian goes on about how exciting and new and creative jazz is, I can't help but feel that it captures the essence of the film. This, along with the constant prompts of when it is set, the film is aware of what it is and has metaphors embedded within the tale that kept me thinking well after the movie had concluded.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" reignites a fire that had been lost from Hollywood and rejuvenated the romance/musical genre. It's refreshing to see a totally unique film, with surreal visuals and one that grasps the nature of Hollywood and Los Angeles in such an unconventional manner. The film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be. Chazelle steers away from the more clich√©d and predictable ending which might leave some on a slightly bitter note but he had the balls to flip the traditional finale on its head and leave us with strong messages imprinted on our mind; opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of 'follow your dreams' to the idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't a fantasy.<br/><br/>When combining all these elements together, you get one of, if not the best film of the year. ""La La Land"" left me speechless twice - it is one to be remembered and will go down as a classic in the many years to come. <br/><br/>It deserves all the praise it has and will receive. Well done and thank you for this masterpiece."

The acting and writing so good, that the movie seemed a lot shorter than it's actual run-time (around two hours).

It was simply Sebastian's passion (Ryan Gosling) as Mia's (Emma Stone)was acting. <br/><br/>This film has won many awards and deservedly so. It's not by accident that the scores on IMDb, Rotton tomatoes, and metacritic are off the charts. I understand that universal acclaim does not guarantee that one will enjoy this film, as I myself have seen films in the past that were wildly popular that I did not enjoy as much as the majority. But the fact of this films success should grab your attention at least.<br/><br/>I guess what it comes down to is whether you like Musicals with original songs that are actually memorable long after the movies over.

","It's hard to understand how this lifeless musical has done so well at the box office, and swept up so many awards and nominations. The film goes downhill fast after an impressive opening song-and-dance routine on a gridlocked Interstate overpass. As soon as the traffic starts rolling again, this love story between a jazz pianist and wannabe actress gets underway with a prescient gesture. Thanks to interruptions for some undistinguished musical numbers, it takes them almost an hour and several coincidental meetings before they're sufficiently motivated to kick-start their tepid romance. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much glue holding them together, and they soon have an unconvincing argument about chasing their respective dreams. This leads to a brief break-up, followed by a half-hearted reconciliation. <br/><br/>Later it's revealed they parted - presumably because they weren't all that into each other in the first place - but the script doesn't bother to show how this separation occurred. As the narrative approaches its conclusion, LA's infamous traffic congestion facilitates yet another meeting and a final chance to ignite some drama. The biggest mystery is why so many critics and viewers admire this drab love affair between two people who seem unable to communicate either affection or passion."

I tried to give this movie a chance, but it just kept getting worse and worse.

It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie though.<br/><br/>I liked how the opening also had the ""Filmed in Cinemascope"" at the beginning. That gave you that ""old school"" feeling right away. There were many great locations in the movie that make you want to travel to LA and just hang out in jazz clubs. Speaking of Jazz Clubs, I really liked how J.K Simmons had a small role at the jazz club, considering he played a jazz instructor in WHIPLASH. <br/><br/>I really love the chemistry between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). It was such a nod to the old Hollywood classics. Emma is such a wonderful actress and captivating on screen.

"baginman","10","7","12","27 April 2017"," A modern musical classic!
","Unusually for me, I actually had good expectations going in to this movie. I've always loved the classic musicals of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and to see such a film as La La Land hit theatres in this day and age felt like some sort of revival of the long dead musical genre. But the big question is, is there anything under the surface? Is it just a fun musical with great songs, or is there more than just that?<br/><br/>Well, it's with deep pleasure that I can in fact say it isn't just a musical - if anything, it's a good story first, a great musical second.<br/><br/>Yes, I went in expecting a good musical, and to be honest, if all it was was that, I would have no complaints. But this movie took it another level. It had an extra layer that I wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 2017's Beauty and the Beast remake a lot. It delivered, with great songs, and brilliant dance choreography, but let's be honest - if you take all that away, what would you have? It wouldn't be half the movie it was without the musical side of things.<br/><br/>Take La La Land, and you have a movie that would work fine even if you took the musical side of things away. The songs only make it even greater than it would have already have been.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two leads feels genuine and believable. They don't feel like fictional characters. Instead, they feel like real human beings, with real aspirations and real dreams, hoping to prove their worth. As someone with big dreams of hitting it big, this undoubtedly hit to heart with me.<br/><br/>I've heard some backlash from some, people who want to get over critical due to the movie's massive success. Some say it's nothing but an excuse for Hollywood to glorify themselves with much narcissism. Those people completely misunderstood the whole point of this movie. This is a raw portrayal of Hollywood, and the challenge one has to achieve success.<br/><br/>The ending - I dare not spoil it!

"my_lena66","2","7","12","19 April 2017"," Pretty but boring
","I came into this with low expectations. It has managed to surprise me with how utterly boring and awkward it is.<br/><br/>It is beautiful. The shots, the costumes the works. That is one thing he has going for him, and I now completely understand a big reason why I found Cloverfield lane so amusing to watch even though its over the top and weird. He truly has moments of brilliance in setting up a scene.<br/><br/>But as a story and a musical its incredibly boring. The songs are completely forgettable for the most part, the singing is using soft, falsetto voices, making it often difficult to read any emotion from them and in some cases even difficult to understand at some points. The dancing of our stars seems like they are just trying to get the steps right. There's no ease of movement that musical lovers are expecting and are used to. When you take into account that the choreographies themselves are not that grand or impressive, it makes it even more obvious that our stars had no time to think about the emotion of the scene, but were focused on getting the steps right. There's no lightness to it when you compare it to classical Gene Kelly movies for example. It makes it very boring to watch, because there is no chemistry. I found myself more interested in the costumes and the back rounds than the characters.<br/><br/>Its not funny, but its not serious enough either. And Emma Stone is amazing for funny, for me at least. This one didn't get a laugh out of me. It didn't get me invested in the characters either. I think its partly because for the longest time the movie makes us think the characters themselves don't really care, so why should we? And this kind of superficiality would work if the music numbers were more exciting and fun.<br/><br/>There is a reason Audrey H. was dubbed in certain movies, they understood that they needed a strong, clear, big voice.<br/><br/>This movies choices baffle me.<br/><br/>The only reason I can honestly think of this being praised this much is people going along with ''professional critic'' and the movie attracting an audience that hasn't seen musicals before with Emma and Gosling. I could understand how someone who hasn't seen any of the amazing musicals out there, would be in love with this movie. And if this movie inspires them to look those up and see what they are missing, i'll be satisfied."
"pere-25366","10","7","12","26 February 2017"," The stuff that dreams are made of...
","""La La Land"" is the kind of movie that you can't help but fall in love with for the sheer energy that oozes out of every frame, every note and every second its on the screen. It really puts you into an inexplicable kind of trance, you become completely lost in its lust and aesthetic beauty. Director Damien Chazelle, already the youngest winner of the Best Director Award in the history of the Golden Globes, may very well accomplish the same feat tomorrow at the Oscars. <br/><br/>The premise of the film is simple: A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. We've heard it before, but what ""La La Land"" actually creates with a rather hackneyed plot line is anything but unoriginal. In fact, Chazelle deserves a ton of credit for creating a completely original musical, one that bursts with toe-tappingly poetic songs and melodies that will be entrenched in people's mind for a long time. He even pays homage to the more classic films of the Hollywood Golden Age by showing us alternate endings (many films of that era were known to film two endings) but how Chazelle masterfuly juxtaposes the fiction to reality merits an Oscar alone.<br/><br/>Aside from the incredible acting, cinematography and writing, one thing I must comment on about ""La La Land"" is the beautiful jazz score. This soundtrack is near close to perfect, especially for those that adore jazz. It perfectly encapsulates all those idealist thoughts people have when daydreaming about cities like LA or NYC. Have you ever listened to jazz music and, to quote fellow IMDb user ElMaruecan82, just felt nostalgic over a time you weren't even born in? Like ""La La Land"", Jazz has all the elements that pulls you in as a viewer: it has melody, it has harmony, it has rhythm, but most of all, it has soul. And boy, does this film have soul. It's energy is relentless and simply undeniable.<br/><br/>Coupled with the beautiful musical score and exceptionally well written songs (""City of Stars"", in particular, is enchanting) is first-rate acting by Gosling and Stone. Gosling can really do so many roles but where I find him most effective is in his minimalism - he's really one of few actors who can show so much with so little. His subtlety and nuances create such depth and mystery in a character like Sebastien you could find yourself spending hours pondering over what he is merely thinking. Stone was great as well, seemingly effortless in her ability to project a charm and likability. Together, their chemistry was electric; they really just looked like they were having a great time out there (for anyone who says they couldn't dance/sing well).<br/><br/>Honestly, I could go on for days about the magic of this film and this likely won't be the final copy of this review for reasons of continuing to think over and re-phrase my thoughts of the film; I get what people are saying about how the film finds a way to stick in your head. Case in point, ""La La Land"" is the stuff that dreams are made of. And whether you're part of the group that despises the film or not, one can't deny the elegance, style and melodic magic the film possesses, and the ability it has to totally immerse you in all its jazzy glory; and isn't that, by some measure, what any film really aspires to do?"

The film appears to be a random collage from a number of chapters from some cyclopedia about film making.<br/><br/>Being rapidly dragged through diverse genres, heartlessly knitted together, it's hard to get emotionally bound with the story or with the characters in the picture.<br/><br/>I felt like a 1st grade student watching a training movie presenting a sketch of different genre styles.<br/><br/>The base story, a Becoming of Age story, is obtrusively filled with all kinds of styles. I was permanently asking myself: Why is he doing this now? What's his motivation? What's the story's motivation? For example: --- I guess the musical elements where supposed to convey love emotion. But why have the actors been so unemotionally, even dismissively, playing it? --- What's been the reason for taking so much time for conveying that the Mia character is an actress? That fact doesn't add to the story at all.<br/><br/>--- There is an (utterly awesome) long lasting uncut scene. It's a performance highlight. But why on earth is it applied to a negligible chat between lovers? --- Why are all the musical artists depicted in the film so emotionless? I understand the jazz club scene as a reminiscence to the jazz club scene in The Glenn Miller Story. But how dull is the La-La-Land version compared to that? --- Speaking of dull: The score was extremely boring. Cheap jazz licks, carelessly arranged.<br/><br/>--- In the musical scenes I was very much in doubt whether the musical text was meant to be serious or ironic. I was asking myself: Is this a Fourth Wall movie or was this a movie with a story to cling to? All in all, to me the movie appeared to be some kind of a bachelor's academic thesis. And I don't understand what makes the movie worth a nomination for even one single Academy Award."
"oldcarbuff","6","7","12","29 January 2017"," Ordinary beyond belief
","I've always enjoyed musicals, though they've been sadly few and far between in recent years. So, when this came along with great publicity, it seemed a good option to fill a hot Australian summer's day.<br/><br/>There's not much point going into details, this show doesn't merit the effort. Apart from a little reasonable jazz, the musical score is unexciting and the main ""theme"" is both inane and forgettable. So much for it being a musical, it doesn't come close to even the ""reasonable"" musicals of the past (think ""Les Miserables"" or ""Xanadu"") let alone the many Gene Kelly/Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers/Cyd Charisse classics.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad, but neither of the main characters could be considered either an interesting or pleasant person. He is ignorant and ill mannered, while she is a nobody with pretensions. And neither of them ranks as a singer.<br/><br/>Which leaves only the story, and the plot is trivial. Boy meets girl etc.<br/><br/>I scored this as a 6, on the basis that I'd probably sit through this again on TV if there was nothing else showing. But don't waste your money going to a theatre to see it."
"Prismark10","7","7","12","14 January 2017"," The Artists
","Damien Chazelle whose father is French has made a Gallic tinged song and dance musical set in Los Angeles. In some ways it is a modern variant of Singin in the Rain but without the overt optimism which modern life does not have. The film has wowed the critics at the awards season but I think like the film 'The Artist' it might not stand up to scrutiny a few years later.<br/><br/>This is a bittersweet love story between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist passionate about the golden age of jazz and wanting to open his own club to play the type of jazz he wants before it really does go to obscurity. He keeps on bumping into Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the Warner Bros studio lot and goes to endless auditions looking for that big break but only to find disinterested casting agents.<br/><br/>Both of them are looking for that big break but find each other slowly at first, but love may not be enough when these people also crave success. Sebastian finds it first, recording and touring with a successful group which puts their relationship under a strain.<br/><br/>Director Damien Chazelle dazzles with a big opening musical number in a traffic jam on the highway but the energy of that number cannot be sustained. Like many modern musicals these days the songs are anaemic and unmemorable not helped with some of the jazz numbers. The film is right, much of the audience will be put off by the jazz music.<br/><br/>The dance numbers between the pair is meant to be easy going than emulate Fred n Ginger and in some ways it works. Chazelle as in in his previous film Whiplash has found a rhythm to his film. It has a sentiment that individual pursuit for your dreams may be the price worth paying for true love. The story although at times tender as well as abrasive is not strong enough and the film really did feel stretched."

","My wife and I heard good things about this film and went to see it this evening. We loved it. Emma Stone sings, dances and acts her part to perfection. Ryan Gosling is brilliant; and actually plays the piano in this film damn well, especially if you consider he reportedly didn't play at all and practiced 2 hours a day, 6 days a week to provide such a convincing performance. The wonderful music and score, the extensive use of primary colours, the great romantic story; all of them prove that they can make them like they used to. La La Land doesn't get too soppy but it does get under your skin in a nice feel good kind of way. We cannot recommend it high enough and hope it cleans up at the Oscars, especially for the lead performances, writing and best film. I'm looking forward to adding the Blu Ray release to my movie collection."

","La La Land is an amazing film. The cast is excellent. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shine in their roles. They're an absolute joy to watch! The story is pretty good. The whole time I watched the film I thought the story was really good, but not as unique as I hoped it'd be, but then the end came. The end...I have never seen that amazing of a finale in a musical. It totally made the story unique. I even cried at the end. I wished Mia and Seb had ended up together, but oh well! This is one of the best musicals I have ever seen. It's up there with Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music, Grease, Mary Poppins, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, etc. This is an absolutely amazing film. I seriously have no flaws with the film. I love how this feels like a film made in the 1950's or 1960's! It is awesome. The music is my favorite part of the film actually. I think Gosling and Stone have great voices. They're no Julie Andrews, but they're great! The Audition (The Fools Who Dream) song was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen in a film, and definitely my favorite scene in a film this year. The whole entire epilogue is also wonderful. I loved how this film also had a wide range in emotion. I cried, laughed, and smiled! The movie is amazing. Everyone, go see this film! Support it! 10/10 stars!"

In a world where Geo-Politics rules our lives, our food, our homes, the journey was surreal and I was deeply moved. There's nothing more to be said. It's about an experience, gently created, gently stated. Ten out of ten, I highly rate it and recommend for all to see.

"cowboycat88","10","7","12","18 December 2016"," Not an original story but a masterfully told one
","I went to see this by myself today and boy did I cry like a baby.<br/><br/>Being a massive fan of Whiplash, I had huge expectations for this film which were all somehow exceeded. La La Land's tone contrasts strongly with Chazelle's previous masterpiece, but it still has everything from beautiful cinematography, solid script and of course error-less directing. The story has been told thousands of times before (cant say more without spoiling it), but it never once felt like a replication of anything.<br/><br/>What made it special for me however was how real it felt. You might disagree since characters break out singing and dancing all the time, which of course does not happen in real life. The long takes combined with staging and lighting makes it feel a lot more like a musical performance than a movie. But as do all great films, this one brings out each viewer's own personal story and all of its raw emotions.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect. This is the best I have seen from Emma Stone, although at times I still think Ryan Gosling managed to outshine her a little bit.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I cannot write this review without mentioning the scores. From my humble experience with films from the last few years, I would say no one understands music better than Chazelle. Nothing is there without serving a purpose for the story. And damn, he has such good taste!<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what Damien Chazelle does next! 10/10"

","Whiplash was amazing. Anybody who saw it, ranked it in the top 3 of 2014. It had a beautiful end, an out of the box yet known premise. <br/><br/>All I feared with La La Land were my own expectations. I was more than hyped to see it. So when it released on the 9th of December, I grabbed my two friends to catch it on IMAX. <br/><br/>And we were all simply blown away. The acting was top notch, the cinematography will probably win an Oscar. Damien Chazelle, the director is the auteur of our times. His love for jazz comes across even more beautifully this time around.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely an improvement over Whiplash.<br/><br/>It is realistic yet fantasy like. It moves like a butterfly and stings like a bee. <br/><br/>La La Land is nothing short of a modern classic with at least 3 to 4 sequences that will go down in movie history.<br/><br/>And no spoilers, but Damien did it again this time around too with the ending."
"Ramascreen","10","7","12","26 November 2016"," Remarkable! One of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year
","""La La Land"" has the exuberance of ""West Side Story,"" the willpower of ""Dreamgirls"" and the pizazz of ""Grease""s romance. Writer/director Damien Chazelle who rocked our world with ""Whiplash"" a couple of years ago, has done it again. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are a movie match made in musical heaven. I seriously cannot find a single false note with ""La La Land.""<br/><br/>The story is about Mia (Emma Stone) who is an aspiring actress, struggling from one audition to the next, her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet, dreaming of someday running his own jazz club. Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other, but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for Los Angeles the way ""Rebel Without a Cause"" did decades ago, in fact, much of ""La La Land"" is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic. The colors, the look, the design, the tone, even though it's set in present day, the characters could've easily been transported from a golden age era. What an ambitious production, Chazelle's crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when I say that that scene must've been worth the traffic because it's absolutely spectacular. The songs, the music, the choreography are flawless, they're on point, they're upbeat, they take you up to cloud nine. And when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and Ryan Gosling melodiously sings his ""City Of Stars"" song, it's so tender, it becomes your only desired remedy.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had worked together before on ""Gangster Squad"" so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each other's company. The level of trust between them is evident. It must be like returning to a familiar place. One sequence stands out where they dance at the Griffith Park and they're so in sync, you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat. What's even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing, even if you don't like musical, the minute you watch ""La La Land,"" you'll stand up and cheer because the things that Gosling and Stone do will blow your mind. ""La La Land"" is original, it's remarkable, it's one of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year. With this film, Chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time. And the themes hit home. Pursuing your dreams does come with a cost, because it all comes down to whether or not you're willing to give it all you've got. It's so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else. Pursuing your dreams is risky, self-doubt gets to haunt you every step of the way, and failure lurks around the corner. But what's wonderful about ""La La Land"" is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes IN you, just like the way Mia and Sebastian believe in each other, the world be damned.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"
"rbylakx","10","7","12","19 November 2016"," LA LA Land a HOMERUN !!
","Went to see an early screening of LA LA Land knowing NOTHING about this film. It's grand opening of a traffic jammed Los Angeles freeway on a scorching hot day (we've all been there) that leads to a girl singing in her car, to then an amazing choreographed song and dance number with what felt like 100 singers and dancers all performing on this freeway (no CGI), just blew me away. There were MANY times throughout this film where I went, ""How'd they do that?"" and ""That was amazing!""<br/><br/>No story spoilers, but Ryan Gosling's character of Seb (a musician) and Emma Stone's character of Mia (an actress) were perfect in their roles as starving and striving artists trying to make it in their professions. Regardless of the fact these two soul mates are perfect for each other, the real life struggles of juggling their love for one another and their career dreams hits home in a big way.<br/><br/>Major kudos to Whiplash director Damien Chazelle. He has hit another homerun, and had us singing along as we all rounded the bases."
"dave-mcclain","8","14","29","20 October 2016"," ""La La Land"" is a wonderful and refreshing, but imperfect film.
","In real life, most people don't randomly break out in song and dance, but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture. Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical (1929's ""The Broadway Melody""). Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals, but they never went away. Some of the best-loved musicals in film history (e.g. ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"") came out in the 10-year span 1944-1953. But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals: ""West Side Story"", ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Oliver!"" (all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s), ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Grease"" and ""All That Jazz"" (1970s), ""Victor/Victoria"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" (1980s), ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Lion King"" and ""Evita"" (1990s) and, in the early 2000s, ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Frozen"", ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Chicago"", which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture.<br/><br/>2016's ""La La Land"" (PG-13, 2:08) is the purest original (non-adapted) live action musical in many years, and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002's ""Chicago"". ""La La Land"" was written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who was the writer-director of 2014's ""Whiplash"", which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film. This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle's previous collaborator, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics by the award-winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul. Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies ‚Äì 2011's ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and 2013's ""Gangster Squad"". And, yes, they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical's story of romance, dreams and hope. It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback - like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear.<br/><br/>The film's title has a dual meaning: (1) referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and (2) the city of Los Angeles itself, where most of the action takes place. In fact, the film opens with a song-and-dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid-locked L.A. highway. At the very end of that scene, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Stone) has a random, brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist, Sebastian Wilder (Gosling), who acts like a real¬Ö pianist. The two run into each other again in Sebastian's jazz club, immediately after he's fired by the club owner (J.K. Simmons) for insisting on playing his own music. Sebastian is no more polite this time. The two finally ""meet cute"" and before long, Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian.<br/><br/>Neither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is a wonderful movie, but not, as some reviewers would lead you to believe, flawless. After three contentious encounters, the two main characters just suddenly fall in love, a development that isn't very well earned by the script or the acting. Otherwise, the performances are excellent (especially Stone's) and the script is funny, poignant and grounded¬Ö except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song. But when they do, those songs are both fun and touching. The dancing, however, seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film. Having said all that, I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective: This is a very entertaining and affecting movie. You'll likely be emotionally invested in these characters, smile a lot ‚Äì and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack. For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today's films, this one is a gift. ""A-"""

"owenchou","10","6","10","3 May 2017"," This is a musical/romance movie about an actress and a passionate jazz pianist
","I was actually really looking forward to this film when it came out because Damien Chazelle's Whiplash was actually one of my most favorite movies of 2014 and naturally I was pretty excited for this. And i'm very proud to say, this instantly became my most favorite movie of all time. This film is a masterpiece. It contains beautiful cinematography, excellent dancing choreography. Usually in a TV show or a movie, in my opinion, what truly stands out to me is that an entire sequence is done in one take or looks as if it were one take. And i'm happy to day, La La Land has many one take scene in which the cinematography is done extremely well. Wait did i mention the soundtrack, because my god, the soundtrack is perfect. I seriously gotta give major props to these cinematographers that work behind the camera as well as Justin Hurwitz for composing such a beautiful soundtrack. But what truly blew me away was the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian. They both struggle in life in which Mia constantly gets interrupted in her audition tape and struggles to find a role in a film and Sebastian wants to open a jazz club in a time period where jazz is dying. He then joins a band and with john legend's character but their style of music is not what Sebastian enjoys. One of the best scenes in this film is when Mia accuses Sebastian of abandoning his dreams of opening a jazz club. It was at this moment, you finally understood the message that Damien Chazelle was trying to convey throughout the movie it is that you should never give up your dreams just because you fail. This message is truly inspiring and is also a message to all of the young people out there that is passionate about their dreams. Now let's talk about the final audition for Mia's character. This scene was handled extremely well with beautiful long take shots, excellent vocals and lyrics from Emma Stone, as well as giving a heartfelt message to the fools that dream. This scene alone deserves an academy award for best actress and thankfully, Emma Stone won best actress. In the end, I find this movie to be extremely satisfying and also reminded me of films of the 1980s. The way this movie ended is a great throwback to the style of filmmaking back in the days."
"videoswithian","10","6","10","25 April 2017"," Being a fool who dreams....
","There comes to be some difficulty when creating a modern film. Certain expectations have been set, and the job of a filmmaker is to either meet or defy them. La La Land does just that, and in the most brilliant of ways. What Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling bring to the table is one of the things this film does right. Their chemistry and sense of humor play a part in why La La Land will be able to be repeatedly watched. The soundtrack gets better the more times you listen to it on Spotify, and songs will never leave your head (in the best way). The thing that absolutely stands out about La La Land, however, is its ability to display the utter truth of life...some dreams have to be postponed or completely dropped in order to make room for the others...while still delivering the message that dreaming is one of the most important aspects of life. And with all that being said, I wholeheartedly smile every time it is mentioned. La La Land will always remain near the top of my favorite motion pictures."

","I dragged my gf to watch this film, and both of us left feeling a bit 'so what...' I can't critisise a film because they do great great marketing, but the Oscar nominations obviously mean something and I cannot see why the committee thinks so highly of it. I was thinking about films to compare it with and the nearest was Pretty Woman which is head and shoulders better. So why? The two leads showed very little chemistry between them, both of them seemingly only half-interested in life; drifting from scene to scene. The filming has a very studio-lot feel about it, slightly artificial and cartoonish. (I'm sure that's what they wanted, it just seemed weak.) And the music has virtually no memorable numbers. I so wanted to like this film, but..."
"sammi_lennon","5","6","10","7 February 2017"," Sorry Should be retitled Blah blah Land...
","What I liked: Ryan Gosling - what's not to love about such a talented, endearing, genuinely gifted actor who is also so gloriously easy on the eye? Emma Stone's portrayal of a would-be starlet Mia is both believable and engaging. The cinematography, though far from innovative definitely compliments the plot providing an essential dynamism and facilitates a colourful landscape upon which the story sits comfortably. The films score is irrefutably blatant in its repetitiveness yet none-the-less befits the plot and, at times is both heart rending and catchy. The plot, while hardly novel in concept (rather, a mulch of countless 'let's make it big in Hollywood' films of the past) still manages to command interest....I didn't fall asleep. Indeed, I felt myself rooting for the film and experienced an overwhelming keenness for it to realise success.....? What let it down: Both Ryan and Emma are certainly accomplished young actors who are completely lovable and engaging. So much so, dear reader, that I am almost ashamed to lament that neither can really sing.... So let's be real now, how can one hope to deliver a seminal musical piece if the lead characters 'pipes' don't cut the mustard? Add to that a distinct lack of chemistry between 'him and her' (re-examine their on screen kisses...the passion just ain't there?), an overly repetitive score, a far too obvious plot line, weird (are they on acid?) scenes that simply don't fit and far, far too many 'lulls' in the plot line (where many people in the movie theatre started chatting or going to the toilet etc) and you're left with a film that sadly, can only be described as average. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Hollywood is so desperate to resurrect a time honoured 'musical' tradition that it has blindly bought in to La La Land desperately touting it an exemplar of musical excellence for the millennium when in truth, the film offers little more than a pedestrian jaunt along a lane oft tread (albeit doing so with significantly less pizzaz than its predecessors). <br/><br/>If I'm honest however, I must attend to the question of why I harbour so much guilt at leaving such a disconsolate review... Perhaps I am missing a trick? It is possible that this is a film that warrants a second watch or a particular kind of viewer to really get it. I advise you to watch it and judge for yourself!"

Again ... appreciate the effort.<br/><br/>The songs didn't really tell or move the story along (aka Grease)and I found myself dozing during them.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie a 2 but the last 5 minutes at least delivered a satisfying ending.....and big plus.<br/><br/>Watch this one at home where you can fast-forward through the dance numbers after you have had enough of them."

Hollywood is drooling over the Chinese these days at the thought of them financing more and more of our movies, and this one in particular is like a musical promotion of the the US film industry.<br/><br/>As for the film, while it had good acting, directing and cinema-photography, it had no memorable musical numbers and had a lousy ending combing elements films ""The Way We Were"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""

However, even though we thought the movie was cute, we noticed right away that it was not even close to wonderful. The singing voices were so-so and the acting and dancing were okay but not Academy Award material. We both did think the ending was a unique idea giving us both a look at something new but not enough to gain the whole move as award winning material. We did think the opening number was quite spectacular and are still trying to agree on how they accomplished it.

The songs are okay - but I did not leave the cinema humming with any one of them stuck in my head and the dance routines are again - okay. If the leads could really sing and dance more could have been made of this okay material. But the fact is while the voices are on pitch and in rhythm and the steps are all in the right place and time, neither of the performances infused any excitement.Contrast their dancing with the opening ensemble dance and song - danced by dancers. I did not feel there was much chemistry between the characters. In summary this was not the Hollywood musical reborn, rather an adequate homage to the genre."

","La La Land is simply one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Coming from someone whose favorite movie of all time is Black Swan, I tend to like darker movies, but this more romantic movie blew most movies I've seen in my lifetime out of the water. At the surface, it's a simple boy-meets-girl love story, but the real magic lies in the artistic direction. I came into this movie expecting a lot due to Chazelle's previous work of art, Whiplash, and I left the theater absolutely satisfied. The way the visual effects, music, and dance play out in this movie make it the masterpiece that it truly is. Emma Stone is the perfect amount of quirky for the lead female role, while Ryan Gosling is the perfect amount of dapper for the lead male role. The two have GREAT chemistry on-screen.

The soundtrack is enchanting, Justin Hurwitz delivers the most memorable tunes of the year, City of stars being my personal favourite. Mia and Sebastian's theme and The fools who dream vocals by Emma Stone standout.<br/><br/>After delivering Whiplash i certainly expected a lot out of Damien Chazelle and he doesn't disappoint one bit.<br/><br/>La La Land can be deemed as One of the greatest musical of this generation and the most Romantic movie of 2016. Go and give into the magic, you won't be disappointed."

","It's a good film, but definitely overhyped. It's a love story about LA that is all-too-true for many people who move there and seek their fortunes (and fame).<br/><br/>3.5/5. Good to watch once. No more."
"babybuddhaiscool","1","9","17","6 March 2017"," So bad that I had to watch Singing in the Rain again to remind myself what a good Hollywood movie should be like.
","What an over-hyped musical! I love musicals from stage to screen, but this one is really one of the worst I have ever seen. Apart from the camera work, I can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie. Bad cast, bad music, bad storyline, NOTHING to hold my interest. I just kept forwarding the movie for the more ""interesting"" parts and then found myself forwarding again after one minute or two.<br/><br/>Honestly I haven't seen a Hollywood movie in ages, but I thought I'd give this one a chance after hearing so many positive reviews. Turned out they were all hype, all outright lies. I am done with the media and sheeple society."

","""This is a dream: it's conflict, it's compromise, and it's very very exciting. Here's to the ones who dream."" La La Land is A True Definition of Cinema. Here's my thoughts about this magical movie:<br/><br/>I'm in love, like really in love with this movie, because LA LA LAND is a movie which has reinforced my belief in the power of dreams. The first five minutes is like a great appetizer before you get the better main course, ONE SHOT DUDE COME ON. Gosling performance is ridiculously good, but Stone has never been better like this before (the Audition scene, GOD). Chazelle's direction is a gift for cinema, he know how to treat a scene and end a movie (Whiplash, remember?), thank God he's not one hit wonder director. Justin Hurwitz needs to get more recognition, his work is a fine art and I think people will always talk about the music of LA LA LAND. The shots and coloring is a masterwork and a feast for your eyes, bow down to Linus Sandgren and Natasha Leonnet. The final 15 minutes and the epilogue scene is breathtaking. Yes I cried, my soul left my body during this sequence because hit me on so many levels, it's so beautiful and charming and emotional.<br/><br/>It's a love letter for people like me who adore everything about cinema, jazz, Hollywood, stunning visual, Los Angeles, musical, and dreamers. LA LA LAND made me nostalgic and yearn about something I've never experienced before, and I want it more than ever after watch this movie. Recommended to everyone who give up to pursue passion for the arts, because this movie celebrate the dreamers among us (except the pessimistic and cynical ones). Bittersweet brilliance, an instant classic, an homage to the classic era of Hollywood musical, and 2016 antidote for sure.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time a movie made me feel this way, deepest thanks to all who created LA LA LAND, especially for Chazelle and Hurwitz for this ambitious project, I love you both.<br/><br/>I can talk about this movie all day long, seriously. Please do watch this one in theater, I will drag everyone I know to watch this blissful magical movie, I can't recommend it enough. Last thing to say, if you don't enjoy LA LA LAND, probably you don't deserve to be happy."
"nimdude","10","9","17","5 January 2017"," Pure... emotion
","It's very obvious that this movie is made with the utmost passion for both films and music. I found this movie to be enthralling and perfect. I cannot specify how much I loved this movie. Did I mention that I loved this movie... well I do. Unlike a lot of people I talk to I have no problems with musicals and I quite like them. I'm going to make this short and sweet and try to list all the perfect things about this movie.<br/><br/>Since it's a musical I feel I should mention that the songs, singing and dancing were absolutely flawless in execution. I especially adored ""Fools who dream"". <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of both leads and in my opinion this was a career best performance by the gorgeous Emma Stone and another brilliant performance by Gostling. Their chemistry was 100% believable and they were very ""cute"" together.<br/><br/>The plot itself focuses a lot on passion and dedication to that passion. It tries to make people want to achieve their goals and follow their dreams in an active way.<br/><br/>Directing and cinematography were absolutely beautiful. I was born in L.A. so this movie made me very nostalgic and it showed the sort of ""artistic"" side of L.A. and I loved it.<br/><br/>It is a gripping experience but I would recommend watching this with a significant other. 11/10"

","Linus Sandgren is a true genius!!! Thanks for a great movie. Looking forward to meet u in London How is Betty and Lucy Please write back Go Linus Go Linus Great<br/><br/>Hugs Bingo<br/><br/>Please read this<br/><br/>In his first film since 'Whiplash,' Damien Chazelle stages a lavish song-and-dance musical that dares to swoon the old-fashioned way, with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as L.A. dreamers.<br/><br/>There was a moment back in the 1970s, sometime before ""Grease"" came out, when the image of people bursting into song and dance in the middle of a motion picture wasn't simply corny and antiquated; it had come to seem downright strange. Not any more. Our era is immersed in retro musical culture, and it has been for a while √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù from the visionary postmodern pop swoon of ""Moulin Rouge!"" to the online resurgence of music video to the high-camp a Capella sincerity of ""Glee"" and the ""Pitch Perfect"" films. So what does it take to make a musical today look unabashedly exotic?"

","This film is my funniest , all the people are singing and dancing .I liked the music, the principle actors had a beautiful voice and they had a special and different characters. I loved their costumes.
But, this film is very long ,I was boring to watch all the series, there are some videos that have no meaning and importance. I was not existed to see the end because it took years to finish it , I think that all see that.
This film has two sides but the majority is good and beautiful."

"Luigi Di Pilla","3","5","8","4 June 2017"," Somebody could explain why it won six Oscars?
","Fortunately I have got this DVD as a gift from a family member and I didn't spent one cent for this boring musical. I waited with my wife thirty minutes and still didn't happen something really interesting. There is no substantial story or any suspense. <br/><br/>I am asking how if is possible that this one got six Oscars. Thrown away instead of giving these to better films that have been done last year. I cannot believe it but it confirms that I am right to not watch the Oscar shows. It is not the first time that a boring movie got so many Oscars and I am not wondering. I highly recommend it if you cannot sleep because I assure you that after some minutes you are falling asleep. 3/10"

This film was predictable at every turn, the characters had little to no chemistry and on top of that the plot stood almost still.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the settings and costumes where a delight. If you like jazz, the music is solid. The casting were good.<br/><br/>All in all, it was boring."
"drkdsm-1","3","5","8","14 May 2017"," Pure waste of time, Bollywood produces far better musical intricate love stories
","This is my first review of any film on IMDb. I saw this film as it has won multiple Oscars and the story showed some premise. I had not seen the trailer. After watching the movie, I was like why I wasted my time on this. I should have gone to watch Meri pyari bindu, heck, even OK Jaanu was way more fun and better love story than this. Bollywood really knows how to make love stories, specially the intense ones. Westerns often bash Bollywood movies for their music and dance numbers (which according to them erupt spontaneously). Then, what was in this movie! Some melodious songs, some over the top dance steps! There is recent trend in Bollywood movies to incorporate the songs with the story-line so that it is not a hindrance in the progress of the story (watch ""dangal"" for example). My final words are if this movie can win Oscar than heck 25% of Bollywood movies also can. If any of you really liked this movie due to the ""music-dance-love story saga"", you are gladly invited to the world of Bollywood."
"noonoonomore","3","5","8","16 April 2017"," It coulda been OK if it wasn't for all the hype and expectations, but not now
","I usually don't use the word ""the worst"" to describe a movie, but sometimes you have no other choices.<br/><br/>The opening reminded me of those stupid teen songs of today's that give me goose bumps outta disgust whenever I accidentally see them on TV, the story is boring and worn out, the music is forgettable and it gave me a headache that I won't be able to study tomorrow, the dancing is an uglified Singin' in the Rain and the performances are mediocre except for Emma's who also didn't deserve to win and a nomination was enough, for Isabelle Huppert was so perfect in Elle the award was hers and hers only. The only thing worth watching in this movie was the cinematography.<br/><br/>It could've been an OK average movie if it wasn't for all the hype but after the built up expectations it's one harsh slap in the face when you finally sit through it waiting for something extraordinary."

It is an absolutely wonderful film with the audience, the music, the audience and the audience. Emma Stone should definitely have an Oscar this year. Because you watched a great movie.

I do not understand why it is acclaimed and why it got the golden globe. Of course I have to write 10 lines of text, and I will try just to be able to express my disappointment with this movie. I do believe that there is something really wrong with these movies, it brings back a memory from an Oscar two years ago (I think) when another weird movie got the best movie. It was The Bird man. No one liked, no one spoke about it, no one even remembers it. It appears to me that the academy jury like to vote for movies about themselves movies about actors and acting. That a closed circle, without connection to the rest of the world."
"ancacupsa","6","5","8","19 January 2017"," Another Titanic
","Another lost love story. People that know me, will confirm that I maybe don't know to cry, but this movie really touched me, if I knew how to cry, this was my moment!! She didn't say hi!?!?! WTF?!?!?<br/><br/>Is definitely a sad movie, and probably his purpose is to remind us, the humans, how stupidly we choose money and a job over love, the feeling that many pretend is the focus of their life. It is sad to forget what is really important and lose someone over a job choice. I find it painful to have the ""what if"" in your shoulders, but again we all have a different understanding of what happiness means. The first part of the movie is quite slow, so be ready to give it a chance, it is worth it! Is not much auction there, but again you know you're going to a romance.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that the story started and ended in winter, like the two main characters probably where feeling. He, hitting the rock bottom, trying to find a way to make some money without giving up on his dream, and she is training to keep her smile up while at every single audition is rejected and ignored. The beginning remind me of Bewitched, they keep running into each other like they were supposed to be together. The moment the movie starts you will think they hate each other so much they have to be together! Is like they are made for each other which by the half of the movie the story line proves you were right they do belong together<br/><br/>La La Land is a triumph on so many levels, and hopefully a lesson for many single people to think twice before they decide their life. This guy give up his career, because she asked to, and she.... She didn't say hi!?!?! WTF?!?!?"
"DavidYZ","1","8","15","7 May 2017"," The critics are wrong - this is an awful film
","I personally know many people who've seen this film - and all of them hate it. Every other review I've written is based on my own viewing - but I'm making an exception for this dreadful film. It sounds so bad that I haven't seen it and am repeating what they said - rather than subjecting myself to the hell of watching it.<br/><br/>Here are the problems with this film:<br/><br/>a) It's boring - especially in the middle. It's far too long for its content.<br/><br/>b) Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are mediocre at singing and dancing. Good singing and dancing are essential in a musical film. <br/><br/>c) Gosling's character is an arrogant snob who thinks that anyone who doesn't love jazz is beneath him.<br/><br/>d) Stone's character lacks a personality.<br/><br/>e) It's too unrealistic for anyone to take seriously as a romantic drama.<br/><br/>f) There's nowhere near enough humour for it to work as a comedy.<br/><br/>The critics and fans don't address these bad points. They don't deny them - they just ignore those faults or claim that they aren't a problem."
"Poochface","5","8","15","5 January 2017"," Banal and Superficial
","La La Land . . . what can I say about La La Land.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that I love musicals (I can't wait to see Sing). I love music documentaries even if I don't like the artistes (yes Oasis, I'm looking at YOU) or even if I haven't heard of the band (Anvil: The Story of Anvil) and I adore films that feature great tracks such as Sing Street or films that feature tracks by the Rolling Stones or The Boss. But La La Land plummets to new depths of banality and superficiality. In fact the title sums it up ideally. The only time it perked up is towards the end.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone do well in their roles but they can do better. The singing and dancing is nothing special and should not be compared to the magical musicals starring the likes of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers etc<br/><br/>I do not understand all the Oscar buzz, in fact if this wins the Best Film Oscar I will scream my little head off.<br/><br/>Whiplash was wonderful but Damien Chazelle has not made a comparably decent follow up. In fact, the woefully underused J.K. Simmons should have thrown a cymbal at his head whilst screaming ""this is dragging"". 5/10"
"andrewmalan","10","8","15","1 January 2017"," The Best Cinematic Experience of My Life.
","I've seen quite a few movies, especially the ones that appear each year in award nominations, so I feel like I have a decent perspective. I remember Whiplash and loved it, and when I saw that this film was from the same creator, I got excited. After I watched the trailer months ago, I shared with probably everyone. I waited months for it to finally make it to theaters. <br/><br/>I saw it right after Christmas and I had high expectations and was a little worried that wasn't going to meet them. But forget that. La La Land exceeded those far and away. I'm not a 'movie critic' so I won't try to use the fancy and eloquent review style of writing, I'll just tell it like it is. <br/><br/>This movie is the most beautiful thing I've seen on screen, and quite possibly the most beautiful piece of performance art I've ever seen too. It's beautifully shot, the music is incredibly addictive and full of emotion, the story is timeless, and the acting (especially from the leads) is absolutely outstanding. Thank God these two ended up in these roles, because the chemistry and character of the two is simply perfect. <br/><br/>La La Land takes you on an incredible roller-coaster that's beautiful in every way. Technically, the film is a musical, but don't let that turn you off (if that's not your thing). It makes the story twice as good. There aren't too many musical numbers and each of them is incredible, as well as important to the story. I love musicals, so that probably helped, but the point is, you're going to love this one. You fall in love with the characters, with the music, with the story, and this movie will affect you. Each of us can relate to La La Land, and the film makes me want more out of life, but at the same time it gives an incredible experience just watching it happen."

","This is a stunning beautiful film that stars Emma Stone as an aspiring actress in Los Angeles that falls for a young jazz pianist played by Ryan Gosling. They dance and sing around l.a hot spots and it is magnificent to watch. Especially a tap dance number they do in front of a Los Angeles sunset. So many of the musical numbers are so well choreographed and beautifully done. The acting is terrific Emma Stone is magnificent it feels like her story when she was young struggling to try and make it as an actress and really trying her best to become a star.You can feel her struggle to succeed. Also Gosling has a real love for jazz and feels that is dieing and wants open his own jazz club. This film has feelings of nostalgia and a dreamer quality of wanting to succeed in the arts and doing what it takes to follow your passion. The film is beautifully directed by Damian Chazelle who also did the awesome Whiplash which i loved. The music was great every scene had me just smiling the whole way through. L.A looks beautiful in this film. This is the best film of the year and will win best picture at the Oscars. 5 stars"

"ozdemiroktaytuna","9","3","4","5 June 2019"," The First and the Only Film Which I Actually Had Cried While Watching.
","Well, I have IMDb for a long time and I am using it consistently but I had never written a review. At first I was skeptical about musicals but while I was watching Aladdin in the theaters, even though the musics weren't that great, I discovered that I can love musicals. I love Emma Stone as an actress and I was truly amazed by her performance in Netflix Series Maniac. After I searched her in IMDb, I found out that she won an Oscar from La La Land so I started to watch it. Man, it was beautiful. The cast, the plot and the conflict it was beatiful. Conflict wasn't cliche as being in love with another boy or girl, the conflict was just a simple disagreement between couples and all couples are, at some point of their life, having this problem in their life. I loved how they fell in love at the beginning of film unlike other films which involves love(happy ending) in the end of the movie. The perspectives help us to emphatize with both of the characters and the songs were pure magnificent. I expected that ending will be like this but it still broke my heart. The director and writers did a wonderful job by just showing what would happen if Mia and Sebastian are together and at that moment, I just cried. I don't know why but it just broke me.<br/><br/>Still this movie has problems in it. The film is stating that Mia and Sebastian had never seen them again which is kind of dumb because they were still lovimng each other and the distance is not an obstacle for love and from Mia's perspective I saw that she adapted really quickly, after 5 years she had found a man who she loved enough to marry him and after that she had two kids. She became so famous in 5 years but she was at least 18 months pregnant for two kids and adding the care to newborn children it became 30 months(2.5 years). So in just 2.5 years she became so famous and considering one film is made in about 1.5 years, it is kind of weird. Even she became famous, she had to find her love in just one month which id also opposite to her love to Sebastian.<br/><br/>I really wanted to give this movie a 10 but I didn't like how and why they had seperated but it still had put lots of tears on my face.<br/><br/>(This is my first review, I am under 18 and I am not a native English speaker.)"

","I saw this at the cinema on its release. As we walked out, myself and others were heard to mutter ""certainly NOT a musical, so what was it all about"".<br/><br/>To classify it as a musical is a misnomer. One or two production numbers and the same musical number played over again, doth not a musical make. The scene where Gosling and Stone attempt to dance on a hill overlooking LA was absolutely cringeworthy for any real dancers watching - and really ? does she happen to have her tap shoes with her after leaving a party ? just watch that scene closely again.<br/><br/>No, it was far from 'awesome', although clearly Ryan Gosling worked hard at learning the piano, so must be commended for that.<br/><br/>Not a film I would want to sit through again, but this is the only place I can vent my spleen or be generous with praise, as I cannot be bothered with social media !!!"

","La La Land is an epic romance tempered with reality. It's about two people trying to make their dreams come true in Hollywood and how much their willing to sacrifice along the way. Along with great music and choreography, the story ranges from hilarious to heartbreaking. In spite of it's bittersweet undertones, there's a lot to love about La La Land. For those who were left bewildered by the ending, here's some clarification so you won't be left scratching your head. (The following is not a spoiler but references the last scene.) The final musical montage was how Seb imagined his life might have been if he'd given up on his dreams.

"isaacglover_05","10","3","4","9 February 2018"," Heaven Forbid! A Movie? Different from other movies?
","It's as if people nowadays just want to see a movie that sticks to a formula that is so overplayed and cliche and predictable. 
Is it so hard to enjoy a movie that is both mainstream and different from the movies that everyone has seen so many times. 
Usually in a romantic comedy movie it plays out like this:
1. There's a boy and a girl
2. They are so different and have different ideas and values that there's no WAY that they can be compatible
3. Turns out they can be
4. They start to slowly fall in love despite their differences
5. Their differences all of a sudden causes an argument. This is what makes the movie reach its climax
6. The couple splits up, seeing different people that are more suited to their values and beliefs
7. Turns out they miss each other
8. They fall in love. THE END<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT FORMULA. It is such a beautiful and at times heart wrenching film about a boy who is an ambitious jazz musician and a girl who is trying to make it as an actress and they fall in love! But their dreams and goals puts their temporary La La Land phase to the test.<br/><br/>It's a real movie about real people and real things happen to them! There's no big fight sequence to make the movie interesting. There's no Deus Ex Machina that makes everything OK. It is about these characters who are trying to reach their goals, and in doing so they end up parting ways! 
And this is what seems to make people get super mad about the movie. The happy ending is not what the viewers had in mind. It drives away from that typical and cliche ending and goes somewhere that not many film makers dare to go. This is the primary reason to the movie's gorgeousness and realness. <br/><br/>On top of that, the cinematography is enough to make you cry! There are some amazingly shot scenes that just take your breath away. 
Ryan and Emma are absolutely stellar. They have such an amazing on screen chemistry that it makes their doomed ending all the more heart breaking. 
The music is another things that makes this movie so different. It's jazzy, it's sometimes bluesy, it is a genre that is not common in modern musicals. Modern musicals are so poppy and generic and something that has been seen time and time again. So this movie moves away from that tackiness and that's why it gets hated? So STUPID! <br/><br/>I could go on and on about why this movie is perhaps and absolute triumph in 2016, but there is no point as a lot of the special snowflakes who try to hate mainstream movies will thumb this review down."

","I've come here to write a preview and my feelings while watching this movie. Some people might not like this movie and they be like :""it's a musical movie, so lame... it doesn't deserve any award.."" or something like that. Well, I'd like to say, yes it's musical, and yes it's about love story, but this love story doesn't lame and it shows us how real life's love story looks like. The music and the lines are beautiful, and again, some people don't think so because musical movie is not their type. The meaning is so beautiful, at the end of the movie, we'll see reality's love. The fact that we have to choose between love and our passions, and how young when we fall in love with someone. I recommend you to watch La la land, but if you don't like musical or ""allergic"" to this type, then you shouldn't watch it. The IMDb of this movie is not low, but that doesn't mean everyone can enjoy it."
"saneman1","3","3","4","16 September 2017"," How can it be a great musical without good songs?
","You don't need a great voice to carry a musical. But you need to have an interesting voice. A lot of the old time musicals pretty much had the likes of Gene Kelly, and others have songs tailored to their limited range as singers. Even the silly Mamma Mia which suffered from cringeworthy screenplay and Pierce Brosnan's earnest donkey braying benefited from the rich catalog of songs and performers immersing themselves into the songs no matter how bad they sounded. Rocky Horror Picture Show made better use of the voices of non singers like Sarandon and even though Rocky Horror was never considered Oscar worthy , it actually has much superior songs to more lauded movies like La La Land. <br/><br/>LaLaLand is just flat out lacking in even semi memorable songs with great melodies. And even the non musical sequences are drab and stilted in the beginning of the movie which kind of makes you impatient right off the bat. The first half hour, there is only one semi compelling scene where Emma Stone is auditioning for a role. So it puts you in a mood not to give this movie the patience it probably needs. <br/><br/>The first scene that grabs my attention is the pool scene with the 80s cover band by an overeager cheesy singer who entertained me more than the other singers in the movie. Then the movie descends into mediocrity again where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a duet where the song does their voices and our ears no favor. Ryan Gosling's voice comes across as a bored half hearted rendition after someone just woke him up in this song. At that point, I just gave up on the movie and watched the rest of it as I did other stuff. <br/><br/>Emma Stone had a better mini musical with her funny SNL skit(Les Jeunes de Paris) set in a french coffee shop than what we saw here. Ryan and Emma are both good actors and just wasted in a sloppily directed effort. This movie somehow achieved what I thought was impossible - make Emma Stone seem boring when she was having fun dancing. <br/><br/>I don't understand the cinematography wow factor here.The imagery looks more akin to late 2000s HD cinematography with the lack of adequate vibrancy in the colors and contrast."

There, I've said something positive, so hopefully that fulfils the required impartiality quotient...<br/><br/>I appreciate the craft, and it's obviously been made with a lot of love... but this just Was. Not. my thing, at all... It's the ultimate stage-brat movie. I have a lot of sympathy for those types of people. I took drama classes... but they tend to become grating, after awhile - and this film grated on me, REALLY fast. Life is not light and frothy. Sometimes we have to do things we don't like. Don't ask me to coddle self-indulgence.<br/><br/>I knew going in that I wasn't a fan of musicals, so you may ask why I freely chose to watch this... The answer is that - as with any genre - occasionally I find an example that surprises me (Top Hat, Chicago, Moulin Rouge... )<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found no such surprises, here. The best part of watching it was knowing that as soon as I finished it, I'd never have to see it, again. I've done my duty as an Oscars devotee and movie buff, but now I need the palate cleansing of Trainspotting 2, as soon as possible!"

","Spoilers ahead (this review refer to people that have seen the film)<br/><br/>Here is to fools who dream.<br/><br/>Here is to jazz that is merely just a shadow of its former self in 1940 , or 1950 or in a place out of time. It is dying and dreamers seem to be its only hope. And what an irony that is. Jazz is a way of life and a way of thinking and it is sinking along with the Sebastians of this word.This movie really succeeds in making us feel what jazz is all about. Not 10 minutes in you already know jazz is not about the musical notes and tabs. Jazz is about freedom. It is about expressing what you feel unbounded , respecting everyone's jazz around you. Jazz is what makes you want to dance in the middle of the street even though you are in a car stuck in the traffic. Jazz is love if a parallelism is possible. And how can it not be possible if the signs are so many. Jazz and love are the driving power of expression and creativity .Love is the highest achievement of anyone of us and what makes determines who we are as jazz is to a musician. Sadly both have never been bleeding so heavily. <br/><br/>And in these dark times indeed for jazz, a change is needed to make it lovable again in this new age. May this be an electronic sound or a compromise to a shortest version of your life longest dream. No Sebastians would ever accept it. Much like love that is dying in our time and age. Love needed to and has changed from what we used to see in the films. Its not limitless and as romantic as it used to be . It is jazz with electronic inputs . It has changed so much in order to survive this new age that can it be even called love anymore ?<br/><br/>In this question Mia ans Sebastian say no. Love is a wonderful kind of music that doesn't have to be mutated to exist . And if times wont accept it, it can exist in a city of stars in their minds inside a look in a bar after so many years.<br/><br/>This movie is a glimpse of the old love and jazz that adds so much colour to a black and white today."

","What a disappointment. Not a musical. (Musical acts are scarce and scattered, there is only one recognizable tune, the others are instantly forgotten). Not a love story. Stone and Gosling show no chemistry, no passion. Not a film about jazz. (apart from a few corny clich√©s)<br/><br/>The film has been successful, so I guess it must have had some appeal. But this Hollywood self celebratory so called return of the musical didn't win me over."

This is Hollywood being self-indulgent.<br/><br/>Neither lead can sing or dance well. This, I would have thought, would be a prerequisite for a musical.<br/><br/>The first two song & dance sequences were uninspiring, though the later ones were a slight improvement; the finale was quite good in terms of editing.<br/><br/>Some of the jazz piano, etc., was good but otherwise there's only one original catchy tune in the whole movie - and you'll be sick of hearing it by the end."

The musical numbers totaled less than 10-minutes. Zero chemistry and zero character study between the main stars. Stilted dialogue that chewed at my ears with no semblance of a plot. La-La Land was nothing more than an excuse to create lavish sets. Despite my cousin having co-produced this film, I will still stand by my educated review.

But from there on, nothing. Everything is perfect: direction, art direction, hairstyles, performances (GOD MIO EMMA STONE), color, photography, soundtrack, script, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

"pjgs200","10","4","6","16 June 2018"," La La Land is the perfect film.
","The first time I watched La La Land, I thought it was good, but not amazing. The more I thought about it (and after a re-watch or two), it just got better and better. At the moment, La La Land is my favorite film, ever. <br/><br/>If I had to describe it in just a few words, La La Land is magical. It makes you feel joy, heartbreak, and hope throughout its running time, and it's endlessly entertaining and re-watchable. It's an homage to Hollywood, LA, and movies in general with great lead performances, truly phenomenal cinematography, and an incredible score that will stick with you for a long time. I watched the film a year and a half ago, and the music is still stuck in my head. <br/><br/>I really can't pick a favorite scene, since the film is just so good, but Mia's Audition towards the end of the movie was the one that impressed me the most. Stone's performance was wonderful, and pretty much anyone can relate to the song she's singing. I also think that making everything else but Mia fade to black in that scene is a smart choice. Not only does it look great, but it makes sure that the only thing we focus on is Stone's performance and the words to the song. <br/><br/>I don't know if I did La La Land justice with this review, but it's nothing short of a masterpiece. I didn't think too much of it the first time I saw it, but the more I thought about it and watched it, the better and better it got. <br/><br/>Note: You know a film is great when it has an 8.1 on IMDb and most of the one-star ratings say ""I just rated it this low to bring the score down."""

Then, in hopes that it might generate some interest for me, I watched the last 45 minutes. Still, MEH. I don't care about these characters and I found that the songs distanced me from them.

How on earth did it win so many awards? A raspberry I'd believe, but the others? Sheesh!<br/><br/>The story line was slow & boring. I'm a big fan of Emma Stone but in this movie she looked thin & unwell. Her singing & dancing were terrible. She was about as graceful as a newborn giraffe.

","If you haven't seen it yet or the hype hadn't convinced you ¬Ö just believe me now when I say - You need to go to the cinema ASAP. Just one warning though; You won't be able to get the music out of your head. IMDb sums up the movie in one sentence, but there is so much more to it, although I have to say "" A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. "" is the only way to describe the plot without giving away any of the important scenes. So let's start, shall we? The movie begins with the most clich√© musical scene I've encountered in a long time, but it sets the mood for what's to come¬Ö being everything else but clich√©. Sure, here we have a case of a (kinda) corny love story, but it is full of surprise, fraught with intelligent conversations and witty comebacks and most importantly, has an open end, to open up a whole new world for your imagination. Our protagonists are Mia and Sebastian played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, the best movie couple they could have found for these characters. The seem so harmonious together, it's sad at the end of the movie you have to discover, this isn't real life. Also the music, oh have I mentioned the music? I've never been a fan of Jazz in fact, I'd thought I didn't like it very much. Turns out I've just hadn't listened to the right stuff. Another thing that convinced me is that the soundtrack doesn't only contain jazz, but also beautiful piano tracks. Sure one might argue, they aren't the type for musicals, but this one seems to be different in so many ways. The whole arrangement of different styles within the movie makes it drop-dead gorgeous to watch, even if you don't like the story. If you haven't figured it by now, it's a 10/10 for me."

"ariellejohnston-12199","10","4","6","28 June 2017"," Why so many 1 star reviews?
","I'm baffled by all of the negativity I'm seeing from reviewers on here. I can guarantee you that this film deserves all of the credit bestowed and to watch it will not be a waste of your time.<br/><br/>I have grown to love this musical the more I that I watch it. The characters are charming and Ryan and Emma once again put their chemistry to good use. The reasons I feel that there has been backlash from the users are as follows:<br/><br/>1. The lack of skill from the stars to perform above par during the singing and dancing numbers. I feel the need to mention that I, too am a musical person, as I've read from many reviewers that compare La La Land to the classics such as An American In Paris and West Side Story. This is not that kind of musical. Do not expect the leads to be within the same spectrum as Gene Kelley or Judy Garland or you will be sorely disappointed. Go in with an open mind, know that the pair did their best, and that the musical numbers are charming and the music is catchy.<br/><br/>2. The plot is drawn out, has been done before, and has no meaning. I disagree with those opinions. The story is spread out, yes, but I believe each scene is essential to understand the characters relationships with each other, why they're doing what they're doing, and how they ended up right where they should be upon their conclusion. There are plenty of scenes that cover the spectrum of emotions I hoped to feel, moments of joy, laughter, music, romance, sympathy, and sadness. There were no dull moments for me.<br/><br/>3. This was supposed to be a feel good movie and I left feeling depressed. This is true. While the film overall lifted my spirits, the ending may not be what most viewers had hoped for. The director himself said it was his intention to finish with a realistic ending, as in the leads, whom the whole story is focused upon, do not end up together. Because of their careers leading them in different places they decide to see what happens if they focus on what they really want. Maybe it's just me (I do have a tendency to appreciate movies with emotional endings) but I think that can be refreshing and true to how real life can be sometimes. This is not meant to be a realistic film how ever the true story line is about our dreams, and how our drive can get us to places we never thought possible. Sometimes the final outcome means we take chances or make sacrifices in our personal lives. You never know what you'll miss if you settle or don't go after what you truly want in life.<br/><br/>4. This movie is like L.A. boasting about itself. As some people have stated, this is a love letter to LA. I have very fond memories of the city, as I have always lived in California and so I have had many opportunities to visit and explore all it has to offer. My mother had dated a man for a long time who lived in Santa Monica, and he had always taken us to the most unique places and introduced me to its culture. I love LA, the good and the bad. La La Land was almost nostalgic for me to watch, the unreal sunsets at Griffith Park, a brief moment at the Ch√¢teau Marmount, seeing the mountains behind the Warner Brothers Lot, and the Manhattan Beach pier all shot so beautifully reminded me of why I love that city so much. I can't relate to the auditions or all of those clich√©s depicted of the business, but I'm sure those scenarios came from someone's true experiences.<br/><br/>I don't always listen to critics. I like what I like and no persons written words will influence me to the point that I would be raving about a terrible film. I am not, as some of the reviewers will refer to me as, part of the herd and will not Bah bah bah at you like sheep. Nor am I a professional critic or a person who has studied film extensively. I am, however, a movie lover and a musical lover. I haven't enjoyed watching a film this much for a long time, and it has been awhile since a movie has touched me as this one has. The songs are beautiful and get stuck in your head as well, so be warned. All I ask is that before you listen to the critics, or the reviewers on here, that you at least give this gorgeous film a chance and go with an open mind."

","I hated The Sound of Music. I hated Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I hate Mary Poppins. I hated all of the music films from that era. Somehow, in 2016, that format has finally been done right. This movie is great. The whole thing plays out like a stage performance. The colours, the lights, the dancing, the acting. But the thing that ties it all together, and makes it really shine as a stage show is the cinematography. I love the long movement shots, where its obvious that everyone had to be on point for their part. Even just the opening song is a huge feat in filming. The stunts, the dancing, the singing, and then both Emma Stone and Ryan Goslings separate acting parts. The opening scene sets up the entire movie.<br/><br/>The story... I don't have too much to say about it. Its just a story. Its a polished, easy to swallow love story. There's nothing special about it, and thats the only thing in my eyes that could be a let down, but for what the movie is, it works for it. Would the story make me watch it again? No, but the production might.<br/><br/>My favourite part of the whole movie is the stage show recap, while Ryan's character plays ""the song"". Its confusing throughout the whole thing. I said ""she turned their story into a stage show... oh, no its a recap... oh, Ryan is the girls Dad... oh, no its Ryan's version of how it should have gone"". I was so confused, but when he finally finished the song, I was spent.<br/><br/>I would watch more movies like this, if only for the production.

","We Indians love musicals and each movie we make irrespective of the language, has songs and dances. Very rare we make a song less movie.<br/><br/>But hats off to Damien Chazelle for writing and directing a musical which beats us in our own game. After watching La La Land, I wondered why we couldn't make a movie like this with the kind of talent Bollywood and rest of the many regional language film industries India has.<br/><br/>I don't know where to start about La La Land. The story of young struggling actress and a Jazz musician in LA could have been a run of the mill film but Damien is fine writer. So he does include the clich√©s but also keeps small twists and turns in the story. He tells the story in forms of the seasons in LA and how life changes like the seasons.<br/><br/>And when we audience think that all is fine, he beautifully delivers the hammer blow at the end which left me speechless. When I left the theatre, I was wondering how my life is at the moment and how my life could have been if some dreams had come true. My introspection is the result of power of writing. Pity he didn't won an Oscar for writing.<br/><br/>Every frame in the movie looks like a painting and the movie deserves the Oscar for cinematography. And the music is outstanding.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone are a fine couple on screen and their chemistry lifts this film to another level. Both of fabulous actors. Stone beautifully shows the pain of a struggler while Gosling shows the unhappiness inspite achieving success.<br/><br/>Whether the film should have won the Best film, well after seeing Moonlight I can tell.

","Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a traditional Jazz piano player and Mia (Emma Watson) an aspiring actress meet and fall in love. Sebastian's dream is to have his own Jazz Club and Mia's dream is to be a successful actress. <br/><br/>I told them I wanted Westerns to be brought back and what they did was to bring back a Musical. A Musical of all things! Well, it wasn't too bad and it got a lot better after the first 15-minutes when they showed a traffic jam on the freeway and everyone got out of their cars to sing and dance. Pretty lame and you could tell the voices were dubbed in. What was I in for when this movie was nominated for all kinds of Oscars? Someone should have seen those first 15-minutes didn't work. The music was not of the toe-tapping kind the dancing was okay, I guess, but way overdone. I was beginning to think this was going to try too hard. Woe is us. <br/><br/>The story really starts when Sebastian and Mia meet and their chemistry was spot on. Kudos. We hear them singing and see them dancing. The choreography was excellent for two actors not known for singing and dancing. Hey, it worked and was enjoyable to watch all the rest of the way. <br/><br/>Mia decides her auditions weren't working and starts to write a one-woman play. Sebastian is offered a job by Keith (John Legend). The music here is what I would call Jazz Rock and is meant to bring in the younger crowd because no one really likes traditional Jazz anymore. Or that is what is commonly known. Sebastian doesn't really like this kind of music but it's a job and he needs a job. Things work for a while until troubles come to paradise and we see dream conflicts. Oh, oh.<br/><br/>The music and choreography - after the first 15-minutes - were very good and maybe those Oscar nominations were deserved after all. (Of course they were) The movie did get Oscars for: Best Actress: Emma Watson; Best Director: Damien Chazelle; Best Original Song: City of Stars; and Best Original Score.<br/><br/>Notable: J.K. Simmons as Bill who fires Sebastian because he wouldn't play the traditional Christmas music and ended up playing some serious Jazz. <br/><br/>This may be the start of Musical Revivals, but am still hoping someone will bring back the Westerns. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity; No. Language: Only on F-bomb was heard."

","I give a 6 only because there were some bright moments and actors were good. But the story itself, seriously boring, nothing to keep you interested, romance? humor? drama? musical? a little from everything but not enough just bland. Choreography had nothing special nothing to impress while it's something to expect from a musical, and singing scenes? Boring with no essence, no weight, no magic... And there was no romance except some kissing and dancing. At some point you want to stop watching but hey it's La La Land I've been expecting this movie, it looked so positive and stylish compared to violent superhero junk that's so popular these days.

","Romantic, warm, successful in terms of actor and actress performance, but still a little boring.<br/><br/>It was really a romantic movie. It was like you feel the romance between Gosling and Stone. You feel that they have strong feelings for each other and they show it in a cute way. The scenes, at which, one of them makes the other one angry, were not only sweet, but also convincing. Stone and Gosling both had great performance. The fact that Emma Stone has won the Oscar, proves this, although I believe Oscar should have gone to Natalie Portman for her amazing performance in Jackie.<br/><br/>Although the movie was romantic and the main characters had great performance, I found it a little slow and boring. You feel the romance but you are not curious what will happen next. The storyline could have been more exciting. Not only the storyline, but also the musical scenes lead to boredom. I must say that the musical scenes were completely disaster for me. I just didn't like the songs and the dance. Maybe it was just not my thing."

Sadly this was supposed to be one of the highlights of the movie. As I said I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but the first song was forgettable, boring and the voices weak. The dancing looked extremely forced and clumsy.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed I couldn't believe how bad it actually was. I don't know anything about Ryan Gosling other than he is no leading man in my view. Contrary to what others would have you believe, he is not handsome. Eyes too close together, a very long face and a perpetual gormless look. Emma Stone isn't much better.<br/><br/>It was actually very difficult to watch the entire movie. It's slow and amateurish and looks like it was directed by a 15 year old. The sets look cheap and the whole thing made on a budget of $500.<br/><br/>It also seemed like it was made in the late 1970s. A TV musical. Wholly forgettable. HIGHLY overrated. Madly so, it's criminal.<br/><br/>Avoid, unless you're being paid well by someone to say it's great."

","There hasn't been a great musical, in my opinion, in almost 30 years, but Damien Chazelle delivers an absolute masterpiece of a musical with La La Land. La La Land gets back to the basics of why we love musicals as La La Land feels like Singin in the Rain, West Side Story, Silk Stockings, The Band Wagon, Carousel, and so many other musicals which we all love and cherish. La La Land is unique though as it has it's own voice on how life really goes(also never has their been an opening scene where people are dancing on cars in a long shot, something so new and innovative in musicals, an amazing shot). Life is not always peaches and cream, as this is a musical which will make you smile, smile so much, and it will make you cry for joy and it will make you sad at the end because we don't always get what we want in life as La La Land so cleverly demonstrates. <br/><br/>La La Land shows the truth about how auditions go sometimes, and it gives the viewer a first hand look at how difficult it can be for two people to date in the entertainment industry (as why you see some actresses in real life date men outside of the entertainment industry, and vice versa). <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's chemistry is so beautiful, you smile, laugh and cry every time you see them together in this film, it reminds you of a Rogers/Astaire dynamic, the stuff dreams are made of. It's been so-so-so long since there has been chemistry this good in a musical. Emma Stone has shown the audience what a great actress she is and that she is here to stay. Gosling is Gosling. He's always great. You can't go wrong with the Gosling. <br/><br/>I really get the feeling this film is going to win best picture this year at the Oscars and it will be between Amy Adams and Emma Stone for Best Actress. <br/><br/>La La Land is a must-must see film! Go see it as soon as you can. You will fall in love with musicals all over again."

","Musicals of the past left you humming the tunes as you left the theater, this is the first time I have seen a musical without a single memorable song. I'm not sure what this film is trying to be, the story is as dull as can be and the acting doesn't even really mater because it's all broken up by terrible dance numbers. I really wanted to like this and in fact did not read any reviews so I wouldn't be swayed, but it was apparent from the first number that this movie was just an extension of the terrible music that is considered popular today. It's as if they just randomly picked notes and placed words together and expected it to be good. It's the same reason why the top of the music charts are filled with sound-alike music with no feeling.<br/><br/>The acting was wooden and the script dull.<br/><br/>I had to rate this with 1 star just to counterbalance all the outrageous reviews calling this a masterpiece."
"DarkLights95","10","9","18","15 January 2017"," I don't even like musicals and I loved this
","For starters, I am not a big fan of the musical genre. I see the appeal, but usually when I watch a film with entire musical pieces, I just see it as cringe and dumb. There are some movies I really like that revolve around music that some may call a musical (I liked Whiplash, its not like the typical of school musical but some considered still) but usually I end up turning off the movie if it's too old school.<br/><br/>This movie though was super enjoyable. The main song is still stuck in my head. The dances and moments with the music didn't feel cringe or dumb at all, and in fact were actually really fun. They never felt out of place or random, it was usually a way to show off an entire scene or tell a story in a different way.<br/><br/>The actors, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were amazing. This is probably the best they acted in. <br/><br/>This isn't just a ""romantic"" movie, this is a movie about people trying to follow their dreams even when things are rough. This movie is a journey, one you must sit through for the 2 hours and just have a blast through.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies of 2016, and definitely the best musical ever created."
"sunraider","6","9","18","2 January 2017"," Love Letter to Hollywood Musicals Misses Hollywood Ending
","I saw this with my 80-something godmother and we both had surprisingly similar reactions. We both agreed that the film gets off to a slow start. It was downright boring in the early scenes, so much so that my godmother admitted she almost fell asleep. The film picks up some much-needed steam when it concentrates on the relationship between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and particularly comes alive whenever jazz takes center stage.<br/><br/>I found many of the early scenes a bit pretentious. Mia and her glamorous friends are struggling to make it but they live in a really well-decorated apartment, have fabulous clothes, and get invited to so many pool-parties in the Hollywood Hills that you wonder when she manages to get enough hours at the coffee bar to put food on her table. <br/><br/>I also found the film lacking in terms of signing quality. I have excellent hearing but had trouble understanding the lyrics to some of the numbers because everybody seemed to be whispering, which is what unskilled people do when they try to sing. None of the actors could belt out a tune, save for real-life singer John Legend. <br/><br/>Finally, I have to say the awful ending was a letdown. Why make a love letter to old Hollywood musicals if you're not going to give us the ending that Hollywood would have given us if this had been made in the 1950s? This plot has been done many times before and much better: girl and guy are fake and phony; girl becomes star and leaves for Hollywood; guy gets left behind; girl secretly pines for her regular guy; guy finally gets up courage to seek her out and they live happily ever after. Would it have been so terrible to have Mia become a success in Hollywood and Seb simultaneously realize his dream of opening a jazz club but have them both realize they were missing something in their lives (like the love of their life) and then meet cute again and go off into the sunset? <br/><br/>Only one tune was memorable in this movie, mostly due to its frequent repetition. Otherwise, this was only an OK film."

Well, the acting was top notch, the story touching and sweet in the best possible sense, the dialogue funny, the musical numbers did not seem out of place (as one might have feared), and if Gosling doesn't have the greatest singing voice ever, he has the ability to make it work to perfection anyway, sort of like the young James Stewart when he soldiered through Cole Porter's ""Easy to Love."" As for the ending ‚Äì well, I cried. I don't mind admitting it. Or, yes I do, but I admit it anyway. And I'm an old and unsentimental guy, not unlike Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge, but I did shed a tear.

The dancing is nothing special. The story? Nothing special. Not much at all, really. See where I'm going with this? La La Land is nothing special. It has nothing new.

Going through the motions is normal flow. Expressive, rhythmic, flowing motion can be performed by PROS flawlessly with every step though every step is not award worthy.<br/><br/>Many current Hollywood actors/actresses could have performed the same motions as Gosling & Stone.

La La Land really IS that good, even if it doesn't immediately present itself as anything more than a fluffy confection. This takes its place comfortably with ""An American in Paris"" (to which it pays considerable homage).<br/><br/>To me this is kind of a ""guerilla musical""; most of the shots seemed to source from hand-held cameras. It's a low-budget production that frequently uses lighting effects that would be at home in a high school musical. There's little in the way of purpose-built sets and heavy use is made of locations with showbiz-themed murals and the like.<br/><br/>The movie is set in present-day Los Angeles, and fits the classic romantic comedy rags-to-riches template. Neither lead is either a great dancer or a great singer, but the characters are engaging and they're having so much damn fun that it's easy to get pulled in.<br/><br/>This is a sticky-sweet L.A. love story, presented without a whit of irony, and its sincere cheer is infectious. The original music is nice and catchy and both Gosling and Stone present fun, relatable characters.<br/><br/>***SPOILER*** Where La La Land goes from escapist confection to truly great is in the final number, a bittersweet composition that re-imagines the story of Nia and Sebastian with some crucial differences.

","Before La La Land, I had never seen any films in theaters with such toe-tapping emotions. Truly so lucky that I was among the first audiences in the world viewing this all-time must-see film, while most of China's movie lovers are thrilling but not being able to see it. After my second view of La La Land at ArcLight Cinerama Dome, Damien Chazelle and Emma Stone came for the Q&A. It was so unbelievable to me that I could see them in person! <br/><br/>In 2016, I had a most difficult time, throughout the year, probably of all my life: many times could get me to abandon the dreams that I'd been chased so far. Like what says in the opening song, Another Day of Sun, there are so many insane things in the life that could ""let you down"", spoiling your dreams. <br/><br/>Yes, I could always feel discouraged, depressed, and being untrusted and underestimated. That's what ""let you down"". This film saved me. As it says, ""behind these hills I'm reaching for the heights, and chasing all the lights that shine, and when they let you down, you'll get up off the ground, as the morning tools around and it's another day of sun."" <br/><br/>I spent a week in LA after my Ph.D. congregation, as LA is the Holy Land to all dreamers, as well as filmmakers and film lovers. Many of the time was spent in LA theaters. Two weeks before this LA trip, I got an offer from a very top lab in a very top US university, although I strived incredibly hard and spent unexpectedly long time for reaching it: ""behind these hills I'm reaching for the heights"". Even though, I feel a very sharp distance between the people there and me. However, as I always say, nothing worthy is easy. Before the success being reached, everyone is just struggling on the road, for ""a somewhere that's just waiting to be found"". Before that point, what we should do, is ""do what you need to do, till they discover you, and make you more than you're seeing now"".<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, La La Land reignites a fire, deep in my heart, that has been almost diminished. I see this trip and this experience of watching La La Land as dream-reigniting. It has a very important place in my career path. <br/><br/>I'm more than eager to seeing La La Land shining and becoming the best picture in the 2017 Academy Awards ceremony."

It is difficult and quite honestly impossible for me to take a minute, sit down, and think: ""what did I truly liked the most out of this film?"" <br/><br/>Let's start off by saying that, ever since Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) takes the piano and plays it, I felt so drawn by the sheer melody... Here I am a day later and it is just implanted in my subconscious. I find myself whistling ""City of Stars"" like I just heard it for the first time. Without giving anything away, Ryan Gosling's dedication for the role is of the utmost respect and its result is majestic. Speaking of which, the soundtrack of this film is undeniably addictive. It is emotionally driven with the style of Jazz on its back. Yes, it is a musical, the music plays a big role but it is unbelievable how the music in this film isn't its greatest achievement.<br/><br/>Before revealing the greatest achievement, I would like to praise other key factors o the film: the costumes, the cinematography of the movie scenes , which where incredibly satisfying for the eyesight, the colors of the sets, the choreography which was traditional and ""old school""... Everything surrounding the greatest achievement of the film gave that little extra boost needed for it to be one of the best movie experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>Without further ado, the ""coup de gr√¢ce"", was the final sequence. The last 10 minutes of the film. All throughout the film, the character development was incredible and it lead to me being completely emotionally drawn to both of the characters by the end of the film. At the end, you can feel the atmosphere, you can actually feel what they are meant to feel and how they react to it. The movie itself is near-perfect but it isn't until the last sequence that it reaches perfection. For a movie to be so good, and end in a perfect note...

However, this film is wholly different and represents staggering new ground covered by Chazelle and the team behind it, as well as being a deliciously unique piece which seems a shoe-in for being the best film of 2016. <br/><br/>In fact, La La Land is not only by far the best film I've seen released in 2016, but also possibly 2015. Simply put, everything about it works. Firstly, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly cast in their roles, with effortless natural likability and chemistry that most actors can only dream of. Gosling provides charm, a believable passion in jazz, and incredible piano skills, whilst Stone is as genuine as ever, and acts as an audience surrogate that is easy to root for.<br/><br/>The music will not only make you tap your toes, but also cause you to leave the cinema dancing with a wide grin on your face - I was a moment away from standing up and giving a round of applause when it finished. The songs, beside being well-sung and expertly-choreographed, are easy to re-listen to and are very catchy.<br/><br/>On the aesthetic side, the cinematography and the colour palette are beautiful. Highly stylised and with an admirable range of techniques. Some stand-out sequences are the planetarium dance and heart-string-pulling epilogue. <br/><br/>Certainly the best thing about the entire film is its spirit and passion. It's so incredibly enjoyable - not a single moment is dull, and though it takes place over a long period of time with a lot of events happening (it is split into winter, spring, summer, fall, and winter again) it is constantly fun. Even in the most dramatic moments it is fantastic to watch, simply for the pure talent on display, and the realness of the drama, despite the almost fantasy-like quality of the film at times.<br/><br/>This review cannot go into enough detail about how delightful the film is - it's also worth mentioning the fresh, well-written script (also Chazelle's work) that is often hilarious. Honestly I can think of no negatives right now, and it will just be interesting to see how it holds up a year down the line. A must- watch, though inevitably those who are staunchly critical of musicals may be hesitant. 98/100."

","""Art is the shortest road between two people"" Andr√© Malraux. I have never before revisited the cinema over and over again to watch a movie. La la land is the kind of movie that awakens the soul and leaves you feeling more, thinking about your dreams, your life, the world around you and inside you. I will not attempt to describe the film's plot, as it is not what matters here. All you need to know about this magical film is in Seb's (Ryan Gosling) eyes as he lays one last look on Mia (Emma Stone) right before 'the end' hits the screen. An entire lifetime and a whole movie in one shot. If Casablanca had it's 'this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' line, la la land has gosling's look, no words needed. This movie, as it promises, is certainly 'one for the dreamers'. But it conceals so much beauty, magic and soul in merely two hours, that even the most cynical of the viewers will leave the movie theater as changed romantics. Only if for a night...<br/><br/>P.S. turns out people do love what other people are passionate about."
"socrates99","10","8","16","8 January 2017"," OK, I hate all musicals,,, except this one, dammit!
","Never been moved much by musicals though I've always admired those of Fred Astaire. But this movie is not some glitzy re-humanization of being rich during The Depression. It's actually almost the opposite, a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business, one an actress, the other a jazz pianist.<br/><br/>Thing is the two leads here, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are not easy to picture in a romantic musical. But, without a doubt, they're an inspired choice who will make you wonder, just how much talent is there in Hollywood? It's mind-boggling to contemplate. What's more, these two fine actors are so evenly matched here that it's impossible to tell which came first, the pairing or the script. Clearly they had an uncanny grasp of the form though it's been years since there's been such a successful one.<br/><br/>This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it's not worth picking a few. Just go see it, even if you don't like musicals. It will win you over."
"dmgoldschmidt","5","8","16","29 December 2016"," Fun plot with great songs unfortunately performed by a pair of amateur singers and dancers
","Sorry folks, but for me, a musical absolutely requires professional level singing and dancing. And although Gosling and Stone are great actors and do an excellent job with a fun script, neither one either dances or sings like a professional. Not even close. The result comes across like one of those rather embarrassing and painful high-school musicals that you sit through because your child is in it.<br/><br/>The costumes and set design were great, and I really liked the music. I think the movie would have been much better if they had just done voice-overs for the songs. Then we would only have needed to overlook the amateur dancing.<br/><br/>The plot is a modified RomCom plot, but since this isn't a spoiler review, you will have to see it to find out how it deviates from the standard line.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with my daughter who is an aficionado of movie musicals. She was annoyed at the rampant borrowing from classics such as ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"", ""An American in Paris"", and ""Singing in the Rain"". Although this point is worth mentioning, I think many if not most viewers will not notice.<br/><br/>We just watched ""Singing in the Rain"" last night, in honor of Debbie Reynolds. If you want to see what a great musical actually looks and sounds like, you can rent it from Amazon. Then make your own comparison."
"cornflakeboy20","6","8","16","6 December 2016"," Return of the unabashed musical
","I've been waiting for a return of the unabashed musical, and this one announces from its opening scene that it's a movie where actors burst into choreographed song and dance routines on the spur of the moment. This is a good thing. Part of the death of the musical involved the casting of actors who could not sing and/or were wrong for the part. Naturally, I was nervous about the casting. Gosling and Stone are good actors; as singers, they're effective, her more so. As a dancer, Gosling is a little clunky. You get the feeling Channing Tatum might have done it better. The plot echoes a 30s musical with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler; though not quite as artificial and stylized. There are also elements of Gene Kelly, including a 50s style ballet sequence. Plot-wise: A struggling jazz pianist and an aspiring actress are looking for a break in Hollywood, fall in love, and struggle when they begin to find success. The romance and much of the comedy echoes Woody Allen's screenplays, especially Annie Hall, and his own musical Everyone Says I Love You (luckily the actors don't _act_ as if they're in an Allen film, no matter how much the script sounds like they should). Story and plot don't tend to matter much in a musical, but the lead characters and the love story works. The style and design are mostly spot on, though it's not a showcase of costume and sets. The editing is a bit odd, and sometimes it seems that the singing is not quite matching the lip movement. When John Legend sings, though his songs are not good, we hear what a polished singer sounds like, and can clearly match his mouth to the sound. None of the songs in the movie are breakout hits exactly. Emma Stone's audition song is the most effective, and/but it heavily echoes Paul Williams (I could hum Rainbow Connection over it). Overall, despite criticism, I think it's a great movie for the present time. It may succeed better as a gimmick, given that this type of musical is so seldom made now. In a year with multiple musicals, I'm not sure how memorable this one would be. I will say, in almost all respects, it's well worth seeing, and probably seeing in a theater for full effect."

","This is one of the best movies I have seen in my 62 years. How often do you hear a theater audience burst into applause in the first 5 minutes? From the spectacular opening of the film you realize that you aren't in Kansas anymore. Anything can and does happen in La La Land. The story involves a young aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who meets a jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) who is determined to open a jazz club. It should be noted that Gosling actually did his own piano playing in the film! But it is Emma Stone who steals the show here with fabulous singing, dancing, and acting. Emma just graduated to the Great Actresses Club with this performance.<br/><br/>The relationship between the actress and pianist has its ups and downs as they seek their dreams. There are moments so beautiful that I wept for joy. I may have to watch this movie many times. It is pure bliss.<br/><br/>This movie is hard to describe because it has charming old-fashioned elements yet it is at the same time super-modern.

"eddie_baggins","10","7","14","8 December 2016"," The film of the year. A true piece of cinematic magic
","Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, I present to you what very well could (and should) be this years Best Picture winner; La La Land.<br/><br/>From the films incredibly choreographed opening scene, La La Land becomes an eye catching, toe-tapping and most importantly of all joyous movie going experience and the film transforms a story that at its core is rather generic into something else entirely, that will very likely place La La Land into the top echelon of cinematic musicals, as well as a classic of our time.<br/><br/>Quite the feat then for third time feature film director Damian Chazelle.<br/><br/>Announcing himself to the film world with his sweat-inducing drummer thriller Whiplash in 2014, La La Land is Chazelle stamping himself into the ranks of the great directors working in the industry today.<br/><br/>The jazz loving artist is a talent worth all the praise he receives, as every thread of Chazelle's love letter to Hollywood, jazz, romance and perhaps most importantly of all, dreaming, is a pure piece of cinematic ecstasy.<br/><br/>Alongside DOP Linus Sandgren (whose work here may well lead to a hefty individual awards haul this season), his composer Justin Hurwitz and genuinely the whole team behind this production, Chazelle has crafted up that rare movie beast, a unique tapestry of brilliance that practically bounces along frame to frame and is matched majestically by its two leads, who in turn give us a duo of characters we are unlikely to forget anytime soon.<br/><br/>Tasked with not only reigniting the chemistry they shared in the likable 2011 romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love and the 2013 Gangster Squad but pulling off the unenviable task of singing and dancing their way into the moviegoers hearts, Emma Stone as the big dreaming wannabe actress Mia and Ryan Gosling as jazz loving hard-done-by musician Sebastian make for a lovable on screen duo whose relationship together is all at once alluring, believable and at times heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The bond between these two starry-eyed lovers is one you can't help but be swept up by as their individual plights and plans take shape, so do our affections towards them as Mia and Sebastian become one of the modern era's most engaging on screen couples.<br/><br/>The two actors are, safe to say, equally deserving of awards, yet as good as Gosling is in a role he seemed tailor made to play this is in many ways Stone's true star making turn that will be nigh on impossible for any of her naysayers to deny. She can no longer just be the lovable redhead from Easy A or Zombieland or the lucky to be there Oscar nominee from Birdman.<br/><br/>In another year where Natalie Portman didn't too give what appears to be the performance of her career, the Best Actess would've been Stone's for the taking (Stone's rendition of the film's key song Audition is a true showstopper and proof enough of this) but regardless of the results of such statue giving, Stone's layered turn here is one for the ages.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to be said about this spellbinding romance that just so happens to express itself through its songs and music as well as its very setting but at the end of the day for anyone that calls themselves a movie lover, La La Land is a brilliantly conceived big screen experience unlike anything we've seen before and a true big screen must-see.<br/><br/>In a year of largely forgettable and cookie cutter experiences, Chazelle's love letter to film, the city of lights and following your dreams should be something that's savoured and enjoyed not only in the coming months, but for years yet to come.<br/><br/>5 observatory waltzes out of 5"
"ThisIsWhyImScott","10","5","9","11 March 2020"," The Best Musical in Decades

"cutesd","1","5","9","27 October 2017"," A musical with no memorable music and talentless actors ... how is this a hit?!?
","Musicals don't necessarily have to have leading stars who can sing and dance. Frank Sinatra was no great dancer but managed to hold his own, Rene Zellweger was dwarfed next to Catherine Zeta, and Christian Bale's Santa Fe ballad complete with cowboy dance in Newsies is downright laughable, hell Rex Harrison SPOKE his songs rather than sing them ... BUT given incredible music we the audience can forgive a lot. <br/><br/>That being said, it's not like Hollywood is hurting for actors who can both sing AND dance. Neil Patrick Harris and Kristen Bell both immediately spring to mind. Now if you'd paired those two in La La Land you MIGHT be able to overlook the huge glaring flaw in this musical: the fact that the music STINKS.<br/><br/>5 minutes in I was bored ... I was supposed to be wowed with a huge musical opening number ala ""All that Jazz"", ""Carrying the Banner"", ""Sweeney Todd"", or ""Singing in the Rain"" and instead I couldn't tell you the title of the song and I couldn't have been less blown away by the opening dance number. BORING.<br/><br/>Then we meet our protagonists and ... I couldn't care less about either of them. At 15 minutes in I was ready to bail out but I figured I should at least hear Gosling sing and see both of them dance before I called it. Man am I sorry I waited. At 30 minutes in we finally get to the first big song/dance number and it just really could not have sucked worse if it were a preschool production. If that was all the singing required, couldn't they have cast Channing Tatum? I'm sure his voice could have been auto tuned as much as Gosling's and he's an excellent dancer. Everyone made fun of Helena Bonham Carter's Ms. Lovett because of her airy nothing of a voice ... well Emma wishes she had the lung capacity of Ms Carter. <br/><br/>Midway through the train wreck of the first musical number I couldn't take any more. If I'd seen it in a theater I'd have demanded my money back. I heard there's some good John Legend moments ... I'll just try to find them on youtube. <br/><br/>So Hollywood casts not 1 but 2 actors who can't sing or dance worth a lick in a musical with utterly bland and completely forgettable music. How is this rated 8.6 stars? Why is this film not overwhelmingly panned by critics? Is this what passes for good from Hollywood now? Because if so they should just turn in the keys because the whole place is bound to go down in flames any second."

","Never have I been more upset at wasting 2 hours of life! I have seen my fair share of garbage but LA LA Land now tops the list. Here's an idea for producers considering a musical - Hire singers and dancers and then teach them to act enough to hold someones attention. Do NOT do what the producers of this heap of steamy crap did and bring in two actors and then try to get them to sing and dance. Gossling is massively miscast! He MUST have some sort of talent to still be making movies but it certainly is not singing and dancing. I imagine everyone involved in any musical prior to this one is either rolling in their graves or, if still living, are making plans to do so. Stay as far away from this puss bowl of boringness as you can. Now we all know why the Academy took back the Best Picture Oscar."

Just a mishmash of scenes, terrible ending, neither star could sing, acting was OK, but certainly nothing to get an Oscar for. Emma Stone deserved an Oscar for "" The Help"", but not for this mess. I love movies, but this was painful to watch. 13 Oscar nominations? Insane."
"hallowfanatic","8","5","9","29 April 2017"," Great musical that breathes life into the genre once again.
","Honestly when I was first told about the premise of La La Land, I was pretty uninterested. I love musicals and films of any genre, but this one didn't peak my interest. It was only after it was nominated for 14 Oscars (which is the same amount as my favorite film of all time, Titanic) that I really noticed it.<br/><br/>And boy was I glad I did! This movie is refreshing. It puts to rest all the things about complex plots, ""inappropriate"" material and language that so many movies have today, and lets us take a two-hour trip into the fantasy world of the story and its characters.<br/><br/>The songs were enjoyable, with ""Someone In the Crowd"" being the standout. The duets were emotional, and I felt the connection, the bright colors and eccentric dances added to the nostalgic feel of the story. It did an exceptional job blending timeless musicals with modern traditions.<br/><br/>I thought Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did a great job at their parts, with Stone being the standout. Their characters felt real, like someone you could really meet walking down the street. Their chemistry was good, and I loved that this movie highlights the ups and downs of relationships, because not every relationship is as flawless as the fairy tales say.<br/><br/>I see some negative reviews about the singing and dancing being out of tune and not perfect, but I think it adds to the story. When the characters make a tiny wrong step, or their voices shake, it adds an extra element of realism that I don't think everyone sees. I for one like the tiny mistakes that you can point out. No one is truly flawless. <br/><br/>I think the only thing I didn't like was the pacing. It was a bit slow, but it's understandable considering you wouldn't add a car chase or some action sequence to a romance musical. I also think it could've used one more group song like the first two in the film. <br/><br/>But overall, it's a clean movie that will give you a roller coaster of emotions, and leave you with melodies and tunes playing in your head all night. A must see for anyone who loves musicals."

Through the cycle of seasons, their love affair develops and their lives too keep on moving but their dreams could hardly be fulfilled in the city of stars.Finally as Sebastian starts to settle while Mia could make even that much,they are ripped apart each after their own dreams.<br/><br/>The movie has moments to remember : the first time when Mia and Sebastian met and through some beautiful dance moves they exchange what they feel about each other ,it was o so beautiful. Another favourite moment of mine was when Mia saw Sebastian five years later , both being equally successful then, and Sebastian played their love note over the piano and Mia imagined how their life had been if they both would've been together.The cinematography and the set design here was something to remember.<br/><br/>Talking about the screenplay,unlike most other romantic dramas,La la land races away in 120 minutes.<br/><br/>The music was excellent with meaningful lyrics.'City of stars', being the special one.<br/><br/>Finally La la land leaves with a message : To chase dreams , one must make a sacrifice.<br/><br/>To handle so much of things in a fashionable way, Damien Chazelle must be applauded for a wonderful direction. <br/><br/>In two hours, La la land offers more than you would expect.Almost everything you can expect from a film.<br/><br/>This musical masterpiece will be remembered even in years to come."

","Although this movie is probably about pursuing one's dreams and sacrifices (necessary?) in the process, it ended up as a lousy musical (with good music). It's also dedicated to some (golden?) era in Hollywood when musical was the best there is in the industry. So, instead of a clear emotional story of two ""star crossed lovers"", we've got collision of dreams of two egoists who think their individual success is more important than than anything else. It isn't. It's just that could not reconcile one type of emotion (craving for fame) with another (love). Direction is not bad (however not as good as in Whiplash) and everything has been ""watered down"" with two miscast main actors who cannot sing (and acting itself is also doubtful). Ending of the story was predictable and probably many Hollywood staff would recognize itself here. As for the musical, unfortunately I liked only ""Sweeny Todd"" (meaning that it could not function in any other form). Summary: Worth a look, but soon to be forgotten (despite the hype). Four stars for cinematography."

At the end of the film, at the edge of my seat, I confidently found two answers: ""This"" and ""YES"". And here's the why:<br/><br/>La La Land is on the surface a love song to the heyday of Hollywood's musicals; a story of struggle to stardom; of romantic and heartbreak; of the juxtaposition of floaty fantasy and harsh reality. The devil in disguise, however, lies NOT solely in the master level of sound design or editing. BUT, the juxtaposition between the characters and the duality and the dynamic between sound and image; between what's going on IN the film versus what's going IN our collective minds.<br/><br/>The film is very aware of its own medium which in turn demonstrates the perfect balance between audio and image. The movie always suggests ideas which in turn emphasizes more than telling. When you must explain a joke, the joke is indeed not funny if you don't get at first. But never once did the editing undermine itself enough to blatantly turn to words to clarify what the story implies or aims for. This is a common mistake predominantly most and every movie makes these days, and they can thank mediocre writing and poor understanding of what the medium is capable of. <br/><br/>Every scene, every cut, every line, every sound cue, has a rightful place in this one hundred and twenty-eight-minute film opus. I am simply soaring in the sky after 10 years of devoted film study, and more than plus 1,000 films legit rated on IMDb, and have no proper way of concluding this review except this anecdote from my friend:<br/><br/>""Now I must go home, watch a crappy movie, so I can get back down to earth!"""

Too many super hot reds gobble up visual information instead of actually lighting the leads and the sets. <br/><br/>To its credit, it's ambitious as hell, well-intentioned, and a bit of a production triumph. I appreciate many of the hand-built sets. But as an experience, it mostly fell flat for me.

The special affects were fun - like the dancing in the stars - actually quite beautiful even though you can tell how they did it. Very little dialogue -and that was OK but it was missing something to me - cannot quite put my finger on it. The colorful costumes were fun, the music was good but I do not think I will be humming any song tomorrow. John Legend was good - and he did write some good songs for the movie. So to me, it was an interesting movie and if the Oscars had a musical best movie award - it would probably get it since there is little competition. I do not see it as a best movie for 2016. I do not think I will be thinking of this film in the next week and to me, when I am still thinking of it later then it has stirred something in me to make it memorable.

","There may be many philosophical reasons to contradict the story of this movie and they are pretty accurate in their own right but that doesn't make this movie any less genius. Hollywood movies are mostly dry of emotional appeal and ""love"" is pretty much objectified by stuffing sexuality in a well thought strategic point of the movie. This movie is like a breath of fresh air in suffocating idea of romanticism. movie is trying to depict love and passion in realistic and idealistic way at the same time. another factor is its emotional appeal, very few movies try to connect with the daily life of common people - which is a good selling strategy for movies. music have succeeded in communicating emotions to the audience. Emma stone have been herself and was well suited for this movie but Ryan have done exceptional job. i think this movie is very original and artistic as it shows every moment with the right level of intensity it deserves. it is obvious that such romanticism isn't helpful in real life but if one could show various forms of romanticism(i.e. with another human, with career, with music, etc), it would come out like this movie.."

"bbewnylorac","6","5","9","7 January 2017"," Not bad but over-rated
","It's a shame that this film, directed by the very talented Damien Chazelle (creator of Whiplash), has had so much praise heaped on it, and is favourite for the Oscars. It is not a bad film, but it doesn't deserve an Oscar. When it ended, I left the cinema saying ""it doesn't suck"" and ""I didn't walk out on it"". But I didn't rave about it. With echoes of Whiplash, it does have deeper themes such as how two artists in a relationship can maintain their careers simultaneously, and also the importance of dreaming big and of being willing to fail and compromise. Also, it must be noted, this film's creators have dreamed big - by bringing a big time musical back to a Hollywood studio film. But maybe that's all the risk they were prepared to take, because much of the film is quite bland. The opening number on the jammed-up freeway is an excellent idea, but all we see dancing and singing are beautiful thin young people in multi-coloured clothes fresh from the studio wardrobe. It would have been so much fresher to have old people and obese people and kids getting out of those cars and doing their own thing. But for many of the film's scenes, we only get lithe young dancers in swimsuits or dancing clothes shaking their booty. It's boring. Or rather, it's nice, but not exciting. I feel Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are sincere in their roles as the struggling actor Mia and the earnest jazz pianist Sebastian. But they come across as very, well, pleasant. I.e. bland. They have no edge, they're not quirky. They're very WASP-ish. The film's soundtrack is nicely performed, but not that memorable. If you look at a musical like Chicago or Hairspray, there are about 10 killer songs that stay with you. Not with La La Land. I like how La La Land showcases some lesser-known Los Angeles landmarks. But the movie is also too conservative in sticking to a very rigid style. There are some tiny nods to modern times, such as Mia driving herself home from a date, and a cellphone ring getting in the way of romance. But lots of other films, such as Chef, which uses Twitter, or Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, with its drug-gang take on a modern city, and even the semi-animated Enchanted, set in tough New York, are willing to have fun with modern technology, even while they portray traditional stories and styles. Gosling and Stone are very serious and earnest. I feel they're wrong for these roles. La La Land tries hard, but ultimately I didn't love it. I wanted to, but I didn't."
"manuelwinchester","9","5","9","28 December 2016"," Dare to dream vs Reality
","I admit it. I had a preconceived perception that this film is overrated and hyped up. Maybe I felt like this because it's a musical. But the truth is that we are dealing with something exceptional. First of all, I'll divide the film into two separate parts. The first is the one which could call ''the musical part''. It's what you expect to watch in a classic musical. But there is a big difference here. The difference is called Damien Chazelle (''Whiplash''). This extremely talented young auteur creates a directing masterpiece. We should regard his work as a directing tutorial. The frames, the one-take moments and of course the brilliant jazz music are working on a perfect way to create a wonderful nostalgic atmosphere which looks alike a hyped 60's romance. Think about all these elements you adore about musicals, in addition with a superb directing. Now the second part is what makes this movie substantial and differentiates it from other musicals. I couldn't have thought, even at the beginning, that this story will be so powerful. The script is the quintessence of motivation, a hymn about dreams. The leading couple, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone), balance their romance on their dreams and goals. They fall in love just because they inspire and motivate each other. But can this love endure the reality? Or, more essentially, can these utopian dreams overpower reality? Each character has goals and aspirations, but what does it really happen when reality strikes? Damien Chazelle knows how to reflect the right principles about life. La La Land is full of such principles and it turns into a big life-lesson, where Chazelle deciphers daily life and suggests that we dare to dream. Of course, the film won't be successful without the fiery leading duo. I think Emma Stone is a big surprise here with a performance which can be finally considered as first-class. On the other hand, Ryan Gosling is that kind of the actor who performs brilliantly at pretty much everything. Their very chemistry ensures film's success. La La Land is probably the best film of the year. It is realistic and dreamlike at the same time. It is a reflection of reality dressed up in a romantic, artistic, musical and theatrical outfit."
"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","9","5","9","26 December 2016"," Theme song
","FINALLY a movie with a theme song like days of yore. It's been over 20 years since a movie has had a nice melodic theme running thru the film. Something you can actually hum when one leaves the theater. So tired of these rap type songs with no melodies whatsoever. Just a bunch of noise and lyrics that can't be understood or even heard.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, excellent. Good story with innovative scenes and alternative story lines. For non singers/dancers, both leads do well. Let's hope they start bringing back old fashioned musicals once again. Enough of the junk that's produced today with all special effects, car crashes, explosions and super type heroes. Not to mention recent movies that use the F word like it's nothing, nudity and graphic violence. No, I'm not a prude, but let's leave the rough stuff at home and start producing ENTERTAINMENT with a capital E. <br/><br/>See LA LA LAND"
"framptonhollis","7","5","9","26 December 2016"," this may be the greatest film of 2016
","""La La Land"" is a dazzling cinematic explosion made up of life, love, and music. It's a magical musical ride through an unforgettable romance that is original and brilliant. After directing ""Whiplash"" and now this, it is obvious that director Damien Chazelle will live on to become one of the greats. As a matter of fact, this might be even better than ""Whiplash"" and it seems like it will certainly become a cinematic classic over time. <br/><br/>Although the film drips with a sense of homage, it still does not contain an ounce of clich√©, which is a real relief! Reading the synopsis, it may seem like an average love story, but it manages to be unpredictable. The depiction of the conflicts that arise during a relationship is reminiscent to Jean Vigo's masterful classic ""L'Atalante"", and this film deserves to be compared to such masterpieces, because it IS a masterpiece! It is not only a masterpiece of cinema, but also of entertainment, music, humor, and drama. It is an experience that will likely be appreciated by all-everyone from high brow critics to young girls."
"brentrschroeder","10","5","9","26 December 2016"," Beautiful, Stunning, and Not What You'd Expect...
","Fresh off of his smash hit, ""Whiplash,"" writer/director Damien Chazelle has returned with another original in the throwback musical-for-the-screen, ""La La Land."" The film follows the two protagonists: Mia (Emma Stone), a barista who struggles to make it as an actress in Hollywood, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist who was fired from his previous steady work and has struggled to move on both professionally and personally ever since.<br/><br/>*Light spoilers to follow, with heavy spoilers later.*<br/><br/>The plot follows Mia and Sebastian as they experience a series of chance meetings: a traffic jam on the interstate, Mia finding him playing in a night club, a party Mia attends where Sebastian also happens to be playing, etc. ""It probably means something,"" Sebastian remarks. ""Probably not,"" Mia replies. The two then sing a song about how there is no spark of romantic interest between them, despite the audience and each other knowing that is false.<br/><br/>The film is a dizzying array of technicolor and from the studio logos to the final roll, you can tell you're in a film that is meant as a love letter to the Golden Age of Hollywood. On a technical level, the craft is so tightly wound that aficionados will likely lose their grip on the narrative as they're swept into the beautiful sights, sounds, camera-work, and stage blocking that can sometimes be distracting in their virtuosity.<br/><br/>Consider, for instance, the film's opening shot. We pan from beautiful blue clouds into a sea of unnamed singers, dancers, and, yes, even musicians and BMX bikers as they sing about their experience moving to California hoping to ""make it."" Some viewers may be so distracted by the level of technical skill on display in this opening scene that they may not realize that it doesn't even establish the film's plot, only its mood and setting.<br/><br/>In terms of casting, the film is pitch perfect. Stone & Gosling have excellent chemistry and in a film that relies heavily on visual storytelling, Chazelle struck gold landing two leads with expressive faces, emotive range, and who are both in the prime of their careers.<br/><br/>*Heavy spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>After a series of clich√© setups, we arrive at the film's core: the film is a love story. But the love story is not simply between Mia and Sebastian; it is also a love story between Modern Cinema and the Golden Age of Hollywood. The film sweeps you away on a current of whimsy, but if you pause a moment to reflect on the course of the narrative you will find that the waters are not so deep after all. The film shows Mia living with three housemates, all who are vying for stardom as she is. Why should we care for her success any more than theirs? And for Sebastian, he presents himself as a loner and a hermit with self-destructive tendencies: why should we sympathize with this character?<br/><br/>The best reason that the film provides is that the two characters are played by the films leads: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And be warned: how you answer this question will largely determine whether you like this movie.<br/><br/>For my final take on this film, I would suggest that disliking based on the premise of inadequate justification for investment in the romance plot is to miss the point. The point isn't whether you care about Mia & Sebastian; the point is that Mia & Sebastian's lives symbolize the cinema of old coming into the Modern Age. One subplot involves Sebastian's dream to open a night club where he picks the music. Co-star John Legend asks the rhetorical question that gets to the heart of the film: ""How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist? You hold onto the past, but jazz is about the future."" If you substitute ""cinema"" for jazz, I think you get the heart of the film's message.<br/><br/>And here is where I will hold out several examples to illuminate my point on this subject: the film subverts expectations at many turns. As I was leaving the theater, I noted that something negative follows nearly every musical number (with very few exceptions). At the end of the opening number, they're still in a traffic jam; after a breathtakingly staged dance at a party, Mia's car is towed; after Mia sings ""Audition"" near the film's end, that signals the end of her relationship with Sebastian. <br/><br/>The film closes with a journey five years into the future. Mia has married another man and is raising a child, Sebastian has started his nightclub. Unsurprisingly, a chance happening causes their paths to cross yet again. Sebastian spots Mia in the crowd and plays a piece that (if not actually, then certainly in the film) is so beautiful that it transports he and Mia into a fantasy world where all of the negative things that they've encountered together hadn't existed. It's beautiful, fantastic, and everything you'd expect in a storybook ending.<br/><br/>But this isn't a storybook ending. The film closes with Mia & Sebastian exchanging knowing glances from opposite ends of the nightclub and Mia leaving with her husband. Just like in the case of new jazz, this musical is a new tune played with a lot of familiar notes. <br/><br/>""La La Land"" seems like a breath of fresh air because of how beautifully it repackages and then subverts the old tunes we know and love. It is silly to speculate on what direction Chazelle's career will take after this film, but his body of work thus far has demonstrated that it will be both beautiful and emotional.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."
"Garrett_Thorne","10","5","9","26 December 2016"," If you enjoy watching movies or are interested in the award season of films this is a must see!
","La La Land is Damien Chazelle's most recent project, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. These two actors/actresses have been in a few movies together already, and you can clearly see that in this movie their chemistry in this movie is so good. Their relationship seems so real, it feels like you are a fly on the wall just looking in on two real life people in a real life scenario. This movie will go down as a classic!<br/><br/>Let's start with the obvious, the music. It is so great in this film! Some of the greatest song in the modern film era! You will find yourself singing the songs repeatedly in your head, over and over again! And the fact the Ryan Gosling learned the piano just for this movie and played it that well is absolutely astonishing!<br/><br/>Another thing I loved about this movie, is the way they pay homage to older musicals, this movie is shot in cinescope and it makes the movie truly beautiful! I really love the way Damien chazelle did the shots in the movie he was able to show the classic musical style in this movie so well!<br/><br/>Now that brings me to my next thing I LOVED in this movie and that is Damien Chazelle, he did it again! After his great movie titled ""Whiplash"" he comes back with yet another classic film! He directed this movie so well, all the shots were absolutely perfect, I can't wait to see what he does next! <br/><br/>I can't say enough about this movie it is so amazing, if you even slightly like movies you need to see this film!! The performances are so good and the movie really tugs at your heartstrings, and makes you really feel for the characters! And this movie drives home the theme of the dying art in the film industry and it shows that plot so well! I'm giving Damien Chazelle's La La Land a 9/10"
"raonadia","9","5","9","26 December 2016"," City of Stars, are you shining just for me?
","Right from its stunning opening sequence 'La La Land' is a joyous ode to the musicals of old. They don't make movies like this any more, except writer/director Damien Chazelle just did! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play likable star-crossed lovers, artists struggling in that most LA of enterprises - the elusive Dream of Stardom. Los Angeles is the third central character in the film, portrayed as a city of murals, painted in primary colors, an Edward Hopper print come to life. Not since 'LA Story' has the city come to life so vividly. 'La La Land' engages in dialogue with other movies either explicitly, such as 'Rebel Without a Cause', or implicitly, such as in 'An American in Paris'. This is the light side of Lynch's 'Mullholand Drive' which also features an aspiring actress whose excruciating auditions are shown in close up. Rhapsodic, nostalgic, giddy, 'La La Land' was a huge risk that paid off through its execution and style. The camera gently lilts and tilts across the California landscape, elevating story through screen language. The LA sun casts a golden haze over the aspirations of its protagonists in a world where pavements are lined with broken dreams and success is just a phone call away. It is Gosling and Stone who carry the film, Chazelle who exalts it into the constellation of stellar cinematic turns. Highly recommended."

","I had very high expectations for Lalaland but what a disappointment. This should have been a Broadway show not a movie. I felt that the story linen was thin and very chaotic. To me this was Bollywood meets Hollywood and it did not work at all. Why can't we just allow Bollywood to make their great movies at least they are authentic. The only positive thing about this movie was the acting. I thought the actors did their best with the material they were given. Also the music was good but did not manage to carry through. Probably just better to buy the soundtrack. Do not recommend this movie but if you do go do so with low expectations that way you might get some enjoyment out of it."
"yehudakut72","10","8","17","12 January 2017"," best movie of 2016!!
","La La Land is a film, I feel that people are annoyed of and don't talk highly enough because of all of its popularity and glory it gets. For example: in Sundance they got excellent reviews from critics and in the Golden Globes they beat a record for most Globes won(with a win of 7 Globes). But I think that this film deserves this amount of attention because all the big movies we get now a days are movies with a hero that is having a conflict with a villain. Some of those movies can be superheros from Marvel and Dc and some can be just plain action movies. Though in 2016 you wont find a better movie than La La Land. <br/><br/>This movie gave me emotions that I have never felt while watching any movie in my life. I felt so much joy from the characters when they were dancing and singing, it was just so beautiful. I am also currently feeling sadness and anger while i'm writing this review, towards the ending of the movie. I don't really know how to respond to how the ending took place and I think it deserves to be praised for that beautiful but sad ending.<br/><br/>I knew this was going to be a good movie the moment I saw the trailer and I knew that it would be my favorite movie of the year from the opening sequence, it was truthfully magnificent.<br/><br/>Emma Stone gave her best performances ever, and she truly delivered. She was so good in the film I would give her already the Oscar for best female lead. Also Ryan Gosling gives a terrific performance in the film. While he is playing on the piano and is tap dancing, it brings a feeling of joy that its hard to get from all of the music you have now in this generation. John Legends acting was excellent as well. His character has shown us how music has changed through out the years and that's what makes Ryan Goslings performance even better. When he plays the piano and listens to jazz, we can understand form that who Sebastian really is, without him talking.<br/><br/>What I truly love the most out of this film is that the genre of the film is a musical. This type of movie that is filmed like this and has great music is something people, and I haven't seen in the 21st century. Studios don't want to make these type of films because they wont bring as much money as Captain America or the Avengers.<br/><br/>So I advice for everyone, that you should go out and watch this film, but not to watch it because of its rating of 8.8, but just to go out for the fun of watching a good film. It's like watching a Broadway show in theaters but better, with amazing directory and filmography.<br/><br/>I cant say much more but truly I think this is my personal favorite film of 2016."

","When once-in-a-lifetime love conflicts with lifetime dreams one or both have to give, or so the characters believe. The result rips open hearts and the time-space continuum. Robert Frost wrote: ""I shall be telling this with a sigh, Somewhere ages and ages hence."" La La Land sings and dances that sigh in high definition.<br/><br/>If you've ever felt the need to sacrifice one passion for another, and you have a heart, this film will leave you in tears. It did me. If not, it won't make sense.<br/><br/>If squashy, squirrelly, fudgy paintings show you reality with chisel preciseness, this film will be a life altering ride. If the impreciseness of oil on canvass annoys you, and you wonder what's the point of brushes when pixels do so well, it'll be a waste of time and money to watch.<br/><br/>If you tolerate, are fascinated by, or even love paradox, and recognize that life is not like Hollywood but it is like Hollywood, and that dissonance is built into the DNA of the Universe, you'll love this film. If your yardstick comes from textbooks that preach 3-act structure, parabolic character arcs and tidy Hollywood endings, this film will annoy the hell out of you.<br/><br/>This dreamlike film about dreaming worked for me.

"metalman50","10","6","12","4 February 2017"," Best Musical in Cinema History
","I saw it thrice in theaters, but Whiplash director Damien Chazelle's La La Land, with good reason, left me totally flabbergasted when I left the cinema all three times. I didn't get to watch it last year, but no matter when I watch a good movie like it, I stick with my clear opinion. It also caught my eye for the reception and cult following it gained among both critics and moviegoers alike so there's more than just a random decision, but let's move on...<br/><br/>When the film acts out as a musical to entertain those of all ages, the audience is easily gripped by all the super catchy songs within its powerful plot that make it seem like the new generation of 1950s musicals. Even for those who aren't fans of musicals, or mainly in my case; romance, the cinematography throughout most of the songs that help make the film live up to its title, like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in an observatory (since this is a love story while also being a musical at the same time after all) give it some of that rewatchable factor since everybody loves good moments like a lovely dance between two characters.<br/><br/>Stone's and Gosling's characters both have their own sides of the story that develop them well enough that will really grip you to them. From Stone's character; Mia's moments of auditioning for films throughout all of her parts, to Gosling's Sebastian playing pianos from building to building and playing the movie's most common theme that is of him and Mia during their relationship, the characterization suits both the leads even if their the only ones that really get it. And I say this because above actors (Emma Watson and Miles Teller who would've been the lead characters original before Stone and Gosling) and characters at times, story and pacing are really more important when it all comes down to it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a big step forward for the film's climax, with the one that's destined to receive an Academy Award (which I'm hoping it will) being ""City of Stars"", or one other towards the end as it's my favorite song of film), but I'm not going to spoil that one here. It's one thing for the songs to be played out, but considering the fact that (again) it's a musical, actors also need to dance out the situations in which the songs that play in them would. My favorite genre of course would be rock n' roll, but the film's trying to be as jazzy as possible - something of which suits musicals more than guitars and sometimes drums, and being all rock n' roll, or techno or whatever really depends on the musical's theme. In this case, since La La Land is trying to be all classical like some blast to the past (like the 50s and 60s), it's trying to be the soothing kind of situation.<br/><br/>Choreography is another thing as to helping all the memorable, and at times soothe tunes that would make one feel good and even imagine different situations he/she would be in. Even if the film's cast seems less interesting than the two leads (with the exception of (Spoiler Alert!) John Legend and J.K. Simmons (an actor who previously starred Chazelle's first film two years beforehand)), what matters is the overall story and how brilliantly its songs implemented, and how it paces itself out. And according to Chazelle and his ideal soundtrack and excellent plot, La La Land has clearly drawn inspiration from other musicals like Boogie Nights and Singin' in the Rain. But that's not a bad thing. As long as you can make a story that's equally as heartfelt and strong in its storytelling, but not the exact same thing in every element of its plot as all of the musicals it was based off.<br/><br/>Of course, there's no denying that the film has heart to it as there are plenty of scenes where audiences will be cracking up enough to feel good about themselves and even choke up at times that they'll really feel for those moments that, with reason, would really melt the heart. So by no means, will you not be having your feelings of sadness and happiness throughout it as it's okay to feel both feelings throughout any good film.<br/><br/>Who seriously needs a couple of DC superhero flicks that are completely rushed and nonsensical or boring and uninteresting romance crap like an overrated, Academy Award-Winning, 1997, boat- sinking, love story (and really, no offense to those of you die hard lovers/fans of them) when you simply have an endearing storyline that blends romance in perfectly with it's well-constructed narrative while also timing wonderfully catchy musical numbers without having its score stand above the rest of story itself, along with strong performances from two beloved actors/actresses, breathtaking and beautiful cinematography, and gripping moments of a fantasized romance? It makes me feel as though I have a cinematic crush on Emma Stone cause (alongside Ryan Gosling) she's just abso-freakin-lutely incredible!<br/><br/>Those who like it will surely be won over, but those who don't probably will just leave it and move on at the end of the day. But considering all of the best things I've mentioned about it, it all adds up to not only one of my favorite films of last year (at this point I can't decide what my top favorite of 2016 is though), but my favorite musical of ALL TIME!"

","Every once in a while i get to see a movie that makes me remember why i love movies. I always appreciated people with passion and love for something, they believe is greater than everything transient in our lives. This movie is made by, about and for people who share this feeling. Damien Chazelle loves art, emotions and especially music, which of all art-forms shows the most direct emotional response. And damn he knows how to stage music perfectly.<br/><br/>La La Land is now getting big buzz for the award season, but in its heart it's a small film with big topics. Visually stunning and heartbreaking. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the focus and you love watching them for every second of the movie. Without their chemistry and their individual charisma, it wouldn't work.<br/><br/>As a male i have to admit, that no man ever looked more interesting in a suit than Ryan Gosling. Emma Stone as usual seems like the girl you easily fall in love with, but you also can have a laugh and beer with. In one of the first scenes, where she acts as if she had to cry,i really felt it just by watching her. Both actors transport emotions with simple changes in looks or facial expressions through the screen. Something that is highly under-appreciated, due to the fact that loud overacted performances cover them up.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, even if musicals are not yours to watch. You won't regret it."

Those of us who appreciate it can take consolation that the awards that came (and more may be coming) will give added pleasure to top what is already a feel good film experience. To finish I would like to comment with reference to those reviews that go beyond the pale. In Bad Day at Black Rock Spencer Tracy says and I para-phrase.... You are wrong.

Ryan Gosling is such a James Dean it's not funny. He has achieved the Cult Status already, hope and pray he just stays longer unlike his predecessors (James Dean, Steve Mcqueen & Heath Ledger). Emma Stone grows over you slowly to only make you eventually realize, that no one could have done it better. The Director has done us a favor by creating this masterpiece for our viewing pleasure and engaging our senses in ways that are totally unpredictable and therefore completely refreshing.He has made the biggest contribution to dying Jazz music through La La Land & Whiplash. I wont get into the Climax, because it is the most amazing one you have ever seen, and my words cannot do justice to it. You will remember everything i have said and thank me later, when you do yourself this great favor of watching it immediately in the big screen if you haven't !!!"

","At first I thought: Oh my, what if I don't like this movie?. I'm not that into musicals and the begging welcomes you with a song, but as the movie develops I could get comfortable with it. I loved the shots taken while dancing and singing most of the time, but maybe there are some flaws such as the scene of Mia's audition where she seems like floating in the black background making it look funny. I also loved the direction in which they choose to represent life how it is, it is not a happy ending story although we can get a glance at the alternative ending where Mia and Sebastian live together. <br/><br/>The work between Emma and Ryan is wonderful, they've work before reason that assures that the connection feels real for the audience despite their first approaches are hostile in the movie, they develop very well their characters relationship. And all their work for dance, piano and singing scenes were worth it.<br/><br/>It is very sad to see reviews with an 1/10 score, this movie doesn't deserve such a poor score. It has an amazing soundtrack, yes i would love more songs but it is not that relevant. There are not many movies such as this one nowadays, people prefer watching two hours of action spectacle without experiencing any kind of feeling.<br/><br/>I do not say you need to love it but it is a must-watch."

","Just saw the movie & thoroughly enjoyed it. Wish I had waited for the video. I have always liked Emma Stone but feel she was miscast for this role. Not a strong musical voice but as this is maybe half a musical she survived the endeavor.<br/><br/>The story line worked but I feel it should have had a little more money thrown at it & extended the time frame for a far better ending could have been achieved. <br/><br/>The music score when there was one was very enjoyable & when a surprise artist made his intro & your introduced to jazz fusion it saves the movie from being a total flop and makes a memorable scene. To bad there were not more. All in all a watchable flick, once! This is not a Moulin Rouge or Phantom, trust me. Wait for the video, sorry!"
"pererau-82666","10","6","12","23 December 2016"," Unfortunate Title, Tremendous Movie
","My review of La La Land (no spoilers, but perhaps a few too many semicolons, run- on sentences, and parentheses ahead):<br/><br/>You should understand, for starters, that I don't like many ""critically acclaimed"" movies. Odds are, if it is nominated for Best Picture, I'll probably find it pretentious and tedious. I'm not a man that loves mindless action, but I do typically prefer my films a little more on the mainstream side of the aisle.<br/><br/>La La Land, however, walks a masterful line. It is at once funny, poignant, novel, retro, gripping, layered, and very straightforward. It is a movie that knows that - as a full-on song-and-dance musical - it cannot be taken literally; and yet, while it winks and nods at the audience, it manages to tell a serious and timeless tale. I felt the weight and import of the decisions demanded of the protagonists, and still could laugh out loud at the comedy. And laugh I did. Repeatedly. Once I let go and immersed myself in the universe of the movie (and this movie demands that you either check in or out immediately - as in literally from the opening seconds of the film), I found myself looking forward to the next inside joke and the perfect deadpan delivery by Emma Stone. The film has an infectious, innocent exuberance that carries you along on a wave of happiness, even when the subject matter gets melancholy. <br/><br/>Or at least, it does in the first half. If I have complaint about this picture, it is that somewhere in the final act, a kind of moroseness sets in that is out of balance with the joviality of the first half. I understand that the direction of the character development requires some tonal changes, and I don't fault the movie for it. Even factoring plot requirements into the equation, though, I felt that the movie changed character in its latter stages in a way that was unpleasantly jarring. This was not an unpardonable infraction, however; in fact, I think that the film managed to find itself in the waning minutes in a way that was powerful and sweet. As the credits began their crawl, I found myself in profound thought, not sure whether to cry from joy or sadness. Without spoiling any of the plot development, this is not a film that makes conclusions for you - it lets you reach your own decisions about its climax - but it certainly requires you to ponder.<br/><br/>This should be obvious. After all, isn't that the goal of any story? Yet most movies fail to so move me. It seems that most storytellers, including Chazelle himself in his previous oeuvre Whiplash, either fail to give you enough stake in the story to warrant the effort to really search your soul, or manipulate you into it through gimmick and misdirection. La La Land manages to get you there without resorting to falsehood. Any misdirection it uses in the final minutes is directly and openly atoned-for as the conclusion is reached and the viewer is left with some honest questions to ask themselves. The movie achieves this without forcing its morals upon you or foisting any political ideations into the debate.<br/><br/>In the end, you are left with a pleasurable experience, catchy music, good laughs, and some introspection about how Seb and Mia's shoes might fit you for a mile or so. It is unfortunately-named, and suffers from a little too much jazz-worship, and ultimately I wonder how well it will hold up on second viewing, but based solely on how much I enjoyed myself in the theater, this is my pick for best movie of the year (move aside, Rogue One, you had your week at the top), and perhaps best since Lincoln (another exception to the Best Picture rule). Your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>Lastly (actually penultimately - I added something else below, but don't want to edit the paragraph), a word about the film from a parent's perspective: I didn't really want to go see this film. I only went because I wanted a date with my 9 year old and I don't feel comfortable with the violence in Rogue One and have no desire to see Sing. This movie is PG 13, and after viewing, I think 13 is a good minimum age. This is not at all because of objectionable content - in fact, besides a barely audible f-bomb and some other fairly innocuous profanity and a little immodesty, there is nearly nothing to object to - but because the film doesn't shy away from subjects that are deep and mature. My daughter loved the singing and dancing and conviviality that often brightened the theater, but she didn't understand the more existential questions of purpose, fulfillment, relationships, and missed opportunities that are ultimately at the core of this film. As such, she walked away with a decidedly mixed reaction and a complaint that the movie was too long. In the end, I agree that it could use about 10 more minutes of excision - mostly in the second hour - but I believe her impression was less a fault of the movie, and more a fault of her youth. Don't hesitate to take your kids with you to see this film, but don't be surprised if they don't really get it.<br/><br/>I've only ever been on the front row for two films. The first was Avatar in IMAX, and now this. No film should ever be seen from the front row, but I chose two particularly bad films to so endure. Avatar for obvious reasons, and La La Land because much of the film is shot in single-take roving-camera sets and with shots that purposely put focus on both sides of the scene simultaneously for artistic and symbolic purpose. Do yourself a favor: if it is sold out, wait for the next showing rather than taking that front-row seat."

","A year after enthralling audiences with his second feature film ""Whiplash"", Damien Chazelle is back at it again with his magical and mesmerizing Musical ""La La Land"" starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, a film that doesn't just capture the style and essence of a musical in the vain of ""Singing in the Rain"" but also perfectly blends it with the style of modern day cinema, thanks in part to being set in modern day but taking place in a traditionally Hollywood part of Los Angeles, and boasting some beautifully colorful cinematography that gives you the feeling you're in a sublime and dreamlike state. The direction and editing on display here is quite flawless, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling once again show off their undeniable chemistry as two struggling performers trying to make it big in the city of stars. In a year full of such disaster and indifference, ""La La Land"" is just what the doctor ordered."

","I really don't know what the big fuss was about this film. Admittedly it was beautifully shot and produced, the music and little dance numbers were brilliant, and it was visually stunning; the whole thing reminded me of a Chagall painting. I would say that was my favourite thing about the movie; it's all very romantic looking and stylish. However, these things were all smoke and mirrors to me, to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious. It just wasn't all that interesting and couldn't hold my attention. Is it just me or do Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies? I feel like they're the same no matter what roles they play (it's the same with Ryan Reynolds) as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they can't take on a wide variety of diverse roles. In a nutshell: beautifully made and visually striking, but rather uninteresting story and uninspired acting. Totally not deserving of all the Oscars."

","One can easily imagine all the elements to inevitably appear in a La La Land story and they're all here. This might dissuade some to sample this movie but that would be a mistake. Somehow, through skill and good taste, the powers behind this movie and the stars, themselves, have wrought a miracle, a true gem of a touching masterpiece. There are times when the schmaltz goes on too long, especially in the alternative reality towards the end, but for much of the rest of the time one can be held in awe as to how good the music, the dance/choreography (especially for two non-virtuoso dancers), the acting and directing, the writing and the actual 'realness' of it all turns out to be. Of course it doesn't hurt if the touch of lunacy, the dream theme and the curse of ever trying the impossible have woven themselves through the viewer's life."

Romantic flirtations lead to an intense love affair; but conflicting ambitions force them to make some tough choices and their relationship begins to fray and both will realize true love is too important to let slip away.<br/><br/>Song and dance scenes could have been cut a little shorter for me; but this movie is well written and acted. Scenery and sets are beautiful and some scenes just ooze romance. By far, should have won Oscar for Best picture.

","I guess I can understand why a lot of people don't like this movie, but I happen to love it.

Or maybe I'm just not uptight about movies and I know how to go in with an open mind..<br/><br/>I LOVE the opening song/scene, and I don't understand how people don't see the significance to the rest of the movie. If you actually pay attention to the lyrics, it totally fits. <br/><br/>I also love the work of both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I think the fact that they are barely average singers is more realistic and relatable for this particular film. There are definitely musicals out there that call for an extraordinary singing voice, but this isn't one of them in my opinion. Same with the dancing. It was all awkwardly cute to me. It would have been strange if they had been singing and dancing perfectly. I can't stand how people are hating on the job they did! It might not be perfect, but it's definitely clear that a lot of work and effort went in to this movie. I wouldn't have minded a few more songs though, or just more variation. <br/><br/>I can understand this movie not being your cup of tea, but it really bothers me when people have to hate on others just to get their point across. Just say the movie wasn't for you and move on. Ryan Gosling learned to play the piano in just 3 months for this movie. If it's that easy, why aren't you the one on the big screen?"
"exousialegend","2","4","7","4 May 2017"," Extremely boring, generic, and formulaic movie
","As someone for which musicals are not all that entertaining, I can say that I thoroughly loved Grease and West Side Story. I cannot say the same for La La Land. The music is repetitive in La La Land, and quickly loses its charm. The acting is great, I'll give it that, but the story has no place being called a good one. It follows the formula of a love story: meeting, honeymoon, trials, and eventual reunion, but fails at a flowing plot. The jump cuts with the season name is lazy at best, and feels to be a lazy scenery change. The plot events don't even do anything to hide that! <br/><br/>And the music is utterly monotonous. Clearly, it is meant to be slow, emotional, but tracks like City of Stars consist only of a few chords and fail to develop beyond that. The melodies are repetitive as well as the dance sequences being mediocre at best. For someone who enjoys classical music and jazz too, it is odd how this movie would have put me to sleep!"
"n15","9","4","7","4 February 2017"," ""Here's to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem""
","It is not the more original story ever, but it gives a sense of nostalgia, containing several references to classic musicals. The dance scenes are frequently long takes, increasing the immersion in these scenes and their spectacular nature.<br/><br/>It is a movie that brings the idea of Los Angeles as ""city of dreams"" and the musical as the romantic fairy tale. But we know that time is not going back. We cannot bring the old good musical.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a dance sequence that is a reference to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (or ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" on its original title), a musical from Jacques Demy. And it is curious that on the scene in which the Casablanca windows are shot, one can see ""Parapluies"" above a door, reinforcing that reference.<br/><br/>Another curiosity is that one of the characteristics of the Demy's movies is their overlapping continuity, that is, characters crossing over from film to film. And, in what can be understood as one more reference to Demy is the boss of Sebastian, which asks the musician not to play jazz songs but pop songs. This character is played by J. K. Simmons, who also played the jazz teacher in Whiplash, the previous movie from Damien Chazelle. So, this character could be crossing from Whiplash, which would make sense, as Sebastian argues that jazz is becoming less popular, and the character would have left his job as jazz musician and teacher, becoming a bar owner who does not want jazz due to its lack of popularity.<br/><br/>The movie has not the conventional happy ending of the musicals. It seems that romance between the main characters is not the central theme of the film. Instead, the real love was with their dreams. Because, although the movie honours the old classics, the romance story is one of the current times, in which the love is no more above everything. Our personal dreams are many times above the people we care for, but that does not mean that we will like them less."
"ninajasmijn","7","4","7","27 December 2016"," To me this film was average.
","By seeing the trailer and the promising reviews of the film I expected to see a visual spectacle. I knew I could not expect a film that would make me think or would change my views on life. If it did it would be a pleasant surprise, otherwise it would be purely very entertaining. To my disappointment it wasn't both of them. The story of the film is really not interesting to keep watching. I was quite bored by its obvious and non-creative plot line. My last hope was a surprising plot-twist but unfortunately this didn't happen either. The plot was straightforward and meaningless. This made me think about where the high rates would come from. Was it the visuals? I think this was the best part of the film, though it wasn't that impressive that it made up for the boring plot. The acting wasn't that good either. Why were Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone chosen for this film? I suppose only for the big names. I would rather have seen actual musical stars with more entertainment experience. I don't think Gosling and Stone have a very convincing chemistry, which made the film not very romantic even though I watched it on Christmas eve with my boyfriend. But I don't know how much I can blame their performance on themselves. The dialogues just weren't very strongly written. There was no excitement or actual drama. Everything remained flat and made you not care about the characters at all. On top of that the characters were already too cool and flawless from the beginning of the film so there wasn't too much character development. In the end I still give the film a 7 because it was still a bit entertaining to watch, the visuals and locations were nice and the editing was quite good. For me this was an average film watching experience."
"tye1138","9","4","7","22 December 2016"," 'La La Land' is the new ""standard"" for fun in cinema.
","'La La Land' is the new ""standard"" for fun in cinema. <br/><br/>From the very opening number, 'La La Land' delivers a perfect mix of fantastic characters and excellent acting, mixed with vibrant musical numbers that hearken back to an era of filmmaking many people forgot about. 'La La Land' is aptly named because the filmmakers are clearly in love with Hollywood, not just in location, but also in the story itself, which revolves around ""making it"" in the industry. So much of the story hit home, everyone in this industry has the struggles these characters go through and to me, that association made the story ever more entertaining. <br/><br/>I must admit, I've never been a huge fan of musicals. However, the way 'La La Land' dealt with their music, worked very well. They didn't tell the story through singing, they told the story through music. If you think about it, that's the RIGHT way to make a musical because most people don't want to be sung to, but they will gladly hear a nice song that helps fill in a normal dialog scene. This film dives deep into music of various kinds and how people in the music industry are forced to do work they normally wouldn't do in order to fulfill their dreams. In a lot of ways, it's the sad reality of being in a more creative field these days and this film hit's a home run when it comes to telling the truth. <br/><br/>Technically 'La La Land' is extremely proficient with a brilliant concept of dimming lights around actors to ""pause"" certain moments and sing a song for instance. It's a great device that I haven't seen used in this fashion in a long time. The dance numbers were also shot with one flowing camera move, that made them much more exciting then the more classical fast cutting method. The amount of steadicam work is absolutely insane, it seems like every scene with someone moving was shot with steadicam. You could see the cuts between takes, where they did a digital splice between two takes in order to break long takes up, but it worked well. The film was shot on 35mm with anamorphic lenses (2.40:1 aspect ratio) and it looked pretty good. Very little noticeable grain, though it was for sure a 2k finish. I was a bit dismayed with some over- exposed scenes in harsh daylight, something that could have easily been fixed on set, but it was clearly unfixable in post or they would have fixed it. There were also some issues with focus pulling, but with film cameras and anamorphic lenses, it's really hard to judge focus on complex camera moves. Lighting wise, the film was proficient, but nothing crazy. Lots of big sources at night with a key of some kind. Lots of controlled ""set"" lighting, which worked SOO well! I felt the set's were fantastic and so professionally done, those moments really stole the show lighting wise. <br/><br/>The music/songs were catchy and some of the jazz numbers within the movie, were even better then the score. Of course, the actors sung and performed all of the songs on their own, including Ryan Gosling having to learn the piano from scratch in a few months of tutoring. Even John Legend has a role in the movie and does a great job, not only acting, but with writing a really nice track for the film. <br/><br/>I loved how the film was edited (most likely written this way), which wasn't as chronological as most movies. There is even an epilogue, kind of a 4th act so to speak, that was absolutely brilliant and unexpected. That mixed with the editing style that held onto longer takes and single's vs the more standard 2 shot, it was just brilliantly made. There were moments where the filmmakers just stayed on a single, non-moving actor talking facing the camera, just looking to the right or left of the lens, for a good solid two minutes. The takes were EPIC and it worked so well thanks to the fantastic cast and I would assume, a lot of ad-lib. <br/><br/>Over-all, I absolutely loved 'La La Land' in every way. Even though there were some technical snafus', and the big tap dance number could have been way better, I felt the movie over-all was extremely strong and VERY fun. You could tell the filmmakers were having fun making it and honestly, I was having a blast watching it. To me, more intelligent ""fun"" movies like this, are what is lacking in Hollywood. It seems more and more, the studio films would rather be stupid and fun, rather then intelligent and fun. This is where 'La La Land' really changes the paradigm and is just one excellent ride! I don't say this much but I do believe this is the best ""general audience"" movie I've seen in decades and for sure the best one this year by leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>9/10 4.5 stars out of 5."
"k-kombos","10","7","15","15 January 2017"," An overall excellent movie!
","Without going into too much detail and spoiling the movie. <br/><br/>I believe that if a movie can make you connect to your life's experiences and/or motivate you to achieve something or help you realize that life is not that bad and such amazing story telling movies exist, then that movie deserves to be called an excellent movie! <br/><br/>Regardless of if you like musicals or Jazz (of which I happen to both love due to my background of playing music), this movie will make you want to dance sing and smile! <br/><br/>And again, if a movie can move you on such extremes when everything's going badly in your life then it truly deserves the ratings it's getting!"

The film had an amazing soundtrack with songs that are still stuck in my head, thanks to 'Justin Hurwitz' who wrote every song on the soundtrack.This is a proper film compared to any other film in the cinemas now or made within the last decade.

Simple fact: they cannot sing or dance. WTF? Plus the dance scenes are so pitiful, so short and so few it is a wonder they were featured in commercials. Did the two even try to learn to dance and sing? I long for the days of the musical film Chicago with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.

Could it be because the characters could actually sing? (OK, Rex was an exception, but he owned his character) If the actor couldn't sing they dubbed their voices. The choreography was exciting and the actors could dance. The script was strong. The songs were memorable and still sung today. La La Land's characters couldn't sing or dance.

As an musician, and artistic dreamer that has touched fame myself, I should have connected with their dreams and goals and failures. I didn't. Again, just felt like it was cookie-cuttered together.<br/><br/>I don't HATE this film at all, in fact, it is well made. The leads did great with their dance numbers, even if Ryan looked a little robotic by the numbers and the singing was too ""auto tuned"". Still, I've seen better, much better, and will not be watching this again. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>Having recently watched 4 movies from the 50's/60's era, this felt like a pale imitation that WANTED to pay respects to those style films, but acted like cheap knock offs instead. Shocked it got all this praise, and that others don't see right trough it like I did."

","Good cinematography, bad musical. <br/><br/>I am a person with non biases, and I will say, although the plot and music was terrible, it had great cinematography. The longshots were great, brings life to the scene. But this movie LACKED the real stuff that cinematography will no make up.<br/><br/>Bad musical.<br/><br/>1 SONG THE ENTIRE SHOW. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Everything was so bad, there was no build to any plot, everything just happens. These actors, CAN'T SING CAN'T DANCE. (Sorta the point of a musical.)<br/><br/>(Give Emma and Ryan credit though, they tried their best. It's the fault of the producers who casted them.)<br/><br/>And in the end they use the cheap trick, ""what if my life was with you."" What's awful is this trick works on the majority of the people. They feel this emotion, like ""what if"" this feeling, and walk out thinking ""wow that movie really made me sad, it must be a good movie.""<br/><br/>Seriously, capitalism has destroyed another art form. <br/><br/>This film was made non other than for PROFIT. I see no passion in the art of musical itself AT ALL, even though mentioned many times in the film, that ""passion is what drives others to enjoy."" <br/><br/>Please, if you truly enjoy musical, don't waste your time watching this. If you just want to see your favorite actor/actress with some super screen time, go for it. <br/><br/>For those who wants to watch musicals, well, sadly, passion is not the drive for movie makers today. Profit is."

","I was real surprised with what I saw in La La Land. The movie revolves around Mia, a coffee shop barista who aspires to be an actress, and Sebastian, a dedicated jazz musician, trying to make ends meet while pursuing their dreams in a city known for destroying hopes and breaking hearts. With modern day L.A. as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what is more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight. Everything in this movie is perfect. The songs are amazing, the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is wonderful, and the story is excellent. I recommend that you check this one out. Definitely worth your time."
"Semisonic","10","5","10","16 April 2017"," Takes your heart out to play it like a piano, and does that just right
","In a sense, creating perfect films and perfect relationships is a similar task. You just start with the best, and then simply keep it up, never compromising, not a single mistake, not a single wrong step. In a sense, it's a technical task: follow these rules - and you are bound to succeed.<br/><br/>However, simply perfect is just too simple. Too plain. When you come to expect the perfection, you start taking it for granted, and even the perfect things lose their shine and become kinda dull. But how to create something perfect if perfect itself won't cut it? The answer is: you just have to wing it, turning your heart into an antenna and listening to what it's telling you.<br/><br/>La La Land does just that. And, technically, what it does isn't perfect at all. The opening scene is way too cheesy and orchestrated, the dissonance between the people and their song is tiny, but stingingly apparent. And you're already bracing yourself for another hyper-hyped ultra-colored hymn to itself. At that point, the film's all but a future disappointment.<br/><br/>But the perfect relationships are not a sunny day on a loop - what's more important is being able to make it up for the flaws and turn them into the details you'll eventually love as well. So, after having overplayed the bravado at first, the film becomes softer and more delicate, not miming its song, however perfectly, but finding its own voice, honest and sincere. A voice in which Mia and Sebastian speak to each other. At moments gruff, at moments insecure - but ultimately telling the most true story there is.<br/><br/>Right here is where most other participants take the smooth road to an inevitable happy ending. And the summer in La La Land is sweet and promising enough to deliver just that. But will the technically perfect thing be really perfect? Or even a sunny day could get pale if not the clouds and rain to be its counterpart? So the summer is bound to turn into fall, and, once inevitable, the prospect of a happy ending vanishes like a sad pipe smoker's dream.<br/><br/>But that's when we're hooked with no way back. From that point on, we want to listen to the story, no second thoughts, no distractions, there's only us and the storyteller. Like children who stopped squabbling and all want to know if the prince eventually finds his fair lady. Our emotions are already at stake, and the elegance with which La La Land took them out of our pocket is almost illegal. The thief doesn't even conceal himself, playing our hearts openly, and it's tempting to stop playing along and call the police. After all, the emotional manipulation is indeed a crime, even when it's so sublimely carried out.<br/><br/>Well, if you still had strength to resist, the last shreds of it fall when Ms Stone takes the lead. And it's not just her ability to act or sing, which was out of question a long time ago. It's how she takes the razor sharp blade of emotions concealed within the script, and pulls it out in one impeccable move, like King Arthur once did. And oh boy, don't you just start shivering at that moment, so bright she shines.<br/><br/>And just after that, it becomes really inevitable. The mastermind of this brilliant spectacle, Mr Chazelle, might be young, but when he's behind the wheel of a story he wrote himself, he doesn't miss. Every single romantic nonsense that we used to laugh about - like ""and she felt as if those five years have never passed, as if she was right there, in that quiet restaurant at Christmas eve, her eyes on him, as if nothing else existed"" - becomes alive in his hands, and he literally takes us on a journey others could only describe. The feeling you experience at that moment... it's pure magic, something that not only makes you forgive the pompous intro, but makes you realize that it was the only right start for something that led you where you are now. And that's when your feeling is finally complete.<br/><br/>Technically, La La Land isn't without a flaw. And if I was a grumpy old fart, I might've groaned on about it for a bit. About Ryan Gosling's questionable singing, or the plot's lack of complexity, or the ending being not what we might want it to be. But that doesn't really matter, after all, it's just technicalities. What does matter is what the film emanates - love. Love for art, love for those who dare to dream and dare to follow the dreams, who dare to be open and true. Love for life itself. The kind of love that shows the passion of the person whose heart that love flows out of. And these feelings don't just show off or simply graze you. They reach out to you. They ARE THERE for you.<br/><br/>And for letting me take that love as my own, La La Land, thank you."
"mayloveharu","4","5","10","25 February 2017"," It was so-so.
","If i had just one word to describe the movie, It would be just meh.<br/><br/>Definitely not an Oscar win for the actors. I have to mention, that Emma Stone really bothered me throughout the movie.. I don't know if it is her eyebrows or what, but, that was the biggest error.. Gosling was fine. He pulled off those little comic reliefs. <br/><br/>If you watch the movie simply for entertainment, I guarantee you will end up sleeping. I watched it at the theaters, and hell, if I watched it anywhere else, that's directly dreamland for sure. And the music is nice. So that encourages that even more. <br/><br/>There's nothing really special to the script and story line.. Just little heartbreaks and awes, but nothing much. I literally could expect what would happen, and the parts where I am supposed to feel sentimental. <br/><br/>All this hype about this movie, astounds me. I guess we were really craving for a prevalent romance movie for a while. <br/><br/>Gotta say, the visual of the overall screenplay is good. The music is nice too. Definitely not a fan of the boring story line and Stone...."
"graceheartshorses","5","5","10","21 January 2017"," Great effects and great acting... But the nostalgia overload is headache-inducing
","I saw this movie on a double date, with my best friend and these two guys that we didn't/don't know very well. It was pouring rain, there was nothing better to do, and no one wanted to see The Bye-Bye Man so this is what we saw. <br/><br/>There's a part where Mia (Stone) shows Sebastian (Gosling) her play for the first time, and asks him if it's too nostalgic. ""That's the point!"" Sebastian says, and I think that's kind of the point of this film.<br/><br/>Whatever town they showed in this movie was NOT NOT NOT Los Angeles, California. I grew up about four hours north of LA. I went there every summer. The L.A. in La La Land is a misty-eyed, nostalgic reinterpretation of the actual city. There's nothing wrong with that, but the movie tries way too hard. It's practically slapping you in the face with a giant nostalgia stick, screaming ""LOOK AT ME - I'M SWEET AND POETIC AND NOSTALGIC!"" <br/><br/>Granted, there are some moments when La La Land pulled it off. The party where Mia and Sebastian meet after he blows her off at that restaurant, and they go out and look over the city - that scene was tasteful and I forgot what I was watching. But then it just dived right back into it's glossy sweetness and I started internally screaming again.<br/><br/>I will give it credit for the whole style of the movie. The directing and sets and visual effects were stunning and new. They deserve all the awards. Stone and Gosling were fabulous actors in the roles they were given.<br/><br/>But the story and the tone are where it all falls apart. The plot left me angry at the characters and the tone of the movie was so sweet it gave me cavities.<br/><br/>The tone is a loud call for simpler times, when old stars like Taylor and Kelly and Monroe and Hepburn graced the screens. Again -- there is nothing wrong with that. But the way this movie did it was so sickeningly sugary sweet that it made my head hurt.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that it was set in modern day L.A. You can't portray modern day L.A. without showing some of the grit and dirty underhandedness and modern surge of technology and ideas. People trying to oppose my point will say that the movie did show this, through the whole 'Sebastian being ripped off by Keith (John Legend) and being forced to give up his art in that weird electro-jazz band'. But even that didn't quite do justice to the harsh realities of L.A. It was all sugar coated in dreams and songs and tap dancing and Emma Stone's goofy smile.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes was when Mia and Sebastian went to the movie and the observatory. When she ditched that Greg guy I was like ""Yes yes yes, you go get Ryan Gosling!"" During the whole hand holding thing, my date looked at me like he wanted to do the same and I kind of had to hide my hands under my legs. But hey, Mia and Sebastian made it work.<br/><br/>And the ending - oh the ending made my heart ache. If you're like me and read reviews marked 'spoiler' even if you haven't seen the film, I won't give it away, but the ending made my heart hurt in the best kind of way. I kind of want to give it 0 stars just because the ending made me so sad, but sad doesn't necessarily equal bad. Actually, I gave the movie a higher rating just because it takes one heck of a movie to make me feel some type of way.<br/><br/>Overall, it was okay. There were moments where I was grinning and laughing and cheering, and there were moments where I wanted to go bash my head against a wall. 50% great moments + 50% cheesy/terrible moments averages out to an okay movie.<br/><br/>Go see it. Or don't. I feel like this is one of those movies where people either hated it or they loved it. As for me, I saw it less than an hour ago. I'm honestly still trying to decide."
"srod-68100","10","5","10","16 January 2017"," My Favorite Musical
","To start off, let it be known that I am not a huge musical guy. I can enjoy them, I have just found it hard to take them seriously and be able to look past the awkwardness. But La La Land blew me away.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle has dazzled me before with his Oscar-worthy ""Whiplash"" and he has done it again. The music in this musical kept me interested, wanting more, anxious to hear the next. Most musicals, I can't wait for the songs to be over to hear the dialogue. Each piece had character, great choreography. Something else that helps is my love of jazz music, and I found most pieces to be ""jazzy"", so that earned itself some brownie points. <br/><br/>The actor/actress performances really surprised me. When I saw Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling starring together in a musical, I was somewhat skeptical. I knew both were wonderful, true professionals at their crafts, I just seemed to question the fact they would be doing this role together. They nailed it. Their dialogue between one another really made this musical seem ""realistic"", if you will, for me. And that went a long way in my view of this film.<br/><br/>As a whole, this film is such a beautiful thing. It's colorful, fun, comedic, pretty, charismatic. The music flows with the feel and the emotions of each scene of the movie to a T and I enjoy every track.<br/><br/>Now... The Ending...<br/><br/>So. Effing. Genius.<br/><br/>Chazelle didn't give us the ending we wanted, and we all knew exactly what we wanted. The typical love story/musical ending, and it's not what we got. But he didn't just stop there. He gave us an alternate ending, in the middle of the actual ending, and I loved it. He gave us a taste of what could have been, what we all wanted to happen so bad, but then he brought us back to reality. It crushed me, absolutely crushed me, but I loved it so so much. I wanted them to be together, but as I stated before, that wouldn't be quite ""realistic"" enough for me. <br/><br/>Sometimes, the people we run into may seem perfect, just what we need. And that's exactly what they are. But as this film shows us, sometimes we may need those people to be temporary, so we can find what we need permanently. <br/><br/>Bravo, Chazelle.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Dandy_Desmond","8","5","10","16 January 2017"," Emotion over spectacle
","I'm not big on musicals, but something about La La Land interested me to go and see it. I do admire Ryan Goslings previous work so that could have been it alongside the idea of making an old fashioned musical in the modern world I found interesting. <br/><br/>The musical numbers are very good, but they are not as spectacular as I imagined they were going to be and not as spectacular as what I have seen in old Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>However on reflection, I don't think it is trying to be. The dance scenes go for emotion rather than spectacle.<br/><br/>Other than that it was a really simple story well told. The look of the film is gorgeous, its set in LA, but its an LA that doesn't really exist except in the movies. Its a film designed to simply entertain and take you away for a couple of hours, and I must admit, it does that very well. <br/><br/>Gosling and Stone have enough chemistry to carry the simple plot throughout and there are funny moments, romantic moments and sad moments. <br/><br/>The seasonal changes gave me an inkling from the start as to where the film was going in terms of the ending but I did eventually like the way it didn't end too sugar coated. <br/><br/>One big drawback however will be the endless poor imitators that will come along on the back of it!"
"mchaka","7","5","10","14 January 2017"," Fresh, light, colorful - but a bit thin
","Saw this yesterday. Did not know what to expect. Drama and romance - well, why not. I'm a bit bored of all those superhero space adventure remakes they push nowadays.<br/><br/>Surprise! I was a bit scared when it became obvious it's a musical. I don't like many musicals. Well, luckily it was not a typical American musical but just a song here and there. Still, some of the songs felt they were just plastered over the story.<br/><br/>What was American, however, was how it was filmed. A lot of static camera with big faces on the screen. Not very ambitious but at least they avoided unnecessary trickery. A few exceptions and traditional cuts played nicely along the story.<br/><br/>I loved the colors.<br/><br/>The story is a bit thin. I felt a there wasn't that much chemistry between the characters but perhaps that was exactly the point. And it was light at the same time, not very dramatic after all. Refreshing.<br/><br/>Singing and music sounded real and not too perfect - which was perfect after all. Sadly there isn't any Jazz clubs in this town. I'd be sitting there very very often. Perhaps I should set up one myself.<br/><br/>I can see they tried to copy the vibe of some classic movies but unfortunately fell a bit short. Quite far at the same time."
"KarenAM","10","5","10","14 January 2017"," Here's to the one who dream
","Unhappy is a person who never dared to dream. This world and our mind have the endless opportunities and we have to be really miserable to even try to suppress those opportunities, because without our perfectional ideas and notions of life and how we should live it, we become empty bodies and let physiology do its thing. Only when you dare to dream you let yourself flow in a world of pure imagination and possibilities, you create your individuality and slightly optimistic and romantic perception of life which helps you get through the tough times and standard routines of daily life. Having the hope that someday you can achieve whatever you have pictured in your head gives you wings and positives to go on. And this one's for dreamers out there who dared to dream and achieved something in their life, for those who are on their way to do so and for those who are too scared to try. Yes, it may go in a completely different direction, but you will never know until you try. Sometimes life has better things to offer than we can imagine and it may lead to something wonderful and new. Lumiere brothers had only visions in their heads and ambitions when they invented film as we know it now, being inspired by Thomas Edison and others. Would they have done it if they never chased the dream? You know the answer. The answer is A Trip to the Moon, City Lights, Casablanca, Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Schindler's List, Lord of the Rings and La La Land. The latter one is a perfect addition to the history of cinema, absolutely deserving of all the praise it receives. Would I change anything in it? Not a single word or move. From the astonishing play of colors and tones to the hopeful and sparkling eyes of the characters were captured wonderfully by one of the bravest and inspiring dreamers of modern Hollywood - Damien Chazelle. Dreaming is simple, he made it clear to himself and to the audience with this movie. No tricky turns and twists in the story line, no complicated dialogues. Everything is clear to the point that it lets you just enjoy the whole spectacle with a bit of nostalgia of your own forgotten dreams, of where you are right now in your life and where are you heading to. All of this is spiced up with magical hidden character called music. From City of Stars to the last note of Mia & Sebastian's Theme, the soundtrack is wonderful. It is cheerful, it is sad, it is hopeful and simply mesmerizing. Undoubtedly the best film in recent years deserving of all the golden statues including the main one for best picture, proving that the best movie of the year can be about a simple subject and not about a slumdog boy who becomes millionaire or a king struggling with his speech, or American heroes saving lives in Iran or elsewhere. This movie is relatable to everyone. Although dreamers or la la landers are considered to be out of this world and not aware of what is happening, we are all still foolishly, with a bit of hope and enthusiasm, trying to chase our dreams and create our own world of reality. So here's to the one who dream."
"monsterkue","10","5","10","9 January 2017"," A beautiful love letter to every foolish lovers and dreamers in the universe.
","okay let's start from the beginning of the movie.from the beginning it's already obvious what kind of movie that we're going to get.a bunch of people dancing in the middle of traffic with colorful outfits. they're singing a song from the soundtrack called ""Another Day of Sun"" which I would like you guys to check it out. this opening really sets the tone of the movie, a very colorful and hopeful movie. <br/><br/>i was shocked by how bright this movie is. because i'm so used to movies that's dark and gritty.the opening sequence of this movie was filmed in a way so it seems like it was filmed in one take. which in my opinion is just amazing. i don't know how they did it, but it works, and it looks awesome. the song, combined with a great choreography, and swift camera movement. this combination is what makes La La Land so good.<br/><br/>not just that, the performances are also really good. Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, all did a terrific job in this movie. particularly Emma Stone. the entire movie works because of her. I think she did most of the jobs. She sings, dancing, acting, and does a lot of stuff that's just amazing. I mean Ryan Gosling did bits too. but, you'll know why I think Emma Stone is the one who gave the best performance in this movie once you saw the movie yourself.<br/><br/>La La Land also use colors in a very interesting way. as I said before, this movie is very colorful. although not as strong as Nicolas Winding Refn's usage of colors. this movie also use color to elevate the emotion of a scene. the most prominent color in this movie is Purple. i don't know why, but it works so well. you'll see purple everywhere.<br/><br/>also, the lighting works. oh my god.. it reminds me to a lot of movies from back in the day. fair to say this movie has one of the best visual works of the year. <br/><br/>as someone who have ""Jazz"" as his own name. I can't appreciate this movie more. if you're a big fan of music Jazz. you'll have a blast, Jazz is basically one of the strongest aspect of this movie. throughout the entirety of the movie. I always think of my dad. he'll love this movie so much. Ryan Gosling's character is in someway, represent my dad. he is so passionate about Jazz, and he's sad cause no one can relate to him. which brings us to the next point, and the most important aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>what is this movie about? lots of people are saying that this movie is a love letter to LA or even an homage to the golden age of Hollywood. while it's not wrong either, LA looks amazing in this movie, the way it's shot, it looks great. and it's obvious as well that Damian Chazelle is trying to pay homage to the Golden Era. by how this movie begins and ended.<br/><br/>but at its core, this movie is about passionate people. about the one who dreams. about how it doesn't matter how foolish you seem you should go out there and go for your dream. go for anything you want in life. and it's also about the sacrifices that we have to make along the way. that even though we might get what we want in life, we still not going to get everything. there's a price to everything.<br/><br/>and all of that, told in a very beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking way. much like life itself.<br/><br/>which is why i'm also going to talk about the ending. don't worry it's not a spoiler. i was worried with how this movie is going to end. cause i don't really want a clich√©d ending just to keep the ""good-feeling"" but no guys, the ending is amazing, it's not clich√© at all. it's amazing, you'll loved it.<br/><br/>the ending was pretty much the same like the opening. but more beautiful, and unique. by same I mean, done with dancing and music.<br/><br/>and as a dreamer, who's at times is an absolute fool. i am in love with this movie, and you'll probably think i'm biased but if i say the otherwise, then i'll be lying. I love this movie, and this movie is definitely going to be a movie that i'll watch again and again until i'm dying. <br/><br/>Great, great film!"

The choreography was not strained, the songs both told an important story and more important sounded good and the chemistry in Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters was absolutely terrific.

"nandidot","10","5","10","4 January 2017"," Sublime, Beautiful, and Award Worthy
","There are several scenes in 'La La Land' that have no dialogue; only a dreamy background score and the actors' expressions guide you through. The beautiful thing here is that you don't miss the spoken word at all. This and many other things make La La Land a subliminal watch. It is a gorgeous movie full of heart and soul and I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>The film is a musical journey about an aspiring actress and an undervalued jazz musician who meet at a low point in their lives and keep running into each other until sparks fly. The story traces their life as they find themselves and pursue their dreams whilst falling in love. The musical genre isn't my favorite (odd I know since I adore Indian movies) but this isn't just about the song and dance routine though that's an integral part of the film. The movie starts with rush hour in LA and people from all walks of life sing their way through the chaos. This first number sets a tone that's rare for movies nowadays, joy. However, the movie isn't all happy, the characters grow, face rejection, fight, but interestingly the mood is never bleak. Its charm is infectious and leaves you wanting to tap your feet.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and perfectly cast as Mia and Sebastian. Ms. Stone delights as a struggling actress whose eyes speak volumes and who can make the most trivial of activities seem noteworthy. At the risk of sounding too cheesy she is the heart while Mr. Gosling is the soul of this gorgeous masterpiece. He is charming without arrogance. He is funny, slightly broken, and good- a lethal combination. Both complement each other marvelously and the chemistry they've built over the years can almost be touched.<br/><br/>There are ample songs in the narrative, of course, and they are enough to whet the palate without leaving you feeling burdened. The singing isn't perfect but we can't expect our actors to do everything flawlessly. The choreography and the ease with which the characters dance is applaudable. As the seasons change you notice brilliantly executed shifts in our leads without ever losing the essence of the movie. There's a fine screenplay at work here. Bravo Damien Chazelle, your vision is glorious. Watch this film, you'll find ample reasons to love it. I left the theatre feeling a little giddy with a smile on face.

Yes, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both charismatic actors and enjoyable to watch, but even they are not able to move the film above average plus. I felt like I was watching a fairly good Woody Allen film that kept getting interrupted by musical numbers. One of my pet peeves with musicals is when the music comes in without any reason other then to have a musical number at that moment. Music in the best of musicals should further the story - not stop it mid stream. I was really disappointed as the hype had led me to expect a truly ground-breaking return to the Hollywood musical. It isn't."

The song in the movie ""The fools who dream"" aptly conveys the message of the movie ""Here's to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem, here's to the hearts that ache, here's to the mess we make"". <br/><br/>The movie is already leading golden globe award nominations and won in 8 out of 11 nominated categories in the Critic's Choice Awards.

I love good movie and stage musicals having worked half my life in them."

","Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that is so good that it almost feels strange to have lived in a world where the film didn't exist. ""La La Land"" is exactly that type of movie.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""La La Land"" tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles: Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club. Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions. After a couple of chance meetings, however, they discover that it may just take their beliefs in each other to make those dreams come true.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is a kind of throwback movie to Old Hollywood in that it is a musical filled with many singing and dancing numbers. Each song is spectacular (a production in and of itself) and is important to the overall plot and character development within the film. I can all but guarantee that you will be listening to the soundtrack for days, weeks, or potentially longer.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes this an all-time classic from the opening credits, however, is its ability to combine those musical numbers with a rock-solid plot. This isn't a ""fluff"" picture by any stretch of the imagination, as it contains deep themes of perseverance, the power of relationships, and following one's dreams. The songs, dances, plots, and characters all weave together to create a perfect tapestry of emotion.<br/><br/>It doesn't hurt, obviously, that the chemistry between leads Gosling and Stone is absolutely off- the-charts...truly the stuff of legends. I now sort of understand why audiences some 80-90 years ago. Cultivated from their first film together (""Crazy Stupid Love""), the Gosling-Stone combination was perfect for ""La La Land"", as the relationship between their characters is what makes the whole thing work.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the ways in which I was supremely impressed by ""La La Land"", but suffice it to say here that it was one of the most entertaining, emotional journeys that the cinema has taken me on in quite some time. This film will likely sweep the Academy Awards, and I wouldn't be disappointed if that indeed happens. My brother recently moved out to LA to pursue his own filmmaking dream, so ""La La Land"" also hit me on a personal level. For anyone who wants to pursue a dream, though, this is the movie for you."

"gaxiola_fk","10","6","13","21 February 2017"," La La Land - Review
","Year: 2017 Director: Damien Chazelle <br/><br/>La La Land, a musical like I've never heard before. Let's talk about the plot, a novice actress and a frustrated pianist fall in love in California, in the city where both of them try to achieve their dreams. Talking about the introduction, the film opens with a big piece of music and dance that doesn't do another thing than prepare the terrain for what is coming. Mia (Stone) is a charismatic women with the dream of becoming an actress and Sebastian (Gosling) is a jazz pianist that dreams with opening his own club of jazz music. The movie give you shots of chemical in some parts that make us arrive to the scene where they finally meet and the well created qualities of the characters make them fall in love. The development of the film is technically the story of a couple fighting against their own and unique dreams, but the narration through songs and dances transforms the movie into a refined and entertaining production. The pursuit of their dreams border them to finish their relation but knowing that none of them would be in this part of their lives without the other, the scene of the fight in the dinner is good but if there would be something that I won't forget, that is the scene where they meet again at the club 5 years later, they only see each other imagining a life together if only they had taken different decisions. The performance of both main characters is excellent, I'm impressed of how good, humans and relatable characters Chazelle had created. Mia is insecure and strong at the same time while Seb is a man with a deep love for jazz music and always wants to feel that he has the control, even if he doesn't. Gosling playing the piano is fantastic and the way the camera film a dance scene, moving while the character does and the organization of that amount of dancers is amazing too. <br/><br/>Finally, La La Land is a beautiful film about love and disappointment, the story tell us how hard is to achieve yours dreams and how strong the life can hit you. Life is simple until you find the right person, everything becomes more complicated and pretty at the same time. Both of the characters established the foundations of what they are at the end and tell u show important is love to achieve your dreams and how important are your dreams to achieve love. An inspiring movie about the sacrifices that some people do to get that sacred thing called success."
"thechoctopfilmblog","10","6","13","13 February 2017"," A film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm
","A film of spontaneous, colourful magic and charm, La La Land captivates us from the very first scene. Visually, it is spectacular. All the elements sing in harmony and coalesce together to form a beautiful artwork. It was director Damian Chazelle ('Whiplash')'s dream for many years to get this film made, and what a passionate, special film he has created. It is a treat for your eyes and ears, and especially your heart.<br/><br/>But let's talk about that opening scene. A hundred dancers, enthusiastically and joyously dancing and singing during a traffic jam on a freeway. Chazelle doesn't wait, he gives us the best from the very start. As the audience, we are immediately enchanted by a symphony of joy and delightful music. I won't spoil the entire scene, but it is done with such incredible craft and skill, it will be remembered for a long time to come.<br/><br/>On that freeway, our protagonists, Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) are introduced. Both are struggling artists, trying to find their way in LA. Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a talented pianist, determined to revive and preserve traditional jazz music. Through a series of chance meetings, the two eventually fall for each other, and pursue their dreams, with one another by their side. The chemistry between and Stone and Gosling is undeniably instantaneous. The fiery intensity of their connection reminded me of the classic Hollywood couples we admired and loved, like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.<br/><br/>A city of dreams, there is no better place than LA to tell this story. On the surface, to those of us unfamiliar with the true essence and identity of the city, we can easily be mesmerised by its allure and its potential for achieving our romanticised ideals. Chazelle wanted to re-create the classic and nostalgic look of the city during the 1950s, and he has successfully captured not just the aesthetic, but also the timeless feeling the city exudes, with a tinge of novelty. To Chazelle, the sound of LA is jazz. Justin Hurwitz's score is a blend of pure extravagance and subtlety. With its jazz influences and undertones, each note tells a story of its own. The trumpet gave the film its life and energy, while the piano touched our hearts and soothed our soul.<br/><br/>I was particularly awestruck at the daedal use of light and the camera-work in this film. Each shot must have been planned meticulously, and yet, they appear very natural. The dance sequences are flawless, effortlessly blending in with the story itself. The hilltop dance between Stone and Gosling - I can imagine just how much effort was invested to get it perfect. As it is taken in one shot, one mistake meant that they would have to start again.<br/><br/>The characters of Mia and Sebastian essentially embody our hopes for romance and our passions. Their journey begins with zealous optimism and as the story progresses, the harsh realities begin to emerge and unveil themselves as they navigate through the challenges. Each one is extremely relatable. In this respect, La La Land is essentially a realistic fairy-tale. In the first half, we are overwhelmed by its elegance and beauty, and in the latter half, we get opportunities to rest our eyes a little, and that is when our hearts start to feel. Beneath the dazzling facade, the story waits for us to discover that warm, but painfully real dynamic that exists between Mia and Sebastian. The music gave this film its rhythm, but it is the love story between these characters that gave La La Land its heartbeat. <br/><br/>Each frame of La La Land could be paused, and turned into an exquisite photograph. I am very glad for the success of Whiplash, otherwise this film may not have been made the way it did. It is creative, refreshing, and daringly speaks to our emotions. The songs, the dances, the story and the characters are immensely addictive. The ending of La La left me stunned. It took a while for me to process what has just happened. But this is why this film is so great. The audience is incredibly invested into these characters and when we get results that we didn't expect, we understand it. It would just take a little while for our hearts to mend."
"joshteggert","10","6","13","17 January 2017"," Overspilling with artistic originality, class and wit, ""La La Land"" promises to be one of the greatest films of this generation
","""La La Land"" is utterly wonderful; a remarkable blend of romantic idealism with the harshness of reality, Damien Chazelle illustrates the Los Angeles setting delightfully, capturing the everyday difficulties of life within love and the external challenges it entails with sharp confidence yet absolute serenity. Exploding with beautiful visual contrasts, expertly demonstrating the director's vision of the romanticised average dreamer's lifestyle, ""La La Land"" emerges as undeniably one of the defining movies of the decade, if not the century. And if not that, the new pinnacle of both the romantic and musical genres alike.<br/><br/>All singing, all dancing, ""La La Land"" boasts some of the best choreographed dance scenes in popular culture of recent memory, and huge credit is deserved to choreographer Mandy Moore who has managed to orchestrate multiple intensely exhilarating movements that so beautifully complement Chazelle's chosen one-shot style. Collectively, the filmmakers have successfully managed to transport the viewers right back to the classic ages of Hollywood: to the era of musicals, playing with nostalgia so respectfully as head cinematographer Linus Sandgren provides us with shots of such magnificence, it truly is a modern art film of unprecedented prosperity.<br/><br/>The film contains a glorious soundtrack, written by Chazelle's Harvard University friend Justin Hurwitz, who manages to grasp the fantastical nature of the film excellently. The songs remain resonant after the credits have rolled, each of them classics in the making, which is exactly what one would hope for in a fresh new musical.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie conjugates to form this masterful outcome with extraordinary spontaneity; nothing ever feels rushed or forced as each scene flows from one to the next naturally, driven by the dynamic character force and chemistry between lead actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Stone shines the brightest, proudly demonstrating her ability to perform, sing and dance throughout, thus completely nailing each scene she is in. She feels perfectly fitted for this part, handpicked by Chazelle after he saw her in ""Cabaret"". Their respective commitment to these roles is also highly commendable, Gosling went through intensive training and learned jazz piano in just three months, and listening to the outcome, it is rather difficult to believe judging by how eloquently he plays. Both look like they are enjoying themselves immensely, dancing and singing with such fluency and passion, which reflects onto the screen sensationally.<br/><br/>And that is ultimately what makes this film so great: it's the dedication of the people involved to making something that one can simply enjoy and appreciate in its own right. It is easy to see that Chazelle has been dreaming of doing this project all his life, and the product of his fantasies is an outstanding spectacle of pure joy; a genuine heartfelt translation of stage onto screen done with such admirable grace, it has certainly earned every shred of praise it gets, and much, much more."
"themadmovieman","10","6","13","16 January 2017"," As perfect as a film can be
","I don't like to say it often, but I think it's pretty much impossible for anyone with a heart and soul to dislike La La Land. It's an exceptionally joyful and uplifting film, full of vibrant and delightful settings, dance numbers and cinematography. It's also a story for the ages, with an incredibly relatable and often bittersweet look at the difficult path to achieving your dreams. Its lead performances are amazing, Damien Chazelle gives arguably one of the best directing performances of all time, and most of all, its music is wonderful.<br/><br/>There's so much to talk about with La La Land, and all of it is good. However, I think it's best to start with the man who both directed and wrote this absolute masterpiece: Damien Chazelle. His previous outing with Whiplash was something incredibly special, and already seen as a modern classic, but he goes to new lengths to indulge his love for cinema and music with La La Land.<br/><br/>And this isn't the sort of self-indulging passion project like some recent Tarantino and Scorsese films that seem to be made to entertain the directors themselves more than anyone else, because Chazelle is all too pleased to take us along on a magical journey through the wondrous place where dreams are made and broken, harking back to the Golden Age of Hollywood better than any film before.<br/><br/>With his dynamic visual style, the film has wonderful energy and ambition, strengthening the story of our main characters striving to achieve their dreams. However, the way in which he uses so many motifs from Classic Hollywood, including the bright, vibrant colours of the costumes, long and elegant instrumental sequences, and even the odd touch of a film-noir vibe from time to time, is such a joy for any film fan to see. With so many little details about Hollywood past and present sprinkled here and there, I could watch this film a million times and still be utterly enchanted by its love for the movies.<br/><br/>But what's even more impressive is that the film's screenplay is also written by Damien Chazelle. The film's story may sound like cheesy and fanciful rubbish at first, but the success of the film's story is testament to how good Chazelle's writing is. Uplifting, joyful and wonderfully magical at almost every moment, the central romance is spellbinding to follow, whilst the conviction that our two main characters have to achieve their dreams, even if they get knocked down from time to time, is so admirable to see. The result of that is that we have a story in which it's so easy to care about the protagonists' hopes and ambitions, and an absolute pleasure to spend two hours with them as they navigate a turning point in their lives.<br/><br/>The thing is, Chazelle goes one better than an uplifting and magical musical by also providing some emotionally riveting themes. Particularly as the film moves towards a spectacular and what I'm sure will be legendary finale, Chazelle inserts some beautifully tender and bittersweet emotions to the story, as well as providing an exceptionally unpredictable and innovative way to tell a story of star-crossed lovers.<br/><br/>Next up are the central performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. We've seen the two work brilliantly on screen together in Crazy Stupid Love, but there's something even more magical about their partnership in La La Land.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact that they make a wonderfully convincing and captivating romantic couple on screen, there's never a moment where one overshadows the other. The two work together to make their characters so lovable and fascinating, and that means that, whilst there's always so much to be impressed by in their incredibly dynamic individual performances, there's nothing more special than seeing them together on screen.<br/><br/>Whether that's in some of the film's more blissful romantic periods, or whether they're sparring, they both play off one another with ease, and make for the most entertaining and energetic leading lady and gentleman I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And whilst Stone and Gosling aren't quite Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly when it comes to the vocals, their singing is just as good as their acting. However, as a lot of the music in La La Land is a little more restrained than classic 40s and 50s musicals, it requires a less showy singing voice.<br/><br/>And that leads me nicely into the one thing that might make you reluctant to see La La Land: the music. I love a good movie musical, and my favourites are all from the 1940s-60s era, just what this film is a love letter to. Put simply, however, La La Land is easily my favourite musical of all time, and undoubtedly one of the best ever made.<br/><br/>When so many movie musicals fail to weave storytelling and musical numbers together, La La Land does it so effortlessly. The moments where the characters break into song feel completely natural, and the songs themselves aren't just entertaining toe-tappers, but integral parts of the story, that accomplish storytelling better than any musical I've ever seen. As such, I was always overjoyed when the characters broke into song, something that I've never really felt before in a musical.<br/><br/>So, overall, I was completely spellbound by La La Land. Doing something that no movie musical has ever done to me before, making me excited to see a story told through song, as well as providing an uplifting, funny and wonderfully joyful story, the film is a real delight. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's performances are pitch- perfect, whilst Damien Chazelle's innovative and passionate writing and directing are the icing on the cake for this absolute triumph of a film."

"Dan_L","6","6","13","8 January 2017"," Fun, But Doesn't Live Up to the Hype
","Unlike Bruce Springsteen in 1973 (and beyond), ""La La Land"" just doesn't live up to the hype. I love a good musical (and it's only fair to put this in perspective - subjectively speaking my favorite musicals include South Pacific (film and play), Singin' in the Rain (objectively best film musical), Miss Saigon, My Fair Lady (film), Little Shop of Horrors, Les Miz (play; the film was mediocre at best), and the musical scenes in Gremlins 2).<br/><br/>But while ""La La Land"" was generally fun, it lacked memorable tunes and outside of the two leads and J.K. Simmons, I'm having trouble remembering any of the other characters. While the ""alternative universe"" section near the end was very moving, the rest of the film just lacked soul.<br/><br/>I think it's so successful due, in part, to the hype and the mental depression more than half the voters are in following the monster's election Nov. 8. It's escapism that is badly needed. And its success also comes in part from the dumbing down of the American people (which accounts in large part for the results of Nov 8) most of whom wouldn't recognize a high quality musical.<br/><br/>I suspect the film will do well in the awards season, but if it garners the Oscar for ""Best Picture,"" it will be another miscarriage of justice like ""The Artist"" winning over ""Hugo"" and ""Gandhi"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" winning at all."
"Quinoa1984","10","7","16","18 December 2016"," La La Land
","I wonder if I had just stumbled upon this movie, being Damien Chazelle's third as director, not knowing anything or knowing little about it, if I would've liked/loved/fallen head over heels for it more than I did. Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Roller-coaster its clich√©d status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.<br/><br/>Sometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always ""correct"" as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall- sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the clich√©s that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.<br/><br/>Which, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE I've EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in clich√©, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).<br/><br/>... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.<br/><br/>My first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is ""better"" than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the ""dream"" of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second."

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are here to dazzle you with this movie musical serving as ode to both 1950's musicals and screenwriter-director Damien Chazelle's love for jazz. <br/><br/>The story is generic but cosy as your favorite pillow: jazz pianist boy meets waitress / aspiring actress girl and they fall in love. And then a whole bunch of people dance and sing. <br/><br/>The two lovely stars are both singing and dancing themselves, doing a good job at that. Still, personally I'd have chosen an actress with stronger on screen presence to pair up with already-legendary Gosling. But you know, whatever.<br/><br/>I am not actually into musicals, so for me, by far the most impressive thing about this feel-good crowdpleaser is the boss man behind the screen: Damien Chazelle. <br/><br/>The dude is only nearly 32 years old but he has done three movies already, always as a director and a sole screenwriter. You know him better as the author of 2014's majestic surprise hit ""Whiplash"".<br/><br/>So... go see it. If you like musicals, you will be pleased. If you don't care about them, there's still enough feel-good stuff to enjoy the ride for 128 minutes.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of ""Whiplash"" dying to get another dose of Chazelle, then be prepared for a nice surprise in the form of certain bald guy who should have a bigger role here for sure."

The long musical sequences often border on the surreal, taking the shape of a wonderful dream with dance numbers in the clouds and in the stars. Yet at times the pacing of the film seems to trail off to a point of being boring, this is quickly remedied, but remains an aspect that should be looked at in editing. <br/><br/>Watching ""La La Land"" is like being awake during a wondrous dream, there is something unique and magical about the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian as well as the visuals of Los Angeles that surround them. As he sits at his piano, Sebastian sweetly and softly sings Mia a love song, a powerful couple of lines that represent love, art and life. ""City of Stars, are you shining just for me, City of Stars there so much that I can see, Who knows is this the start of something wonderful and new, Or one more dream that I cannot make true."" With ""La La Land"" a dream has come true, and made its way onto the big screen."

","This movie is about a romance story between a man and a woman. A man would like to own his bar which he can play jazz music as he likes. He meets a woman who would like to be an actress in a jazz bar. First, they do not like each other, but a closer relationship between them is brought by a common hobby. I like a lot of dancing and singing scenes, especially ""A lovely Night"". This scene has a singing part in the former half and a dancing part in the latter half. They say ""you are not type for me"" and ""Our relationship never becomes a romance"" to each other, so I can understand they do not like one another. However, I am fascinating of their harmonious tap dance as I do not feel they do not like each other. I am impressed with the first scene that many people dance in a highway, First, I do not think this scene is related to the story, but it is the important scene that the man and encounters the woman. The song and dance are so attractive , so I think it is a good introduction. I can enjoy the process of developing their love, and music and dance. I cannot expect the ending, but I like this movie as I bought a sound track CD."

This ""La La l Land"" should stand before the International Criminal Court to answer for its outrageous crimes against humanity. I couldn't leave since I was the guy projecting the movie. I wish I had had a can of petrol and a lighter to set the screen on fire. The audience would have applaud. At least,the half of it that had remained sitting and winning the eternal salvation. Can anyone tell me what the hell the story was about? After one hour nothing happened; after two hours, the same. The best part was when it ended. Thank God for having listened to my prayers! The whole movie was forgettable after 5 minutes. But the feeling and imprint left in my brain will not disappear in a thousand years and for sure I will need psychiatric assistance from now on. I have that (single) piano key sounding in my mind continuously. There are no language or words that could describe this attack on intelligence and human dignity. Please, do not watch this movie!!! For god's sake!!!!. You'll save your money, time and mental health. The story was beyond rubbish, the music... I'd rather be deaf. The acting was below absolute zero. And the length...oh, my god! Have you ever watched ""The Neverending Story""? That one did have an end but this one was the real neverending story, so eternal, so boring. The worst, worst movie I've seen in 40 years. And most of the merit goes to the fact that they tried to sell it as the best of the best but it really is the best of the worst. It was awarded 6 Oscars!!!???? How come? Did the jury toss a coin to see who wins them? This is a kind of ""musical"" that would hurt a deaf person's ears. And I totally agree with one reviewer: finding nemo is much better, light- years better than this crap crap land. I didn't actually have great expectations about it, maybe just killing time.

"warren-87235","6","3","5","21 May 2017"," Just 'Okay'
","Honestly, despite the critics I wasn't blown away. I can see why the critics loved it so much, though. It's a heavy handed love-letter to Hollywood musicals and Hollywood history and life. It feels like a film made for L.A. critics rather than the audience. If you take away the musical and directorial elements, the love story is so clich√©d (yes, even the 'bittersweet' ending has become a clich√© nowadays, when you want to be seen as being different and going against the 'Hollywood ending' and 'embracing gritty, real life')<br/><br/>The worst bit wasn't the ending, however. That could be forgiven. the worst bit was the contrived ""Oh, yes, he's too busy with work to see her one-woman play, which spells the end¬Ö"" That was the low point of the movie for me. It was a cringe-worthy plot contrivance that's been done a million times, and usually not in so heavy handed a way. Damien Chazelle seems capable of writing the 'happier' bits well enough, because he can fall back on his love of cheerful/colourful musicals, but the more dramatic elements felt like he relied on the stereotypes and heavy handed symbolism. Oooh, their relationship fails in 'The Fall'? Just when they've had an argument, the smoke alarm goes off, because he's forgotten the meal cooking in the oven, that comes out all burnt and over- done?<br/><br/>The songs also feel a little forced, but it makes sense when you watch the making-of, and realise that the music was written first, and other people were brought in to quite literally force lyrics into the music, rather than both being created at the same time. This is a flimsy, clich√©-ridden story written to join dance routines and music together.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's fun enough and a bit different (if only stylistically). I'll admit I did love some of the filming, and was very impressed by some of the direction. After watching the making-of, and seeing the passion and enthusiasm that went into it, and how someone got to make their dream project, I really wanted to like the movie more. In fact, I actually admire the Hollywood producers who wanted to back something that was a passion- project, rather than something designed purely with the box-office in mind. Unfortunately it all ends up a bit mediocre, unless you're a critic who wants to praise it simply for being a love-letter to the superior Hollywood musicals that inspired it. This is for musical lovers, what Jupiter Ascending is for action movie lovers. Great visuals and design, some amazing direction, some good actors get roped in, and... That's about it. You come away neither disappointed nor elated."
"acinemafan","3","3","5","15 May 2017"," Ruined by the ending
","Without giving anything away, there is a stark tonal shift at the close of the movie, and this is a major problem. People likely watched/will want to watch this movie for it's romantic, nostalgic nod to Hollywood. That's the way ""La La Land"" was advertised. And the majority of the film follows what was promoted -- except the ending. And that ruins the movie.<br/><br/>Upon doing some reading after seeing the movie, the director was trying to be complex with the ending, and, perhaps because of his youth and inexperience as a filmmaker, it looks like he was trying to be too clever.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" was a repeat viewing movie -- until the ending. And now, I just want to forget about this movie, and am glad it didn't win Best Picture."

","Obviously there is a little of a problem when you watch a movie as acclaimed as this one, this will always generate a slightly unfair expectation bias.<br/><br/>Still, battling through opening scenes which are simply boring, wondering when the movie may start taking a few unexpected turns, dreading the reappearance of people singing mediocrely and without much inspiration, not much good can be said about the first hour. <br/><br/>And even the rest I spent far from captivated by a disastrously simple story line: Girl meets boy repeatedly, they fall in love, both are very talented and under-appreciated artists, boy acts stupid, girl sets him straight, one row and the relationship is on pause, boy rescues girl from low self-esteem, they both have to follow their dream which rips them apart, years later they meet again, both successful and appreciated now, still love each other, but oh the tragedy they can't be together. <br/><br/>And before we can leave we have to sit through an alternative universe dream where everything went perfect.<br/><br/>There is basically a complete absence of witty dialog, all elements are pieced together to self-celebrate Hollywood, at times the picture gets so cheesy the screen threatens to turn into caramel. Add a happy-end and you would doubtlessly leave with a sugar overdose. As it is, it's tolerable. <br/><br/>What's rescuing this movie from the jaws of lethal pathos is its cinematographic master class, the electric magic between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling which is well-proved by now, and a main score track which carries some spice. The sheer number of awards this movie has received is hard to understand for me."

When scenes fade to black to put the main protagonists at the center of the pictures, these are well done. Emma Stone is extremely photogenic and looked great in that picture. Ryan Gosling has the charm he is known for. Color, contrast, visuals, these were great to see. Some of the scenes almost felt like paintings or work of art.<br/><br/>Emma Stone range of emotions and acting are that of a great actress. She gave life to the movie. I wasn't really convinced by Ryan Gosling acting though. He always seem to play the same guy in all of his movies :s.<br/><br/>About the songs and the pace of the movie, they felt really really dull. I kept looking at my watch and waiting for it to be over. Maybe a second screening is necessary but that was the feeling I had while watching the movie.<br/><br/>The songs didn't feel full of energy, they mostly made me want to sleep.<br/><br/>The main issue I had with the ""story"" of the movie is that it goes in messy plain delirium sometimes.<br/><br/>The instrumental parts, without any people singing, were really good. Especially the piano parts. These were the parts that lent the most emotions and getting us to dream in my humble opinion.

","I can defend almost everything about this movie, like certain leaps of logic. That's normal for the genre. Gosling and Stone's vocals start out flatly, but they grow into the songs. The colors and Emma's dresses were eye catching. <br/><br/>They began with a peppy dance number, right before we meet the hero & heroine. The movie should have ended that way--before the epilogue. Musicals usually have tacked-on happy endings, not tacked-on depressing endings. I felt cheated, and thought, ""This doesn't make sense."""

The main storyline of the movie is the relationship between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). To be fair the two leads throw themselves into the movie and there is certainly chemistry between them. <br/><br/>To be honest there was probably less music and dance than I expected.

Nearly every scene socks you in the face with a bright, over-saturated colour palate of primary colours; blues, greens, reds and yellows. The music is completely forgettable, with not one song and dance number standing out. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty generic and takes no unexpected turns. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they each succeed with their careers but this causes them to break up. The End. Seriously, that is the whole plot of La La Land. Beef that flimsy premise out to 2 hours of movie with plenty of boring songs and watch the Oscars come pouring in.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the chemistry and acting of the two leads, which while not Oscar worthy, was adequate.

The music is extraordinary and dare I say it one of the best film scores ever. Damien Chazelle is truly a poetic genius and I believe on track to be one of the greatest film directors ever (I also love his 2014 film Whiplash). In regards to the 14 Academy Award nominations I see why many think that's too many nominations but when you look into detail at what they were nominated for it does make sense because this film, at least in my opinion, is very well put together. The sound nominations they received, for example, were deserved (granted I never thought they would win them anyway) because they do have to blend a lot of sounds together with the singing and dancing, and that can actually be very tricky especially with the bigger numbers. The plot is simple but the way it's told is very unique and enjoyable. All around an amazing film in every aspect."
"Robert_duder","5","4","8","2 May 2017"," Average in every way and maybe a little unique but not worthy of the acclaim
","To me, the Oscars nowadays means that the critics all got together and decided to play a popularity contest that quite often the mainstream movie going public doesn't see eye to eye with. I love musicals...like adore them...so I was excited for LaLa Land and so I was disappointed and confused by the fact that it did not come close to fulfilling expectations. I will say there were a couple of scenes that were very well done. The film has a unique vibe that is timeless and some of the dance and music scenes are reminiscent of an era gone by. It is definitely an artistic film. However, the story and the characters and the climax of the film is utterly and completely bland. It's not the type of film I could watch more than once and I don't understand how it is even classified as a musical when it had very few blatant musical numbers and it felt like it was more about jazz or ""LaLa Land"" itself than the music. The hardest part to accept was the lack of chemistry with the stars and just the overall lack of a solid story to hold onto.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is notable for this film because she is Emma Stone. She has an undeniable chemistry on screen and it always works at least a little bit. Still her struggling character actress is okay at best and she never really goes through any arc at all and you're left feeling very underwhelmed. Ryan Gosling honestly is downright terrible. I don't know if it's the writing or what but his character is vapid and empty and boring. Their ""romance"" is silly and contrived and it never takes off despite them trying desperately to make you root for these two. Somehow the ""music"" brings them together and their love of the arts. There is some supporting cast but honestly no one comes even close to being memorable or stepping up to anything. It's overall a very large disappointment.<br/><br/>If the film was just a few dance scenes with Gosling and Stone I might be inclined to love it but unfortunately they make you sit through a sub-par story first. I guess the choreography and some of the scenes are worth noting. The thing is I adore writer and director Damien Chazelle. Whiplash was literally incredible. Easily one of the best films of the year. I had such high hopes this would be more of the same and I get the art behind it and the neon glow and the story of Los Angeles and struggling artists but there is no meat here. There is nothing that captivates you and a film that won all kinds of awards and (nearly) won Best Picture is barely memorable. Film schools might study it but for me once is enough. 5/10"

The story itself kinda makes me want to vomit in my mouth, though it did seem like they were going for a rather corny set up so I won't let personal bias get in the way of that.<br/><br/>Bottom line, you don't really care about either of these characters. Their love is nothing gripping, its not forbidden or difficult for that matter, and he doesn't even have to try and woo her, just keeps running into her and eventually he must think ""alright might as well give it a try this is the 5th time i've seen her""<br/><br/>cannot believe that this has a 99% rating on sites I usually rely on, must be a candidate for the most over-hyped movie of all time, and to the critics that gave it 10 stars shame on you for diluting the quality Hollywood should be able to achieve.<br/><br/>If you want an award winning movie that delivers on raw & truthful emotion and the human experience, see what Moonlight did for 1/20th (yes, check me) the budget."
"josegomeztorres030196","10","4","8","25 April 2017"," For Love at Art
","What better way to use my first review for this wonderful movie. La La Land is the new project of Damien Chazelle, director who followed when he showed a Hollywood of what was capable with his exciting Whiplash. And it's that, if we talk about Chazelle, we talk about passion, and the love he brings loaded on video every time he plays a camera. We're facing one of the best cinematographic works of recent years, inviting to dream, love, singing, dancing... And for this, they put us in the context of the two protagonists, Mia Dolan played by Emma Stone and Sebastian Wilder, played by Ryan Gosling. This endearing pair of artists have already worked seamlessly on previous tapes, performing the roles of an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist who end up falling in love after being in various situations in the city of Los Angeles. From the premise, which we have heard of her a thousand times, we can find in this story also miles of reasons to know that it is not the typical romantic comedy. Shops that deal with a special musical from the outset, in the that each melody fulfills both the sound perfection and the development of the characters. We assimilate that the soundtrack shares from the beginning, a ligature with each protagonist, and that isn't in a euphoric moment of the jazz pianist, the music creates more euphoria still. Each scene is pristine, bright, pure and visually beautiful. It has a classic tonality that honors the great tapes that made the history as ''Casablanca'' (Michael Curtiz, 1942), ''Singin' in the Rain'' (Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen, 1952), ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (Nicholas Ray, 1955), or ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'' (Jacques Demy, 1967) and many more, which have a direct influence on this film. For this, the director proposes a photograph that also shines or degrades depending on the state of the characters, with a use of bright and radiant color in much of the film, in moments of happiness, desire to succeed, euphoria, in the pursuit of dreams, and some more mature, dark, in the conflicts between the protagonists, in their cadences as artists or in a less ideal future than at the beginning. Around this circle of genius left the music and photography, we have two great Hollywood actors in the role of these artists, who completely fill that gap we need. We could no longer imagine another that wasn't Emma Stone in this role. There is a great job behind all of this, and yet once you don't destabilize by a good dance canteen, I seem to be a positive point to the cause, since you grant realism to every scene however ideal. These are recurrent in the film, since Chazelle wants to tell us the sacrifices (in this case love) that have to end up making our dreams come true. The memories that only the characters have in them, or use the melancholy with all the aforementioned resources, makes this tape the transmission of love that sits, in a way not tacky, with versatility, gives the same musicality to the dialogues. This perfect couple, with a relationship from outside totally normal, is also complete inside, as happens in reality. The question: can it destroy a relationship of personal ambition?, could define the film. Life puts the obstacles that each person limits in one way or another, until reaching the goal. Taking everything said in the conclusion, he found one of the finest worked finishes of the past times, which he was lucky enough to enjoy several times on the big screen. It's sweet and cloudy at the same time, it is a smile and a tear. A tribute to the cinema that only the political correctness has deprived him of the Oscar to the Best Picture."
"basmaelassar","9","4","8","22 April 2017"," Better than expected
","La La Land is a movie full of life, love, music, dance, cheerfulness, and a lot of other twisted emotions.<br/><br/>First, it's different, it presents a simple love story, a woman and a man met by chance, and decided to love each other. Nothing complicated about it. And that's what I found enjoyable about it. That it just doesn't have that much of twists and trouble.<br/><br/>Then, there's the filming, which was the thing that really hooks you up from the beginning. It's just the aura of these old musical films about it. The music and The dances, it's just so colorful and cheerful and charges you with positive energy, and makes you smile while watching<br/><br/>And, there's the story, Some people say that the story isn't something new, two young people, trying to build a career in different fields, search for a way to realize their dreams and have a relationship along the way. But it's not about the story, it's about how it's put into the film. Sebastian's dream of having a Jazz Club and Mia's dream of being an actress, how each one supports the other into reaching, and how in the end they had to choose between their dreams and their love. How their choice to support each other in the first place, was the reason of them breaking up. How as it is shown at the end of the movie, they could have made hundreds of different choices to have the life they wanted. and how in the end they still loved each other but went on with their life despite it. The movie is just so packed with emotions, it's cheerful, amusing and simple. <br/><br/>And I would really recommend it for everyone who doesn't have any objections against musicals."

I stopped watching the movie at the 20th something minute, it was boring and felt like it was dragged. This ''masterpiece'' never really puts the clutch in the 2nd gear, it was constantly slowed down and the dance performances were bleak, it was missing additional extras for the explosiveness.<br/><br/>Now go and see ''Beauty and the Beast'', it is everything that ''LaLaLand'' is not."
"Mladen007","9","4","8","19 April 2017"," Lovely, charming, well-balanced.
","Sharp and Short<br/><br/>There is no so much more to ask from a musical. Beside adjectives like lovely and charming, well-balanced is the best word to describe this movie. A common problem in musicales can be to much or to less music, to much or to less focus on love story etc. Damian Chazelle showed us again that he is excellent at directing this type of movies. I was a little bit suspicious that he is going to achieve same success like he did with Whiplash but La La Land put my doubts sidelong. It brings something new, something different. We could call it Musical of modern times. <br/><br/>La La Land is about love story between jazz pianist and young actress who is trying to find her way to fame. They are ambitious, he wants to bring back jazz to where it belongs showing people what are true values of music and she wants to be herself in the world of acting. On their similar but different life paths, there are lots of obstacles that affect their love lives and their careers. We can describe it like a story about giving up from something in order to succeed in something else. Emma Stone is perfect for this part. Young, charming, pretty and adorable Emma evoked Mia's character exactly like it supposed to be. On the other hand, Ryan Gosling is quite good, especially in that melancholic acting at the end, but in some parts of the movie he has a bore, glassy and blank facial expression with a lack of emotions. Beyond that, there is no doubt that he gave his best to portray a character of a young and perspective musician (Best example is when he plays the piano. By the position of his fingers and the way he plays the piano in the movie, it's obvious that he didn't know how to play it but he was very good at imitating the moves. –¢his aren't my words, i heard it from my friend Olga who watched movie with me. She took piano lessons for several years). Music is one of the best components of the movie. Simple, original, beautifully written and catchy. Despite slightly unpromising start, La La Land is getting better and better as the movie goes on. Atmosphere in the movie is getting along with the story and that is very important. The end of the movie or should I say: What would happen if it happened?, was the best way to finish this story, the way that made us (and probably still make us) think about similar situations in our lives. <br/><br/>Excellent!"

","2 ratings because it is my second worst movie ever.

No feelings at all. The flow/pace how the movie progressed was certainly good but it lacked the touch and feel what should have radiated from the story. The last 20 min or so just sort of fast forwarded and I could say the directors could not bring out even 1% of emotions which the ending could have brought."

"Dmagic5000","10","4","8","3 April 2017"," La La Land is a glorious throwback to classic Hollywood
","Why do we even go to movies anymore? Damian Chazelle's latest movie La La Land is a perfect answer to that question. The sensational and intoxicating movie musical is one of the year's best.<br/><br/>La La Land stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gossling and tells the story of a struggling actress in Hollywood trying to make it big and a struggling Jazz musician who dreams of one day opening up his own Jazz club. As fate would have it, they meet and begin to date.<br/><br/>There was a time where musicals ruled the film industry. Starting in the 50s and going through the 60s. musicals dominated Hollywood. Soon, the genre began to fizzle out and since then, we've only had a number of musicals a year, if any. While the quantity and quality of musicals have dropped significantly, be assured, that La La Land is without a doubt a return to form for the genre and is the best movie musical since Singin' in the Rain. Whether or not you are a fan of musicals, it will pierce your soul and put a smile on your face.<br/><br/>From the incredible opening number to the very end, La La Land is an absolute masterful and euphoric experience. It's the kind of movie that audiences deserve to see every time they step into the theatre. Just by watching the trailer, you can get a sense of the wonder and joy the movie brings. It's heartwarming, beautiful and sensational. It's a delight from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The opening number is a beautiful and jaw dropping one-shot dance sequence directed perfectly by Damian Chazelle. Chazelle is the main reason this movie works so well. Nearly every song and dance sequence is filmed in beautiful long-takes that really showcase the choreography. It's jaw-dropping at times.<br/><br/>Emma Stone gives the best performance of her entire career. She is absolutely perfect in this movie. Her performance is so real and so raw. Performances like hers are a rare find and there is something just so heartfelt about it. Her chemistry with Ryan Gossling is perfect. Ryan Gossling is also very good in the movie and gives one of his best performances.<br/><br/>The musical score and dance numbers are dazzling and beautiful to behold. There is one scene near the middle of the movie that takes place in a observatory and the entire sequence is absolutely breathtaking. The choreography and metaphoric visuals are beautiful.<br/><br/>La La Land is a rare movie that begs to be seen. Movies like this just aren't made anymore. It's a love letter to Los Angeles, to Hollywood, to film, to musicals. If you love movies, don't miss out on this one. La La Land one of the best movies of the year. If you only see one movie this year, this is the one to watch."

But it was Ryan's job for his role, in case Ryan Gosling did not have to learn all the songs that had the piano included. And Emma Stone ... it only counts and does it very well.<br/><br/>The montage of the scenes are impeccable, very good. Especially in the scene of the bridge.

(Being that I do live in Los Angeles, saw the failings in such as one line of cars was facing the wrong way with a concrete barrier in between. Also, despite being a traffic jam, the surrounding freeways were very clear, which is not typical other than early morning on the weekend.)<br/><br/>The subsequent numbers were also enjoyable and colorful. The music solid (although I should have watched it with earphones).<br/><br/>The performances were very good but would come short of saying they were Oscar worthy. There wasn't a range of emotions with Stone to warrant it. Although Gosling ends up being effective and a great screen presence, I generally find his actual performances somewhat cold. But kudos to him learning the piano for the role. It was an effective element.<br/><br/>But, in the end, the story was very textbook. Traditional love story between two who were at first opposites. It did try to break the mold with them not being together in the end, but fell short and provoked more questions than satisfaction. Then the ""alternate ending"" (which I more thought was a ""what if"" from the Gosling character) was colorful."

",",,,it's not a horrible movie but I don't understand the growing hype either. I went to see this no expectations except some decent musical entertainment and...I don't know. What's good? Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are charming (to me) as the leads, the aspiring actress/playwright and the true-to-old-school Jazz musician. The songs are okay. Nothing tremendously memorable but I did like the ""City Of Stars"" tune that Gosling sings on the pier (and later duets on again with Stone). The other stuff? The dancing was cute but not fantastic. The actors did the best they could and God knows they did better than I ever could but they looked a little uncomfortable doing it, like they were counting out the steps in their heads. What wasn't so great? The premise was fine but it's nothing new and the film had a LOT of slow areas where I kind of felt bored. Like the writers added what they thought was clever dialogue but actually came across as ""filler"" to make up some time in the movie. While some people didn't like the planetarium/fantasy dance scene, I thought that was one of the better, old Hollywood type scenes in this film. Nice little twist as the film draws toward it's conclusion and it wasn't dumbed down with a ton of explanations, as if the audience were clueless, that made up for the dry spots earlier on. So, it's not a bad film or anything but again, I don't understand the Oscar build up on this because there seem to be other films with more to offer out there. To each their own, I guess."

","A modern take on the classic Hollywood musical. It baffles me how such a high profile movie can divide opinion so much with reviews here ranging from 1 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú a waste of time to 10 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú my best movie ever. I think the hype surrounding this movie has left a lot of people feeling robbed and angry. I went to see the movie open minded. I'll qualify my views by firstly stating I'm a male in the over 40's age bracket. I've thoroughly enjoyed movies like Grease and Moulin Rouge in the past.<br/><br/>I would say that this film's appeal is that it's different to the 'run of the mill' Hollywood films. That could be why it's getting so much attention. Suddenly we have a new film which isn't like all the others! From that point of view it's a good effort. For the most part it does actually work quite will if you stick with it. Performances from the two lead actors are good.<br/><br/>After the opening sequence and early stages of the movie I was unsure where it was going. However, I started to find it 'pleasant' to watch. Whilst the music score and singing are not the best, it was sufficient. However, I found the end was disappointing and left me feeling flat. I think a movie like this must have a 'happy ending'. In my view, dare I say it, this movie will appeal mostly to a female audience who appreciate something different. Decide for yourself."

","I just can't begin to understand the irrational hype over this movie. It is good. It's very beautifully filmed and edited, and has a intriguing, although well-worn story line. It boasts measured and tasteful acting as well as attractive actors, of course. It even features some really awesome jazz. But that's about where it ends. Shouldn't a musical include some actual song and dance talent? The dancing is, well, pedestrian. The singing ranges from decent to awful. It's difficult to understand who thought it was a good idea to cast Ryan Gosling in a singing role. It's more painful to listen to than Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia. La La Land will probably win lots more awards, I just wish someone would explain to me why."

"Neil-M09","7","4","8","22 January 2017"," If this movie wins 'Best actor in Leading role', rather than a tribute it's gonna be a mockery to Gene Kelly and old Hollywood.
","First of all, I like musical films, but this was supposed to be a tribute to the greatest musical performers in old Hollywood (Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, etc.). It was a lie, because it was a clich√É¬© love story of a young couple, Sebastian and Mia.<br/><br/>The script's structure isn't great neither, narrated by seasons. The characters, Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a man who wants to make Jazz popular again. The rest of the characters are just there, lost in the script, doesn't matter if they exist. And the end is like the supporting characters too, is like those quickly ending scenes where the movie doesn't feel complete.<br/><br/>Now I'll be honest, Emma does her best and gives an acceptable performance, but Ryan can barely sing and is worse when he dances, no coordination with Emma and graceless dance steps disguised by the sound department with tap sounds. The musical numbers are forgettable too, 'City of Stars' is good but no great and the old Hollywood tribute is just a Casablanca's window, Rebel Without a Cause, some posters and dance steps, good joke for publicize the movie.<br/><br/>Despite all these, the good things in the movie, the sound editing and mixing. The art direction gives this film different places with urban atmosphere, and the costume design and make-up/hairstyling department also contribute to make the story something that everyone can feel identified.<br/><br/>Maybe is for all this the success, but can't match on to classics like Singing in the Rain, An American in Paris, Sound of Music and more.

It wasn't mimicking the ending of legendary musicals like Singing In The Rain, or films like A Star Is Born, about a couple whose stars are in opposing trajectories. So what was it trying to achieve? A muddled and unsatisfying finish was all I was left with. They both get what they want in their careers, but not each other? Hmmm... The music is weak overall (mumbly), and the dancing isn't remarkable apart from the opening number. It's beautiful to look at, and the production values keep the whole thing running to a point, but you can only admire the beauty that David Wasco, Austin Gorg and Sandy Reynolds-Wasco created (Production Design, Art Direction and Set Decoration) for so long.

In fact very little is new in this film, we've kind of seen it all before, yet there is a little sparkle that makes it different!!!! The script is fairly ordinary and the songs are fairly bland, however, bring both these together and some magic happens. Emma Stone produces a pretty good performance as a girl trying to make it in Hollywood, she has some good opportunity to show a repertoire of various acting skills as her character trawls round audition after audition trying to break into the industry. Ryan Gosling plays a jazz musician passionate about his music but unable to bring his dream to fruition and having to sacrifice his goals in order to make ends meet. Musician meets actress and our story has begun. This film is trying to mix the modern with the glory days of Hollywood past and although successful in many ways it doesn't quite reach the spot. Having said that I enjoyed it immensely, anything with a little song and dance is sure to keep me entertained the bright colours and jazz music evoke memories of the grand days of the big studios, yet we know we are in modern times as technology is evident in most scenes.

","There are good news and bad news.<br/><br/>The good news is that, if you know nothing about musicals, then La La Land is going to tell you all about the creme de la creme: Top Hat, An American In Paris, Mary Poppins, Singin' In The Rain (both in very specific references) and, the most obvious influence of all, especially in terms of characters and narrative, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Not only is the essential history of musicals part of this film, but everything's also impeccably executed. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are both remarkably subtle as well, and for once in a colorful Hollywood romance, none of the main characters steps over the other. Note that there's a Woody Allen sleeping in Gosling's character: a very traditional artist who refuses to open up to other people's tastes and opinions (not sure if mentioning Mr. Allen is a compliment or not). But seriously, even the most skeptics of you about musicals will have a good time.<br/><br/>The bad news is that this is one long, long, long movie that ends a million consecutive times. Don't you hate it when you're watching a movie and you get the feeling that it ends a first time, then it ends again, then again, and again, and again to the extent that you no longer know if it's ever going to end at all? The director Damien Chazelle is also developing his gimmicks that he might be unfortunately mistaking for trademark: fast consecutive inserts, referencing anecdotes about great musicians, building sonic climax and breaking it abruptly... Also, if you're expecting to find some of the tension remaining from Chazelle's previous coup-de-ma√É¬Ætre Whiplash, you won't because he has moved on to a more contemplative, more harmonious and less scientific place about music and he wants everybody to know it. To sum up the major difference between Whiplash and La La Land in terms of experience as a spectator: you eat Whiplash and you sip La La Land.<br/><br/>By the way, you can thank the producers for approving of a not-so-happy-after-all ending for an A-list Hollywood movie. HALLELUJAH!<br/><br/>You might get bored here and there. However you should be convinced by the likability of the cast, the delicious 40's three-color-strip-referencing cinematography and the shockingly impressive Steadicam work. La La Land will also manage to steal a few good laughs from you."

I was a little worried during the start of ""La La Land"" that we'd encountered the latter, and while the musical numbers were entertaining, they were pretty ordinary. However, as the movie progressed, the singing decreased, and the dialog and story got more interesting.

Simmons in a cameo appearance√Ç¬†(he won an Oscar for his√Ç¬†performance in 'WHIPLASH'). √Ç¬†On top of being almost unanimously praised by critics, it was also named one of the ten best movies of the year by the American Film Institute, and it's expected to likely win Best Picture at next year's Academy Awards. √Ç¬†I really enjoyed it.√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†<br/><br/>Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) are both struggling√Ç¬†artists, trying to make a living (while doing what they really love) in Los Angeles. √Ç¬†Sebastian is a jazz musician, who attempts to pay the bills by playing bars and parties, while Mia is an aspiring actress, who gets by serving coffee to actors on the set of a movie studio. √Ç¬†The two meet, and don't immediately take a liking to each other, but eventually mutual attraction appears to grow between them. √Ç¬†They then take turns supporting each other, in their different passions, while attempting to maintain a relationship.<br/><br/>Chazelle is a drummer, who wrote 'LA LA LAND' back in 2010 (when he was still just an aspiring filmmaker). √Ç¬†All three of his movies, including 2009's√Ç¬†'GUY AND MADELINE ON A PARK BENCH' (which is also a musical), focus heavily on jazz music. √Ç¬†I think this is a very passionate subject for him, as is film, and it's because of this strong (heartfelt) passion, that his films become such great masterpieces. √Ç¬†This is an old fashioned (soon to be√Ç¬†classic) musical; I saw it with my parents and they loved it. √Ç¬†Because this genre of film is so rare, I think it will win Best Picture (it's definitely√Ç¬†one of my favorites of the year). √Ç¬†Gosling and Stone are both fantastic in it, and they√Ç¬†have beautiful chemistry together (once again); the romance between their characters is both very touching and believable as well. √Ç¬†It's a great film! <br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_ufnweLGYJ4"

","Went to see it the first time about two weeks ago and like others on this thread was put off a little by all the bells and whistles. But after watching it and having play out in my head I realized I had missed something so I went to see it again.<br/><br/>In the fantasy scene that plays out after Mia enters the jazz club Sebastian starts it by playing their theme song but the fantasy is played out through Mia's eyes, but by playing their song he was admitting to the mistakes he had made in their relationship and she was imagining what their life together would've been had he not made those mistakes. Of course this was all fantasy and neither of them would've realized their respective dreams had their relationship worked out but they also wouldn't have realized their dreams had they not been together.<br/><br/>That is what I missed the first time that I got on the second viewing.<br/><br/>Two other things I found interesting were the opening song and dance sequence where everyone is stuck in a traffic jam but singing how everything is great because it is another day of sun and the fact they had to tell you what season it was."

"adimadau","9","4","8","28 December 2016"," Best or Bust?
","This is my first review for a movie. I went with my wife and daughter to see this movie. I enjoyed it, they did not. I noticed many of the reviews are either overwhelmingly positive or very negative. Very few in between. I believe you will enjoy this movie if you like musicals but 1) You are not a huge fan of older musicals to be able to compare them since Ryan and Emma are not great at dancing or singing. (though they were very good) and 2) You have not seen Ryan and Emma in their other movies together since you will expect their roles to be similar. These are very different roles for them. The producers may have done better be selecting unknown actors for these roles. It's like seeing Pierce Brosnan singing in Ma Ma Mia after watching him as 007. It's just odd. My girls could not accept Ryan tap dancing and singing and floating around in this movie and therefore did not enjoy it. I could accept Ryan and Emma in these roles (though not immediately) and did enjoy this movie so I give it a 9/10."
"kgfaldyn","10","4","8","28 December 2016"," An absolute masterpiece.
","La La Land is without a doubt one of the best musicals ever made. Not being much of fan of this genre, it blew me away. When I saw the original trailer for this film in theaters and learned Damien Chazelle was directing(director of Whiplash), I had to see it, and boy did it deliver. Told in the forms of seasons, the film's seamless editing and cinematography is a marvel to observe. Lengthy complicated and choreographed takes show off the talent Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have, Stone giving in my opinion the best performance of here career. Goslings performance is second only to ""Drive"", or perhaps ""The Nice Guys"". The score by Justin Hurwitz is once again astonishing- Chazelle's love for jazz holds true in this film. It's interesting that the two films I've seen by him both mention jazz as a dying art- an art he is helping keep alive with his brilliant film making. The Whiplash nods were wonderful with the double-time swing followed by a bass player, and the talk of Charlie Parker as ""the bird"". The J.K. Simmons cameo had the crowd grinning nicely as well, still playing a hard-ass persona. In conclusion, La La Land is one of the best made, performed, and creative films of the year. It is an inspiring work of art that begs its viewers to seize the day and follow their dreams. Get out and see this one."

"dallas-23-628630","7","4","8","26 December 2016"," Very enjoyable but the end left me a bit flat
","I built up a high level of anticipation in seeing this film. I enjoy both Ryan G and Emma S as actors and like music. The high ratings on IMDb also added to the anticipation. I found myself quite engrossed in the story and where it was going. It was filled with the day to day ups and downs of life and the beauty of aspiring to dreams and love. I play the piano and enjoy Jazz and dancing so appreciated the melodic intertwining of the music through the story line. Both main actors did a good job with the dancing and singing given they are not professionals in these areas. As much as I enjoyed the film, I found myself a bit flat at the end as I didn't interpret the ending as a joyous one unlike other reviewers that said it was inspiring and a feel good ending. This was not the case for me. I felt the ending could have been done much better and there was too much of a gap in the story that was covered in the last 15 or so mins. I enjoyed the singing, dancing, story and overall cinematography, the movie had a great realistic emotional romantic feel to it. Just felt a bit let down at the end though."
"monstermayhem32","9","4","8","23 December 2016"," A tale of romance and always pursuing your dreams
","This film happens to be the third collaboration of Emma stone and Ryan gosling who plays lovers yet again after doing so twice before in crazy stupid love and gangster squad. Emma plays Mia an up and coming actress who is hoping to catch her lucky break with acting after various auditions have gone bust. Ryan plays Sebastian a pianist who plans to open up his own jazz club. I will say while I am not a big fan of musical features since they tend to be more about singing and dancing than actual story and dialogue but it has a perfect blend of that. I would say that the overall story is despite the obstacle on ones path is to always continue your dreams and to never give up."

","To be honest I am not a musical fan, but tell that to my... tapping toes while watching the enchantment of ""La La Land"", one of the year's best films. It is a clever movie full of color, brightness, rhythm and emotion. When it comes to talented filmmakers, there is no better example of one than Damien Chazelle. I was blown away in 2014 with ""Whiplash"", and it shares so many similarities with ""La La Land"". Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the perfect pair to sing and play in ""La La Land"". Now that your chance to see this standout film is finally here, don't miss out because it's simply impossible not to completely fall in love with it."
"tudorsud","10","4","8","22 December 2016"," Perfect atmosphere, awesome performance
","I particularly see this movie as the 2016 iconic one. The atmosphere is so right, the actors play seamlessly. The music left me speechless, and I have to admit that I arrived by mistake at this film, because if I knew it was a musical I would have thought twice. That being said, I admit that this will be one of my favourites from now on. It s not the best played movies of all times, but what makes it special it s the amount of thoughts it lets behind after you reach the end. It s been two days since I saw it, and I'm haunted by the theme song and how life leads you to certain places. If you re a dreamer and you had a passion once, this movie will definitely touch you in your deepest places. Don t lose this piece of art, whatever people say :)"
"MrPink4312","10","4","8","19 December 2016"," La La Land: Ode to all Artists
","La La Land: This film is a gem, I can't express enough how much I love this film. As a person that's not so much Into musicals I can finally say that I Loved a musical. La La Land is an ode to jazz, but not just jazz. It's an ode to all the artists. From musicians to actors and actresses. The struggle of those who want to achieve better things, to those who have dreams. I can truly say that this film, is by far my favorite and the best film of 2016. Both actors Emma Stone who plays an aspiring actress, and Ryan Gosling who plays a musician that plays jazz on the piano. Bot characters were fleshed out, and both performances delivered. This film is not only about music but the romance is very strong in this film. Both actors have played and worked together in other films before. But as of now nothing beats the performance they showed in this film. This film is being played in limited cinemas and the reason being is because the studio wanted this film to be a contender for the Oscar's. For those that want to wait, it will have a wide release in January.I would not be surprised if Emma Stone get a nomination for best lead actress. She is phenomenal! And I wouldn't be surprised if Ryan Gosling gets a nomination as well, plus the film for best screenplay and for best motion picture. I can't express enough how good Emma Stone is in this Picture. She truly shines and stands out in this picture. I highly recommend this film, you will not take away from the movie, and you will definitely love the music that the film revolves around. My only problem with the film was the ending. It's nothing bad of sort, it's still amazing and wonderful, but it messed with my heart, and my feelings were hurt. It messes with concept of ""what if"" once people get see this movie they will understand. But regardless, if you like musicals mixed with heavy romance and comedy. This film is must see! La La Land: 9.8/10"
"ahooda-85743","9","4","8","18 December 2016"," It is pure Art
","To be frank you wouldn't waste your money. I saw folks in Michigan standing and clapping at the end. It's a marvel. I didn't give 10/10 because some of the dance and emotional scenes lacked depth from Ryan Gosling, who somehow covered it in the end by natural pain that he carries in his presence. Emma Stone on the contrary carried the tempo throughout the film; she just proved once again that how brilliant she is in acting and surprisingly singing. She's all in for an Oscar this year. <br/><br/>Finally I think movie tried to encompass the entire story of one's regular youthful life - which is only the life that seems to matter now a days - I however wished that it may have covered short life span with probably more intensity. In that regard I revered the movie ""Before Sunrise"" that magnificently captured charisma and magic within a night. Finally, in my understanding Indian cinema, especially Bollywood has some incredible movies that captured musicals in an exceptional way. Somehow, the showmanship in that regard fallen a bit short. Still, it's magical - much better than the artificially created poetry of Birdman or superficial picturesque of Revenant."
"david_kravitz","7","4","8","18 December 2016"," A curate's egg of a film.
","I am a great fan of musicals, I own over 700 of them on DVD and lecture on the subject all over Israel. I eagerly anticipated this film which arrived in Israel on December 16th. I am disappointed.<br/><br/>In parts this film is good, the opening sequence on the freeway superb, but parts of the film were, simply, boringly slow. The music and songs were good but not outstandingly memorable. The ""hit"" song City of Stars was not allowed to be performed fully and the marvelous and colorful dance sequence towards the end was cut shamefully short. The jazz sequences were terrific, if you like jazz as the dialog points out.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is a revelation as a singer,dancer and pianist but everyone else was average. The constant panning of the camera was a distraction but the long, continuous, single takes work very well, particularly Emma Stone's audition song. The dance sequence between the two stars into the clouds was poor, not even in the same class as as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.<br/><br/>The film is described by some as a tribute to Fred and Ginger. Hardly. And I wonder how many of the current reviews from such limited distribution are from actors and luvvies from la la land?<br/><br/>Yes, this is a good film, one I might watch again but the advance hype is not supported by what I saw on screen. The audience seemed to like it, with the odd exception and, maybe, I am being too critical which is likely reflected in the ""likes"" for my review. But this is not, in my opinion, a musical that will stand the test of time as a blockbuster."

","All right, this movie is gaining more and more echo sound as days goes by, but for once, all positive reviews, all positive remarks, all praises and compliments are more than well deserved.<br/><br/>Since second one you are drawn into the story, into the characters, into the music! This movie is simply a piece of art. Something that needs to be watch and enjoyed at the same time. Many people are no fans of musical movies, but please, give it a chance. Take a chance on it as otherwise you will regret it deeply.<br/><br/>The story told is nothing that we haven't seen before, boy and girl meet and they fall in love and make it into a musical. Nothing new in here but! Watch gets our attention is not the story itself, but how it is told. How we follow these characters into their lives. what are they aspirations and where they come from. Something really reachable for us, as we all can be identified with them.<br/><br/>Of course the main character of the movie is the music. All songs are really catchy and the dance scenes are simply brilliant, full of color and rhythm. As for Ryan and Emma, I cannot think of a better duo together on-screen. As they have shown in past collaborations together, there is chemistry between them and that is something really important for this kind of movies. Both do an amazing job which is being rewarded thru the awards season that just began.<br/><br/>A movie that gives tribute to classic musical movies, both made in Hollywood and not so made in Hollywood. A move that makes you forget about what is happening around you. A movie that tells a story that we all can be related to. A movie that makes you feel. A movie absolutely worth watching and enjoying.<br/><br/>You still want more? Watch the fantastic French film ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" (1964); the film that inspired this fantastic piece of art that we have today and that is a piece of art itself."

","I love magic. And that's what I felt when I watch La La Land. Enchanted. There are a lot of complaints about this film, I assume mostly due to the never ending positive buzz it's gotten. There was even an SNL skit about how widely (and overly) loved it is. But I can't help it. I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I love a musical, and I love the classic style. You can tell me all day long about how Stone is breathy, Gosling looks at his feet when he dances, I don't care. I liked the way it made me feel, and I left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs. I went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis (which come around every other week). I was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half. A few weeks later, I went in for another show time because I was worried I wasn't in a stable mental state the first time around. I cried (slightly) less in my second showing, but it still felt as connected. Flat out it was a beautifully shot, exciting, catchy frolic through every young dreamer's fantasy in LA. 9.8/10"

"Sewaat","9","5","11","27 February 2017"," Irresistible Fun
","It's true. We've seen films like La La Land before. In the first five minutes it becomes all too clear that Damien Chazelle's Hollywood musical is trying to pay homage to all of the ones that came before it. (Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, etc.) However, it is exactly this that makes La La Land such a delight for audiences and film critics alike. And it heavily contributes to what could have so nearly been a bland and soulless film.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly charming in the lead roles. They share great chemistry and play well off of one another. I was not a big fan of either star before watching this film. Watching La La Land, I get the distinct feeling that these two were made to star in this film. I can't picture anyone else playing Mia or Sebastian more perfectly. However, despite the love story that takes the fore front of the plot, this film refuses to give us the happy ending we've grown so accustomed to receiving. What a shame that one of the films freshest elements is also it's saddest. <br/><br/>It's also worth noting that La La Land earned the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, an honour that was well deserved. The camera is just as much an esteemed guest in the film as the lead stars. It moves graciously with the actors and enhances the fluidity of the sequences. Beautiful lavender sunsets, a gorgeous planetarium full of starlight and colours that dance and sparkle in the street lights all come to life in this amazing, vibrant story.<br/><br/>I loved La La Land and I am not ashamed of it. It's not a new story by any means, but it is criminally fun and oh so very hard not to become swept up in it's astounding melodies. The criticism for it is understandable, but we should never be made to feel guilty for the films we enjoy. So if your feet start tapping to ""Another day of sun"" or ""City of Stars"", then by all means, enjoy it to your hearts content. Film is art. Art is subjective. Never stop falling in love with what makes your soul sing and your heart race.<br/><br/>As a musical, La La Land succeeds in a land slide. But do not forget that this is also a film about winning, losing, love, heartache and most importantly...a film about dreams and those who are brave and foolish enough chase them."

Toward the end, it takes an unexpected twist, keeping the audience engaged.

Don't let the musical aspect of this film be the reason you don't go see it, incredible performances from Gosling and especially Stone make the two hour run time fly and make you feel and connect with the pair as you see them juggle their love for each other while working in Hollywood. Director Damien Chazells incredibly fast and steady camera work throws you into these entertaining and visually spectacular musical numbers that end up leaving a big smile on your face the whole time you're watching it.

","""People love what other people are passionate about."" <br/><br/>Being at the top of the quotes' section, I guess that statement had the most powerful resonance in the hearts of all the fools, dreamers, lovers who experienced, with amusement and amazement ""La La Land"". This is not Mia talking but Damien Chazelle, Hollywood's child prodigy, though what he did is sure no ""child's work"".<br/><br/>Chazelle made a spectacular entrance with ""Whiplash"", a spellbinding masterpiece exalting the virtues of work, passion and discipline. And by tying the Oscar-nominations record of ""Titanic"" and ""All About Eve"", ""La La Land"" makes exactly the point of ""Whiplash"", the one missed by those who label it as a 'musical', while you can enjoy it without even being impressed by the music (although I find it difficult not to be mildly haunted by that score from Justin Hurwitz, a melody echoing the work of Michel Legrand and that doesn't get off the head easily).<br/><br/>""Here's to the fools who dream"".<br/><br/>""La La Land"" follows the ups-and-downs of a romance between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a pianist as passionate about jazz as J.K. Simmons in ""Whiplash"" (Simmons has a small part) and Mia (Emma Stone), a struggling actress stuck in Cinderella-phase, working in a Hollywood cafeteria with a string of auditions' failures that severely undermined her self-confidence. And while it's easier for pianists to find jobs, Seb is a purist who can't stand selling his soul for pop music or any modernized, youth-appealing, version of jazz.<br/><br/>But there's no villain in ""La La Land"" except for reality and its necessary compromises. Together, Mia and Seb find the motivation to achieve their dreams. Seb works with a band lead by Keith, an old friend played by John Legend, so he can provide for Mia while she writes a one-woman-show, and stops relying on auditions. It is very telling that she wants to be an actress and he a jazz pianist, Mia must learn how to act, and not surrender to defeatism, while Seb has got to play the game, and as Keith says ""not try to revolutionize something by being traditional"". The irony is that while they try to reach happiness, they're happy and have the time of their life.<br/><br/>""Life is what happens to you while you're making projects"".<br/><br/>Chazelle doesn't share John Lennon's view of happiness, his vision follows the same pattern than ""Whiplash"", to the point I wondered if Chazelle wasn't the kind of workaholic guy who decided one day that he had to dedicate 100% of his time to movie-making at the expenses of love comfort. It seems like you can see his personal story behind his work and I feel that it's for this sincerity, that he's one of these artists who peak very early like Scorsese or Tarantino. Now, I know I could go on the stylish directing and the whole love letter to Hollywood but this is one aspect that I'm less hot about.<br/><br/>The first sunny and enthusiastic dance sequence was nothing but a masterpiece of choreographic directing and time will tell if it becomes as iconic as the beginning of ""West Side Story"" but personally, I was not impressed... in the sense that I felt it was Chazelle begging for the Oscar, especially since the scene doesn't stop after the music and the film goes on. It was remarkable but in such a showy way it felt too Oscar-baity for its own good. But Chazelle is a jazzy director: he knows when to over-bake it and when to play it smooth. So, I let myself transported by the film and at the Planetarium sequence, I was literally transported by the poetry of the moment, like ""what the heck¬Ö"" this is good, give the film the awards it deserves.<br/><br/>Yes, ""La La Land"" is stylish and you can see the director and writer's touches of unpredictability everywhere, in the backgrounds, in the use of phone calls, even the title is a clever bit of creativity, this is one of these cases where the directing is in symbiosis with the story, like in Scorsese's movie. And rightfully so because the story isn't even revolutionary and we've seen it a thousand times but it's in the storytelling¬Ö and that magnificent 'rewriting' third act. The finale redeemed the slower second act and echoed how many feel about life: you can succeed through money, love and dreams, you're happy if you get two out of three. By that logic, Mia and Seb are happy at the end, but indulge to a fantasy sequence where they succeed in everything.<br/><br/>And as dreamy as it was, the 'fantasy' sequence was still plausible... had they engaged in a transparent, sincere and flawless relationship from the start. But who said life was flawless? I spend my whole life rewriting my story and asking myself: ""what if I had done this or that?"", it's never totally unrealistic, but that's the whole fantasy aspect about it, when you know what awaited you, it's easier to look at your past in retrospect. You only realize your mistakes when it's you late, otherwise, you wouldn't call them mistakes. And well, five years later, they still have good reasons to smile despite the wasted opportunities, because when you sacrifice love for dreams, the lost love becomes the dream. C'est la la vie! <br/><br/>Finally¬Ö <br/><br/>Speaking of life, this is my 1000th review, I'm sad that IMDb is shutting down the message boards and wanted a feel-good movie for the occasion. Yet I felt cheated, because Chazelle doesn't go for sentimentality at the end¬Ö as romantic and deliberately kitsch as it was, ""La La Land"" is true to life because it has a little twist¬Ö called reality. I don't know if I feel so good after all¬Ö I feel good in the way this film made me feel about life... but maybe I wanted the dream, after all."
"wikoli-80946","10","5","11","14 February 2017"," Wonderful, Amazing, Engaging, Genuine
","Saw La La Land on Valentine's Day with my wife. Didn't know what to expect. Was thinking ""chick flick"". I was totally surprised. That's one word. I was expecting a boring, slow beginning, and it immediately started off with the freeway overpass song and dance scene. It surprised me. Here's another word: it ENGAGED me. Think ""WOW"". Don't know what the bad reviews are all about. Maybe a lot of unhappy people out there. Maybe I'm a hick (though I drive through LA on occasion). I, for one, haven't been to a movie that impressed me as much as this one in many, many years. It wasn't a war movie, an action movie, horror, spy, suspense, boring drama etc. It is an UNEXPECTED movie. Here's another word: GENUINE. I have to admit, the singing wasn't super strong, but it was on key, sincere and genuine. The dancing wasn't the most complex, but the timing was awesome, very emotional and it flowed perfectly with the story. Beautiful timing. Gosling and Stone were so genuine, that I was intrigued and engaged even through he slow parts of the movie because of the good character development. Emma Stone isn't the most beautiful actress, but there is something so real and fresh about her performance. There's just a hint (or maybe more of a hint) of awkwardness. She just nailed it though, IMHO. Right on the edge, but nothing embarrassing. Just engaging. Gosling is great too, but hey, I'm a guy. He does obviously play the piano pretty well too. They had REAL musicians in this film as well. Like John Legend for one. And the reoccurring theme song was good. The segues weren't perfect, and the ending was a little in-congruent, but with the time allotted, they had to end it and bring you back down to earth somehow. I'm a skeptic, and not easily impressed, but this film impressed me. I love that they started out not liking each other, but then bonded with the song and dance routines. Haven't had a film impress me like this in YEARS."
"richard-1787","10","5","11","28 January 2017"," Magical
","This is truly a magical movie. Sometimes quite literally, when the male lead discovers that he can lift the young woman in the air and then go soaring after her, like Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn in *Everybody Says I Love You*. Sometimes ""just"" with their wonderful dancing on earth. Especially with the fantasy sequences.<br/><br/>I am sure others have already praised Ms. Stone's and especially Mr. Gosling's acting, singing, and dancing. He in particular has a charm, and outright athleticism, when he dances that made their scenes together wonderful.<br/><br/>What I wanted to add was that this movie often made me think of Jacques Demy's early musical The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). You get the same sudden dance numbers set on banal city streets - and here, even on the freeway! - with apparently ""normal"" individuals who turn out to be marvelous, athletic dancers. Characters burst into song in a, granted, unrealistic but still very natural way, often wearing outfits of one solid bright pastel color (at least for the women).<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this movie - and why would you not? - you might want to check out Demy's earlier work."
"mohamed-emam1","10","5","11","27 January 2017"," Lots of emotions with a real smooth camera movement where you feel inside the movie
","The first minute of the movie, you feel that the camera is moving like it does in a normal horror movies ""final destination"" but astonishingly the movement of the camera continues to be so smooth until the end of the movie; simply you get the feeling that you are a part of the movie as if you are inside the Story. <br/><br/>As for the music, I really can't explain the amount of emotions you get during the different moments of the characters. The flashback that was used in different occasions was very subtle especially the last scene of the movie where we see the unexpected reunion between the two main characters; I say reunion only from the abstract point of view as Sebastian started recalling all the main incidents that happened between him and Mia but the flashback was very different for this scene as he started thinking about the ""what if""; this was a real more than heartbreaking moment and a perfect ending for this movie.In fact this last flashback wasn't only going in Sebastian's mind but also inside Mia's mind .In a nutshell, the movie is full of emotions, acting skills, and nice music for the real lovers of Jazz. For me, the camera was the main character of this movie. When you go to the Cinema, just try to relax, and leave yourself to the story line and you will enjoy a lot."
"AnpanPat","10","5","11","25 January 2017"," One of my most favourite cinema experiences
","This movie is not some glitzy re-humanization of being rich during The Depression. It's actually almost the opposite, a musical centered on the little people striving to succeed while enduring the ups and downs of relationships and two branches of the entertainment business, one an actress, the other a jazz pianist.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle has dazzled me before. Most musicals, I can't wait for the songs to be over to hear the dialogue. Each piece had character, great choreography. Something else that helps is my love of jazz music, and I found most pieces to be ""jazzy"", so that earned itself some points. <br/><br/>This movie so deftly navigates all sorts of truth about so many elusive things that it's not worth picking a few. Just go see it, even if you don't like musicals. It will win you over."

","1st review. Keeping it simple. I watch a TON of movies and grew up on musicals including theater.<br/><br/>I just can't give this a big thumbs up. <br/><br/>I WANTED to love it. I really did. I'd love to see a modern version of the old school musicals I learned (yes, learned) to love. It's not ""Singing in the Rain"" and such.<br/><br/>I love Gosling as far as his talent. I wanted it to work. Truly. I did not come in being critical.<br/><br/>It just never clicked for me. The singing was blah (I get the concept of being ""regular"" folks""). The story, well I just kept waiting for it to be a big splash.<br/><br/>Instead it seemed to end quickly and simply bland. <br/><br/>I really did want to love it and understand the love for it. <br/><br/>Sorry it's my first review but I've seriously watched a ton of quality movies from IMAX to my home theater and this is the first time I felt I HAD TO SAY MY QUALMS. <br/><br/>It's a fine movie for what it is. However, throw in the hype, and it just let me down.<br/><br/>Sure, I could get more specific and such but I am just throwing it out there that it was a fail for me overall. I WANTED to love it. It just never go going for me.<br/><br/>Do a good old school musical where it's the norm characters as they make them out to be then BOOM- suddenly it rocks (no, not the genre of music). I just think they let it drop where they could have taken it to another level.<br/><br/>Love the actors. I am sure I will see tons of great works to come. This just did not take it to the level I had hoped. Perhaps too much hype?"
"gab-fan22","8","5","11","17 January 2017"," Surprisingly uplifting, beautiful old school musical
","I am not a musical fan to be honest, and honestly saw this film cause Hidden Figures was sold out in UA Sheepshead bay, BK. However, La La Land which has gotten a lot of hype after their Golden Globe dominance turns out to be a beautiful work about the pursuit of one's dreams and what can happen on the way.<br/><br/>LA is the city of angels, broken dreams and full of haunting old symbols of the golden age like Griffith observatory, the highways, film lots, etc... The modern setting coupled with the music and cinemascope was brilliant and really established he film's mood.<br/><br/>Acting- Emma and Ryan in my opinion were very good, and their dynamic throughout this movie was astonishing. The Oscars would be a fool to ignore Emma's performance which is brilliant in particular her breakdown after her one-woman play goes poorly, or her work near the end both of which should get her a nomination. Reynolds is just as good, and their chemistry lifts this movie through the good, and in their argument scene where Reynolds really captures the pain and frustration of doing something he hates, but helps him survive.<br/><br/>Now is the dancing like Kelly or Astaire?? No, and its clear both are not singers but they did a good job in my view with that and the music while its not awe-inspiring, really hits you particularly City of Stars which is my pick for best original song.<br/><br/>Flaws-<br/><br/>I was confused why Simmons, Legend and Dewitt did not really have more of a presence in the film to continue the storyline Chazelle as building about dreams vs. reality. This hurts the movie, because at times Stone and Reynolds journey was odd without more people in their worlds pressuring them to give up and conform which would have added to the film's emotion. Also the opening wasn't that great and in the middle the film did kind of lag a bit.<br/><br/>Overall, though the movie was good and did feature some magical scenes like their dance in the planetarium and in the magic hour overlooking the city. Chazelle really establishes himself as a director for his choices at capturing this city of hope, broken dreams and melding it in a way Mia and Sebastian's journey symbolizes not just other creative people but everyone who takes a chance to pursue their loves and faces all the heartbreak, frustration and joy that comes along the way.<br/><br/>Now the last hr of the film in particular the ending is brilliant. This movie is not dialogue heavy, and Stone's eyes really capture her emotion's as things begin to happen as does Reynolds body which droops when he's down or vice-versa when he's up. Those final scenes in particular the montage which reminded me of Pixar's UP is the correct ending in that our dreams take us down different paths, and we dnt always stay close to those along the way we remember their efforts that helped us make our choices and fulfill the goals we desire. La La Land to my surprise is one of 2016's best films."

","I had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week ... go and see Felicity Jones get ill and die in A Monster Calls, or go for some escapist nonsense instead. It was a grey miserable January day, so La La Land won. It was pretty enjoyable, too. Ryan Gosling did a great job of being, e, Ryan Gosling pianist / keyboard player (which is pretty cool in itself)... and Emma Stone was absolutely fantastic as his love interest. One of her audition scenes reminded me of the incredibly powerful audition Naomi Watts does in Mulholland Drive, and that might not be a co-incidence judging from La La Land's locations. Ultimately a musical is going to stand or fall on the quality of its songs, and I'm not sure these will pass the test of time... but the whole movie was well done and a good romantic night out - unless you go along with someone you are not totally sure you want to spend the rest of your life with."
"Screen_Blitz","10","5","11","16 January 2017"," Electrifying, charming, and swelling with vibrant performances, La La Land is a true cinematic masterpiece
","In the age of countless romantic films lacking originality and falling victim to tiresome formula, Damien Chazelle, the intelligent mind behind the exhilarating music-theme drama 'Whiplash' in 2014, makes a return to the director's seat to deliver arguably one of the most sensational romantic tales in recent years 'La La Land'. Crafted in a style of an old romantic film-noir from the 1950s through slick editing and vibrant storytelling, this film shines with the powerful cinematic appeal of actress Emma Stone and supporting actor Ryan Gosling, both of whom blossom on screen in a romance that not only feels original, it almost magical in every sense. It is sweet, it's sexy, and most importantly vastly unpredictable. And if the cast performances and sensational musical numbers tightly grips your attention, Damien Chazelle also has a sweet appetite for visual storytelling; an aspect this film greatly embraces. Set in modern day Los Angeles, this follows Mia (played by Emma Stone), a struggling actress who crosses paths with a passionate jazz pianist Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling). As the two bond and a boiling romance develops between them, their separate careers grow further and further in the entertainment industry which puts a rift on their relationship.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle effectively breathes life into the romance genre, operating on both narrative and technical elements have been abandoned since the Golden Age of Hollywood back in the 50s. Opening up with a vibrant musical number on a crowded highway, this film mixes elements of classic musicals with a gripping love story that gracefully comes to life on both a narrative and visual scope. The pinnacle to the film is a love story between two individuals of different backgrounds who grow further and further in love and before too long, are progressively drawn into each other's remarkable world. And rather driving the story on overbearing melancholy, Chazelle proceeds the story through a sense a humanity and spirit without feeling the need to rely on redundant formula. To add icing on the cake, the film expresses a sense of spirit and sensation through a series of musical numbers that are not only evoke nostalgia of classic 50s musicals but play out very provocatively. During these scenes, we are introduced to both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's surprising singing abilities arguably very few knew they've processed. And these scenes blossom with beautiful cinematography by Linus Sandgren (of David O. Russell's 'Joy' and 'American Hustle') who strives to not only capture the energy of these of the duo's lively performances but also the colorful palette of nighttime Los Angeles and the character's outfits.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Goslings are both the apex of the picture, and explode on screen with performances that can only be described as mesmerizing; and even that sounds like an understatement. Emma Stone who rose to Oscar territory with her performance in the Oscar-winning picture 'Birdman', shines her light with charm and vibrancy in her role. And the biggest surprise comes not only from her ability to drown herself in a dramatic characterization but also with her lively singing ability which she displays on screen a good number of sequences. Down-to-Earth and swarming with humanity, Stone breathes life into her character. Working along her side is co-star Ryan Goslings who steps in the shoes with her romantic partner Sebastian, a jazz musician with a passion to igniting a future for jazz music and disillusioned by the fading light the classic music genre has evolved in America's culture. When he crosses paths with Emma Stone's Mia, he almost desperately tries to his artful world upon learning of her lack of appeal in the classic style of music. His performance along with his singing ability is a thing of beauty, and by far the most enthralling performance he's ever ignited in this career. The chemistry these two share is brought by Damien Chazelle's engrossing direction which renders their romantic spark simply irresistible, even during long periods without them on screen together. The romance between these characters never feels contrived or hokey but thoroughly uncompromising.<br/><br/>La La Land is an electrifying romantic masterpiece swelling with vibrant performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and best of all boasts an outstanding directorial exertion from Damien Chazelle. Furthermore, it ignites life into a dimming romantic genre. In a stunning conclusion, La La Land takes a soft spot as one of the best films of 2016."

She has incredible acting skills. Her range of facial emotions is just wonderful . I love the end of the movie and how it makes me feel. Emma Stone deserves Oscar for this great leading role. She simply is the best actress in Hollywood this year. Overall La La Land is movie for every California dreamer and truly inspiring story for every romantic. I am surprise that musical can be so good. One of the best movie of all time . I recommend it to anyone who loves LA."
"petricor","6","5","11","15 January 2017"," So are you a romantic or cynic?
","I was very much looking forward to La La Land, being a fan of old Hollywood musicals the likes of Fred and Ginger, etc. It was disappointing, because it seemed like watching two different movies - the whimsical romantic comedy musical and the realistic gut-wrenching drama.<br/><br/>The beginning sets you up feeling like you're on cloud nine and you might even forget neither of the two actors can really sing or be remotely comparable to old musicals in terms of dancing ability. And really, it's okay. We don't need a technically amazing singing and dancing pair of actors, because that's not what Hollywood is like today. The feel of the bygone musical era was there in La La Land and it was enough to make you feel good about life.<br/><br/>...and then the feeling is snatched from you in the second half and you wonder what the heck happened. It's not even ""reality,"" it's pure old cynicism, and in any other movie, this would have been tolerated, but a movie which set its mind up to be a delightful jazz tapping number, it's nothing short of a betrayal.<br/><br/>For a movie talking of pipe dreams, when does a dream become so fixed you're unwilling to compromise or look past it to make your life more enjoyable? While some people find there's nothing wrong with staying constant and going after what you want, some people understand life's a little more dynamic and staying true to an original dream can be equally toxic. It's called adaptation. I'm not sure Chazelle was trying to be ironic or not with La La Land. Therefore, I can't seriously recommend this as best picture or inspiring, but I have to admit, at least it presented jazz in a good light, so yay? To add, acting is great. Music has a few haunting, dreamy, and often melancholic hooks to keep you humming along. Dancing is decent for today's Hollywood. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did a superb job, especially Gosling. He stole the show with his piano-playing performance and deserves whatever accolades he receives. It's just, to my dismay and horror, the story falls flat on its face and easily ruins the movie from becoming any greater.<br/><br/>In summary, this is the ultimate movie to test whether you're a romantic or a cynic. Turns out I'm not as much of the latter as I thought I was and therein lies the problem of being able to fully enjoy La La Land. A big pity. 6/10"

"SpoodermanDerp","10","5","11","15 January 2017"," What A Lovely Night Indeed
","*MINOR VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW* <br/><br/>Chazelle's La La Land not only succeeds at being an outright love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and be able to convey the magic it had, but also succeeds at being a grounded, profound, and genuine depiction of how we aspire for dreams. The film shows another side of how we try to achieve success or how we essentially try to be the best in our craft and passion just like in his previous film ""Whiplash"" (2014), but what's so special about this film is the fact that the dreams of the characters give way for their love to flourish, but at the same time it inevitably sets them apart.<br/><br/>The classical and nostalgic backdrop of the film compliments the dream like aesthetic and feel that drips in every scene. From being presented in Cinemascope, to the the Ingrid Bergman wallpaper, to the breathtakingly fitting colorful color palettes, the musical numbers that make you wonder if this film truly is set in the 21st century and the dialogue that is reminiscent of the usual golden age superstars like James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. All in all, this film breathes an atmosphere that truly makes it feel like we are dreaming along with the protagonists and it also makes you want to go back to the times where films weren't bloated with excessive blockbusters or piffle cash grabs and instead bring in the uplifting or melancholy magic that they should truly present. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling bring in their best performances yet, with a triple- threat-esque nature to their performances just like the legendary actors from the golden age of cinema, as both of them truly knew how to sing, dance, and most of all, act. The simple nuances each character bring to screen even in the smallest detail of visual comedy (which people rarely do nowadays), or visual story telling in each scene that makes the audience learn so much about a certain character with just one look or change in their face, this is real acting, show and don't tell. This is the same reason why we remember Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart so much from Casablanca, because they did not need to convey their love through oblivious dialogue, but through one glance at each other and we know it tells countless stories. We immediately know Stone's character ""Mia""'s aspirations as she glances at an actress and see a strong emotion present in her face, she didn't need to say anything more or outright say ""This is my dream!"" through some sort of monologue. This is tremendously subtle and well done acting that we rarely see nowadays. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and stunning in each scene, the locations are incredibly iconic and nostalgic and the back drop of Los Angeles, especially at night, gives the movie an unique feel that will definitely remind you of the golden ages.<br/><br/>The story and plot is quite simple, yet layered enough to be such a universal story that anyone can fully grasp or have some sort of relation to. Sure it tells a faithful love story to the usual tropes and stories we saw in the 40s or 50s, but it tells it through the lens of so many specific and realistic aspects of life. The use of jazz once again by Chazelle just like in Whiplash, and of course acting as a profession, helps layer the story to a more grounded level, their dreams. Another way to view this film is to see how it may not have been entirely a love story after all. Sure there is no denying the chemistry and love brought by the two DID EXIST, but in the end it was a story about conflict and compromise and about how sometimes, compromise is walking away from something for each person's benefit no matter how hard it is. The film presents that love can be used as a tool to help you achieve your dreams and how even at the end, if not everything ends up the way it is, you acknowledge and find compromise in that arbitrary feeling and connection of love that helped you in the way. In the film Whiplash, the protagonist had to leave his girlfriend because he thinks that love was a distraction to the goal he needed to achieve, but in La La Land, they explore how love CAN also help you reach the goals you want in life. But in the end, just like most things in life, you cannot have everything and this is why this film is such an honest and inspiring depiction of people who want to aspire for something.<br/><br/>In the end, La La Land wasn't just a love letter to the golden age of Hollywood, it was also a love letter to the fools who dream, it's a love letter to anyone who wants to find someone in the crowd who can lift them off the ground, it's a love letter to anyone who may have been discouraged or disheartened in achieving something, it's a love letter to anyone who feels like dancing and singing see themselves flying off with their dreams.<br/><br/>Verdict: 9.9/10"
"Zoe_Read","10","5","11","14 January 2017"," Simply brilliant.
","I went to see La La Land yesterday (13/1/2017) and I am IN LOVE. I can't believe how long the UK has waited for this movie. One of my favourite scenes is where they dance together for the first time on the hill after the party, they get closer to kiss and the phone goes off. I love how it's got a golden days of Hollywood feel to everything but it's set in the modern day where phones exist and it's just a classic moment that would happen in old films that was subsequently and humorously ruined by a phone! What I loved about this movie was how it was like a dream unfolding in front of me.<br/><br/>I think we've been waiting a few years to see a musical as glorious as this. It's fresh, new and yet it's reminiscent. It invites you in and quite honestly, I would say this film applies to not just people wanting to be actresses or own a jazz club, but everyone who's going out there and dreaming and it's almost a moral of 'Keep on dreaming. Make your dreams a reality'. Yes it's a jazzed (haha pun) up view of the world and the real world isn't as rosy and sweet but it can if you believe in it. <br/><br/>Not even joking, even in the first song I was nearly crying tears of joy because of how happy, bright and amazing it was! I'm such a wimp! City of Stars made me tremble with goosebumps (and also proper tears). The end was made sadder by the audience silently whimpering as well. But I just love, love, LOVE every feeling and emotions you get from it. How it's so bright and beautiful and the cinematography had me. I'm an avid enthusiast of nicely shot camera angles, colours and gradients and there wasn't a camera shot I didn't like. Everything worked!<br/><br/>I wish and would quite happily talk about this movie for hours but I'm yet to find someone in my life who has watched it or love it as much as I do!Ôªø"

After the dark perspective of the Jazz world, Chazelle gives us the other end of the spectrum, with the celebratory joy of jazz through the passionate Sebastian, opposite a display of the labour in Hollywood through Mia's ambition to be an actress.<br/><br/>What we find the film taking us on is a massive tribute to Hollywood golden cinema age from the 30s-50s. Enjoy all the layered reference and hat tip to Gene Kelly's lamppost dancing Singin' in the Rain (1952), and monumental epilogue attributing An American in Paris,(1951) to the underlining echoes of Casablanca (1942), From its overwhelming screen presence, La La Land is marvellous treat for the eyes, consisting of unforgettable set piece designs and locations combined with stunning colour schemes in scenery and costume. This of course is the setting for the magnificent soundtrack of songs. From the eccentric 'Another Day of Sun' from the start, to heart tugging 'Audition' La La land contains amazing original music about reach for the star Brilliant cinematography by Linus Sandgren, who guides in a fluent vibrant city in a sensational visual presence especially during the songs, particular opening with Birdman endless take around the dancing traffic drivers. Against Justin Hurwitz heart-rendering score, powers the fairy tale wonderland that our two dreamers enter in their romance and aspirations.<br/><br/>Clearly Chazelle has a massive passion for music and he has not let us down yet at an age of 31.

","A bold statement I admit, when you have to size it up against West Side Story and Singin' in the Rain. But from the first bar of Another Day of Sun - a huge Busby Berkeleyesque number - that erupts on the gridlocked freeways of LA you know you are actually in heaven.<br/><br/>The two central characters, Mia and Sebastian, are introduced at its finale and we set off on a love story like no other. (Are there even any other actors in the film. I'll have to look next time. Oh yes. John Legend completely taking the Mickey out of himself. Tip your hat to him for that.) <br/><br/>Well, it's like the Umbrellas of Cherbourg actually, but better, so so much better.<br/><br/>There are only actually 7 songs in it. So it's quite an unmusical, musical. And neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone can really properly sing. But that's beside the point.<br/><br/>Writer and director Damian Chazelle (Whiplash - another magical movie about jazz) subverts the musical genre by having almost no music in the third and fourth acts. But it doesn't matter because now he has a story to tell. <br/><br/>Emma Stone is nothing short of mesmerising. <br/><br/>Those eyes. <br/><br/>That cinematography. <br/><br/>Those costumes.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling. A fault free cinema superstar. He rises eloquently and handsomely to the occasion.<br/><br/>But even though they are both brilliant this is Damian Chazelle's movie. He has the mark of a master with his direction and storytelling.<br/><br/>It even has tap dancing. <br/><br/>I won't spoil it for you by sharing the full storyline as I knew nothing of it before I went to see it but I confess I was worried about the hype and the knowledge that the leads can't sing. There was no need to worry and you shouldn't either because this movie is about the unique vision of Damian Chazelle. He is clearly a scholar of big studio big budget musicals and has used the power of Whiplash's success to create a dream that no-one has been allowed to tamper with. It's a deconstruction and reconstruction of everything that makes great musicals great but with the twist outlined above.<br/><br/>City of Stars has already picked up a Golden Globe, and rightly so, but it's not even the best song in the movie. <br/><br/>It's difficult to go much further without spoilers so I'll leave it at that. <br/><br/>Probably the best musical movie ever made. I led the applause and went to buy a ticket for the showing immediately after the one I'd seen but circumstances prevented me from watching it back to back. I'll have to wait until later this week when it opens properly.<br/><br/>Put it this way I'm now extremely jealous of the 99% of the world's population who have yet to see La La Land and I beseech you to follow my actions.<br/><br/>A straight 10/10. No question."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","11","1 January 2017"," Not fully a musical technically, but what a musical!
","""La La Land"" is the best musical that Hollywood has to offer for a long, long time. Yes, I split hair. A basic characteristic of a Broadway musical is that the music numbers are very much a part of the show in entirety, with a pivotal function of advancing the story. The motion picture screen however offers more flexibility. ""La La Land"" has a story that is told first and foremost by the superb acting of the two leads. The musical numbers augment but do not subsume their acting performance<br/><br/>If your movie viewing goes back to the 50s and 60s, the opening frame with the once familiar ""Cinemascope"" routine will right away grab your attention. As you go along, things from the colour palette of the picture to the unabashed Ginger Rogers-Fred Astaire routine confirm the walk in retro land. But make no mistake about it. This is L.A. of today when we live and die by smart cell phones.<br/><br/>The opening number, ""Another day of sun"", is set on a freeway. Using everything from steel band to hula hoop to skate board, the ensemble of incidental drivers stuck in a traffic jam generate an energy level that reminds me of Irving Berlin's ""There's no business like show business"" (not a very good comparison, I confess). But you don't see them again. In fact, this movie has little by way of support cast (J.K. Simmons fans, be forewarned ‚Äì he is no more than a cameo). Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling carry the whole show. They are, of course, good enough, but that is a gross understatement. They are riveting.<br/><br/>The story is anything but original, but it is in the telling and portraying that it shines. They play two young people each with a passion for an art and a commitment for its fulfilment. Mia is a struggling actress, struggling for six years going from one frustrating audition to another, making ends meet by working as a barista. Seb's (for Sebastian) predicaments are all too similar, with traditional jazz as his passion but playing cheap music in a bar. The trajectory is predictable: they meet (with a rocky start, as usual), they fall in love, they move in together, their cup runneth over with love. Then comes the reality of hard choice between love and career.<br/><br/>What puts this story a notch above the familiar run-of-the-mill fodder is that little additional depth. The touring band he joins is rewarding both financially and emotionally (applauses and all that) but deep down there is the question of whether he truly likes the kind of music to which he has adapted himself. What about his dream of opening a small jazz club for only purists? She is always there to be his conscience, challenging him. And this works both ways. When her self-confidence is progressively gnawed away he is there to shake her up, even when they have already broken up. ""I am always gonna love you"", they say to each other. But this transcends just romantic love. It is an artist empathizing with, and loving the passion and commitment of another.<br/><br/>I shall be negligent if I gloss over the musical aspect. Both of the leads are actors before singers and dancers. But they are more than competent in these other departments. The witty song-and-dance number ""A lovely night"" is quite a treat to the eyes and their rendition of the theme song ""City of Stars"" (Golden Globe nominated) touches the heart.<br/><br/>The ending sequence is a master stroke. It is what the magic of motion picture can give you (yes, it can be done skilfully on stage too, but not quite with the magic of the movie screen). You emerge from the cinema with a kind of lingering bitter-sweet magic. Then, back in reality, you will say to yourself, they are not doing too badly after all, when you think of places like Aleppo."

","La La Land (2016) Starring: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, J.K. Simmons, Finn Wittrock, John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt, Tom Everett Scott, Jason Fuchs, Jessica Rothe, Sonoya Mizuno, Callie Hernandez, Josh Pence, Anna Chazelle, Meagen Fay, Hemky Madera, Zo√´ Hall, Dempsey Pappion, Claudine Claudio, Jordan Ray Fox, and Olivia Hamilton Directed By: Damien Chazelle Review HERE'S TO THE FOOLS WHO DREAM. Finally it took a while but it's finally in theaters so I go to see it. I saw the teaser when it first premiered online and when Ryan Gosling finished singing City of Stars I knew I had see it. Along with the fact that my wife Emma Stone is in it. LOL! No but I ugh I knew it had to be special. Mia, an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian, a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart. I am not a big fan of musicals but to name a few from the past I do enjoy they're Grease, Les Miserables and Into The Woods. But this is the best Musical I have ever seen. It even feels like an old Hollywood original film. Mia (Emma Stone) who is an aspiring actress works at a coffee shop right next to a building where they filmed Casablanca and has posters in her room. Sebastian( Ryan Gosling) is a pianist who loves Jazz and has a passion for it. You can tell just n the first 15-20 minutes by lines of dialogue. You could totally get into there characters because of there passions. The cutaways for the film reminded of like a serial or old TV show or movie even the way it ends. The reason I'm not a big fan of musicals because when the movie finishes I usually don't sing any of the songs or they just don't hit me. But I couldn't stop singing City of Stars or the fools who dream when I left the theater. La La Land is the best film I have seen in the genre of romance- Musical has beautiful editing and singing. Great songs that you will be singing long after you see it and has lovely performances from two great actors who have proved to have chemistry. I'm giving La La Land a five out of five, this is destined to be a classic nay it is a classic."
"quinimdb","10","5","11","21 December 2016"," La La Land
","With its extravagant, fantastically choreographed opening scene, all done in a single long take, ""La La Land"" shows that it is inspired by the great classic musicals from the golden age of Hollywood, yet I can say with certainty that this surpasses all of those.<br/><br/>Last year, the most technically impressive films of the year were ""The Revenant"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", two intense action films. This year, it's ""La La Land"", a romantic musical. The cinematography, set design, costume design, and choreography of the film are all pretty much flawless. Almost every dance scene is done in one perfect long take, as the camera flows naturally with the characters' dance, and when they are cuts, it is edited flawlessly, and each moment transitions into the next perfectly. The cinematography and editing are fast paced and energetic when they need to be, but also slow and elegant when necessary. The film is incredibly ambitious, which fits, considering it's about having dreams and ambitions, and just going for them.<br/><br/>On top of its technical brilliance, the film has fantastic writing and characters, and just as the set design and choreography and cinematography and lighting and lyrics of each musical number perfectly align, the musical numbers flow perfectly with the story. The musical numbers are reflections of the characters' romanticism of each other and the world around them, and as they slowly lose their romanticism, the dance numbers begin to happen less. Even outside of the musical numbers, the cinematography, lighting, and colors of each scene match the feelings of the characters. Vibrant reds, blues, greens, and yellows show up often to depict the joy and happiness of the characters while more dull and standard lighting shows their displeasure with their life at the moment. There is also one fantastic montage in which the cinematography depicts how both characters, while still in a relationship, now feel distant and lonely due to complications with their jobs. The film is also incredibly comedic at times (mostly towards the beginning), and the performances by the main two leads are very charismatic and passionate, and it allowed me to easily connect with these two characters.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be among the greatest and most original directors working today. In 2014, he did his first film, ""Whiplash"" and it blew me away. Now he has done his second film, and it is completely different in tone, genre, and style, yet is executed just as perfectly."
"eventpix","6","5","11","19 December 2016"," Is that all there is?
","I haven't lived in Los Angles in almost thirty years and was curious to see a movie about the present day city. I was really quite surprised to find that there appear to be no same sex couples there.... not on the streets, in restaurants and clubs, at parties... anywhere! Of course, lack of LGBT representation doesn't make this a bad movie and the fact that there wasn't a hint of even a token LGBT character doesn't really mean much because, other than the two lovers, there weren't any characters to speak of. OK, there was John Legend's who has about six lines of dialog and a big song that really has nothing to do with the narrative. There was a sister.... what happened to her? and the room mates.... what happened to them? the restaurant owner? <br/><br/>I can think of two other musicals that rely almost entirely on the give and take in a relationship: ""I do! I do!"" was a hit on Broadway but that at least follows the couple over the course of fifty years. A more recent movie, ""The Last Five Years"", probably has much more in common with ""La La Land"", but that movie rates a 5.9 on IMDb and this one is currently clocking a stupendous 8.9<br/><br/>My guess is that if the two main characters really connect with your inner daydream this movie will really resonate for you. Let's face it, the notion that Mia would somehow write a one woman show, pull together the money to rent a theater and mount a production, give up completely and return to Nevada, be called in by a director who somehow has the funds for a movie and a location, Paris, but no script.... and presumably tracks her down to offer her both the lead and the script-writing, all on the strength of one performance? This is clearly daydream territory. So, be my guest, dream on. It's just that I didn't particularly like either character and that leaves me being entertained, up to a point, by everything else. The singing was OK, the dancing too. The music was OK. The snappy production was impressive but I personally preferred the long, live, takes and the more realistic look of ""The Last Five Years"", a movie that never got the hype that surrounds this one. <br/><br/>So that brings me back, in a way, to my original point. Twenty-five years ago ""Newsies"" was a major studio re-launch of the classic movie musical. I remember that it got some the worst reviews I have ever seen and bombed at the box office. Even now, after selling zillions of VCR and DVD units, and spawning an, originally overlooked, but eventually smash hit Broadway production it only rates a 6.9 here. Could that be because it was directed by Kenny Ortega and features a cast of dancing paperboys, and not the dreamy pairing of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone? <br/><br/>So my point would be that ""La La Land"" is really awesome as the ultimate heterosexual movie musical of our time. It's not fabulous and it clearly doesn't want to be. It traces its origins back to Fred and Ginger, or Gene and Debbie, but without the aid of Edward Everett and Helen, or Donald and Jean or any of the characters that helped to make those movies so memorable. And so I would ask, ""Is that all there is?"""

","Just saw La La Land yesterday in IMAX and am glad I did. This movie is a visual experience that must be experienced in the biggest screen possible.<br/><br/>But while I think it's a good movie, I'm sorry to say it's not as great as many of the critics have said it is.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I love Musicals. But it not in the same league as Musicals like Singin' in the Rain (my favorite), Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and Cabaret. I even like modern Musicals like Moulin Rouge. Though I know comparing one movie to another is wrong, as each movie is different and unique, but you tend to compare movies of the same genre (Raging Bull vs Rocky).<br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>1. The Direction is good.<br/><br/>2. Performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are really good.<br/><br/>3. Music is good.<br/><br/>4. Cinematography is beautiful. Feels like a Van Gogh painting come to life.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>1. Script is uneven. First half is not engaging, things improve post intermission, but¬Ö<br/><br/>2. I wouldn't call this a negative but takes too much inspiration from movies like ""American in Paris"" and a lot form French Musicals like ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort.""

"ferguson-6","9","5","11","6 December 2016"," a gem with full spectrum of emotions
","Greetings again from the darkness. Is this a nostalgic throwback to the movie musicals of Stanley Donen and Fred Astaire, or is it a contemporary film designed to revitalize the movie musical genre in an era dominated by superheroes and sci-fi? However you might choose to label writer/director Damien Chazelle's follow-up to Whiplash (2014), it's clearly one of the best and most entertaining movies of the year.<br/><br/>While the opening credits are still rolling (""Presented in CinemaScope"" being the first gag), the film kicks off with its only large scale (think Busby Berkeley on a L.A. freeway rather than in a swimming pool) musical production, ""Another Day of Sun"". It's also the first of 3 less-than-warm-and-fuzzy ""meetings"" between the two lead characters before they finally click.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling light up the screen with the same incredible chemistry they displayed in Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011). Mia (Ms. Stone) is a struggling actress-wannabe working behind the counter at the Warner Brothers studio coffee shop. Sebastian (Mr. Gosling) is a pianist committed to the traditions of jazz music ¬Ö even as he toils in a club playing mainstream tunes for folks who aren't even listening.<br/><br/>As their relationship develops, we get a tap dance number in the Mulholland Drive moonlight. Soon, Sebastian (kind of a brooding Gene Kelly or a dancing James Dean) is forced to make a choice between finding a way to open his own jazz club or compromising his integrity by making lots of money joining a ""hot"" band (led by John Legend), while Mia is focusing on auditions and her writing (which leads to a disastrous one-woman show).<br/><br/>Director Chazelle and cinematographer Linus Sandgren create a look in line with Singin' in the Rain, but a tone more suited to A Star is Born. There is no shortage of romance and music, but it's equally balanced with melancholy, foolish dreams, and shattered hopes. While it's an homage to old Hollywood, Los Angeles and movie musicals, it seems to gracefully swing between past and present ‚Äì and reality and fantasy.<br/><br/>Mia has a bedroom wall mural of Ingrid Bergman, while Sebastian treasures his piano stool that once belonged to Hoagy Carmichael ¬Ö two more examples of past and present intertwined. Ms. Stone and Mr. Gosling possess solid (not exceptional) singing voices, which aids in having the songs tell their story. Ms. Stone is quite a talent, and especially stands out in her audition scenes ¬Ö we feel her pouring her heart out to casting agents who may or may not even be paying attention. It's remarkable work from her.<br/><br/>Supporting work is provided by Rosemarie DeWitt (as Sebastian's sister), JK Simmons (as a club owner and Sebastian's boss), Finn Wittrock (as Mia's boyfriend) and Damon Gupton. Also in supporting roles would be the Griffith Observatory (after a Rebel Without a Cause viewing), the Los Angeles scene, and the Warner Brothers lot.<br/><br/>The ""What Could Have Been"" ending sequence is top notch filmmaking in all aspects, and perfectly caps a movie that drips with nostalgia ¬Ö while also being touching, funny, and downright fun. Watching this film is much like going through the ups and downs of a relationship, and it deserves to be seen on the big screen ‚Äì enjoy the full palette of colors and the full spectrum of emotions (love and heartbreak, frustration, anger, and utter joy). This is one to tell your friends about ¬Ö don't wait for them to tell you."

They feel real and the flaws in their vocals are just beautiful to tell the story.<br/><br/>The opening scene was a little bit too long for me but it works.<br/><br/>The scene at the observatory was a bit too dreamy but It felt like watching Mary Poppins which I absolutely love and didn't care about the resemblance.<br/><br/>The ending was totally unexpected.

","La la land is a cinematic masterpiece. Director Damien Chazelle proves that he is the best director in the business right now. Following up Whiplash with something like this is astonishing. The visual effects and camera work are the best we've seen in the past years. Emma Stone's oscar winning performance is her best work as an actress, with Ryan Gosling as the love interest in his oscar nominating performance. The original soundtrack ignites the film with powerful pieces, especially the piano. This has to be considered one of the best movies of the twenty first century."

","I should say that I stopped watching after one hour. That was enough. The film still hadn't started. Apart from the fact that the music is mediocre, the real problem lies in the lack of authenticity of the characters. She is supposed to be a down on her luck actress and he is a down on his luck jazz pianist. The trouble is, they fail to portray this vulnerability because there is none of it to portray. If you think about Billy Bigelow in Carousel, he puffs himself up and puts on veneer of bravado because underneath he believes he's a nobody. In the end, this is his undoing. In La La Land, the two main characters are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling (rather than the characters they are supposed to be portraying). I don't buy into the characters at all. She lives in a nice place. They both have cars. They go to nice places if they want to. There is no sense of feeling disenfranchised or smashed by life. There are no songs anything remotely like ""If I loved you"", ""Feed the birds"", ""The sound of music"". High school musical is way better."

","I wasn't sure if I was to like this as I tend to duck the hyped titles from Hollowwood.<br/><br/>Well the first act of three parts was perky enough to keep me in the evolvement of the story, then the second act dropped the ball with a less than gripping conflict build up as jazz ambition is swapped for easier cash. To me this was the least musical part as it circled this uninteresting part in an attempt to have real conflict of interest. Act three was a 15 minute montage that made a reprise of the developed story and the eternal question of what could have become if we down our path had the chance to choose over, go into other direction and have a life that could have been the fulfilment we ought to have had.
I thought this part was genuinely moving.<br/><br/>But musicals are to be full of music, yes ? No ? I was hoping a little for something closer to heart as I was swept by A Chorus Line and All That Jazz.

","Seemingly frivolous details can destroy one's most cherished dreams. Feelings of excitement and disappointment are reflected in the music and lyrics. In ""La la land"" the lyrics are enjoyable and life-affirming. The film teaches people to sing their emotions. For the average person to express her/his feelings of love is quite difficult. But, for example, if someone tried to form into a song his/her feelings of anger, hate, sadness, that might possibly help in saving the beloved and prevent tragic consequences. And finally, song is a beautiful way to share emotions among people."
"andrewroy-04316","9","2","3","4 September 2018"," Despite its imperfections and focus on style, La La Land improves with each act and by the end is emotionally captivating
","While La La Land would seem to be a combination of things I dislike (romantic focus, musical, more style than substance), I was surprised by how deeply I was invested in the two main characters. Gosling is phenomenal, and Stone puts on a performance for the ages. The script is tight and showcases many sides of their characters. I'm not one for musicals, but I will admit that the music from the movie was excellent. La La Land definitely left me shrugging at times - I didn't like the opening sequence or the first act in general, as the development of how their relationship came to be was unrealistic and inevitable. The lack of real, developed supporting characters also hurt the movie - neither of them really had anyone else relevant in their lives, or by chance no other intriguing characters become relevant in the plot? Several times I was taken out of the story because of a song and dance number that to me didn't add anything to the movie and just prevented more interactions from happening. Despite these problems, La La Land truly improves as the movie progresses, and by the third act I was enthralled. The ending was heartbreaking and brilliant, as I'm coming to expect from Chazelle. Showing the events unfold from Gosling's point of view really made the ending hit home, and while it's sad, it feels satisfying and right. For all its flaws, I loved Gosling and Stone's characters, and Chazelle again directs a great movie and excellent third act."

","I didn't expect to like this film, in fact, I actually closed myself off to the idea. It wore me down from the first second and by the tenth, I was in for the long haul. To be clear, you have to be in the prepared to let down the barriers and let te cheese engulf you. It's warm, it's cold, it's a copy and yet so original. It's a nod to The Hollywood of old with an even bigger nod to today's audience. Yeah, Gosling is moody and Yes, Stone is quirky but they have the depth of you read between the lines. Don't expect this film to spell out everything for you. You should see a Michael Bay film if you need that."
"blrnani","7","2","3","17 February 2018"," Not the best 2016 film, but much better than the one that won the Oscar!
","Despite the very obvious contrivances, I enjoyed this film. Let's face it, films where two people singing loudly in one another's ear is not realistic. But often we find we'd like the world to be more like that - look at the opening routine, in response to traffic congestion, for example.
I sympathise with the desire to popularise jazz, which at its best is wonderful music, but all too often sounds like a combo all playing different tunes, or the same indulgence as much late 60s progressive rock, where the performers take a long detour so each instrumentalist can show off what they can do with the instrument. For me music is, essentially, melody and anything else tends to be just showing off (which is why so many young singers over-sing songs today). I also find the ethnic ownership battles foolish, veering on repugnant. The Beatles and Michael Jackson didn't produce music for 'white' or 'black' people! They just produced great music that could be enjoyed by anyone who appreciated the style. So the backlash against a 'white' guy trying to save jazz, and rejection of the film in favour of a much inferior one that had the right skin tone (it might be considered in some spheres to have introduced homosexuality to 'the black audience' but I think that's ludicrous; the guy wasn't gay, he was just grabbing onto affection in the one place he found it - in every other respect he followed the 'black' cliches of drug trafficker with gold teeth and flashy car) really turned me off the whole 'Oscars' crap.
With so many reviews, I'm sure the major aspects have been more than adequately covered by others, so I will limit myself to something that most people who I've talked to about this film have overlooked, in relation to the ending. Of course we all (well most people, surely) wanted them to get together in the end. But what I really liked about the ending and those ironic smiles is that - because they truly loved one another - they were really pleased that each had followed their dream and achieved it. And that's what love is all about - putting somebody else's well-being and success ahead of our own desires. Sadly, those desires are far too often expressed in a desire for ownership and control of the other person, who needs to be constrained within our shadow. That's not love, that's slavery! So it was wonderful to see this film rise up above that and send out the positive message of following our dreams and translating our love into helping and encouraging others to follow their dreams too!"
"Peaceful224","4","2","3","5 February 2018"," Nominated for an Oscar?
","It took me a while to finally watch this critically acclaimed, massively popular, iconic movie. 
And after watching it, I just can't believe this movie was nominated for an Oscar and nearly won Best Picture of the Year. (Remember that hilarious unforgettable mistake?) Before I watched it, I had heard all the backlash and people hating on it for all it's awards and popularity, and I was like, ""Oh I'm sure this movie is really good and people are just jealous of it's popularity."" I love musicals, so I thought I would easily like it. And while I was watching it, I was trying to enjoy it.... But I couldn't.
There were only about two things I liked about this movie. 1) It's colorfulness. It has such beautiful cinematography! 2) The acting is pretty good. A lot of musical numbers and scenes seemed to be inspired from older musicals, and I think it was cool that they were trying that.
But the movie was very slow, and at times quite boring. There were times while I was watching it where it really made me feel depressed. And... I just wasn't feeling the passion in the music. It lacked something that other musicals have. I just wasn't feeling the music in this musical. It wasn't really making me feel anything and something always felt missing. City of Stars was a little catchy but that's about it. And the ending? I understand they were trying to be different and basically say that things don't always go the way we plan them to, but still... It ends with them staring at each other? It should have ended with them dancing and singing together happily! 
I had such high hopes for this movie, and I think I can understand why other people might like it, but I also understand why it got backlash. And I can't believe it almost won best picture of the year!
It feels strange and weird that I rated movies like Pitch Perfect higher that have way much less depth than La La Land... But idk, it seems to me they have something La La Land doesn't. At least they have happy endings! I gave it 4 stars for the decent acting and colorfulness"
"wilia_kurnia","10","2","3","31 January 2018"," Think about it again
","You have to think about this movie again after you watch this movie, or else you have to watch it twice. Why? because at the first time you will be dissapointed, just like me. I was so excited when all the praise of this movie came out on movie review sites, because musical movies nowadays are very rare. Moreover, I listened to this movie's soundtrack before I watched the movie and I liked it so much. Both of those reasons drove me to see it in the theater. When I watched it on the theater, there's no denial that I was really blown away by the cinematography, the songs, the acting, but I was... dissapointed? maybe because it didn't go as I have predicted or expected? I was thinking a lot why they didn't end up together? It's just ridiculous. I was expecting for an uplifting and happily ever after ending movie, and what I got was exactly the opposite. <br/><br/>
After re-think about it, I realize that the-no-happily-ever-after-ending is the reason why this movie is brilliant. This is not just about a love story made into a musical movie. This is not your typical happily-ever-after movie. It's deeper than that : It's about sacrifice and choices that have to be made if you want to pursue something, in this case is love, or career. It's about how you feel discouraged when you want to pursue your dream, because you always feel that maybe you are just no that good compared to other people, but you just need to hold on and don't give up. Damien Chazelle definitely did a fantastic job for creating a piece of art combined with magnificent story and messages."

"connordimmock","10","2","3","10 November 2017"," La La Land ‚Äì A Real Classic of this Generation
","La La Land, produced by Marc Platt, Fred Berger and Jordan Horowitz, and expertly written as well as masterfully directed by, relative newcomer, Damien Chazelle, simply put, truly is a masterpiece and is surely destined to go down as one of the classics of this generation of filmmaking.<br/><br/>This is a prime example of one of those rare films in which on every level it seems to succeed, where all elements of the film, including, performances, story, writing, direction and soundtrack come together in such a way that such a sweet ensemble of filmmaking is produced of the very highest standard. Here Chazelle, following his equally commendable outing as writer and director of the critically acclaimed Whiplash, manages to perfectly encapsulate, the magic that really made classic musicals such as, 1952's 'Singin' in the Rain' sparkle and resonate in such a magnificent sort of way. Not only does Chazelle accomplish this with La La Land he goes a step further in bringing a much needed freshness to the film (as well as the genre as a whole) making both La La Land and the musical genre relevant in the world of today.<br/><br/>The brilliantly vibrant La La Land never disappoints with a dull scene, sequence or even a dull shot for that matter, and instead constantly amazes and impresses, delivering a rich tapestry of colourful, scenes, sequences and shots, all dripping with technical and artistic nuances as well as creative flair. You really can tell how much love and just how much hard work went into every scene of this project and how painstakingly it has been put together through with great editing, and fine attention to detail being paid throughout.<br/><br/>Linus Sandgren (American Hustle) heads the outrageously good cinematography bringing his use of frantic yet controlled camera-work to Damien Chazelle's artistic vision. During the impressive music sequences, that look as though most are shot as whole one shot sequences, (unless there is some equally impressive editing going on) it is as though the camera is playing a cat and mouse kind of game, constantly on the move, always one step behind but always right there with the action that needs to be shot. The camera and lighting almost become dancers within the musical themselves, spinning, darting and dancing from shot to shot, punching in between characters with expert precision, creating noticeably, compelling and emotional storytelling. Transitions into musical numbers often combine the camera moving in towards the character as a subtle lighting effect of some type illuminates the character, as if this were a musical being performed on stage.<br/><br/>Enough praise cannot be given to the outstanding music used within the musical, packed full of such musical delights as the quietly hopeful yet melancholy 'City of Stars' and 'Mia and Seb's Theme' as well as the more energetic and upbeat opening song 'Another Day in Sun' and the following 'Someone in the Crowd'. The musical performances of the two leads, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, can also not go without praise. Neither are professional singers, dancers or musicians, but neither are their characters, both are believable in all of their entertaining musical performances, displaying impressive vocals and particularly impressive piano playing on the part of Mr. Gosling.<br/><br/>As stated above, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling head the spot on casting of the film, playing the roles of smart, headstrong, aspiring actress Mia and sarcastic, down on his luck, jazz musician and enthusiast Sebastian, respectively. Both performances are very thought out and believable and the chemistry between the two actors (this being their third film together) is so great and just adds to the overall believability of the relationship the two characters' share. At the start of their stories we find both characters at a point in their lives that they didn't expect to find themselves in, expecting or at least hoping to have been living the more glamorous life of having 'made it' by now. They are both irked with the clich√©s of todays Hollywood life and fed-up of being told they are not good enough, constantly finding themselves on the cusp of 'making it', but unfortunately never succeeding. More fortunately though they end up finding each other along the way, when a 'chance encounter' occurs between the two characters, sparks (eventually) fly, and a romance blossoms, through the shared exasperation of their own lives.<br/><br/>The following love-affair plays out through, the four different seasons of the year, where we see not only passion for one another grow, but we also see the rekindling of the passion for each of their professions in one way or another and through the inspiration and motivation they gain off of each other, wherein lies our conflict.<br/><br/>Tension is built through the conflict at the core of this love-torn romantic, musical story, which is in essence the long fought battle between ambition and love. You are made to thin that the romance of this film refers only to the romance between the two leading characters, however this is not the case. The romance of pursuing one's passion for their craft and the heartache that comes along with such passion is also an integral part of the superb narrative being told here, concluding in one of the deepest and most meaningful, as well as thought provoking, and bittersweet climaxes to a film I have seen in a long time."

Mia (Emma Stone) is a struggling actress working as a barista in between auditions. They fall in love just as their careers take unexpected turns. <br/><br/>As for me, it took to long to get into the story, but it did keep me intrigued as to where would Sebastian and Mia's careers take them? Would they stay together? Would they break up and then get back together? Good movie for the teen girl sleepover."

","La La Land starts with a beautiful number, a single shot with a wide depth of field perfectly choreographed scene that includes dance, song, and capturing the life, color and excitement that Hollywood inspires. We then follow Mia into her world of being an aspiring actress, going through lines with her, a failed audition and everything that follows with that disappointment. Her friends encourage her to go out and try to find someone in the crowd to help her make it big in the famous world, but it does not happen yet. She meets Sebastian when walking home from a party that she doesn't feel that she belongs. We find that Sebastian is a jazz piano player who wants to open his own jazz club and preserve real jazz. When he's in the middle of a song, Mia is drawn to him as if it was the song that speaks to who they are and how their life will change. Throughout the movie, as she continues to audition you can see that every time she changes and moves into a deeper sadness which she feels that she will never be able to become famous. He finds that no one is interested in pure jazz anymore and has to change himself and his dreams in order to survive in this harsh Hollywood world. An over encompassing explanation of this movie is it's about two people who discover themselves and their fame while being together but ultimately live different lives away from each other. <br/><br/>The introducing scene is a very tonal with high contrast block colored costuming which allows the characters to stand out on the busy highway. The music, however, the instrumental overpowered and was mixed higher the vocal. This diminished the quality of the song, making it forgettable. As the music progresses the plot of the musical it distracted from the main goal. The musical has formalistic traditions due to some impossibilities of the scenes, for example, when Mia and Sebastian dance in space during the planetarium scene and the epilogue. There are many realistic styles that are within the movie but it heavily relies on formalism. As realism tries to preserve a fact of an un-manipulated film, while musicals do not follow the ideas of preserving the reality of it due to song and dance. In formalism, the subject matter is very important to the plot and self- expression, which is portrayed using song, dance, and color. This stylized reality makes a magical, enchantment that is far from real life problems and expresses it through song, dance, color and lighting. Through lighting many concepts are portrayed, many scenes within the movie include a deep focus, high contrast dark out focusing on Mia during intimate moments showing her true passion. This use of high lighting shows a deep contrast between the world and her. Many times lighting is used to illuminate the faces of the characters to portray feelings, thoughts, emotions, and actions. For example, during the fight scene between Mia and Sebastian, their faces are illuminated by a yellow light but there is a dark green background behind them, these colors are fighting each other using contemporary colors and this tells the viewers how they should feel in this moment. Another example is when Mia first hears Sebastian playing their song, he's in the building she's outside listening in and a red light illuminates her face showing the romantic side of the movie and their relationship that is soon to come. There was a large use of lighting and darkening during the movie, mainly the use of silhouettes during the epilogue. Color such as blue, yellow, green and red was very important in the film using the bright colors to bring out the characters, the colors bring out the expressive, emotional and atmosphere parts of the movie. During Mia's audition song, blue hues are displayed to show a relaxed, calm and natural feeling set on the characters and the viewers. While warm colors such as red, yellow and orange express aggression, violence, and romance, shown during fights and loving times between Mia and Sebastian.<br/><br/>Overall, although the movie had strong characters, a put together plot and music, which is my favorite thing, the movie didn't meet to the potential or the expectations that everyone made it be. The songs weren't memorable which in a musical is a huge drawback of the principle of a musical. Personally, I believe that the movie was good in the moment and as you're watching it, it brought entertainment and joy, but only in the moment. The movie didn't make people think, didn't have people singing the songs after the movie ended, it didn't have anyone talking about it. Although many of the characters had beautiful voices, I believe the actors were chosen due to their fame rather than the talents they possessed, Emma Stone has a beautiful lower register but most of the songs she sung were in a higher register causing her voice to weaken, sound breathy, and made her seem not confident. Ryan Gosling has exceptional dancing skills as he has danced his entire life, however, his singing skills needed improvement with tone, phrasing and breath support. There was so much hype that two actors were brought back together again (Crazy, Stupid Love) in a pairing that many people enjoy, that it overshadowed any other chance to have two other stars who had the vocal, lyrical and acting perfect for this musical. This movie had various good pieces to it, but the pieces that needed improvement overweight the good pieces creating a film, in my eyes, needed many changes."
"jes-66467","7","2","3","28 September 2017"," LaLa Review
","The film, La la Land, is a story that is carried more by color and music than plot or characters. That is not to say that the plot or characters take away from the film. By nature, musicals tend to compromise character traits and logical scenes for visuals and song. People do not just randomly break into songs or dance to choreographed music. It is difficult to create a musical because the songs should further the plot, fit the characters and not feel too out of place. This film does a decent job of matching the character's songs to their personalities, but I believe that the focus of this movie lies with the colors. The colors in this movie are widely varied both in locations and outfits. Mia, the main character, wears several different dresses throughout the film. These dresses vary wildly in color and appearance. The purpose of the dresses appears to be mostly aesthetic, giving Mia an outfit that would compliment the rest of the scene and make her stand out. La la Land is a film that focuses heavily on aesthetics. These dresses are used in conjunction with several scenes where the lighting changes to emphasize a specific color. This is used to convey emotion as well as pull the viewer's attention to Mia and her actions during these scenes. Scenes with dramatic lighting like this often end up showing more emotional aspects of the story. As a musical, how a character moves and looks is incredibly meaningful to the story. Some of the most striking examples of the use of color include when Mia and Sebastian meet at the moment Sebastian is fired and when Mia and Sebastian argue over his dreams. There are also several scenes that use color together with a low lighting such as when Mia enters the bathroom, walks home, or sings for her recital. These scenes all take advantage of color to highlight both the characters and the atmosphere. Another aspect that this film takes advantage of is the movement of the characters and camera. It is not just the dancing that is eye catching, although that is one of the main uses of movement utilized by the film. When Mia and Sebastian first enter the observatory, the camera spins around displaying the room. This eventually leads to a dance in the star filled observatory itself where the characters appear to be dancing among the stars. I am sure that this is a reference to something, although I am not sure what. This film is very much a product of it's time. It is full of references to other movies, both through the parody of specific scenes and the characters directly mentioning other movies of the time. I believe that a portion of what endears this movie to people is the nostalgia of remembering great movies of the past. This is not inherently a bad thing, but younger members of the audience who may not remember such movies, will not be able to receive the full experience the film was designed to provide. The plot of this movie is relatively simple. The main characters fall in love and decide to follow their dreams, end up failing and break up only to seize the chance to follow their dreams again. One interesting feature of the film is that, while both characters are able to realize their dreams, these dreams cause them to part ways, effectively ending the romantic plot as they each go to live their own lives. There is a happy ending, but it can be seen that they compromised their relationship for the sake of their dreams. It is possible that they could have made everything work out 'perfectly', but I think such an ending would be much less satisfactory and that their ability to each pursue their own dream to fruition is what makes them such likable characters."
"spinedthopter","7","2","3","27 September 2017"," Great at first watch but...
","La La Land is well made cinematographic experience that really leaves a great first impression, the main characters Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) are likable, quirky, individuals who are down on their luck but striving to make their dreams reality. Both characters have big aspirations but not a whole lot of direction as throughout the movie they struggle to make their dreams a reality all while dealing with the issues that come along with having a relationship. The story also moves fairly quickly and is good at making the audience connect with the characters emotions which allows you to get easily invested in the characters and the movie's plot.<br/><br/>The film also does a very good job at using lighting and color during specific conflicts to make them seem more intense. (Spoiler Warning) There is a scene in the film where Mia and Sebastian get into a fight which ultimately destabilizes their relationship to the point where they end up separating not too long afterwards. The scene itself though is very smartly set up, the two main characters are eating dinner together by candle-light so the room isn't brightly lit but the yellow-ish light from the candles blends very well with the lighter green that the room is colored. Yellow and green are analogous colors which tend to make people feel very relaxed and comfortable so a few minutes into the scene when Mia and Sebastian's argument ensues and escalates quickly it comes as a bit of an emotional shock as your initial impression of the scene would make you think that it would be a bit more melancholy than it turns out to be.<br/><br/>Now while this movie does leave a great first impression, it falls flat on any subsequent views. The first time I watched this film it was very emotional and I loved the characters, the dancing, the music, everything in the film made me love it.<br/><br/>However when I watched it a second time with a friend, everything fell flat, like really flat. The story then felt extremely rushed and clich√© as well as there are so many characters that are introduced just to be thrown away a few scenes later. An example of which would be Mia's roommates who seem important when introduced only to disappear after the first 15 minutes only to return briefly for 2 more scenes much later in the film.<br/><br/>Not only this but some of the character conflicts also felt pointless as they did not contribute to the plot or felt like they felt forced just so the plot could actually progress. Also much of the musical score felt really forgettable outside of the opening piece ""Another Day of Sun"" and the piece with John Legend ""We Can Start a Fire"".<br/><br/>All-in-all the film is a great experience, just don't expect to enjoy it the same way if you end of seeing it a second time."
"lambiepie-2","2","2","3","16 September 2017"," LA LA LAND is a lullaby
","I am a big fan of Hollywood Musicals (From Busby Berkley ones to Hedwig and the Angry Inch from the Directors, Choreographers and Dancers like Astaire, Kelly, Caron, Fosse, Dandridge, Charisse, Rivera, Nicolas Brothers, Tune, Moreno, etc... even little Shirley Temple) the ones done ""back in the day"" and some of the more recent ones, which is why I cannot express my disappointment in watching LA LA LAND. So much so, turned to another premium channel that showed the late artist's Prince's ""Sign O' The Times"" (which hadn't been shown in 20 years) and found that more on track for a ""tip to stage musicals"" than LA LA LAND (and let me add I was not a big Prince fan, and I know this was a 'concert' stage film of one of his recordings more than a 'musical' so this is making a point).<br/><br/>LA LA LAND tells the old tale of a struggling (jazz) musician and budding actress in Los Angeles trying to make it. Yes, you've seen it over 100 times, and this is just one more telling. They run into each other at 'meaningless but hoping to get discovered while making ends meet' Hollywood functions they are at. They're dreamers in the land where dreams can or may not come true, Los Angeles - or a reasonable facsimile thereof. One of the biggest problems is that I found the leads, 'eh' - no spark for me between the two, no real 'heart' for me between the two, no reason to make me want to root for their success OR failure whether they were in Los Angeles or anyplace else.<br/><br/>The production numbers are -'eh'. The music is - 'eh'. The dancing is 'eh'. The story is - 'eh'. And 'eh' seems perfect for this 'eh' generation that seems to want to like anything that is a way-watered down or blatantly copied (oops, 'sampled' now called 'homage') version of something that was done infinitely better before.<br/><br/>The emphasis on colors throughout this film are like the colors on products from ""The Price is Right"" - bright, attention-grabbing and staged to where you want to buy them where you can find them. But I didn't buy into this. Want to see good musicals with bright colors, bright music, boy meets girl and dancing..? Bollywood has done it better, much, much, MUCH better and I am as American as apple-pie mind you! I just love musicals.(For example, Bollywood films like 'Jab We Met' or 'Bajirao Mastani' or even 'Cocktail' are done much better).<br/><br/>I would never compare LA LA LAND to ANY the musicals of its past - they are classics and you root for the subjects, tape your feet, get transported to their world, watch amazing choreography and whimsy - even in the more tragic of musical tales. So is LA LA LAND a homage to the old musicals? Tries to be, however just didn't work for me."

"Mike_Devine","5","2","3","12 August 2017"," Welcome to the Gosling & Stone show
","'La La Land' was the toast of the town this past Awards season, earning scores of nominations and six Academy Awards. But while critics loved the film to death, and most of the movie-going audience was cool with it, too, there's no denying that it's a schlockfest that's high on itself and its pretentiousness.<br/><br/>Despite this, 'La La Land' clearly benefits from the vision of Damien Chazelle, who recognized an opportunity to bring back the musical genre in a way that hearkens back to films from decades ago. From the opening freeway sequence to the many impromptu song-and-dance moments scattered throughout, there's a lot of commotion going on. This musical whiplash might be interesting to some, but it can be very jarring for those who are not bonafide fans of the genre. Even though these musical numbers might seem somewhat all over the place, they are actually a useful device that help guide the audience through the story between two struggling Los Angeles transplants (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone). While annoying, ""City of Stars"" is the song that acts as a needle that threads everything together.<br/><br/>But yes, 'La La Land' is basically the Gosling & Stone show. Both are major stars in their own right, and together they do bring a good deal of chemistry to the screen. But when a film relies too heavily on its leads, it can have some weak spots in other areas. For 'La La Land,' this includes the fact that there's pretty much no supporting cast (John Legend's role is an elongated cameo) and there's really no ""there"" there for a plot. Sure, the somewhat straightforward progression of the film is thrown for a loop in the climax, which is refreshing, but it's still not the mark of a first-rate film.<br/><br/>'La La Land' may not have won best picture, but it won enough critical acclaim that was mostly based on what some were hoping the film could be, not what it actually was. It's not the worst thing to come out in 2016, but it's also far from the greatest."

","In January 2016, Aziz Ansari originated an SNL skit where he is interrogated at a police station for insufficiently adoring La La Land. ""I mean¬ÖI liked it! I just didn't think it was ah-mazing!"" he protests. ""What DO you like if you don't like La La Land??!"" is the vitriolic, bellowed response. Well, you'd better get my handcuffs ready. A cynic would point out that every 3-5 years, Hollywood and its audiences remember the musical genre exists, and fall rapturously in love with each new tent-pole release as if its predecessors had never existed (Les Mis√©rables? Chicago? Okay, I'll stop). I'm not cynical enough to dismiss La La Land outright as such, but I am on Ansari's team on this one. Damien Chazelle's follow up to his blistering Whiplash IS lots of fun. It's a boisterous, sweet, massively charming slice of cheese with a sloshing side order of nostalgia. And it buys into its clich√©d, pandering familiarity with such outrageous gusto it's almost easy to forget how fundamentally vacuous it is. So there you go. Lock me up, and throw away the key. <br/><br/>Like 2011's The Artist, it's a glossy, heartfelt riff on the overwhelming power of the Classics (here, in a Whiplash hangover, jazz greats receive equal adulation to Da Moofies) and how soul-crushing it can be to fall short in comparison. It's Scorsese's New York, New York for the YouTube generation, if you will. And this proves to be the film's greatest asset and pitfall simultaneously: it plays phenomenally in instalments. Chazelle is a whiz at conjuring moments of transcendental movie magic, riffing on the whimsical, expressionistic flourishes of the Singin' in the Rain era, bubblegum colours, triumphant tap dancing, floating through the air framed by a sea of stars and all. Linus Sandgren's spectacular cinematography helps astronomically to pump up proceedings, as the camera zips through parked cars, swimming pools and past whirling dancers like a caffeine-addled hummingbird. And that opening four minute long take crane shot? Has to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>But, for all these highs of spectacle come the crashing lows of the story gluing them together. It's immediately, unshakably apparent that Chazelle's script is too flamboyantly nostalgic to offer much that hadn't already been done to death in the 'good ol' days' it cherishes, and it's a shame to see a movie directed with such pizazz be so¬Ö well, boring. The title, of course, is a double-pun, nodding not only to singing, but crafting enough of a gushy love letter to the mystique and iconicity of LA to make Woody Allen wince. Here, Chapelle trips over his own earnestness. 'An aspiring actress meets a spurned jazz pianist' verges on ""Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world"" in the groan department, and Chazelle never musters up the gumption to deliver any reflexive reworking of the 'star-crossed lover/artists' formula whatsoever. Even the film's fake-out 'happy-ever-after-but-at-what-cost' ending, a melancholic, 'what might have been' fantasy dance break, is cheerfully poached from An American in Paris among countless others, making the film's one seeming deviance from clich√©¬Ö just as ensconced in clich√©. <br/><br/>{Maybe the 'La La' is really Chazelle retorting ""La La La, I can't hear you¬Ö?""}<br/><br/>That said, Chazelle's original tunes are more than worth their salt, a handful of charming, bittersweet ear-worms sure to light up iTunes for months. Occasionally, sly humour pokes through the polish - there's a great laugh to be had when Gosling's Serious Musician joining John Legend's pop-jazz-fusion band (meant to signify his artistic bankruptcy in favour of pop commercialism) produces the film's most infectiously memorable song. Still, post-Whiplash, Chazelle's one true love is still jazz, and the film's jazz club scenes come alive with more kinetic ferocity than any of its schmaltzy dance breaks. The 'non-professional singer musical' trope is ultimately a matter of personal preference (Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You takes this poetic accessibility to the next level) but it's effective here, thematically underscoring the dissonance of these two 'good but not amazing' dreamers slotting themselves into the iconicity of legend. It's a shame that they're further marred by consistently murky, almost distressingly amateurish sound editing, garbling the audibility of most of the song's lyrics almost past the point of comprehension. 'Naturalism' is one thing, but it's still hard to fall in love with songs we can barely hear. <br/><br/>Still, it takes appropriately glitzy stars to own up to such a superficially pleasurable film, and it's impossible to imagine a more lovable duo than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Endearingly clumsy singing aside, their respective astronomical charisma easily outperform their less-than-stimulating material. Underpinning her 'adorably neurotic klutz' schtick with a smattering of raw pathos, Stone's gigantic, alien bug- eyes prove capable of expounding almost alarming deluges of emotion. Hearing her show-stopping Audition ballad is so phenomenally moving that it's almost hard to focus on her amidst brushing tears away. Similarly, Gosling proves he's able to look as winningly suave sporting a keytar and red leather jacket as ever, and he's breezy, smooth and funny enough to breathe life into his stale 'frustrated artist.' Nonetheless: restricting the superb J.K. Simmons to a fleeting cameo? Borderline criminal offence. <br/><br/>It's curious to see a movie so obsessed with history and nostalgia playing its spate of clich√© so unironically, but La La Land is such a pleasantly dopey ode to the love of creation, it's evidently easy for many to overlook. Chazelle's film is likely best enjoyed outside the spotlight of the awards hype machine, where it's easier to embrace its superfluous camp and profoundly heartfelt sweetness at face value. Still, for a world so riddled with conflict and strife, there's an unmistakable value for a film so silly - episodically on YouTube, if nothing else. Here's to the ones who dream. <br/><br/>-7/10"
"showmethemoviescontact","7","2","3","28 January 2017"," La La Land ShowMeTheMovies Review
","Critically acclaimed and currently totaling 14 Oscar Nominations, 11 BAFTA Nominations, and 7 Golden Globe wins, musical La La Land is not as incredible as you would expect. Myself and guest writer Natasha tell you why...<br/><br/>Plot Summary La La Land's centres on Seb (Ryan Gosling), an overqualified restaurant pianist with a penchant for Jazz, and Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress lacking in successful auditions. Upon meeting, Mia and Seb push each other to make their struggling dreams a reality, and the movie follows how their relationship moulds as they attempt to reach their goals.<br/><br/>He Said... Damien Chazelle, director of La La Land, clearly knew with this project that he was on to a winner; but why did he have to make such a song and a dance about it?! With its' dazzling aesthetic and charm, it is difficult to imagine La La Land going home empty-handed at this years' Academy Awards, particularly for costume design and cinematography. Emma Stone clearly the star of the show, I felt Ryan Gosling's performance was not particularly special, nor any of the rest of the cast bar Stone. For its' praised musical elements, certain shots (and songs) were overused at times - every other song, it appeared, would open with dimmed lights and a spotlight on the performer (*eye roll*). Perhaps due to the overwhelming acclaim it has already received, my expectations were set high - and La La Land was not the solid 10/10 I had hoped it to be. The plot itself wasn't overly ambitious, and through all its glitz and retro glamour had an aura of arrogance despite being far from perfect.<br/><br/>She Said... Did I like La La Land? Of course! Did I love it? Hmm, perhaps not.. With fantastic use of colour and costumer, as well as a hint of Baz-Luhrmann-esque beauty in its' shots and cuts, the storyline and catchy songs kept my intrigue until the end. But whilst I understand some of the hype, I can't help but feel it could have been a little less pretentious. This self-indulgent piece of cinema portrayed a bland Ryan Gosling, some fairly odd pacing (or total lack there-of), and an unusual, disappointing lack of chemistry between Gosling and Stone. Emma Stone was breath-taking as ever - endearing, gawky and not afraid to laugh at herself - but I felt paired with far too 'Hollywood' a role. The films' music (think 20's speakeasy & Parisian jazz cafe contrasted with blatant cheese), whilst catchy, was paired with some fairly mediocre singing and dancing. The whole thing just seemed a bit unnecessary, and its' overzealous approach to the arts just reminded me of the movie Midnight in Paris (FYI, not a favourite of mine). My final words? Over-hyped but a fun ride."

If you re not a demanding guy, if you re a patient viewer with a cigar relaxing at his sofa yes you might be thrilled. Despite that, i Think that Ryan's and Emma's good performance was wasted because it had such a good dramatic/ romantic story that led to motivation and a pure inspiring movie relation to music. I agree it had to be with music and acting but without so many musical songs every couple of minutes. I think the direction was quite poor and the lighting wasn't that great. Its one of those movies i guess that half of the crowd won't ever see again and the other half will re-watch."

"owamibuy","5","1","1","12 May 2019"," Disappointing ""meal""
","Watching La La Land is like going to a restaurant that everyone raves about. We had high expectations. The meal starts with rainbow shaved ice. The food takes a while to come, but once it does is good. And just when you like it and are ready for dessert, they bring out a bowl of hot and sour soup to finish off. The movie took about 20 minutes to get into, started to have good chemistry and like-ability, stalled with some twists, and just when you're ready for the payoff, ripped the carpet out at the end. A story of love and hope that turns into My Best Friend's Wedding."

Emma Stone's voice is meets expections. Unfortunately her body shape did not adequate for dancing perfectly. At least they have not terrible.

I've read some people find La La Land awful, because they can not stand Hollywood / LA.
Since my heart is in California, it totally appeals to me and gives me pleasure.<br/><br/>The story is about passion, dream chasing and fulfilling, dreams vs. reality, love and the true aspect of the showbiz in Hollywood.<br/><br/>La La Land is an Homage to the old Hollywood and a great lovestory about LA.
Director Damien Chazelle had put many years of work and love into this movie.<br/><br/>Only the end I can not understand and I think it's a shame. I would've like a slightly different ending. Why do you can't have both?
A dream job and a fulfilling relationship. It doesn't have to be a shallow happy end but what about some more positive vibes?<br/><br/>Anyway... La La Land is a heck of a film that deserves a watch.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing by the way."

","I only got half way through this film so I can't give an overall opinion, however what I saw was very dull. I never turn off halfway through! I wasn't overly fussed about watching in the first place but due to the hype and reviews I decided to give it a go. The songs were not catchy at all, you can barely understand the lyrics. The beginning was also very drawn out and had a very bland storyline, so much so I could not put myself through it anymore and didn't care about how it ended. How this gets more than the greatest showman is beyond me!"

Both leading role actors are so good that you can not help yourself to keep your tears at the same time of the scenes that they cyr, at least that happened to me. As of a horror movie fan, I watched it with tears honestly speaking, I dont know what will happen to no other kind of movie fans. You should definitely watch it, do not hesitate!"

Stone and Gosling's characters develop a true love, one bound by music and appreciation for eachother's artistry, but like real relationships, small cracks start to appear when the characters choose one over the other.<br/><br/>Suddenly, their dreams seem too far apart. <br/><br/>This movie does a great job of romanticising the concept of finding a true love, only to have it crashing down. The final moments of the movie are the most powerful I've seen in a completely different way than the Titanic. Never has a romance movie shown the feeling of regret so captivatingly.<br/><br/>The cinematography and location is also beautiful, the one shot take of the jazz band and the dancing scenes are gorgeous and the movie leaves you feeling nostalgic."

","Being a working class, hairy bottomed, meat eating and somewhat a stereotypical male Neanderthal I was blown away by this film. I was encouraged (forced) to watch by my daughter and from the get go was fascinated by the use of colour and although this film is contemporary it has the feel of the great musicals of yesteryear. I loved the use of cars from several decades mixed with clothing and film studio backgrounds/scenery to give the impression that the film is set in one of several decades. The acting is superb and dispite my cynicism the music is well crafted and again crosses the decades in composition and feel. Can't say anything negative about this film and for all those like myself who would rather nail a leg to a church pew on Easter Sunday than watch a chick flick/Musical! Just watch it and between the soundtrack, visuals and Emma Stone's hypnotic beauty you'll be sold, you may not want to admit it but you'll be humming 'that' tune for weeks? The best thing I've seen in years with a superb ending. I'm off to take a flower arranging course as I am now in touch with my Feminine side."
"mrnunleygo","9","1","1","2 June 2018"," What it feels like
","La La Land is a special movie, and Damien Chazelle is to be congratulated for creating it. Each musical number is in some way an homage to a different previous type of Hollywood musical style. More significant, though, is the way this love story captures the progression of sensations experienced when you are simultaneously concerned about ambition/achievement and about love. The one criticism I've heard of the movie is that it's ""not realistic."" Really? Not realistic to have hundreds of people dancing and singing during a freeway stoppage? Who knew? The movie isn't trying to achieve realism; its artifices are transparent.. The point is to represent and, maybe more importantly, evoke in the audience the emotional moments that can occur during the trajectories of two sometimes intertwined, sometimes contradictory life goals: the desire for achievement and the desire for love."

This was not the best movie I've ever seen but I like to see a movie like this once in a while that takes us back to an earlier time. Sentimental, yes. But I like how the movie lifted the viewer into this fantasy where the shallow world of Hollywood meets the simple, sweetness of two people in love. The music and dance added to the overall sense of fun and helped portray the ups and downs of a blossoming relationship. Wait for the right mood... be open and ready for a sweet story and you'll like La La Land."

There's far too many unnecessary musical numbers, the romance between Sebastian and Mia takes WAY too long to get off the ground, the music is literally like mia says- elevator music. The only good song in the whole movie is 'audition'. Then, the last half hour of the film happens that COMPLETELY invalidated the first 3/4. I can't even write about it without getting angry.

I love the music very much, though I don't know the name of the composer. I myself love to play the piano like the male protagonist Sebastian.

","I simply cannot understand why this film rated so highly. The best part was Emma Stone's acting but other than that there is virtually nothing worth praising. If this was an attempt to revive the classic film musicals of the forties and fifties it fails utterly in my opinion. The main problem is that Emma Stone can't sing and Ryan Gosling can't act.
 Another problem is that in many of the other musical numbers including the opening one in the LA traffic jam you can't hear the lyrics. As an actor Ryan Gosling reminds me of sixties actor David Jansen who played Richard Kimble in the Fugitive TV series - he has one or at the most two facial expressions. Overall the story is fairly boring too. I'm writing this review about two weeks after seeing the movie and I have no desire to see it again.<br/><br/>I'm probably being generous in rating this 4/10."

","After the fuss about this I was expecting a well-paced, heart-warming, mesmerising film, but frankly I was bored rigid, as were the rest of the family. The dances are passable for your average amateur production (and I've seen amateur productions with much better) but a homage to Astaire and Rogers (or even a second rate 50s musical) they're not. A bit of hopping about and swinging her round and that's your lot. The music is pleasant enough but instantly forgettable.
Plot? Well, you follow two pleasant enough but essentially bland characters for a while. She swears she will always love him then finds someone else without a backward glance. He gets to play his jazz. That's about it. But because it drifts through with all the dynamism of a spaced-out sloth it takes AGES!"

Someone, somewhere along the line, needed to tell them that Emma Stone's and Ryan Gosling's voices aren't up the leads in a musical. The only decent song that I can even vaguely remember included Gosling whistling, I watched the movie 18 hours ago and that's the best I've got.<br/><br/>The acting isn't up to scratch from the two leads, and if either of them win an Oscar it will be a travesty.<br/><br/>How this film could win over Lion, Hidden Figures, or Hacksaw Ridge is beyond me.

Calling a film overrated is something that will strike up an argument on any message board but while I don't think the film was that great, there's no question that it's an extremely charming film with two great performances.<br/><br/>I will start off with what I didn't love about the film. One was the opening dance number, which was impressive in regards to how it was shot but at the same time I must admit that it really didn't pull me into the film. I'd also say that I didn't love any of the songs in the picture. A couple were nice but I really didn't walk out of the theater singing any of them. Finally, I did feel that the film went on a bit too long and would have benefited from about ten-minutes being cut out.<br/><br/>With all of that out of the way, there was still a lot of stuff here that I really enjoyed but there's no question that the greatest thing were the two leads. Gosling and Stone were so great and so wonderfully charming together that you couldn't help but fall in love with their characters and want to see them succeed. I really thought both of them did a terrific job in their acting, their dancing and their singing and you can honestly say that they were among the most entertaining couples from recent memory. They really get to shine with the comedy, the romance and the drama and they really pack a great punch.<br/><br/>I also really loved the Jazz music in the picture. The music is certainly something wonderful and it just perfectly builds up the story and delivers the goods. The film also benefits from some wonderful costume and production design with brilliant uses of colors that just leap off the screen. As I said, the film is a homage to Hollywood and there's some great dialogue about older movies, older stars and of course Jazz musicians.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why people and especially Hollywood are in love with LA LA LAND. It's a great throwback to the type of romantic comedies and musicals that were made in a different era. I'm sure many young people were seeing this type of film for the first time. Hopefully some of those who loved this will go out and seek out the classics that this is paying homage to."
"LaLaLandisaMasterpiece","10","8","22","2 January 2017"," It is a Masterpiece
","This is the best movie of the year for me. It hit me on every level, on every emotion. I connect every single way with this movie. It's so real, hurtful, but has empowered me to never quit. Cynicism must die, I hate it when people throw away their passion. I've been cynical many times in my life and at the same time confused, but now it's all clear to me. There's no turning back, I choose my destiny and I have to believe in myself. No matter how much pain and suffering I go through, I know there will always be hope. I know it will truly be worth it in the end. Even if I meet my end before I ever reach my goal, I know that I tried my best. This movie is so endearing to me, it might be the best movie of all time for me. Damien Chazelle has made a masterpiece with so much craft and passion into it. He is truly one of the best directors and writers of this generation. <br/><br/>Lets get into the technical stuff: The cinematography, gorgeously shot, lit, and impressive long takes. Coordination of the choreography was on point. I know a lot of people complain that the dancing and song numbers may be mediocre, but lets get this straight. None of those people are professional dancers, they are portrayed as normal people in LA. So, there's no reason for them to be dancing Gene Kelly level or singing Gene Kelly level. Now, I may not be too much of a fan of the soundtrack, but it works for the movie VERY WELL. It's the scenes you are seeing that connection you with emotional punch and that's what I liked about the silent and long moments in this film. It is nerve breaking and powerful. The sound editing and mixing was also very good. I can see it winning tons of technical Oscars. My favorite is the editing. Tom Cross has done it again. It's edited in such a brilliant and interesting way, I could never lay my eyes off the film. I thought it was perfectly paced in every single way. It should definitely win for best editing.<br/><br/>Story and Characters: A simple, but also though provoking plot about two aspiring artists chasing their goals that are dreams to them. When I mean dreams, this is where it gets to spoiler territory. There are a lot of fantasy and dream sequences that likely never happened through dance and song. It's what I found so brilliant. It's not typically a generic musical, but a brilliant one that makes sense why there would be dance and musical numbers. As I said before, this is a damn tragedy and damn it is. They end up being cynical, but recovered. It's just that once they find out what could've been, it's damn heartbreaking. It's why people should never be cynical. What this movie teaches is never be negative. Even if you are hurt, you have to keep moving and never change your path. Mia is a sensitive, passionate, and heart wrenching soul who just wanted to make it as an actress. She did, but it wasn't the way as she wanted. Sebastian is a passionate pianist who wants to revive Jazz and keep it alive. He wants his own club and he does get it, but ends being heartbroken. Two souls that could've been something greater if they didn't have that dinner argument in the first place. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling should both receive Oscar nominations, they played their characters perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, La La Land is a masterpiece, 10/10."

","La La Land is undoubtedly a brilliant film; I have not seen many musicals, and, admittedly, I bore a fairly...stereotypical, sceptical view of such-that is, until I watched this baby-I used to think that the musical was all about, you guessed it, the music. But, now...I think there's more to it than that-I liked the music; it was original, and it was definitely good, but it wasn't outstanding. It was special with the plot, which was also brilliant. The plot was that of two people-an aspiring, jazzy pianist and an aspiring actress-who, after a multitude of chance encounters, share a relationship-one that is almost as if they are exploiting each other to attempt to realise their ambitions by feeding off emotion, and who soon realise that, to realise their gluttonous ambitions, they may not be able to love each other as well."

","I guess I should say I didn't like ""Whiplash"" at all. Or, to be more precise, it was a pretty interesting watch for anyone who's into music in general and jazz in particular. But, on the whole, in my view - a really thin piece of cinema. But this one ¬Ö <br/><br/>Didn't expect it from Chazelle, but it's ¬Ö simply ¬Ö beautiful. Not only is it a virtually perfect movie, which carries you along all the way through while surprising at every turn to totally carry away at the end, it's the most beautiful, moving and genuine work I've seen in some really ""serious"" while. And, as far as I'm concerned, somewhat misunderstood on the both sides of the barricade. That is it has little to do with writing a love letter to Hollywood ‚Äì for which Hollywood seems to like it so much and so many other people seem to just as seriously hate it (or to modern Hollywood, at any rate ‚Äì while old Hollywood here should rather be read as a metaphor) . Nor is it supplemented with a forced or 'artsy' finale ‚Äì another reason for this hate ‚Äì because it's not just a romantic story. As far as I can see this movie is about so many other things as well. It's about chance and fate, personal happiness and personal integrity, following signs and making your own choices, freedom and responsibility. It's about cause and effect, dreams and reality. About whether this reality is ""benignly indifferent"" or can be 'on your side'. About what it ultimately is. And what it takes to find and walk your own path through it.<br/><br/>It's impeccably written, immaculately executed and perfectly structured in dramatic terms. The intonation is flawless, no wrong notes. Always organically dramatic, never melodramatic. Good performances (especially Stone). Don't quite remember the last time I saw such meaningful cuts ‚Äì Eisenstein would be proud. And the last note does last ‚Äì when the show was through I somehow couldn't get away from the theater and roamed for hours in circles in the vicinity. Then got back for no reason and just sat there in the lobby until they had to drive me out at night. So the stuff stays with you ¬Ö to say the least -:).<br/><br/>Anyways, if you haven't yet, go and see it. It's there. It's cinema. Not sure about Fellini's ""aerodromes"" but it looks like some of his random ""planes"" are still in the air. Hooah!<br/><br/>And a piece of advice ‚Äì watch the credits up to the very end."
"darcywinchester","9","5","12","27 January 2017"," Singing in the Rain with a bold modern twist
","In this Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, 10 Cloverfield Lane) written and directed film, Ryan Gosling (Drive, The Big Short) stars as Sebastian, the jazz musician who falls in love with Mia (Emma Stone: The Help, Easy A) who is a struggling actress. They live in a world where she has to serve lattes to actresses she wishes she can be and auditions where most of the time she is lucky if they are even listening to her and he tries to keep the purity of jazz alive, but is fighting a losing battle when all his gigs seem to want elevator jazz or Christmas tunes. His efforts to change this results in him losing his jobs, notably by Bill, played be the excellent J. K. Simmons (Spider-man, The Closer), a club manager.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, there is some fantastic music and a soundtrack is available which has been nominated for a best original score Oscar that features Stone, Gosling, John Legend (who had to learn to play guitar for the role) and Justin Hurwitz. The film has already won 7 Golden Globes.<br/><br/>For me, Emma Stone steals the movie and deserves all the accolades coming her way. The chemistry between Stone and Gosling works well and apparently their night-time sequence, atop the canyon with the view of Los Angeles, was shot in one take during the magic hour, the playful musical number reminiscent of Singing in the Rain yet giving it a bold modern twist.<br/><br/>From the first scene with the most happy traffic jam in the world, you are whisked away into the lives of Mia and Sebastian. Vibrant colours and uplifting songs paired with the harsh realities of a life scraping by in the pursuit of your dream, the dance routines and duality of the actors pull you in and keep you firmly enmeshed in a bygone time that is strangely anchored in the here and now.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes was the one in the observatory as to me falling in love is perfectly visualised here and the alternate endings sequence is genius, showing us that things can end very differently depending upon our choices, even whilst echoing the old Tinseltown way of ending movies like this.<br/><br/>The film evokes a more carefree era and is truly a masterful colourful and happy film which deals with the most important thing in life, love. Not the candy-box version either, the complicated, life gets in the way truth of it, yet it recognises that in each other we can find the things that really matter to us. In this post-Brexit/Trump world, this is just what we need, to concentrate on the simple value of love. To stop thinking of our differences and of real or imagined slights, but to help one another to find the joy in this world and dare to try to achieve our dreams.<br/><br/>This film may be in the marmite category, but I like marmite and the quirkiness of this movie gives it a bite that may not be to everyone's taste, but it won't be something you forget."
"stellarhode","3","5","12","26 January 2017"," Good film that was completely clouded by prejudice
","This film was really enjoyable in many aspects and took a great opportunity to revive an older and forgotten genre, but in the process of modernising completely neglected to remove any racist overtones of the past. To create a film centred around a white man 'saving' jazz, a genre so deeply rooted in African American culture, seems so blindly ignorant that I am shocked it was created in 2016. While the spotlight focuses in on the white leads, they are surrounded by black people that are being turned into furniture in the background of their own culture. While John Legend performed well in a large role, he was cast as the one ruining jazz, by turning it into pop music, while Ryan Gosling is the hero that must maintain the rich traditions. That is not to mention the fact that Emma Stone's 'talent' in the film pales into insignificance, a mere afterthought, while the entire story line is centred around Gosling's own interests. <br/><br/>The film was engaging and managed to strike the difficult balance between drama and music well, but it missed a wonderful opportunity to *genuinely* modernise a lost genre. Instead, I was so distracted by the gross ignorance involved that I could not really enjoy it."

Jazz would barge into your playlists and hearts with ease!<br/><br/>Like the bits and pieces that we carry from movies like 'Titanic', 'Casablanca', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'The 'Pulp Fiction', 'Dark Knight Rises', or take any other all-time classics for an instance, there are a whole lot of elements in 'La La Land' too that would win an eternal life in your memories.<br/><br/>It's a magical blend of the following concepts ‚Äì success that comes with a price, the beauty and liberty in Jazz that the musicians are trying to rescue from extinction, love that's governed by the universal laws, drama that isn't so dramatic but sweet and unbelievably beautiful with insanely vivid shots, the art of dreaming and the life through a musical kaleidoscope, and so many! It's pure magic. Mia and Sebastian will make you stoned with their dreams, music and love. You might cry like a baby at the end of it ‚Äì not because of the story, but for the perfect blend of something that the world of cinemas has long forgotten.<br/><br/>Two parallel, but very different streams of realizing the dreams that starts at a common point, but having no confluence and only a hard-hitting end, which is hard to digest!<br/><br/>About the two streams: One reminds us of a line from the book The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho, ""The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one more stone ‚Äì just one more ‚Äì he would find his emerald.""<br/><br/>And the second is a story of success through sacrifice that's part and parcel of certain decisions; they are the game-changers, but you can't actually judge if it's good and bad.

"cultfilmfan","10","5","12","15 January 2017"," La La Land
","Recently filmmaker Ridley Scott admitted that he found the current state of cinema to be declining and even himself admitted to being asked numerous times to be a director, or somehow involved in any number of superhero related movies. Thankfully to this day he has not done so and while some of his choices as a director, or producer tend to be a little perplexing and leaving the viewer wondering why he did said project, I think he may be on to something with the general statement that cinema does seem to be declining in quality and what would have played on the big screen even 30 to 40 years ago, is not the same today and that same level of expertise, artistry and quality just doesn't seem to be there a lot of the time. Jean-Luc Godard once famously said that cinema began with D.W. Griffith and ends with Abbas Kiarostami. With the unfortunate passing of Kiarostami this past year, does that mean cinema is definitely gone for good? In some ways yes, but then again on the other hand you have a film like La La Land which is very much in the same kind of style and spirit of the movies of yesterday while being completely original on it's own, so maybe in a sense there is still hope for today's cinema yet. Within the first ten to fifteen minutes of La La Land, I really was not anticipating that I would end up liking the film as much as I did. The film started out with bubbly and very much pop flavoured dance and musical numbers that seemed so happy and bright that I felt that if the whole movie was this upbeat and sunny than I probably should have seen something else at the theatre instead because what I was witnessing was so sickeningly sweet that it would even turn most kids who grow up on that stuff off of it. Thankfully however the trailers I had seen for the film as well as everything else I knew about it proved to be true and that wasn't the kind of film this was going to be. Instead we do have a film that in it's own way is trying to recapture the magic and charm of the movies that generations ago people grew up on and films and music that we should be watching today instead of the countless hours we throw away on mindless entertainment and games with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The film loves old Hollywood from the movies to the actors to the big budget musicals of yesteryear. It also pays homage to music such as the jazz classics that I know any die hard jazz fan would go head over feet over. In a sense those also attuned to movies with a more European feel (think the French New Wave of the 50's and 60's) will also most likely find a lot to like here as well because this film is not simply just plagiarizing these movies and cultural icons of old, but instead borrows from their styles and techniques and as I said earlier, they make a movie all their own using those trademark pieces of style and music and they do so in a way that is pulled off to perfection and will leave even the hardest of film critics longing for movies from decades ago pretty pleased at what still proves to be talent and good work with movies and filmmakers in this current generation. The film is more than anything else a love story between two people who often at first seem completely at odds with each other, but with any good romance, sometimes the opposites do attract and can lead to magic. The film also incorporates old Hollywood and the fact that many classic films and even styles of music are dying because today's generation is different. People are now so into themselves, or their electronic devices that they no longer have the interest, or curiosity about the true arts anymore. I once had a film professor acquaintance who told me that in his university film class that the students he had did not want to see older movies, but things that were current, or modern at least to them. How incredibly sad. La La Land reaches out to those lost arts and shows us that these forms of art definitely need to stay alive and need to be rediscovered by each and every generation. The film also details the struggles of trying to make it in the arts scene and with all the rejections and disappointments you get, sometimes it definitely is hard to keep your chin up. However these characters have perseverance and will give it everything they got and ultimately prove that dreams can happen and sometimes with a little help you get not just get what you want, but maybe something better is lying just around the corner for you. La La Land has a lot of style, the musical numbers are all very well done and it's a film with some great character development and it truly will be relatable to this generation, but countless others as well. This is a film of originality that proves that Hollywood is not dead yet, nor is film and we might just have a few surprises left from some up and coming filmmakers, so with films like La La Land, Hollywood and film is still alive and thriving for now at least which I think is a great place to be."
"Eshan_2110","10","5","12","13 January 2017"," Damien Chazelle does it again.
","Firstly, I've got to start off by saying I am not a fan of musicals or romantic films, in fact I've never completed a single one. With that said, this film was just a delight to watch, a treat from start to finish.<br/><br/>You're probably wondering why I went to see this film after declaring myself to not be a fan of musicals and romantic films. That would be down to the fact that this film was directed by Damien Chazelle, the mastermind behind Whiplash (2014). He demonstrated his ability to create meaning through sound and cinematography in that film. Chazelle asserts his talents in La La Land, creating vibrant images that hold your attention. <br/><br/>The second reason is simple, the wonderful trailers. I tried to not look into this film too much or reading about it online. The teaser trailer gave me enough insight as to what to expect, but boy was I in for a treat. <br/><br/>The narrative is simple, Sebastian and Mia meet, perhaps through unconventional means at first, and fall in love. There are many layers to this story however and it most definitely has a lot of heart. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have wonderful chemistry and both are extremely quirky and personable. The film has heart, through comedic moments (that work), gorgeous and lavish set designs and the beautiful soundtrack. The numbers work and part of me now wishes people would just break out and dance on the motorways, much like the film portrays. I enjoyed how the film presented the struggles of relationships and handled them in what I would argue is a realistic manner. The camera work is extremely efficient in providing information about characters. For instance, a simple wide shot of an isolated character walking down the street in the film told me a lot of what the director wanted to show.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in recent times, if not the best. It really demonstrates the wide array of films out there, even in genres you may not expect. I can't wait to see Damien Chazelle's project, First Man. La La Land was a truly unique experience, one that I do not regret going to watch."

","""La La Land"" is a fun, sweet movie about two young artists, their attempt to establish their careers, and their love affair. It's enjoyable but not the masterpiece reviews insist it is. <br/><br/>Mia (Emma Stone) is a barrista and an aspiring actress. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist. They meet during a traffic jam, get together at a party, and go through the ups and downs of young people who are in love and who are also chasing artistic success. <br/><br/>""La La Land"" is a musical. People sing and dance. That's fun. Neither Stone nor Gosling is a professional singer or dancer, so the singing and dancing are mediocre. <br/><br/>Mia and Sebastian go for a walk at night. Their walk is cinematically reminiscent of a walk that Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse take in the 1953 movie musical, ""Band Wagon"" ‚Äì to the tune of ""Dancing in the Dark."" <br/><br/>Just like Fred and Cyd, Mia and Seb begin their nighttime walk as bickering enemies, but during the dance they warm up to each other. They dance under trees and streetlights. The difference is that Gosling and Stone can't begin to match the magic that professional dancers like Astaire and Charisse conjure in their dance number. Gosling's voice is barely there. <br/><br/>In another scene, Stone sings what might have been a show-stopping number, a song about her free-spirited aunt who lived in Paris and went swimming in the River Seine. During this song, Stone wears a non- descript, baggy sweater and she barely moves. Stone is very compelling as an actress. As a singer, especially during this number, she falls flat. <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle's direction doesn't highlight the dance numbers as it might. The opening scene depicts an LA traffic jam. Passengers emerge from their cars and dance on the highway. They sing a lyric-dense song; you can't hear them over the music in order to make out the words. It's frustrating. Their movements are not flattered by Chazelle's camera. <br/><br/>Even so, I very much enjoyed ""La La Land."" Its strengths would have been evident whether anyone had been singing or not. ""La La Land"" brings home how hard it is for struggling artists to nurture healthy relationships. Mia and Sebastian live in poverty. At one point he looks at a water stain on the ceiling and despairs. They are crushed when their best efforts meet with failure. They are tempted to sell out. Their careers demand that they not be present for each other for months at a time. Mia and Sebastian let each other down. <br/><br/>""La La Land"" drags after a bit. Stone and Gosling are virtually the only characters in the film. Their key interactions are repeated. ""La La Land"" redeemed itself, for me, in a final, fantasy sequence that was incredibly poignant and true and that was unlike anything else I'd ever seen in any other film. I'd recommend seeing ""La La Land"" for that sequence alone."

","*Spoilers* Many people despise La La Land for copying iconic themes/scenes from famous musicals throughout the years, but putting those speculations aside, the film successfully displays human nature in a way most movies have not, which could be one reason why people felt outraged or disappointed. Many of these following comments came from friends and family who debated about the film. The fact that Ryan and Emma weren't the best, professional singers actually added to the realistic theme as it made the characters that much more easy to relate to. If they were the best singers, their struggle for their dreams would seem not as difficult. One of the greatest lines in the movie that really resonated in my mind was Sebastian exclaiming, ""They worship everything and value nothing"".This single line sums up the entire movie as the value of Jazz is what drives Sebastian and acting is valued so much by Mia. This can also be put into context over our culture. I would be so bold as to say that this is the generation we live in today, a culture that worships everything but has lost the true sense of value. The culture worships famous people, beauty, money, and has lost sight of personal, human value. There is strong truth in the words of Sebastian. The film does a great job in making other movie references, old trends in fashion and music, as well as incorporating places that are popular today that will make this movies nostalgic in the future. The film also did not have any sex scenes, contrary to most films of this generation. It depicted a relationship that came through friendship and showed a relationship of valuing lives instead of using another person (referencing the end when Sebastian encouraged Mia to follow her dreams of acting in Paris). The film inspires people to passionately follow their dreams which is not seen that much in recent films. La La land is a film that respects the dignity of humanity and is very easy to relate to any audience."

","Lala land is one of the most awarded pictures of all times, and it comes to us in a time when the world is in such state with religious, political, economical and social wars that contribute to the world crisis. <br/><br/>The movie is based on a young girl that wants to make it in the movie business. Life in Hollywood with the constant chase for a major roll and to have a life changing experience and become famous. All she needs is one chance to change her destiny. <br/><br/>As we watch the movie with all the colours and music we can appreciate what life is through jazz. Its music takes us to another level where we try to fight for our survival, to have our 5 seconds of solo (fame) and then to mingle with the other instruments that complement our purpouse in existence. Life is about being in the world with all the kind of people that makes us hear they way we sound. <br/><br/>The parallelism in both lives, the struggle, the dreams, the project and the talent shows us that anyone can do it. But if we aren't willing to share the dream and make sacrifices, then we may travel different. That is what happens to the main characters, they fell in love, but didn't share any of their passions to make it work. That's why we see two versions of their love life, what you are willing to give to be successful. <br/><br/>The taste of freedom in this movie shows us the things we choose in the present affects the things to come in the future. The happy ending is all about us here and now. https://pensarparaserfeliz.wordpress.com/2017/03/06/lala-land-and- freedom/"

","Ever since watching the trailer, I was excited to see this movie. However, it let me down. There is no doubt that Emma Stone had great acting (especially in the audition scenes). But the story got boring at times. As I was sitting there I noticed that the opening dance scene could have been much better and overall the dancing was mediocre. I absolutely loved the set and costume designs. Personally, I don't think this movie is that amazing. But I have to admit the songs were emotional and catchy."

","La La Land is an incredibly well made movie. It is a nod to old Hollywood musicals but also a rejection of their traditional and oftentimes predictable story lines. To those who've had the pleasure of seeing a Broadway musical, this movie rings a familiar bell. The soundtrack is utterly fantastic, and is really worth a buy. This film left me feeling feeling happy, sad, reminiscent, unsatisfied as a person wrapped up in the story, but very satisfied as a movie-goer."
"BoxOfficeKid","10","4","9","26 February 2017"," A movie for the sake of telling a story, and not trying to grab the award-season by the p%¬§#y!
","An original musical about two people falling in love, while in pursuing their dreams in Hollywood... <br/><br/>The movie sounds pretty generic on paper, but then again, La La Land manages to evoke magic on-screen not possible to write on a piece of paper. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable. A great contemporary epic through only the daily life, scenery and songs. The feeling of listening to a great classical score for the first time... Damien Chazelle has somehow made two back-to-back utterly unique movies, coincidentally revolving around jazz. While Whiplash was an intense psychological thriller-like drama, La La Land is genuinely a funny and heartwarming romantic musical.<br/><br/>This movie breaks the mold in the Best Picture category this year: You will not find the typical Oscar baits, such as; cathartic moments in the story-line, melodramatic tragedies, powerhouse acting vehicle, period pieces, biopics or controversial themes. Yet, the movie is pretty overwhelming in only its pacing, comedic timing and music. It really balances well between comedic and serious moments, never taking the easy route to drama-land! Its La La Land, remember? It's about joy, hope, dreams and love!<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","This 2016 Academy Award nominated musical (a record-tying 14 nominations), written and directed by Damien Chazelle (the wunderkind creator of the astonishing Whiplash, see my December 8, 2014 review on my unhealedwound blog ) is this year's can-do-no-wrong rom-com starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.<br/><br/>La La Land is a bold resurrection of the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers 1940-50s musical with a blend of nostalgia (using filtered-lens cinematography and costumes) mixed with the novelty of contemporary millennial life in Los Angeles. A flip-book of competing images of vintage and modern LA with twirling skirts and old-fashioned dancing, La La Land is all about dreaming for the big break in Hollywood.<br/><br/>An undeniable paean to the joy and ecstasy of following your passions, La La Land also touches upon the sacrifices to one's personal life, to missed human connections and to other dreams that will never come true.

"ironhorse_iv","8","4","9","8 February 2017"," La La Land hit the right notes for the most part. Still, I felt a little disjointed, while watching it. It's a good film, but not a perfect film.
","Similar to the way, I felt about 2011's Oscar Best Picture 'The Artist', for its love letter portrayal of old Hollywood black and white silent film styles. 'La La Land' is the same with its homage to the 1950's Golden Age of Hollywood Musicals. Vibrant colors and exquisite cinematography makes this film, perfect eye candy. The opening song and dance sequence to the song 'Another Day in the Sun' sets the tone of the routine of joyful dreams of succeeding in Los Angeles, while stuck in gridlock on the freeway, going nowhere fast, without establishing, any of the characters. Others songs like 'Someone in the Crowd', 'The Fools Who Dream', 'A Lovely Night' and 'City of Stars' by Justin Hurwitz, were beautiful and the dancing was impressive throughout it. Even music without lyrics like 'Mia and Sebastian theme' & 'Planetarium' stood out. However, the music, they chose, didn't have, much of a Jazz feel to it for a film trying to save original jazz. While, these songs makes the movie seem entertaining to new viewers, the dancing and the story felt too old & familiar for me. The story about two struggling artists, one being actress, Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) & the other, being an old school Jazz musician, Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) felt a little too generic. After all, I saw similar musicals films like this, before in 1951's 'An American in Paris', 1952's 'Singing in the Rain', 1953's 'The Band Wagon', & 1954's 'A Star is Born'. This film even remind me of non 1950's musical films like 1964's 'Paris, when it sizzles' & 1975's 'the Day of the Locusts' in its style. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have some unique things that set it, apart from those films, like, placing it in a weird 1950's fuel, nostalgic present time and using digital effects to make a great musical numbers, however the story of Sebastian and Mia trying to make it in Hollywood, fell a little short in me. Maybe, because, I thought the movie play it, really too safe. It didn't really have, much of an interesting real-life story conflict, compare to the others movies nominated that year for Best Picture. It's pure romanticism escapism for the most part. It doesn't challenge Hollywood in any unconventional terms. No wonder, why Hollywood loves this film. It praise it, without much criticize. I think, that is one of the problems with this film. It's wears its location on its sleeve, with several standard Hollywood house parties, several scenes on movie backlots and discussions on movie history, and a plethora of struggling artists trying to make it, that the other side of Americans or the rest of the world can't really relate to it. After all, the conflict in the film really do, seem a bit 'first world' problems. While, I love that the word 'La La Land' euphemism describing a person out of touch with reality. I wish the movie would had use that, more. I would had love to see the movie dealt more with what Los Angeles life is really like, than what's it's portray in Hollywood. Something similar to the musical ""In the Heights' or 'Rent' did for New York City. After all, modern day Los Angeles population is mostly made out of very normal people of every culture and creed, but rarely any of them is showcase in this film. All of the people feature here, seem a little fake-looking with their rich and beautiful Hollywood lives. Despite that, Stone and Gosling show strength in their performances, even if Gosling character seem out of place as the white guy trying to save Jazz. It probably would have been better, if he was played by a black actor. Despite that Gosling was alright, even if his character was somewhat of a jerk, at times. Though his own character is indeed flawed, Sebastian shows refreshing selflessness towards Mia, putting her dreams and pursuits even above himself and encouraging her all the way. Mia isn't without her positive attributes either. She puts her everything into being a successful, good artist. The audition scene is heart-breaking. Overall: both of the actors made their characters, very likable. Also, their singing was alright, even if they still feel a bit rough around the edges at times. About their chemistry, this is the third time, following 2011's 'Crazy Stupid Love' and 2013's 'Gangster Squad', where Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone work together. Both were able to align with each other, once again, on every level in this film. In the end, 'La La Land' serve as the antithesis to 2014's 'Whiplash', writer and director Damien Chazelle's previous film. This is most notable in the two films' tones - where 'Whiplash' was dark and oppressive with the New York settling, this film is a bright, sparkling, old-fashioned Hollywood musical with just a hint of modern cynicism. There's even a counterpart in the characters of actor, J.K. Simmons, going to a mean guy who's a jazz maniac to a mean guy who doesn't want to hear any jazz. Both films deal with the common theme that many dreamers face: how far should people go in pursuing their own passions, while risking their own connection toward friends, family and relationships? In my opinion, 'Whiplash' shows the dangers, a lot better. Why, because I think the five years/dream sequence ending of this film, kinda the message. It felt like a cop-out. Don't get me wrong, I still think this film is worthy of the accolades, it is sure to receive. However, if I had to choose, which movie of Chazelle told the same story, better. I have to say 'Whiplash'. Still, recommended seeing 'La La Land', regardless. It's a fun movie to watch."
"mikey-242-435767","7","4","9","4 February 2017"," Interesting movie, but slow paced.
","This is a love story with rocks in the road. Worse than bumps, these are boulders! The two leads are interesting and you want them to succeed. I did not realize it was a musical but there is lots of music in this one. Apparently completely performed by the leads.<br/><br/>It is somewhat like Chorus Line (not the movie, the Broadway version). It has a lot of ""heart"". The story is rather standard but also non-standard at the same time. You think you know where it is going but then they make a left turn. Or even a U-turn.<br/><br/>I liked this movie. Be sure to pop the popcorn to give yourself lots to do because at 90 minutes, it feels like about 3 hours. Interesting but intimate. Very much a character study of two performers with different talents and directions who came together for a few years. I don't know where it will end. Still about 30 minutes from the end. And, still, more turns coming.<br/><br/>Would be an 8 if they had trimmed about 40 minutes out of it. Really drags. Thank goodness the characters are likable or next stop would have been the Stop button."

","I really haven't felt like this after a film in a long time. ""La La Land"" was intriguing; it served the movie-goer with great visuals and beautiful music pieces. When it came to music and dancing, the movie had some old ""Singing in the Rain"" charisma, but it still was brought to this century. <br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are always wonderful together and balanced each other well in La La Land as well; their singing and dancing was cute - not perfect - but it suited their story well. The movie was full of lightness, sadness, happiness, and longing that made me personally feel like I was really part of their world. Afterwards, I found myself walking about in the snow while humming the closing melody, as it was just so catching! <br/><br/>La La Land brought romance back into the cinema and it was wonderfully refreshing.

The music and visuals are absolutely breathtaking- don't be surprised if you find yourself keeping each and every song on a never ending repeat during the days following your spectacular movie experience. La La Land is guaranteed to make you feel almost every emotion possible throughout the film, whether it be happiness, nostalgia, contentedness, sadness, or if you're like me, all at the same time!

The film has so much heart that by the time film is over, emotions will be rampant. <br/><br/>As previously mentioned, both the way the movie was shot and the musical aspect worked for the movie instead of working against it like what most other musicals seem to do.

"mikeydewsnap","10","4","9","22 January 2017"," Best film i've seen in the cinema since my first trip to the movies (to watch the Return of the King)
","(please note, I do not think there are any spoilers in this review, however I don't think it is worth the risk of having the review taken down). I had been thinking about joining this site for some time now but never really found time to. This is my first ever review on the sight and I would like to make it known I am an avid film buff. The main reason I joined was because of all the negative reactions to this film - to the point where it's rating dropped from an 8.8 average down to an 8.7 average. This bothered me a lot because this in my opinion is the greatest film to come out so far in the decade and is now one of my favourite films of all time, and I would like my voice to be heard on the matter. So... here it goes...<br/><br/>This movie marks the director's third feature length film after Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009) and, a personal favourite of mine, Whiplash (2014). Chazelle's newest film however is, without a doubt his masterpiece. As noted from when I watched Whiplash for the first time in collage, Chazelle is a master with the use of his camera and is able to make every single shot meaningful and artistically stimulating. This film however takes this skill to a whole new level as his use of long takes to show off his actors skills, is utter perfection. The dance routines in this film are well choreographed and must have taken many rehearsal hours to get on point. This hard work pays off purely through the extended length of each take ‚Äì however there are certainly moments that seem to try and trick you into thinking a sequence is done in one take when in reality they cut as the camera is spinning (reminiscent of 2014's Birdman). The greatest aspect of this film is the closing sequence which reflects on all the events leading up to this point of the story, and it done in a manner that is so movingly artistic, it almost brought a tear to my eye (a feat that is never accomplished with me). Chazelle experiments with many forms of visual storytelling, without the use of voice in this sequence, that for a general audience, who do not pick up on stylistic choice, it may become daunting to some, or boring to others. As in the case of Whiplash the story is incredibly focused on the two leads, with the side plots being left as just that ‚Äì to the side. In this film Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play the lovable pair of Sebastian and Mia who both aspire for greatness in their industries. Sebastian has a passionate flair for jazz music (reflecting on Chazelle's view on the genre as all three movie have been heavily focused on the dying of that industry) and Mia is a talented actress who just cannot seem to land a roll no matter how hard she tries. The film relishes the beauty of these aspirations and has a message for artists everywhere that she should always follow their dreams no matter how hard it may seem or how often you are set back ‚Äì which is again reflected on Chazelle's own experience as a low budget film maker to now accomplishing his dream and now working in the big leagues of the industry. But I digress, the chemistry between these two is so believable through the writing and acting that it no longer feels as though you are watching a film and more as if you are peering into the struggling lives of two very real people and you feel compelled to follow their story to the very end. This film is not just a romance however, it is also a musical, and a musical is nothing without a good soundtrack that relates back to the story or the raw emotions the characters are feeling at the time. This film is the best written Musical I have ever seen. The songs' tone and pace is very reminiscent of that of the musical decade of the 1950's only unlike those movies, this one is heavily grounded in the harshness of reality and forces you to confront the most realistic scenarios that these character would go through in the real world. This film is visually fascinating, musically pleasing, and heart-wrenchingly grounded in reality ‚Äì creating a very dream like state where both everything and nothing feels real. This one I will be buying on Blu Ray and will be re-watching time and time again."

","I never write reviews, but with this film, I feel the need to do it because this movie is excellent in so many levels. It has all you want: love, humor, and soul. If you are an artist with dreams, go see it. La la land is what you need to go and fight for all you want and wish for, it's the fight of dreamers who wants everything, and want to be everything. It's about those moments when you know everything is wrong, but you stand still. This movie is perfection: the acting is amazing (Stone is pretty awesome in every part she is in), songs are just perfect (I really love Someone in the crowd and Another Day of Sun) , cinematography is on point (I am really thankful for the cinema scope). When you see this movie, you feel Chazelle's talent, you can taste the soul that he had put into it.

"barbque","10","4","9","19 January 2017"," Best LA Based Musical Movie Ever!
","So, to start I was really excited to watch this movie. The opening traffic jam scene is probably the best I've seen all year. As a matter of fact, this was the best movie I've seen all year. But I'll get into that a little later.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Damien Chazelle. This is his second feature film. First being ""Whiplash"" (If you haven't seen Whiplash, go watch it right now). Whiplash does have some similarities to ""La La Land"". Some key points being the idea of jazz music, and the story unfolding over the seasons. I really can't wait to see what this director can bring us next. Just with these two masterpiece films, I think that Damien Chazelle is a director to watch in the coming years.<br/><br/>Good<br/><br/>The movie is a great balance of music, comedy, and drama. I found myself waiting for the songs to be slowly introduced, but they always came at a surprise. I really liked how this film's musical aspect was always a surprise. I actually never could tell when a song was coming, and I think this is something that makes this musical stand apart from other musicals.<br/><br/>I knew I was going to like this film just from the intro scene. That is the best depiction of LA life. Being stuck in traffic on the freeway. So smart in relating to everyone here. The intense choreography that was done on the freeway was insane (Also, I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure they shot that on the 405 south exit to the 105 east).<br/><br/>Being someone who grew up in Los Angeles, this film is seriously one of the best LA films I've seen. We get to see some of the best Los Angeles architecture. You also see 'The lighthouse' (which is not a jazz club no more, more of a hip-hop electronic DJ kinda place Hermosa beach, along with the pier. From The streets of downtown to the Griffith Observatory. So much detail can be found in this film. I'm honestly sad that I didn't have a chance to see this movie twice, I feel like there is so much to appreciate from the choreography to the cinematography. When showing LA in different view points like being a coffee barista in a Warner bros. movie back-lot, shows the ambition and aspiration building in these talented artists. I think that this film Choosing LA was carefully planned out and is the base point for the whole film, in other words, with LA they have a very successful metaphorical film.<br/><br/>I like how the film was heavily influenced by old school type musicals and theater but had a modern spin on the drama. For example, they displayed this by showing things like the 'Toyota Prius' reference. Showing that everyone drives a Prius, in the modern times. Or when they are having the 80's pool party in a house in the Hollywood hills. It's a classic LA scenario done in a modern time. Even the tap dancing shows the creativity behind the modern connection.<br/><br/>Bad<br/><br/>OK now for the bad. The one thing that I didn't agree with was the misconception of Hollywood entertainment. I love LA and almost everything about it. I understand that the film and art industries are really hard to become successful in. I can understand how people can be offended about the whole 'waiting in line for your chance' ideology. Although I don't like to see these things portrayed in Hollywood's films, I understand that, honestly, that is what LA is about. I think the realism of becoming an actress or a jazz musician is almost impossible in LA and for this film a little too dreamy."

","I guess the power of advertising remains a marvelous and powerful medium that has but one goal: To make more money. And, in my view, La la land delivers the perfect example of this clever but unfortunate phenomenon. Of course everyone will go to see it, (even I did after all). It will undoubtedly make a bundle for its producers and investors and may quite possibly even win a few awards that increasingly appear to be handed out with the sole intention of increasing a film's profits even further.<br/><br/>How can this possibly happen? Is it really all about money? What did all of these people that saw the film see that I didn't? Admittedly, not much attention should be paid to Mr and Mrs Public who will continue to slavishly follow the opinions of others and are perfectly satisfied to have their minds dulled by average entertainment. But what about the critics (e.g. IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes among others), and especially the ones who are actually paid to deliver a service and whom one hopes and trusts to be just a little objective? Who can be trusted not to mislead the earnest movie lover these days?<br/><br/>I fully appreciate that taste differs, but please please tell me what exactly separates this film from mere, unabashed mediocrity? In considering this just for a moment, one is mindful of some of the musicals of the 50s (Hit the Deck is just one) that did not possess the money machine, camera work, and technological advantages that are readily available today. It bears pointing out that La la land is a mere pale shadow of some of those films of so long ago.<br/><br/>More to the point: In my view La la land is a mediocre effort, not worthy of the actors' talents, nor of that of the Director who, after all, gave us the wonderful Whiplash. I do have to say that Emma Stone does her absolute best against almost impossible odds and gives a great performance, but Ryan Gosling is not only miscast, but displays no visible energy for his co-star. He appears somewhat wooden, stiff and almost disinterested in the movie and this describes his dancing and singing as well. The film's editing furthermore leaves a lot to be desired and creates a disjointed feeling for the viewer. It is almost as if some of the scenes were just thrown together haphazardly in a hurry in a boring and predictable script. <br/><br/>I really could go on and one may wonder why I have spent so much energy in criticizing this film, but I simply cannot believe the accolades that it continues to receive and this upsets me greatly. <br/><br/>Finally, after seeing La la land, I was left feeling dissatisfied and somewhat angry at having sat through it.

","Thoroughly engaging and moving at the same time! I remember being floored by The Artist (2011's Academy Award winning Best Picture) and it's still one of my favorites. On a similar level, La La Land celebrates the transporting power of the movies with music and magic that never feels routine, rather, a heartfelt ode to cinema itself.<br/><br/>It isn't just a musical either. Like The Artist before, this is a very simple film (none of that mind bending stuff) but also brutally honest on the harsh and often destructive nature of show biz; while the media is always ravenous for Hollywood scandals, what we don't often see are the painful choices and sacrifices these artists have had to make. And for that reason La La Land isn't just a device to revive musicals but also a heart wrenching account of what it takes to be successful in show biz. Kudos to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, not just for their Velcro-like chemistry but also for perfecting that colossal irony often expected at the movies ‚Äì a happy ending. That ending segment when we see what could have happened was almost unbearable but it's also the director revealing the quintessential soul of this film ‚Äì and for me, it is in a perpetual state of enchanting melancholy."

Take a city like Los Angeles, that has plenty of history with Hollywood and the impact that it's made on the film industry. Buy a map to the starts and you'll probably be able to find the Chinese Theater, Paramount studios, and the Brown Derby hat. What a lot of those maps don't show is that many elements from Hollywood's heyday are still around like certain theaters, homes, and even murals. You just have to look for them.<br/><br/>Today's film pays plenty of tributes. Old Hollywood is just a part of that.

When's the last time that you remember a musical that was not based off of a Broadway play (not counting animated movies)? It's been a while and to sell one in today's time, it would have to offer something we've haven't seen before. La La Land brings back the original musical. <br/><br/>Mia (played by Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who works as a barista for an on studio coffee shop. The few auditions she's given are either stopped after one line or interrupted by someone who clearly feels more important then her. At the same time, jazz musician Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) is having problems with money and trying to get work that'll allow him to play the improvisational music that he prefers. A gig at a restaurant only allows him to play Christmas music, but he tries his hand at a beautiful melody that doesn't catch the eye of a lot of people. It does so of Mia who happened to discover it by chance.<br/><br/>The two are initially not introduced that evening, but they encounter reach other months later at a party. The two strike up a friendship which ranges from Sebastian taking her to a jazz bar to curve her interest in the genre to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause. This eventually blooms into a romance as the two move in together and continue to chase the Hollywood dreams of making a mark within the world of entertainment. <br/><br/>I'll say right off the back that La La Land is one of the best, most entertaining movies of 2016. I expect this to be a major hit with everyone, even those that don't typically watch musicals. This is a rare musical where I can recall all the songs being great. ""City of Stars"", ""Another Day of Sun"" and ""Start a Fire"" are all candidates for the best song Oscar. Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) clearly loves older music as jazz is given a bigger spotlight here then before. The tunes plays by Ryan Gosling and John Legend (who also plays a part in the story) are just delightful.<br/><br/>La La Land is also one of the best made movies of the year. It takes several cues from Martin Scorsese as many of the scenes, especially the musical sequences, are done with long takes. This made me realize just how too often modern-musicals rely on editing to make the shooting easier. La La Land shows the hard work the actors went through to make each step and tap flawless. When editing is present, it pays homage to movies of the 1950s. How does it do that? I really don't want to give anything away.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten old Hollywood murals out of ten. If 2016 has brought down your spirits, then La La Land will bring them back up. I highly recommend this to everyone! This is a fantastic work of art that justifies much of the hidden history and beauty our world holds to us. Dance your way to a screening of this and sing a long if you wish."

","La La Land is a true masterpiece. From the second the movie started to the very end my foot was tapping. The acting in the movie is spot on. If you like musicals then I think you will love La La Land. It was such a clever movie. The music was brilliant especially City of Stars. This toe tapping masterpiece will be a new classic for years and years to come. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Parents La La Land is rated PG-13 for language, but there was not that much language in it, well there was one f word and two middle fingers but that was it. If your kids love musicals then they will fall in love with La La Land. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were absolutely incredible. Even John Legend for his first time acting he was unbelievable. This whole movie had great acting. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading hope you enjoy La La Land<br/><br/>My score 10/10"

","Going to see this movie the third time. Such an excellent blend of music, colors, emotions and ambition. Worth seeing multiple times and every time i found something new. the attention to detail and careful expressions made me connect to the characters. Tears were filling up yet hope was rising at the same time. Love the rhythm of the plots, where there is a great combination of active and slow songs, leading my feelings to a roller coaster. The colors are absolutely stunning, the outfits and various of sets give an impression of old Hollywood, with a touch of youth and summer. I admire the characters, as they have dreams and passion. Maybe we were all considered as fools once on our way to the dream, to keep being true to ourselves or follow the trends, to gain or to lose, each decision may lead to a direction. more importantly, i can literally see the sparkles between the main characters. Absolutely my favourite of the year!"

","I really wanted to love 'la la land'. And I REALLY REALLY liked it. But I didn't love it. It was a beautiful film, but left a lot to be desired in the writing department. As a screenwriter myself, the clich√© way Sebastian and Mia meet and banter left a lot to be desired. They don't actually get together until what feels like Halfway through the movie. I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who love 'the journey'. I'm not one of them. Even my friend next to me said 'just kiss ALREADY!'. I can't say the rest of my problems with the film without spoiling it so I'll just say the dinner scene made NO SENSE. Thankfully for Damian, the dancing and singing was just enough to distract from plot holes. The musical numbers were fantastic and ultimately this kind of escapist film is just what we need in this day and age. It definitely lives up to its hype, even if the ending doesn't leave you as uplifted as you expected to asking in. On the bright side, the 'audition' song is a beautifully moving one that leaves you in tears. If it's not performed and doesn't win an Oscar, it will be a major upset."

","So a few hours before I had been brought by Damien Chazelle on an unforgettable musical adventure, I had been searching through IMDb (like I do for hours every day), and found this poll about the top directors under 40 years of age. But this poll took me by surprise like no other previously has. You know why? I was scrolling through for about five minutes, wondering. Wondering why. Why wasn't Damien Chanzelle even given the respect he deserves. Because can you believe it? This man is only 31. 31!! And look what he's done. He's terrific. So this poll took me by great surprise, to the reason being Damien wasn't even on the list. He wasn't even respected enough to on the list. Damien needs to be recognized to a full. He certainly came into the the film industry full of great ideas and proving his future value with his fantastic film debut of Whiplash.<br/><br/>Anyway, so moving on, it's very obvious that this man loves his music. Though this unforgettable glory of La La Land, Damien takes you on a trip you never thought you'd undertake. He's mixed the late musicals (not to mention his outstanding camera work, going back to the traditional no cut sequences) and the romantic flicks of near after. And he's done a terrific job at it. I had never expected what I would see once I stepped into the cinema and sat in the slightly comfortable but not all too thrilling red seats. This film was spectacular in every way. It brought terrific camera work. I say terrific. It can't get better than Damien Chazelles camera work. His directing is exquisite, it's original, it's breath taking, it's eye catching, it's not to be missed. I literally did not blink throughout the whole film, that's how unmissable this soon to be classic is. Damien Chazelle is soon to be, a film making legend. He's got an entertaining future ahead of himself, and I'm sure he's not going to let anyone forget that. Just wait.<br/><br/>My rating: 9.6/10"
"Gordon-11","Null","4","9","25 December 2016"," It's alright
","This film tells the story of a budding actress, who goes to audition after audition trying to get her break. She meets a jazz musician who is also waiting for a break in his career.<br/><br/>Looking at the ratings and the number of award nominations it has gathered, I thought it would be amazing. Indeed, the first scene of the traffic jam in the highway is great, as it is a continuous shot of people singing and dancing on the highway. After that, such musical number if far and few in between. The story is slow and drags on, fortunately the subplot about how they have to follow their dreams somehow strikes a chord with the audience. There is a number of songs that are good, but I expected more songs and less dialogues for a musical."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","7","4","9","25 December 2016"," Not a masterpiece
","I'll keep this review straight and to the point ‚Äì I liked La La Land, but I didn't love it, and I'm a little perplexed about why it's a front runner for the Best Picture Oscar. I think the film looks beautiful, from the camera work, to the costumes, and the lighting. Emma Stone also gives a very good performance. But other than that, there's not much else I can really praise. It kept me engaged, but I wasn't riveted by it. <br/><br/>La La Land is an attempt to revive the musical genre by giving it a more modern twist. It's about an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a struggling Jazz piano player (Ryan Gosling) trying to reach success in their respective industries. They fall in love without much build up and they encourage each other to achieve their dreams, but there are some bumps along the road (I don't want to spoil it). It's a pretty routine bittersweet love story about the conflict between chasing your ideal career and personal happiness. <br/><br/>I think the main reason La La Land is getting so much buzz is because it's nostalgic about 1940's musicals and it makes show business seem like an important industry. Hollywood and the critics eat up those kinds of movies. I don't think the songs or the dance numbers are particularly memorable though. Script wise, it's nothing special either. Director Damien Chazelle's camera work and Emma Stone's performance are the real stars here. While I don't think the actual songs are memorable, they ARE filmed well. La La Land deserves many technical awards. <br/><br/>I think most people who go into La La Land not expecting a masterpiece will be very pleased. I just don't get the people calling it the best movie of the year. Different strokes for different folks I guess."

"ThomasDrufke","10","4","9","20 December 2016"," For the Dreamers
","There are two things that can really win me over in a movie; great music and a great ending. La La Land has both, and then some.<br/><br/>Coming off of Whiplash, one of the best films of 2014, the pressure was on Damien Chazelle to come up with something to top what he did previously. Not only did he co-write 13 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, but he finally got to direct his passion project, La La Land. In fact, the very plot of the film echoes Chazelle's relentless devotion to getting this film made all these years. And for the most part, the result is magical. Surely, there's nothing like it you will see this year. <br/><br/>Like many classic musicals of the 40's and 50's, La La Land's narrative tends to wander into dreamy and surreal territories, but it's at its best when it is simply telling the story of two ambitious artists in Los Angeles, one a jazz musician and the other an aspiring actress. I think Chazelle's vision would have been fine with other actors, but there's no question that a ton of credit has to go to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Their chemistry bolsters this story, and really, is why I cared so much about these characters. Both of them will be nominated and both of them deserve to be. Their relationship through triumphs and struggles, may be the best romance of the year.<br/><br/>La La Land is one of those movies that doesn't really hit you until the car ride home, or even a few days after. Sometimes the wandering plot and the inconsistent presence of musical numbers is frustrating, but it all leads to one satisfying ending. So much so that I significantly upped my score because of how hard the ending hit me. It isn't predictable or easy, in fact, because the ending wasn't what I originally hoped, made me enjoy it even more. The final few shots gave me a whole movie's worth of emotion, and it made it worth it in the end.<br/><br/>This is clearly a tribute to the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood and also a constant reminder at the brilliance of Jazz music, but I found the touching romance and struggle of these two artists to be the most rewarding aspect to La La Land. The beautiful score and equally subtle and swashbuckling songs contribute to one epic theater experience. I'm still processing how I feel about the film as a whole, but I'm certainly pleased that I saw it.<br/><br/>+Stone & Gosling chemistry<br/><br/>+Music<br/><br/>+Unpredictable<br/><br/>+Satisfying ending<br/><br/>-Middle act wanders<br/><br/>10/10"

This movie chronicles Sebastian & Mia's relationship & how they strive to achieve their dreams. <br/><br/>La La Land is an excellent movie. Director Damien Chazelle has made yet another masterpiece, after Whiplash(2014). The original soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz is unforgettable. My favorite song in the movie is 'City of Stars', which is sung by Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone. I also loved 'Audition(The Fools Who Dream)', sung by Emma Stone. Ryan Gosling is outstanding as Sebastian. Emma Stone is spectacular as Mia. They both deserve all the accolades they have received, for their respective performances. The chemistry between Stone & Gosling is electrifying. Both of them sing beautifully & dance flawlessly. La La Land is a must watch. Go for it, as soon as you can!"

All of them are singers and dancers and belongs to la la land. As a musician and lover of dance I felt like this is what I was looking for. Action movies and the protagonist's struggles seems to have been defeated by pure love, romance and life's irony. Incredibly beautiful experience I would call it.

","The struggling actress meets a determined jazz musician and they fling themselves around Los Angeles' sights and scenes, while slowly falling in love. Ho hum. But I found a lot of Ho! and much to hum along to. This film swept me up in a way I wasn't expecting, and the effortless gliding between such a range and contrasts of styles, situations and emotions worked a treat. There is sentimentality (quite a lot, actually) but also pathos, doubts, despair, firmly grounded reality, unexpected twists and over the top implausibility.<br/><br/>Los Angeles proves she has some fabulous settings and backdrops, many dating back a long way, which give the city more style, substance and depth than the abundance of concrete freeways and glass office towers that generally appear.<br/><br/>It is a film of two leads: Ryan Gosling as the jazz pianist Sebastian and Emma Stone as wannabe actress Mia. There are no other characters of substance. There is quite a lot of jazz, mostly modern, a little trad and some pleasant tuneful jazz-pop-musical style songs. If either of the leads or modern jazz is a turn off for you, then it mightn't be your cup of tea, because there's a lot of all three. Ryan Gosling gets my special mention award for playing his own piano - and really well. It's the next level up from performers like Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott who can play and make a convincing show as a real pianist. But Ryan's effort is the real deal.<br/><br/>The film is well structured and I suspect has many references to earlier classics, most of which I failed to notice. But the re- creation of Walt Disney's dancing fairy in the Griffith Observatory was just wonderful.<br/><br/>I found it an effortlessly entertaining couple of hours, with that feeling of ""How did it get to be that late?"" when we emerged. Damien Chazelle as writer and director in my view has scored a hat trick, a home run, a set to love or whatever your favourite sporting accolade is. As an Aussie Rules follower, it's probably kicking the winning goal after the siren."

No single song steps out as much as everything works so well together to enhance telling the story.<br/><br/>Filmed by the guy who made Whiplash(La La Land has a small role for JK Simmons who won an Oscar for his role in that film), I still like Whiplash far better but this was a great follow up.<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"

","I can see why this won Best Picture, even if it was only for 30 seconds. This film was fantastic! I'm not usually a fan of live-action musicals, which is why I waited to rent this one, but this was a great movie! Although, it is a little pretentious and narcissitic, but hey, it's an Oscar-nominated film. That's the very definiton. Given that this is the only movie that I've seen Ryan Gosling in, I can't really compare his role in this film to previous works, so for what I got it was great. His singing is pretty good. And now we move to Emma Stone. As far as acting goes, she was fantastic, but her singing ability is average, and at times a bit off key. I've heard better, but I've definietely heard worse. This movie goes into date-night movie territory, but never chick flick territory, thank goodness. (Hey, I'm a guy. I'm not the target audience for those). Overall this was a fun romp, and it deserved every award it was nominated for and won with the exception of Best Costume Design. (What costumes? It's just regular clothes.) The story was pretty good, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was believable, although sometimes the drama and arguments were a bit overacted, and the choreography and songs were awesome! I am going to be listening to the soundtrack on repeat for a long time. I cannot get these songs out of my head. It's a mix of jazz, pop, funk, a little bit of everything. There's something for everyone to love in this fun musical romp.

"miadocteur","10","3","6","27 September 2017"," Review of La La Land
","Damien Chavelles "" La La Land"" is a movie which has rightfully won many awards for its cinematography, acting and music. It feels as though each note, thread, and camera angle were delicately and thoughtfully chosen to bring together a story about two people fighting to make their dreams come true as well as fighting to be together. Mia, an aspiring actress from Boulder City, soon falls in love with a snappy jazz pianist, Sebastian, who tries to revive the art of jazz. <br/><br/>There are many scenes in which lighting plays an important role in adding to the mood of each scene as well as creating a beautiful visual composition. When Sebastian plays the piano and Mia hears him for the first time, the moment is intensified with a spotlight. With the use of a spotlight, nothing else mattered except the two of them in the moment. The lighting also ties in with the use of colors used and how the colors would mix to add to a scene. The lighting is used in order to make certain scenes stand out from others such as when Sebastian and Mia have their fight or when they sit down to sing a song together at the piano. The same lighting is used after Mia does her solo performance. Some scenes were filmed with only natural light to give it a more realistic feeling. Although most of the film had a formalist feel, it did indeed had realistic elements.<br/><br/>Primary colors were used throughout this movie to convey a certain emotion for a particular scene. Blue was used to express success and control such as when she decides to go to the party with her roommates. Although the other girls are wearing bright primary colors, they still fade into the background of the party whereas Mia stands out foreshadowing that she has more potential and will stand out. Yellow was used to signify that there would be some sort of change to follow such as the dance that Sebastian and Mia share after the pool party or Keith bumping into the couple at the jazz club. The absence of color also plays an important role in the building of the story such as the scene where Mia botches her solo performance and after Sebastian goes through a humiliating photo shoot. The two of them are wearing black and white when they individually hit ""rock bottom"". <br/><br/>The music and dance numbers were used to allude to classic musicals as well as tie the entire story together. Sebastian theme shows up a number of times throughout the film as a way to ground the characters or make them reminisce about how things were by the end of the film when Mia and her husband happen to go to Sebastian's Jazz Club. The audience gets somewhat sucked into the idea of exclusionary musical art, being trained throughout the movie that jazz and classical is better than modern pop. At the pool party, the audience is able to feel Sebastian's embarrassment when he's asked to play ""I Ran"". They are also able to feel a shock and almost disgust when Sebastian first starts to play with Keith's Band. <br/><br/>The cinematography used in this film was used for the specific purpose of making it feel like Old Hollywood by using CinemaScope. Most of the dancing scenes were filmed as if the camera was moving with the music like an instrument, spinning and moving in and out. The camera moves in an almost emotional way and goes along with the feelings of the scene. <br/><br/>Altogether, the film was very well thought out and with that it was able to grab the attention of a larger audience with a good outcome."
"bxl-12458","10","3","6","27 September 2017"," Amazing movie!
","La La Land is an amazing movie, and easily one of my all-time favorites. There is a heavy amount of importance placed on colors throughout the film, often used to portray character emotion or to foreshadow the outcome of imminent events. Though the color foreshadowing was occasionally intentionally misleading, making the movie all the more fun! There were many scenes in the movie where extremely vibrant colors were brought to the foreground to really deliver an effective message or emotion. There was also a plethora of scenes that used color as a mood modifier in the background, so that it doesn't jump out at you nearly as much as the foreground color placement, but so that it still has an amazing impact setting this apart from all other movies released in 2016. I very much enjoyed the use of camera angles throughout this movie. More often than not, they were used to portray a light-hearted sarcastic tone to scenes that could have otherwise felt dry. This effect is present so much that without it, I doubt the main characters would have found any interest in each other. Camera angles also provided the obvious added bonus of making you feel those emotional scenes all that much more, especially when combined with the movie's (again) excellent use of color. I enjoyed the use of far shots to make you feel disconnected from the characters emotionally, there are very few in this movie, but they are used extremely well. Another stand out example of the amazing camera angle usage in this movie is the panoramic shot of the female protagonist during her final interview, which truly gave the emotion of a transformation occurring, the turning over of a new leaf in a sense, as her life really started to take off in the direction she had always hoped it would. There seems to have been significant effort put in to making every scene as perfect as it could be. It feels as though a lot of time went into making sure that every scene had exactly the setup to deliver the message exactly as it was intended. The whole movie gives the feeling of, well, watching a movie. This is shown in the way that things come up in the order that they feel they should, even to a comedic affect at times, and the often times extravagant scenes or props. For example, when the protagonist couple is leaving the coffee shop and walks into a movie set, setup right next to the coffee shop. The set is comedic in both its placement and lack of dramatic introduction. It's not exactly a defining moment in the movie, but the scene is referred to and referenced at later points in the movie. This gives it the backing to have justified receiving a moment of individual introduction. Instead, it, like many other sets throughout the movie, are introduced in a lackluster kind of fashion, which helps to lend to the almost constant sarcastic undertone of the movie in a spectacular way. I would highly recommend that anyone who hasn't already go see this movie ASAP!"

The music and score of the movie is fresh and entertaining, some addicting, while maintaining a subtle vibe.

"sammlanza","10","3","6","19 August 2017"," A true masterpiece and easily the best film of 2016
","The fact that this masterpiece is so unfairly being rated a 1 out of 10 by a large minority of haters is precisely why I never pay attention to reviews on IMDb for certain types of movies. Over the years, I've observed that there's an obvious bias against musicals, anything with romance, or a strong female lead no matter the quality of the film on IMDb. Anything with a superhero in it, however, breaks through the stratosphere of 9/10 or greater by default before it drifts downward even if it's a real turkey. So, yeah, I definitely take the averages on IMDb with a grain of salt since they are motivated more by unfair biases than the true quality of the film."
"iysky","5","3","6","6 August 2017"," Dear Hollywood: Please Stop Praising Mediocrity
","Firstly I want to clarify that La La Land isn't a bad film. It's fun, has great production value, and has some good acting along with some catchy songs. The story is clear and to the point with a message you'd want your kids to understand. It'd be great for a mindless movie night where you're too busy with the snacks and your mates to fully concentrate on artistic concepts or deep explorations of human nature. <br/><br/>But I was angry after watching it because it is not a great film, or even a good one, it's a passable film. Passable films aren't deserving of 6 Oscars. <br/><br/>I'm not normally a musical person (although I fully appreciate why people enjoy them) but watched it due to the hype expecting some kind of revolutionary masterpiece that would become one of the few musicals I actually like. But yet again I was disappointed. <br/><br/>For a start the plot was bland and uninspiring with extremely little depth. I know musicals generally don't go to much depth but if you're going to be the film of the year do something original. The 'penniless artist' trope has been done many times before and even here they made the characters flat and romanticised. <br/><br/>The film seemed to jump violently between a story about 'real people', a homage to the classics, and a pantomime. Due to this I couldn't get immersed in the story at all nor get to know the characters. By the end of it I realised I didn't care about them at all nor could I take any of it seriously. A film should know what it is, especially one that did so well. The Moulin Rouge knew what it was so well that it had a giant metaphor for itself sitting in the middle of it, but that comparative rant is for another day.<br/><br/>This film did nothing new. It had the same approach as musicals made 50 years ago. There was no 'modern spin', placing it in the 21st century does nothing if the bones of it are the same. And that would all be fine if it wasn't hailed as a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Filmmaking is an art and art needs to change and evolve. Praising this is stunting the growth of a genre that could potentially be so much more. Hollywood is spending so much time saying 'Look how great we are!' and 'Look how great we used to be!' that it's forgetting what makes film great, originality and growth. <br/><br/>Hollywood needs to learn to embrace the new and daring (although something tells me they never will). Great films are being made these days but they don't have the visibility they deserve. This film wont be remembered in the history books, stop acting like it will."

Long, flowing shots with complex choreography of dancers, props and the camera rig, this is high craft. It's dreamy, always lush with contrasting colors in light or wardrobe. It's a big, satisfying visual-fest that drips off the screen.<br/><br/>Most important of all, it's a sweet story. Two lovers who are perfectly matched, but with timing that couldn't be more wrong. I'm not a big fan of either actor, but they pulled me in and had be interested until the end.<br/><br/>Was it perfect? No. Is anything? It's about 15 minutes too fat in the running time.

They were broke, relatable ""dreamers"" with designer clothes, expensive cars, and no flaws. The characters were very underdeveloped, and there did not seem to be any chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. <br/><br/>The music was really boring and simple, and every song was forgettable- except for City of Stars because they played it every five minutes.

","I can't give the film higher marks as although I enjoyed it - it was great to watch- as a musical it didn't have the power of, say, Chicago. The dance routines were mediocre. Having recently watched Astaire and Powell dance to Begin the Beguine, the routine by the two actors by the lampost was just, well, lacking. Trying to be cool with hand in trouser pocket, they didn't seem to me to be dancing, just moving. Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but if dance routines are included, they've got to be good, and memorable. <br/><br/>Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the colour, the locations and the story. We weren't told what was going on in the story, it just evolved. The girl works in a cafe on a film production set, we see her going to rehearsals and ( despite doing well) fails to get parts. Chance meetings with the Sebastian, they talk about their aspirations, etc. etc. I saw the film with four others and they all said, what did you think of that? This isn't their usual response and they weren't smiling. I just enjoyed being entertained and watching the story unfold. The singing wasn't great, the songs not memorable and the dance routines OKish (the opening dance at the traffic jam was, er different).

The dancing and choreographic work were spectacular in this, not to mention the camera-work, which was interesting to say the least. The musical numbers, to me were the true highlight of this movie and I really wanted to see more of them. Unfortunately, what drags the movie down for me is the fact that I found the story only okay. While I found the musical bits amazing, I thought that the story wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. There were some bits that felt too slow even though the pacing was pretty good.

"freemantle_uk","5","3","6","19 January 2017"," A wonderful throwback or over-hyped?
","La La Land is one big awards contenders of 2017, sweeping the Golden Globes and been nominated for 11 BAFTAs at the time of writing and received near universal acclaim. But is really worthy of this praise or has it been over-hyped? Mia (Emma Stone) and Seb (Ryan Gosling) are two artistic dreamers living in the City of Angels who inexplicably keeping each other in the metropolis. Mia is an aspiring actor and Seb is a jazz pianist who wants to open his own jazz club. They soon for start a relationship and encourage each other to follow their dreams, but the harsh reality of real life test them regarding the personal and professional life.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle is easily considered one of the great emerging directing having already made Whiplash and now has La La Land to his credit it has been announced he would be reuniting with Ryan Gosling to make a biopic about Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>La La Land opens with an excellent song-and-dance number on an LA freeway and Chazelle embraces the old-fashion nature of the film. The film celebrates the fact it was shot in cinemascope and it uses a lot of techniques that was common in the technicolor era, using long tracking shots (making the dance numbers even better) and the editing transitions. But some of the early songs do have the same structure, a soft beginning becomes a bigger numbers as the song process and then two-thirds through the song one singer has a moment of introspective before a huge finish. One of the best moments is a big tap-dancing when Mia and Seb start to get to know each other, wonderfully reflecting the musicals it's reflecting.<br/><br/>When Seb and Mia finally get together the musical number pretty much stop and La La Land becomes more like a serious drama about a relationship. Whilst this part of the film of fine but it was not the pastel coloured detail that made the first act such a delight. It becomes a romantic drama about the highs and lows of a relationship. There is a logic in the film having less music during its middle act because of the reality of their situation but one of the big selling points of La La Land was it meant to be an all-singing-all-dancing aware. It doesn't go back to being a musical until the third act in an extremely drawn-out ending.<br/><br/>The retro style and story about the struggles in Hollywood La La Land has similarities to 2011's The Artist, the story of a silent movie star whose career takes a downturn whilst an actress he helped out becomes a huge star. Both films were celebrations of a bygone era in Hollywood, using the same techniques that the films that were referred used. This is usually a great way for a film to gain awards attention.<br/><br/>La La Land personally reminded me of John Carney's Begin Again, both similar openings, including showing two characters having bad days, plot points and themes about success vs. artistic integrity. La La Land also looks at the reality of a relationship and artistic lifestyle and it is essentially a story about the American Dream - looking at the sacrifices people need to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>La La Land offered a lot of promise with its big opening and the film as a whole should have been a big song-and-dance feature throughout. There is too much of a lull after it's great opening act and whilst La La Land is enjoyable, it is not the masterpiece some have made it out to be. Moana is the best musical of 2016 and Chazelle's previous offering, Whiplash was a better film."

They wanted to ""be somebody."" And so, why not be a star?<br/><br/>This is so fundamentally and almost uniquely American. The belief that you can come from ""nowhere"" today and be a ""star"" tomorrow still strongly echoes in the American psyche. Television shows like ""The Voice,"" ""American Idol,"" and ""America's Got Talent"" easily attest to that.<br/><br/>However, these days, we've carried it way too far. Today, there are too many people who believe that in order to be relevant or whole they must be on television or they must be ""a star."" It's really sad. That road is fraught with peril and pitfalls.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is a throwback to old Hollywood musicals. You know, those big, Busby Berkeley type films where the characters break into song and dance every ten minutes or so. There's always a production number right around the corner or in the next scene. Fred and Ginger. <br/><br/>While La La Land isn't as intricate as Berkeley, it does borrow some of his tricks and clich√©s. Director Damien Chazelle was clearly influenced by old Hollywood films at some point in his life. And fortunately for him and La La Land, it has paid off quite well.<br/><br/>La La Land is a delightful film about dreams. It's about the importance of dreaming and fantasizing about your life as you'd like it to be. In this case, it centers on characters beautifully played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.<br/><br/>Their characters want to be happy and meaningful. They live in Los Angeles and they're both reaching for relevance in their respective venues. Throw in a little romance, some song and dance, some Technicolor with a pinch of nostalgia and jazz ¬Ö and you've got the film pegged.<br/><br/>As a nation ‚Äì and world - we totally need this film right now. We're in a dark period. Things feel bleak.<br/><br/>We need to be reminded that life doesn't always have to be about strife and struggle and conflict, although the characters in this film clearly deal with these issues.<br/><br/>La La Land reminds us that a life lived without pursuing your dream isn't much of a life at all. It also teaches us that perhaps the greatest love of all is the selflessness that allows us to give flight to someone else's dream. If you truly love someone, you'll release them so they can become who they're meant to be.<br/><br/>Yes, I've already said too much.<br/><br/>La La Land is a must-see film for creative types who are prone to apathy, depression or indecision. Do yourself a favor and go see it. It reminds us that success is not the destination. It's part of the journey.<br/><br/>I promise you ¬Ö after seeing this film, you'll leave the movie theater ready to take flight and become one with the stars. <br/><br/>After all, you ARE a star. -- Michael K.

","I had high hopes for this movie based on word-of-mouth from other movie-goers, but the only decent parts were the occasional ""older"" jazz tunes fleetingly heard throughout a dreadfully long and puffed-up souffl√© that had no memorable music of its own to offer the listener. How many times can you play the same simple semi-classical jazz tune, over and over and over, and still have it leave no trace of memory after the movie is finished?<br/><br/>Beginning with the over-extended opening ""musical"" sequence leading up to Emma Stone giving the finger to Ryan Gosling once a massive traffic jam on the freeway finally begins moving again, all I could figuratively hear was some inept director in the background saying ""Faster, faster! More energy! Keep smiling, dammit!"" and where casting apparently had a call where every driver stuck in traffic couldn't be over 25, preferably not over 20.<br/><br/>As the skimpy plot slowly wound its way through the ""seasons"" to give us some time-frame for reference as to the length of this tripe, I kept expecting Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst to make a cameo appearance from their ""Spiderman 3"" jazz-bar sequence to at least bring some life to the turgid pace of this dog. The entire movie seemed like a two hour riff on that five minute clip. And the last ""season"" actually takes place five years later, like a bad coda to an awful movie.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling can't sing, although neither could jazz artist Chet Baker, so I didn't hold that against him. But he certainly can't act, either. Emma Stone's own singing paled in comparison to Kirsten Dunst's feeble warbling in ""Spider Man 3"", and makes Nicole Kidman's singing in ""Moulin Rouge"" seem like an artistic triumph. Ms. Stone appeared to be trying her hardest to bring some much needed acting relief to the screen, but often came across as chewing the scenery opposite the sheer blandness of Ryan Gosling. Walter Matthau had more chemistry with Barbra Streisand in ""Hello, Dolly!"" and I always thought they had zero chemistry. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have less, as he seems to keep sucking it away from her.<br/><br/>The writing, directing, editing, ""special effects"" and even sound were awful. Characters just became ""different"", dancer's feet were cut off in several sequences, swirling the camera back and forth and back and forth took the place of cuts, possible close-ups were often ignored, segues were choppy, the ""dream sequences"" were usually laughable, with the final one the most ridiculous of all, and volume blared up and down throughout.

The perfect music, the wonderful actors,.. I was just hoping no one would talk to me because I surely wasn't able to talk with all those tears in my eyes. This has never happened to me before, you can totally lose yourself in this beautiful movie. From this day on, I was using every single chance to see the movie again and again.<br/><br/>La La Land changed the way I look at things. I feel way more open for unknown things. This movie is pure creativity and it well deserves all the awards."

","From the opening to the end, La La Land was amazing with beautiful cinematography, moving story everybody can relate to, and surprise and heartbreaking ending. I laughed and cried. This movie is like a dreamscape. I would watch this movie again and again and enjoy its artistry and story. The opening scene on highway was one of the greatest ever. I'm disappointed that it didn't win Oscar best picture, but it's just an award show with people's agenda in choosing which movie ""should"" win. La La Land will be an Hollywood classic for many many years."

","The way the main character (played by gosling) plays jazz for his love interest (played by stone) in the end, when he sees that she's saddened that their not together.... With the whole music being played by him in such a way that it takes her to a perfect imaginary world.... where they lead perfect life with each other.... starting from the first time she was attracted to him and all the way till she came to his dream jazz bar.... SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF IMAGINATION! This is not your average musical/drama movie, this is a new genre that just toys with the audience's emotions by both sounds and visuals. I don't know why people are giving it negative reviews. I don't care what sort of technical mistakes there were in the making of this movie but I simply sat back and enjoyed the art of heartbreak."

Escorted by a very good matching and equally beautiful Soundtrack it took me completely at the End.

","Hollywood and it's glamour is just the vehicle to grab your visual attention and it's spectacularly done well and as the story develops it never loses the basic human experience of hope and having a dream and those who come in and out of your life who supported and loved you in that dream and visa versa. All of the horrible nasty reviews on here just means that the movie is on target. Ask yourselves. Am I living my dream? Was it trampled on growing up? Did I let my dream die? Did someone believe in me when I didn't? And am I bitter, resentful and regretful that I stopped growing when others didn't? This movie gets right to the point as to why we should strive to live our lives to the fullest and take those risks no matter what. It was also a thrill to see such glamour in a Hollywood film again. Stunning, just stunning. I was moved to tears and overwhelmed as I knew that I had lived their experiences emotionally too. This movie is a vehicle to process grief regret, loss and joy and love and so much more."
"ethanguerami","10","4","10","20 February 2017"," Amazing and Powerful Movie Making
","So I finally went out and saw LaLa Land before it was no longer in theaters. I was expecting a dance-tastic TV commercial type deal where a bunch of people continuously come out of nowhere and dancing to the camera, and actually, this is exactly how it begins. After 10 minutes, I was ready to make my move for a refund, but i decided to give it more time and wow was I rewarded for sticking to it. I powered through some additional dancing and singing and eased into the plot which really focuses on two people who are working hard to improve their financial lives (I'll avoid any spoilers so this won't go into much detail about the movie specifics).<br/><br/>Several times throughout the film they pointed to how the co-stars each had big dreams and wanted to make their dreams come true. They lived uncomfortable lives and several scenes such as a long stare into a old dried-up roof leak on the ceiling silently illustrated how the great entrepreneur creator ‚Äì unsatisfaction ‚Äì helped drive them to make their dreams come true.<br/><br/>So instead of the typical Hollywood underlying theme of trying to break social molds, the movie really focuses on the American Dream and the difficulties and heart-ache that comes from pursuing your dreams. The two characters push each other to continue even after having constant disappointments.<br/><br/>Each star is faced with hardship when wanting to do things their own way and each had to make decisions that might cause them to lose their dreams. The reason the movie was such a great movie is that each of us face the same dilemma along with the search to do our dreams with someone we respect and care for.<br/><br/>So, I highly recommend this movie and will forewarn you that you have to power through the cotton candy beginning to get into the fine dining that develops midway through and launches you into a fantastic and powerful ending. All I will say about the ending is that a mesmerizing stare and a few notes on a piano get expanded into amazing and powerful movie making. Congrats to everyone who made the movie possible."

","THIS. This right here is what I love about movies. This film right here is why I put myself through going pretty much every weekend to see the latest critically acclaimed masterpiece that turns out to flop, in the hopes that one day, this will happen. La La Land is beautiful, soaring, fun, uplifting, dramatic, gorgeous, and basically everything that makes us smile. I was grinning throughout the entire first act. This is an original live action musical, something we don't get to see too often in movies today. Could it have been a bit of a missed opportunity to cast two white actors in a movie about jazz? Yes, it could have been, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shone. On their own, they are both bright stars, but put them together, and they light up the world. Chemistry, which is such a big missed ball in Hollywood these days, is undeniable between the two of them. It just WORKED. I cannot praise the soundtrack enough. The songs are brilliant and catchy and bright, I'm still listening to it months after seeing the film. Also, the choreography and costumes and the aesthetic of it all. The musical scenes are filmed with such fluidity it is magnificent. The movie is given a retro feeling, but takes place in modern times. The color palette of bright, primary colors for Stone's character and more muted browns and blues for Gosling worked perfectly with the themes and their relationship. The ending, as abrupt as it may be, was certainly beautiful and no one can say it was unsatisfactory."

Frankly, it is such a good filmmaking and the directing, the picture, the photography... everything is beautiful. The songs are so well written and even if you're not into jazz, you'll get after watching La La Land. Chazelle is a genius. It reminded me of good old musicals. Such movies are the reason why people need to go to the cinemas, often. I loved it.<br/><br/>And without giving any spoilers, I want to say that the ending is the reason why it's the best film that I've seen. Stone and Gosling need congratulations for playing these roles so magically. They gave me so many feelings (Chazelle needs to rock Oscars this year) You will dig into so deep feelings, you will feel it.

Their love story is really a touching and funny one:how they say it was never meant to be but then each makes whatever it can to make the other proud of him and happy,the way they encourage each other and even when they fall apart they are still there for one another,that is PURE LOVE.<br/><br/>The music is perfectly in tone with the film and complements it perfectly each time it happens.The 2 leads are amazing and they quite show their vocal potential in the songs they perform,especially Ema Stone.The best piece in my opinion is City of Stars performed by 2 young aspiring artists who are in awe of Los Angeles,the city where dreams come true.<br/><br/>The dance was also on point and I love how our 2 leads managed to keep up and even surpass at some point their professional dancers colleagues.<br/><br/>The scenery:digital+studio+real landscapes were very well chosen depending on the scene,depending on the message and depending on the interactions.<br/><br/>All scenes were great but for me the best one was the ""What If?"" type of life they could have had together,the way they could have lived and merged beautifully with the final dance and the fact both achieved their dreams but had to sacrifice their love in the processes.<br/><br/>It was a real journey for me too,I felt like being there with them and made me really look a little at my life and enjoy it more,struggle more when time comes to achieve what I want and to be positive and it shown me that life gives you plenty if you look at things the right way."

One of my favorite scenes is when Mia and Sebastian dive into dancing through the halls of the Griffith observatory. Sebastian wants to get a jazz club going. Mia wants to quit the coffee shop and write plays. The ending is a dream sequence that's very well connected with the way they feel about each other.

"GuilhermeHT","10","4","10","6 February 2017"," A Lovely Dream
","La Land is a film that was made by the passion for movies and evokes the same love to the public. Damien Chazelle's dream project is replete with gender references, all perfectly incorporated, ranging from a narrative structure to a simple touch on a post. Here is the heart who leads the story. The direction of Chazelle is creative and daring, giving preference to long plans, the mise en scene is vivid and the camera is active, always looking to float around the scene and characters, and the dance and music scenes are impeccable.<br/><br/>But the soul of the film is in Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Gosling has an extremely dedicated work, including the piano. He injects different layers to the character, transiting very well between drama, comedy, romance and sarcasm, and that leaves the public fallen in love with Sebastian. And Stone (probably the most wonderful thing in this lovely movie) creates a vibrant Mia. A performance with explosions of feelings and that exceeds the limits of the screen and reaches the heart of the viewer in full, leaving us with each new frame more and more in love with it. The rest of the cast acts correctly, but without individual highlights. <br/><br/>The technical part is perfect. The cinematography is inventive, and printing Technicolor's dream-colors and presented in Cinemascope makes the film an event. The vast costumes and the detailed production design help create an intense, fluid, and euphoric world. And the soundtrack and the songs (which could be more) are incredible, they are remarkable compositions that help to punctuate the emotions of the scenes and that help to extract excellent moments of the protagonists.<br/><br/>The few problems of the film, like the abandonment of some elements that were interesting and abrupt changes of feelings, do not change the fact that La Tierra is a masterpiece. A masterful, harmonious, exciting, brave and daring film, with captures the essence of what it truly is to fall in love with the movies. A movie for a lifetime."

"SpoilerAlertReviews","10","4","10","26 January 2017"," Get swept off your feet with a dazzling masterpiece of cinema.
","There is so much to say about this movie musical, even without giving anything away. Just looking at my after notes, it's already loaded with comments and details telling me this is going to be a larger than normal post. (Possibly exceeding the IMDb word count of a thousand) let's see. <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle does it again, firstly where he bashed my head in with a drumstick or two with 2014's Whiplash, which was so intense, it had me sweating in the cinema. Twice. I had to watch it again the very next day and wasn't any less sweaty the second time round. An absolute masterpiece. <br/><br/>Chazelle again, displays his absolutely, stunning, visual brilliance whilst tilting the hat to classic cinema and musicals like Casablanca, Funny Face and The Red Balloon. Having been to L.A. countless of times, I find it to be my less favourite of the American cities I've been to, but, Chazelle manages to add a glossy, vibrant veil over the top that's inspired me with a new appreciation for the city. I still find it incredible and slightly unbelievable, but in a good way, that he's managed to take a modern, bustling and dirty city and still make it feel retro and vintage using abstract cinematography, like creating its very own time zone altogether. He even opens using the original 20th Century Fox logo and the fade out focuses make you feel like you're watching a theatre play. <br/><br/>There's a long list of scenes that stay with you because of this style and of course, being a musical, Chazelle honours the classic musical methods with astonishing and exuberant long takes that makes your smile stretch from seat 1 to 20. The opening scene alone is a tremendous feat with epic cinematography and beautiful imagery. I could dissect the whole movie, recounting each joyful and pleasant scene by scene, but it's truly something that has to be marvelled at by seeing and not reading. <br/><br/>The story is about a turbulent romance between Seb, (Ryan Gosling), a confident, proud and passionate pianist those ambitions sits with having his very own jazz club; and Mia, (Emma Stone) a struggling, aspiring actress trying to make her way in the superficial Hollywood. The cars they drive is a sweet analogy of their characters in way, Seb driving a classic '82 Buick Riviera and Mia driving a Prius. It must be familiar ground for both, playing aspiring performing artists such as they are in real life. Apparently the auditioning scenes which are torturous, were drawn from both star's actually experiences in auditioning. <br/><br/>The chemistry between the two is as always, perfect. This being their third outing after Gangster Squad and Stupid Crazy Love. Gosling oozes a certain coolness but with quite the finazz of confident arrogance. Whilst Stone appears vulnerable, reserved and bashful but what's simmering is an audacious, creative and inspiring woman. It's so well balanced and enriched by both, you could be forgiven for forgetting John Legend is in the movie. <br/><br/>Chazelle and Hurwitz love of Jazz shines through just like it did with Whiplash, now I know I keep referencing Whiplash, but please note, these are two very different films, which make this all the more impressive. It's the similarities such as the music being very much a subject matter to both films. I'm no expert but I'm a lover of Jazz too, and this soundtrack itself is utterly amazing, infectious and makes the heart glow with instantly recognisable tracks like ""Someone In The Crowd"", ""City of Stars"" and ""A Lovely Night."" Justin Hurwitz composes a mesmerising, enchanting musical that reminds me of sitting in Ronnie Scott's and has me weaving in and out of traffic whilst listening to the songs in the car. <br/><br/>Gosling and Stone perform the songs and dances excellently, displaying a gracefulness that would make any non-musical fan a lover and a dancer. The choreography is majestic throughout, especially the two scenes at Griffin Park/Observatory, the tap dancing in particular. Gosling actually learning to play the piano for his parts entirely says a lot about him as a star and as an actor, getting the emotion to come through. <br/><br/>The whole production is flawless and as I've said before, this zesty imagery is made up dazzling costume designs, great atmospheric sets and masterful use of lighting. The dresses Mia wears set against the plots she's on is just eye-candy and Seb's shoes! I want a pair of those shoes! <br/><br/>Have you ever watched a film and thought it was a personally message to you, sent from the cosmos, whether it be a dig or a reminder. The conclusion certainly hit a few chords on my heartstrings, bringing a tear to my eye, it's the perfect ending to a glorious movie. It's only shame is not having enough song and dance, but it a good thing to leave wanting more, and the film already has a runtime of 128mins. <br/><br/>As always, I haven't read any reviews but from what I can gather from the quotable taglines they are awarding the film with, they're absolutely right, it really is what everyone is saying. A dazzling, delightful masterpiece, that's amazingly good for the soul, heartfelt and a prefect blend of modern and vintage style. Being nominated for 14 Oscars, 11 BAFTA awards and won 7 Golden Globes should speaks volumes. I was totally swept off my feet and urge everyone to watch this film, at least twice. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 10 Performance: 9 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 10 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 10 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10<br/><br/>98% 9/10"

"artmania90","8","4","10","16 January 2017"," Not the masterpiece everyone is making it out to be
","""La La Land"" is above all an experiment in filmmaking just as ""The Artist"" was: to see if modern audiences can accept a bygone style of movies in today's world. It's exciting to see that it works (based on the box office success of ""La La"" and the surge of Oscars for ""Artist""). There are no cheats, there are no plot twists or modern devices to twist the audience's arm. This is a musical that is unapologetically saccharine and delivers as a crowning achievement of the year, even if it doesn't always live up to the insurmountable hype behind it.<br/><br/>This is Damien Chazelle's second major feature as writer/ director after his unbelievable debut with ""Whiplash"" (winner of 3 Oscars and maybe the best movie I've seen since beginning reviews for this website). The buzz behind this film was undeniable, and I know the pressure on Chazelle was great. In an industry of remakes and reboots galore, and despite my few issues with the film, I still think he is a filmmaker above all else. As Oliver Stone so perfectly described it: ""I have seen the future of filmmaking and his name is Damien Chazelle.""<br/><br/>La La Land is the romanticism of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the story is aptly simple. Two people try to make a name for themselves amidst rejections galore. Mia (Emma Stone) likens herself as a great actress and yet can't get out of her part time job as a barista. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) has a dream of opening a jazz club and reinvigorating the musical scene in the city. Through fate and circumstance these two run into each other more often than one might expect, and as luck would have it they fall in love.<br/><br/>As grand of a scope as the film is, it's essentially about these two people and the connection they share. SAG notably 'snubbed' the movie of an ensemble nomination, but thinking back on the story I can't even recall the side characters who occasionally dropped in. Both Stone and Gosling carry the film with humor and charm, a throwback to the simple storytelling of classic MGM musicals, and they sing to boot (live on set, too).<br/><br/>Yes, this is a musical. Not a gritty reboot of the genre as ""Moulin Rouge!"" was, or one driven by sex and jazz like ""Chicago,"" or an adaptation of Broadway like ""Les Mis."" This is a pure, original story with original music in all its candy-color CinemaScope shots and costumes. I can't think of a movie quite like it, so creative and risky to fund. It's like ""Singin In The Rain"" or ""American in Paris"" and has the tone of those movies, too. The musical numbers themselves are each filmed in one long take (a popular trend after movies like ""Birdman"") and are mesmerizing to watch. The opening song has a moving camera across a busy highway complete with traffic. How they filmed it I will never know. Another song shows Mia and Sebastian tap dancing over a cityscape as the sun is about to set. I would have to assume it's computer generated but would believe otherwise- I'm sure they had no more than 5 minutes to film the entire scene before losing light.<br/><br/>There are a lot of themes at work, and a lot of the same ideas that ""Whiplash"" previously explored: jazz, dreams, failure... the two films, as different to ally as they are, work to compliment each other and are the beginnings of a repertoire that only could be described as ""Chazelle-ian."" The movie isn't all fun and games, and the final 20 minutes are full of deep melancholy and regret. I admired the film all the more for its conclusion, but still felt the ever-present fact that in following the style of a classic MGM musical, it's very predictable. I loved ""Whiplash"" for its unique voice and style. The style is still there, but there's only so much a script can do that is bound by rules and guidelines. The final exchange of glances between Mia and Sebastian and the last moments of the film are most certainly a reference to the finale of ""Casablanca."" Even if the ending isn't what we had hoped, their look says it all. ""We'll always have Paris.""<br/><br/>Go see this film if only because there is nothing else like it. I doubt anything will ever come out again like it. Go for the filmmaking and admire the year's best cinematography (a scene in a movie theater in which Emma Stone is illuminated by projection light is unquestionably beautiful, and the recreations of the green silhouette from ""Vertigo"" is jaw- dropping and unexpected). If you are looking for the year's best movie I don't know if this is it. Regardless, it's damn good."

","Im not the biggest musical fan but this movie absolutely blew me away.<br/><br/>So i have 4 major reasons why i absolutely loved this to its core. <br/><br/>1. this movie looks so visually flawless. the cinematographer and director obviously understood each other perfectly in the making of this film. Each scene was breath taking to my eyes and even to the point of goosebumps for me. the vision of the city during the night time was incredible and something i noticed which may be wrong but the constant slight nudges of stars throughout the whole movie was pretty awesome to me. visually breath taking.<br/><br/>2. The characters were so well written that from the moment we are introduced to them i was curious and my curiosities were all satisfied within the limits of this film. i felt myself growing with them and could even relate to them in many parts from ryan goslings obsession over his favorite thing in life to emma stones dreams of being an actress. very relatable and extremely well acted by both gosling and stone.<br/><br/>3. I supported everything this movie stood for which was a love/encouragement letter to any dreamer in the world that are having a tough time making there dreams a reality<br/><br/>and finally 4. the ending of this movie was absolutely PERFECT in every way. though i say it is not exactly original, it is exactly the ending that this movie needed to seal the deal.<br/><br/>I love this movie cause it was perfect to me. The movie itself had more impact on me then the musicality to it (although I am also obsessed with the music currently) Any movie goer even if you do not like musicals should check this out because even you don't like the music, the story is so brilliantly told and you will fall in love with the characters. just go see it NOW!"

They used perfectly colors and lightning to create a nice and sweet area, that really warmed my heart. Make Up and Costumes were very authentically chosen and made me feel like it was REAL. The use of camera and the sound are very good (but average good). Emma Stone: This girl can sing!!! I didn't think after Easy A she can hit a note:D, but she really has a sweet voice and in the right moments it turns out to be very powerful and energetic. She has a perfect and very high range of emotions and can express these very good. This role will push her many steps up on the ladder. Ryan Gosling: He has a great voice too. I like his acting very much and I think he gave his best, but at some parts I believe he was weaker than Emma- but still a magical performance. The Cast: Many talented actors in there, but you don't really recognize them, because the two lead actors are always more or less alone in the focus. They made their job good, but hadn't enough time to develop. The Story: The only weak thing in here is, that you don't really understand how they fall in love (this is too short explained). The rest is awesome. They seem very happy while chasing their dreams and their love and then it turns and they nearly caught their dreams, but these dreams collide with the love. I think, this is a clever story and what you see on screen is perfectly worked out. At the end, when they decided to have own lives without each other to achieve their dreams, and they look at each other and see how their life could have been if they stayed together, I cried so hard. And this is the point. You laugh, you cry, you are happy and you are sad. All this in one package. The Music: I love the songs, they stuck in my head just one second after they finished an they didn't leave. I am not a musician, but I love these arrangements. I will buy these soundtrack!!! Best Scenes: 1) Opening 2) A lovely night 3) Audition (Fools who dream) 4) Epilogue<br/><br/>This is the best musical I ever saw and one of the best movies I ever saw. It deserves every good review and every award. I will be live and see this rule the Oscars!!!"

","This review of La La Land is spoiler free <br/><br/>***** (5/5) <br/><br/>A modern Hollywood film, about the glitz and glam of Hollywood with an addition of pure unadulterated joy is in very short supply in this crazy, sometimes nonsensical world both on and off the big screen. This is the short reason why the irresistible La La Land is so cherishable today. It's just as light on its feet as Fred Astaire and just as beautiful as Judy Garland. Sure enough, Whiplash was very intense especially with J.K Simmons' Terrance Fletcher screaming ""that's not my f**king tempo"" every so often and throwing a chair at Miles Teller's head, La La Land is a little more bittersweet than that in its first half it's footloose (not 'Footloose') and fancy free buoyed by the catchy soundtrack such as ""City of Stars"" which definitely deserves some awards recognition (thanks to the production team for coming up with that).<br/><br/>Its part New York, New York, part The Umbrellas of Cherbourg with a little bit of Singin' in the Rain we can just imagine the sweet singing voice and quick footed dance moves of Gene Kelly running the streets of modern day LA, though it's a bigger-budgeted upgrade over writer/director Damien Chazelle's short Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench with more or less the same idea. The story is Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress trying to make her life in Hollywood who soon learns that if you don't make it, the place will eat you up whole and use your bones as a toothpick, she meets with Seb (Ryan Gosling) a jazz pianist trying to become a famous musician. It's an incredible part of the story which is the definition of simplicity and initially as soon as the pair meets the chemistry is electric as sparks fly in every place both literally and figuratively. Whether they are singing to a jazz track or dancing on a hilltop to a Technicolour backdrop they are unfathomably a match made in heaven and almost inseparable.<br/><br/>At one point, the two are walking through the modern streets of LA Seb is talking about his chances as a Jazz musician suddenly Mia states that she hates Jazz, so he teaches her that it is everything with his irresistible dance moves or playing A-Ha on a key-tar she learns to like his taste in music a bit more. When she gets the chance to star in a one-woman play the tension becomes unbearable between the two and they decide to go their separate ways, Mia's and Seb's career takes off on a high the two become famous and their life starts to go in different directions. Unfortunately there isn't much of a story which falls horribly flat in places due to some sadly misplaced Pulp Fiction-esque narration techniques but with the sound track, the dance moves and the electricity of the stage the message is clear that La La Land doesn't need much of a story. Despite the story falling flat in places, their chemistry is electric, the music is terrifically catchy, the dancing is irresistible and the awards-calibre performances keep the film on a high. La La Land will make you sing, dance and cheer if there is a musical you watch in 2017 make sure it's this one.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Fast paced, very funny, audacious and beautiful Hollywood doesn't make this kind of film anymore truly an instant classic with a lot of heart it's the best movie of 2017 so far.<br/><br/>10/10 stunning."

","The buzz is high, the prizes started to accumulate. They tell however more about the status of the industry and the longing of the public for escapist entertainment combined with a high dose of nostalgia for the musical successes that were running high 60 or 70 years ago. La La Land directed by Damien Chazelle combines a well known formula, makes reverences to the golden period of the musical films in Hollywood (some scenes were filmed in the studio were Fred Astaire once was filmed) but also to some more modern film makers and their ideas (like Ki-duk Kim), and enjoys the participation of shining stars like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It may be sufficient for collecting statuettes. It is not enough to make it a real good film. I know I am in a minority expressing this opinion now. I believe that it will be a growing minority soon.<br/><br/>What we get with La La Land a collection of a few wonderful moments connected by an awfully schematic story. Boy meets girl, of course. Boy is an aspiring jazz musician in a time when real jazz seems to be in a descending slope of interest, Girl is an aspiring actress, waiting in a Starbucks (or like) coffee shop and auditioning in a serial and desperate manner. They both have visions and passion. They both aspire to careers, but life is tough and art and success seldom meet for one person and almost never with personal happiness. Or true love. From here on the story accumulates many of the possible stereotypes and too little artistic truth. Great scenes are not missing - actually this film has a number of memorable quotes, the problem is the rosy sweet materials on between. There is also one great idea that I liked - who does it belong to? script writers or director - the non-reality scenes are drawn in music and dance. The ones from the films in the 40s and 50s.<br/><br/>When jazz is played however, it's different. Jazz music is also about being true, great jazzmen do not lie when they play music. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) explaining to Mia (Emma Stone) what jazz is about is one of the best scenes I have ever seen about jazz. The problem is that this is not a jazz movie. As much as I love Ryan Gosling and appreciate Emma Stone their chemistry on screen is not enough to sustain the film, and it actually makes their breaking (and the break away scene) even less credible.<br/><br/>Just to be clear - La La Land is not a bad movie. Damien Chazelle is at his third film, the two other were also one way or the other related to music. Whiplash was welcome with ravishing critics and a very high IMDb rating. La La Land however belongs to a very different category. In the thin air of the ideas and good cinema of the last years it will get a lot of prizes in the next couple of months. Many of them are not deserved. I write this by respect for what the film is (and is not) and for what the Academy, BAFTA, or Golden Globe awards should be. I am expecting more and better films about music from Damien Chazelle. Maybe a great jazz movie."

","La La Land is a pinch of heart-touching reality draped in a croissant of sweet fantasy with a flavor of jazz and the 60s. The film reaches deep as it explores the intensity and authenticity of one's pursuit of dreams, etching them in a technicolorish yet surrealistic canvas. However, it blurts out a squeeze of reality that chasing one's dreams no matter how authentic they seem, may not be the perfect path to happiness. Dreams after all are visions of what we haven't yet achieved; they rarely take us places where we already are blessed.<br/><br/>The film surrounds an idyllic relationship between a Jazz Pianist and a wannabe Actress which derives fuel from the individual passions of one another. Gosling is great in his typical shy-away from lens yet intense Scorpio-ish style, but Emma is stupendous. Her charm and vividness is the heart and soul of this film. The chemistry is bang-on and exudes undercurrents of bleak and innocent adolescence. The cinematographer has exploited the moods of viewers with exuberant use of colors. The hilltop dance sequence vividly reminds of ""Singin' in the Rain"", and shall definitely be remembered as a classic in the years to come.<br/><br/>Some realists may find it a tad too frivolous with frills, ribbons and unicorns but dreamers, prepare for a beautiful ride. The best of 2016, period.<br/><br/>P. S. JK Simmons still scares the crap outta me, please keep him away from musical things."

","Believe the hype with La La Land, as this colourful, creative and masterful musical deserves to sweep up at the upcoming Oscar season, just as it has at the Golden Globes.

It's refreshing, stunningly told, visually captivating and heartfelt in its exploration of themes and ideas with two sensational performances at its core.

","An original Hollywood musical shot in Cinemascope and BRIGHT Tehnicolor. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a failed jazz musician and Mia (Emma Stone) s failed actress meet cute and fall in love. It follows their relationship over the course of a year. It all leads to a happy if bittersweet ending that literally had me sobbing in my seat.<br/><br/>The film looks gorgeous, the original score is great and the songs and dances are performed very energetically by the cast. It looks just like a 1950s Hollywood musical right down to the cars and clothes. There's also plenty of references to the old musicals sprinkled throughout. However this just misses the mark of being a great musical for one thing--I didn't really like the two main characters. Sebastian is a bit of a jerk and very arrogant. He's always talking about jazz which gets annoying. Mia is sweet but always seems depressed and dour all the time. I'm not blaming the actors--I blame the script. The acting is great but the characters aren't. I never warmed to them at all. Still all was forgiven during the last 10 minutes which, as I said, had me crying out loud. Also the individual music numbers throughout the picture are GREAT! So it's a VERY good musical that I recommend. Just bring plenty of tissues for the end."
"bilbobrick","10","4","10","19 December 2016"," Best Musical Ever?
","OK, I know. The Sound of Music, The King and I, White Christmas.<br/><br/>I didn't really like any of those. I recognize that they are great, timeless films that many people love, including family members and friends of mine, but if I personally had to pick a least favorite genre of movie, I'd have to go with musical. But, my God, this was great! In fact, it's my second favorite movie of the year after Hacksaw Ridge.<br/><br/>This is a colorful, amazingly directed, beautifully filmed movie that puts the music in musical without hitting you over the head with it. In most musicals, there is a song every five minutes, and I'm sitting there face-palming myself: ""Another one? ALREADY?!"" However, La La Land spaces out its musical acts, so that you appreciate them more when they appear. And, while I wasn't crazy about all of the songs, most of the music in the film is gorgeous. It also has an amazing ending, several moments of comedy, and a generous dose of warmth and feeling, without becoming too sappy. <br/><br/>The only complaints I can come up with are a lack of explanation for a certain plot point (but the filmmakers probably wanted this aspect to be left open to interpretation), and the fact that Gosling and Stone are not professional singers. However, this makes the characters more believable in a way, and you are certainly invited to relate to them.<br/><br/>Much like The Magnificent Seven attempted to resurrect the Western earlier this year, (and I enjoyed that film greatly as well) La La Land set out to bring the musical back from the grave-- and if they can make more that are this good, I say go for it. Once again, these thoughts come from a cinephile that doesn't like musicals. If you're like me, I still highly recommend this film, and if you do like musicals, boy, you're in for a REAL treat. Move over, Hamilton!"
"hannahohnz","10","4","10","13 December 2016"," Old and forgotten done right becomes new and fresh
","""Old and forgotten done right becomes new and fresh""<br/><br/>It's almost surreal to watch Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling sing and tap dance against a picturesque view of LA. Here are two top stars taking on these really challenging roles, singing and tap dancing in a jazz musical. And the outcome is really lovely. In a very old Hollywood kind of way. <br/><br/>""When dream becomes reality and reality becomes a dream"" - sth. along the lines of what Watcha user Î∞±ÏàòÍ≥®Î∞© wrote.<br/><br/>As with Chazelle's previous film Whiplash, the ending was riveting and unexpected. Yes, Mia and Seb both achieve their dreams, but it seems as though the reality each of them gave up becomes their dreams. Dream vs. reality, an endless cycle of given up opportunity costs. However, this is why La La Land can strike a chord with a mass audience - anyone who has dreamed or anyone who has loved will be able to relate to the characters and engage with the story.<br/><br/>WATCH IN THEATRES: There were times during musical sequences or emotional scenes when the audio is completely silent. And in these moments, you can hear the entire audience catching their breath and you are suddenly so aware that you are watching a film at a theatre with a collective audience. It's a really rare traditional film-watching experience.<br/><br/>We are currently in an era of reinterpreting and rebooting old content, there hasn't been much freshness in films for a long time. Film has been around long enough to have explored so many stories and techniques, and film audiences have seen more films than ever that it's hard to come up with something that can leave an impression that lingers for days after watching.<br/><br/>La La Land, however, is different. It not only leaves a lingering impression, but it also gives you a feeling that you're watching something that will be talked about for a long time.<br/><br/>La La Land does take notes from the past. However, rather than rehashing another predictable, well-known story, it has an honest story, which, when combined with the near-obsolete genre of jazz musical, has a lovely effect and is so fresh from what you seem today that it seems strangely, new. This is also attributed to the beautiful use of colour and visuals, smooth, old-style camera-work, unexpected plot/editing, and just the right amount of special effects to make it special.<br/><br/>Note:<br/><br/><ul><li>I love how the film was set in modern times. It was more than trying to be an old Hollywood film by strictly copying how old films were made - special effects are used in some sequences to add to the magic - La La Land was about taking the best parts of great films and moving forward. Although I really enjoyed the black and white silent film The Artist, it would have been even more interesting (though doubly challenging to make) to see the traditional style work in a modern day setting.</li></ul>"
"leeo-mock","9","4","10","8 December 2016"," A brilliant musical and a brilliant film. Best of 2016 so far
","I had watched La La Land at TIFF 2016, and it was a definite highlight of the festival. Having had seen director Damien Chazelle's previous film Whiplash and being utterly blown away by it, I went into La La Land with very high expectations. I'm happy to say, I was far from disappointed. Tonally, La La Land was very different from Whiplash, (one was an intense and dark psychological thriller whereas this was a brilliant, comedic, and emotional romance) but Chazelle's style can still be seen in this film. With two stellar films under his belt, I'm incredibly exited for Chazelle's next project.<br/><br/>Performances from Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone were absolutely astounding. Both of the stars were able to authentically portray such a vast range of emotion as well as deliver great musical performances. The chemistry between the two actors was great. Gosling and Stone were able to believably play off of one another and it made for an entertaining and emotionally engaging relationship to watch unfold. John Legend gave a good performance in his supporting role, although he was outshone by the stars of the film. <br/><br/>The costume and set design were expertly done and well utilized in the story. Where a lesser film may establish character through expository dialogue, Chazelle tells the audience what there is to know about his characters by showing us details like the color of her dress, the dustiness of his apartment, or even the make of his car. The mise-en-scene is employed to establish the tone of the movie. For example, there are multiple comedic scenes in which the comedy is derived from the clash between the costumes and setting. A more dramatic, tragic scene uses the lighting to communicate to us the emotions which the characters are trying to communicate to each other. The lighting would often be used as a way to transport the film from the real world to a more dream-like, surreal, timeless space. In many scenes, the hue of the lighting is used to represent emotion or even to represent a particular character. The use of spotlights was also helpful to establish tone and mood.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning. With a wide variety of beautiful shots, La La Land is able to convey emotion. A simple point-of-view shot can turn a stereo speaker into a symbol of longing or a stained ceiling into a symbol of desperation. The production of some of the shots were impressive, especially during the musical numbers. These scenes employed a variety of long shots, crane shots, and dolly shots. Another example of raw talent to be marveled at.<br/><br/>The editing was good. Chazelle knew when to cut and when not to cut. Cuts were strategically placed for the sake of comedy, similarly, other shots would linger for a decent length to emphasize the drama and tension of the scene.<br/><br/>This entire review can be spent discussing the film's soundtrack. Not only did this film display what is perhaps this decade's greatest soundtrack yet, but the score was so essential to the movie. Whenever placed in the film, the lyrics and tone of the music perfectly compliment the tone and plot. Every single piece of music in this film is so expertly written and fits so superbly within the film. There are plenty of clever double and triple entendres in songs like City of Stars which comment on the plot and the larger themes of the film all at once. The musical performances by Gosling, Stone and John Legend were all out of this world. The soundtrack is the highlight of this film and it will, without a doubt, win La La Land at least one Oscar come February.<br/><br/>The story was simplistic yet admirably written. Unlike many romantic films that will force in some contrived conflict between the two leads in order to push the film into the third act, every plot point in La La Land feels natural and believable. There are a couple of encounters and events towards the beginning of the film that feel a little too coincidental. But as long as you can suspend your disbelief a little, they won't be anything that will ruin the movie. If I had to choose I would say that the plot is the weakest element of this film, if not only because every other aspect was done so perfectly. <br/><br/>La La Land was an amazing, alluring, magnificent, emotional roller-coaster of a film. I am excited to see it again when it opens next week, and to see it win at the Oscars. The opening scene alone is worthy of multiple Oscars so it wouldn't be surprising if this took home best picture. This film is an anthem for all the fools who dream. 9/10. Best film of 2016 so far."

","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who saw it before and said it was okay. The movie seems to want to be both realistic and fantasy-laden as evidenced by the location shots for the former and the more imaginative set designs for the latter. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the leads and they both seem believable enough playing a real-life couple trying to live their dreams and also to please each other but it seems they can't do both. The original songs are pretty entertaining and their voices are, well, serviceable for their characters. Part of me did wonder if the praise was worth it but by the end, it brought a smile to me face even if the ending was not a ""happily ever after"" one. So that's a recommendation for La La Land. Oh, and glad it just got 14 Oscar nominations!"
"LaLaLandSucks","1","6","18","30 April 2017"," Another Copycat Film by Hackzelle
","This film rips off from multiple films without ever getting remake rights: Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Young Girls of Rochefort, Moulin Rouge, An American in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, Tophat, Funny Faces, and many more. This is an atrocious work that I do not even consider art. I'll admit, it is entertaining and a decent copycat, but a copycat can never ever receive full credit. It instantly gets a 0/10 for being a dishonest and slimy piece of work. The plot goes like this: it is broken into four stages of time just like Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The girl and guy gets together, they go on dates, they end up having a conflict that separates them, and in the end they break apart. It goes over a two year time span to many years later where they meet again. It ends with a bitter sweet ending just like Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Mia gets pregnant like Genevieve. It's act to act, all structured, a complete copycat of Umbrellas of Cherbourg. This would be okay IF CHAZELLE BOUGHT THE RIGHTS, but there is no proof that he did. It's an embarrassing attempt at remaking with mediocre everything. Even I hated the smooth and standard cinematography. It rips off the visuals from Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The worst thing is, it rips off from 5 other films and then tries to paint it self as an original musical on the market. Such a shady director, he should be sued and imprisoned. I am boycotting anything Chazelle makes. An undeserving, non-talented director who is incapable of being creative.<br/><br/>A FAT 0/10."

"jawad_tahir","10","3","7","30 September 2017"," One of those eternal movies
","La la land questions our definition of happiness and fulfillment. At the end, did he look happy on stage? Did she? While both thought that becoming a famous actress or a jazz bar owner were their life's purpose, was it worth it when they lost each other in the process? In the dream sequence, he wished he had just kissed her when she approached. He wished he had never taken his eyes off her when offered the band. He realized that his true fulfillment was to come through true love. Had he stayed true to his art and classical jazz, he still could have pursued his dream in Paris and even make enough to build his dream bar one-day (say.. the same five year it took him). <br/><br/>When she pushes him to pursue his dream rather than mess about with people he does not like and music that does not mean anything to him, he questions her motive. Attributing her endeavor to keep him true to his path, to something so demeaning as jealously was the gross mistake and caused an irreparable crack in their relationship. If nothing else, than at least in her image of him. <br/><br/>Dr Victor E. Frankl once wrote that our search for meaning comes through 3 things. Work, love and strength in the face of adversity. The writer wants to drive home the point that nothing should ever prevail over true love because even when you will have everything you desired, you will look across at each other and long, and think.. What if"
"bobhopesoap","9","3","7","25 September 2017"," great movie
","La La Land is a very good film. There is a number of film techniques that are used to create an overall great movie. An important aspect of the film is the set design, with vibrant bright colors, it contributes to the classical film noir. With the great cinematography and an array of shoots including close ups and establishing shots we can see how the set design contributes to the expressionistic aspect of this classically composed film. The cinematography is great especially with each scene having a different feel from the large portfolio of almost every imaginable film technique used. Another important aspect of the film is the melodrama between protagonists. The intense emotions can really appeal to the viewer and have a significant impact. With reference to many ""golden age"" films we can see a modern interpretation of a classical film. The production design is a very important aspect of the film with color being an important symbol and how it symbolizes the intense emotions thought the film la la land definitely deserved the award for production design. With both realistic and expressionistic story telling the film appeals greatly to almost every viewer. Lastly the staging and progression of the film is important. The way the space is used greatly helps the meaning of the film. The way each idea is built off each other and the film smoothly progresses the film to build up to a extremely dramatic ending that leaves the viewer very satisfied."

However the end is where the film, throws us back into reality as we are shocked by the plot twist ending where they don't end up together. The ending reminds us of what reality is really like, not everything can be as perfect as it is made out to be in the movies.

","Bad music, bad lyrics, horrible acting, poor direction, dismal writing. There is not one good thing I can say about this dismal disaster, other than the writer/director should be banned from ever making another film for all time. Not only is the acting horrendous, but the singing is non-existent. And I speak as a gay man who loves a good musical and has appeared on stage professionally in quite a few. It really shows the dismal state of Hollyweed that this would ever even have been nominated for any awards. But then that is what it has come to. Even the good musicals have been destroyed by making them into films (i.e.Sweeney Todd, Chicago, ad nauseum). The art of the musical is now officially dead, and the participants here have killed it forever."
"beladornon2","3","3","7","6 May 2017"," Huge waste of talent and money
","Set in a perpetually sunny and warm Los Angeles, LA LA LAND offers the spectacle of two wannabes longing for success and originality. Director/writer Damien Chazelle has deliberately cast his film with stars who can't sing or dance, and, in Gosling's case, can't act, to explore the parallels between jazz and film stardom, without gaining any particular insights along the way. As far as its credentials as a musical go, MOULIN ROUGE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK, and ""Once More With Feeling"" from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER are all vastly superior fore-runners in the categories of music and writing; where this film excels and wins the race is in its soaring camera work and flawless combination of live action and CGI. I really couldn't tell, even on the big screen, what was real and what was fake. Chazelle wastes absolutely no time developing characters, backstory, or actual relationship building as he delves into the usual dynamics of boy-meets-girl. The innovation comes when he rewinds the film and shows the same story from the other perspective. This is hardly new, but it's beautifully and excitingly done. Gosling may be past his prime, but he's still semi-attractive, while Emma Stone is a revelation as a woman battling insecurity in a looks-based business that creates insecurity by its very nature. As long as the characters are struggling for success by trying to imitate their role models, they flounder. It's only when they strive for authenticity that their lives take off, and the resolution of the film doesn't shy away from the inevitable consequences of success, either. Go, but be prepared to hate the jazz, which is deliberately unappealing and ugly."
"cosmo_tiger","8","3","7","1 May 2017"," I went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is
","""City of stars are you shining just for me?"" Mia (Stone) is an aspiring and struggling actress who spends her time in between auditions working as a barista. When she walks into a restaurant and hears Sebastian (Gosling) playing piano the lives of both become entwined. Now, both are struggling to make their dreams come true while at the same time supporting each other, but somethings don't go as smooth as you hope. This is a movie that had everything going against it for me. I was not in the mood to watch it, I usually don't like movies that have this much hype behind it and I was expecting wall to wall singing and dancing and sat down expecting to be bored and uninterested. I'm not sure if it was those expectations or not but I ended up liking this much more than I expected to. In case you're scared, the movie is not wall to wall singing at all and is like Chicago in the way that the musical numbers are large and full out, but placed sporadically and in ways that actually make sense (after the opening). This is not a movie that will convert non-musical fans into theater lovers, but at the same time it won't offend those that hate them either. This is a movie where I can see why it won the awards and Emma Stone did do a tremendous job in this very intense part. Overall, much better than I was expecting, I went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is. I surprisingly give this a B+."

","I expected more from a movie that received such high acclaim. I enjoyed it but I didn't love it like I had been set up to think I would. My biggest problem is that I wanted more depth from the story, but I don't know what I was expecting from a movie called ""La La Land"". It's as romantic and whimsical as the title suggests. <br/><br/>I suppose as someone who isn't much of a romantic I maybe wasn't the intended audience for this movie. I can't truly appreciate the nostalgic feeling for old Hollywood, and ultimately the movie is probably amazing for a very niche group and just OK for most everyone else. I wasn't wowed by the music or the production design, which are the aspects I was most looking forward to. I felt that it was stylistically inconsistent and I kept being pulled out of the movie to analyze the design decisions, especially in terms of the set and costumes. <br/><br/>Overall I do think it is a great film, it just didn't quite meet my expectations."

"JohnMalick24","9","3","7","20 January 2017"," A well-crafted and shot ode to musicals of the former era that manages to take a similar story and turn it into something grand.
","With La La Land, director Damien Chazelle proves with this and his 2014 effort Whiplash he's a talented and ingenious film maker at a young age, and female lead Emma Stone dazzles us with her shining, glistening aura throughout, although un-nuanced writing and a poorly paced middle section weigh down the film from ""masterpiece"" to only a truly great movie.<br/><br/>La La Land contains moments and scenes where you just can't help but marvel at the absolute luxury that film goers have in watching films of this caliber. Utilising widescreen CinemaScope (tsk tsk), the stunning cinematography and effectiveness of shots can render many an observer to an incapacitated mess on a floor drenched in drool. There is not one whiff of over-exaggeration in that statement. The cinematography is a clear bonus to this film.<br/><br/>In addition, the musical numbers are excellent and wholly nostalgic and whimsical. Although singing from the two leads does leave some more training to be desired. The thrilling ""Another Day of Sun"" number at the start features a singing/dancing show for our pleasure, and this one set-piece will go down as one of the great moments in recent musical history. But the best (and possibly most prominent song) in the film is the quiet and introspective ""City of Stars"" which features the lead Ryan Gosling as its performer. The song simply oozes classic Hollywood, and is a great addition to the fantastic sound heard throughout the film.<br/><br/>Performances are satisfactory at worst (particularly from male-lead Gosling) and truthfully, it is the star-power of Emma Stone that carries this film. As Mia, she carries a bubbly, sun-shining effervescence that allows viewers to fall completely in love with this character. With her eyes alone, we can learn much about who she is as a character. More so than many other aspects of this film, she keeps us interested, and we want to see her arc come to a solid and happy conclusion. Gosling. although willing to show restraint in his acting, much like his co-star, cannot elevate himself to the level of Stone (though that isn't a criticism on his part, since he was great as a struggling Jazz pianist Sebastian. He just wasn't able to compete with Emma's Oscar-worthy performance).<br/><br/>In terms of direction, Chazelle proves he's only gotten better since directing his 2014 Jazz masterpiece Whiplash. However, his writing leaves more to be desired. The two leads manage to make use of Chazelle's lazy writing and turn their characters into fully realized and 3 dimensional people, luckily for Chazelle. Furthermore, the middle section, as some others have pointed out, feels rushed and not comparable to the start and end of the film. I myself, completely agree. Although we get to see the chemistry between the two leads on full display, we don't see anything matching the vibrant musical introduction to Los Angeles, or the simultaneously triumphant/sad although magnificent conclusion to Mia and Sebastian's story.<br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't be surprised if this film earns that Best Picture Oscar and I wouldn't mind one bit. It is a fantastic film, featuring great direction, an astonishing female lead performance from Emma Stone, wonderful cinematography, amazing music and musical numbers and is an original take on a long historic genre of film."

Actually the first scene is more than enough and is a great ""opening"" that is as impressive as the many other visual scenes that would follow. And between all the music, the swift and sophisticated moves, the tap dancing, the colors, the smiles and the stages, you end up noticing the moments of silence, the moments of truth..this tiny instant between two records, or notes when everything seems to be some kind of a distant vision, a ""trip"" to a future that could have been but that won't necessarily happen..One vision out of many others, one possibility out of a multitude; Never going with one perspective but covering all of them..Hers, His..and theirs together.

He definitely deserves an academy award nomination at least this year.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone were so so blended and I really loved them. Emma stone was dramatically better than Gosling and did much better but overall they were both great. If they will get any nomination, I think only Emma Stone deserves it.<br/><br/>I hoped J.K.

","La La Land is one of the most different and entertaining movies of recent times I have ever seen. The acting and the melodious musical numbers mesmerized me. The colorful setting and dresses also add to the cinematic flair. <br/><br/>The story is about two aspiring people with dreams of what they want to become, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone). Sebastian is an exceptional jazz pianist who wants to revive jazz with his own jazz club which he dreams to make and Mia dreams to be an exceptional actress. The two meet under random circumstances, somewhat rudely. Drawn together by their aspiration to do what they love, they fall for each other. However, their dreams conflict with their love for each other. Ryan Gosling excellently expresses his love for jazz and Mia. He enacts the piano playing part exceptionally well and it really looks like he is a gifted jazz pianist. Emma Stone is a show stealer as Mia with her expressive eyes, aspirations and acting skills, especially during the scenes where her character auditions and her chemistry with Ryan Gosling is amazing. John Legend, as Keith, utilizes his short on-screen time well, portraying a man with a different taste in jazz which Sebastian doesn't like, and he happens to be a good friend in need.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle's direction keeps the movie flowing from one beautiful musical number to the next. Mandy Moore's exceptional choreography charms us, particularly in ""A Lovely Night,"" which was done in one-shot on a hilltop on Sunset, and includes amazing dancing from the main actors. My favorite scene is the scene in the planetarium with creative visuals such as Sebastian and Mia flying in the sky, dancing. Sebastian and Mia's dresses in the movie are spectacular and some of the best I have seen in a movie. The film is also shot in cinemascope which gives it the vibe of many golden Hollywood musicals.<br/><br/>The movie has a positive message about Mia and Sebastian never giving up their dreams. Despite multiple failures, Mia still pursues her dreams about being an actress and the same with Sebastian about starting a jazz club. I give this movie 5, out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18. The only inappropriate thing about the movie is some of the language, but that is infrequent. This is a movie which everyone will enjoy. This film opens in theaters on December 25, 2016, so go and check it out for a unique musical unlike any other.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST!

","Great experience even for a non-musical lover. I've don't remember a time walking out of a theater and being so convinced that a movie was going to rack up some Oscars. Some parts were certainly cheesy and predictable but that's half of what makes musicals fun. I'm torn about the ending. On one hand, I love they kept it simple with the soft smile and eye contact but on the other hand, the hopeless romantic in me would love to have seen them work things out. Also, being in the middle of trying to figure out what I want to do with my life the ending really hit home for me. To me, it exemplified all the 'what could have been' scenarios. <br/><br/>Hats off to Chazelle and Gosling though. Phenomenal first attempt at a musical by Chazelle and I'm developing quite the man-crush on Gosling this year between this and The Nice Guys. Incredible how quickly he learned the piano and how to dance.<br/><br/>Also, I imagine the cinematography won't get much attention but it was fantastic. Great job of paralleling Mia and Sebastian's relationship (shots together in middle of the movie and single shots during fights)."

One of the most elegant, delicious, captivating movies of all time is waiting for you to be seen.<br/><br/>When I first heard that a new picture of Chazelle coming, I was expecting something great because he put the slat very top with Whiplash. But this was far above my expectations. Color dancing scenes, penetrative acting by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, not even necessary to mention about it's entrancing soundtrack (I have been listening it's album for 2 days and all the movie comes in front of my eyes again) and maybe the most important of all for me is that it includes Jazz. Chazelle used a bit of everything, an amazing balance of drama,comedy and music without overdoing anything so that you just find yourself somewhere between happiness and sadness but if there is anything definite, you feel it very intense when you left the cinema. <br/><br/>And Damien Chazelle of course. He had already won my admiration with Whiplash (which is the best movie for me in 2014) but after La La Land, (which is the best picture of the year for me again) my admiration has even more increased for him. If he doesn't break his line, he might be one of the greatest directors of all time in the future. <br/><br/>In short, don't miss it!"
"aygocrazy","Null","3","7","30 December 2016"," anti-Chinese sentiments in a movie that could be good
","The movie itself isn't bad. It could be a good movie. What strikes me is the anti-Chinese sentiments that is repeatedly expressed in this movie. The French-Anglo director Damien Chazelle is obviously racist against the Chinese.<br/><br/>First, he made Ryan Gosling tell the audience that nobody would ever want Chinese coffee. Later on, Emma Stone's boyfriend who's supposed to portray a real jerk, shows that he does business with Chinese people. He also tells that the Chinese is building a bridge (which is controversial) as a hidden political message to the movie viewer.<br/><br/>This Frenchman obviously has a lot of hidden anti-Chinese frustration and tries to use La La Land as racist anti-Chinese propaganda for his own hidden political racist views against ethnic Chinese people.<br/><br/>The movie's story itself wasn't bad and it was quite well executed but ruined by the butt-hurt personal political frustration of this racist French-Anglo director/writer, Damien Chazelle. It's no wonder that an Asian Man-White woman couple is the only couple that has been banned from showing in this movie.<br/><br/>If the movie wasn't politically motivated, I would give it a higher score."

","Just saw La La Land and I think this is probably my favorite movie of 2016.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Damien Chazelle (who also directed 2014's Whiplash), follows the story of two artists, a musician named Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling) and an actress named Mia (played by Emma Stone), who fall for each other and have to figure out not only what they want to do with their careers, but also with their lives. <br/><br/>After the movie was completed, I was in awe of what I have just saw. The film was a beautiful tribute to ""Old Hollywood"" and the films produced then. It also manages to present some interesting social commentary about the state of the film industry as well as the reality of someone working in that industry. <br/><br/>The cast was great. Gosling and Stone had great chemistry. They truly felt like a real couple and both performances felt genuine and real. The musical numbers were also amazing. I'm definitely looking up the soundtrack on Spotify. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren was also amazing. His work felt colorful and vibrant. Chazelle's direction as well as writing was great and never manage to hold back. <br/><br/>¬ïOverall Thoughts: <br/><br/>From the script to the acting to the cinematography and musical numbers to the direction, La La Land is a complete tribute to ""Old Hollywood"" and manages to both honor the legacy of that era while also managing to tell a heartfelt story about two artists falling in love in the City of Dreams. This is a fantastic movie and quite possibly, my favorite movie of 2016. I highly recommend seeing this movie during the holiday season. It's worth your time and money. <br/><br/>As they say in showbiz sometimes, ""They don't make them like they used to."""

","Fantastic movie. It's about a jazz pianist (gosling) and aspiring actress (stone) who meet and fall in love in LA while pursuing their dreams. Nothing really new story-wise, and I think we're all familiar with the trope of people painstakingly following their dreams in a metropolis and overcoming obstacles along the way.<br/><br/>That said, I found this movie absolutely mesmerizing. Won't comment much on the musicality since I don't watch many musicals, but the songs are catchy and Gosling/Stone sing well. As anyone who's seen Crazy Stupid Love knows, these two have really good chemistry, and this movie definitely benefits from two great characters who are charming and endearing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is gorgeous, the choreography and set pieces are great, the acting is sincere, pretty much everything about this movie is well executed.

"Red_Identity","Null","3","7","22 December 2016"," Charming and, yes, magical
","Oh yeah, the backlash is going to be huge with this one. Especially when it's up against more ""important"" films like Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea. I definitely had problems with the film. I found its main themes and conflicts to be quite unoriginal. I also thought the screenplay at times didn't know where to go and was only really at its strength when it was building moments and scenarios for the songs. In that respect the film isn't unlike Whiplash, which also had a screenplay that was its biggest weakness. Unlike that film though, I think the screenplay is definitely more than adequate enough for building this world around the characters. I can imagine many people taking heat for preferring this film over many of the other Oscar contenders. I can see criticisms of it being too ""basic"" and too ""simple"". On a pure filmmaking level, the film is gorgeous and so brilliantly-made, but I also think the two leads do a great job of building that emotional connection. Is the film complex? Not particularly, and that's going to be part of the backlash. Does it need to be? Not really, no. Only because it isn't complex doesn't mean that it's not a film worthy of praise for everything it accomplishes. I think it's easy to look past how utterly charming and magical it honestly is. I definitely had problems with it throughout but it wasn't until the last several minutes where all of my problems sort of dissipated, concluding in the final minute that made me more emotional than all other films I've seen this year aside from Moonlight's final scenes. It was at this moment where I realized how much I enjoyed it and how much of a connection I formed with the characters. I feel because of this, because it's not about particularly thought-provoking or cerebral themes and because it basically succeeds or fails on one's own personal experience watching it (all films do, but many of them don't highlight the personal subjectivity as much as this one) it's going to receive a lot of backlash. But what the film did make me appreciate and realize more is that we shouldn't take the little moments, specific moments in our everyday lives, for granted. No other film this year has taught me to become more mindful of the moment and to enjoy the present. In that respect, it's escapism at its most effective. For that the film should be celebrated and for that I deeply admire what it did. Is it my favorite film of the year? No. Will I be as enamored with it in the future? Perhaps not as much as now. But what an experience it surely was. But now having said all of that, do I think it's a particularly ""great"" film? Not really sure.<br/><br/>To now more specifically talk about the performances... Emma Stone is just an incredibly charismatic and charming actress. It's not a very dramatic role, but it doesn't need to be. I definitely do have a hard time seeing her win the Oscar though. Ryan Gosling is good and also has some of the same charm, but he suffers here from what I believe he has suffered in many of his films the last few years. He has a certain ""too cool for school"" persona that gets infused into all of his performances. It works for certain roles (like Drive) but I honestly can't help but feel what another actor could have brought to the table. I think he's at his best playing alongside Stone, but his individual performance? Not really sure it should be up for any award nominations personally."

"sato060483","9","3","7","20 December 2016"," Enthralling
","""It's so surreal!"" is the sentiment of my cross-dimensional trip to La La Land. Throughout the journey, my modes of transport constantly switch from land to air without a prior notice as the jazz was blaring and songs were impeccably cutting in. It was a ride like no other, shifting elegantly from reality to dreams and evoking the nostalgia of Singin' in the Rain. The transition is just so perfect that you'd adore how fantasy was woven into life to the point which you might have to scream your lungs out, ""goddamn it! this is too beautiful for me to handle.""<br/><br/>I would've literally screamed when the movie was about to start because some people around my seat were talking and commenting like they were some god-like movie experts whom everybody else was eager to seek opinions from. Shut up you insensitive self-centered conversationalists. Thankfully the scene jingled instantly and riveted me from all nuisances. I thought I knew what kind of movie I was expecting when the drivers stomped out of their vehicles, hopped on the roofs and performed an upbeat song in the middle of traffic. My feet were tapping on their own accord and I couldn't wait to see the main characters singing out their stories. But unlike other movies in which the characters express feelings in a fabulous way. The song halted and everyone just returned to their cars like nothing had occurred. The musical intention unfolded itself. The songs don't tell the story. They are the story.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother you with the plot because I think everyone should approach this movie without a clue. Trust me. The story is so simple that you may not give it a second thought. But the way the mastermind behind Whiplash told it is enthralling. One of my most favorite scenes is when Mia came to her movie audition and was asked to improvise a story. The transition of lights and speech to music was so good that you'll resent me if I provide more detail (and I won't). ""Here's to the ones who dream"", sang Mia. I feel that it was more of a message for those who don't. ""So bring on the rebels / The roles from pebbles / The painters, and poets, and plays"". It was like a protest to confront a materialistic society to not give up on dreamers, their hope, and imaginative contributions. That was the whole point of La La Land. Follow your dreams and don't care what others think. The concept is old. But I'm glad people like Damien Chazelle still believe in it and encourage everybody else to bravely pursue the path of ""the fools"".<br/><br/>The ending is either wonderful or sad or wonderfully sad or sadly wonderful depending on your own perspective. It brings back to my mind the memories of the Casablanca, especially the play-it-Sam moment and that unforgettable ending in which Ilsa had to choose between getting in the plane with Victor Lazslo or staying with Rick Blaine. I just simply can't put my thoughts into words when the last shot of La La Land faded."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","7","19 December 2016"," Chazelle makes a statement with this contemporary love story told as an old movie musical
","Classical cinema sensibilities collide with 21st century realities in Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land."" The ""Whiplash"" filmmaker follows up that highly acclaimed effort with its tonal opposite, a breezy, colorful romance wrapped in original songs and musical numbers. <br/><br/>While something feels contradictory about combining a contemporary independent comedy with an old Hollywood movie musical, Chazelle blends the two with visual ingenuity and strives for the utmost artistic integrity. The result is a wholly unique albeit strangely familiar movie-going experience.<br/><br/>The 31-year-old Chazelle has made a couple things clear in his short but noteworthy career thus far: he really loves movie musicals and he really really loves jazz. Jazz music has played an integral role in all three of his features, and two of his films have featured original song performances. ""La La Land"" follows aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone) who keeps having fated encounters with jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) until their Hollywood-based romance blooms and they challenge each other to pursue their dreams in new ways.<br/><br/>The film goes heavy on the music early on, as if to announce itself as a full on musical. It opens with a rousing number during gridlock traffic on the LA freeway (""Another Day of Sun"") intended to look like a single take full of sweeping camera movements, bright colors and diverse faces. Not long after, we see Mia musically preparing for a night out with her roommates (""Someone in the Crowd"") in stereotypical fashion, a number that ends in a choreographed pool party sequence. Yet these are two of the five original songs in the entire film. In other words, Chazelle didn't start his film that way just to be cute.<br/><br/>Once Mia and Sebastian finally connect on a sunset stroll that results in tap-dancing (""A Lovely Night""), the musical numbers slow down and what few new songs remain are of the soul-searching, introspective variety. Chazelle organizes the film in seasons, and the tone changes as we go from winter to spring to summer to fall. So while he begins the film in a showy way, creating an idyllic portrait of Hollywood and romance, the story slowly accumulates more depth and we see the characters, their relationship and their struggles more clearly.<br/><br/>Stone and Gosling's on-screen chemistry has already been proved twice before (""Crazy Stupid Love,"" ""Gangster Squad"") and that makes Chazelle's job much easier. Having movie musical chemistry and screen presence is a whole other beast, however, and in this regard, Stone really steals the show. Gosling looks unbelievably sharp and he clearly devoted a lot of time to his piano skills in preparation for his role, but he's more cool than charming, almost too cool. Perhaps that's by design, but Stone has the singing starlet aura. She's effortless to watch and love, qualities that Gosling has but not to the same degree and not in a way that's utterly transporting.<br/><br/>Both actors, however, provide exactly what ""La La Land"" needs in terms of being a contemporary comedy. Both have excellent comedic credentials and dramatic chops; their performances embody the fine line between playful humor and emotional honesty that reflects how Millennials see themselves in the world, and lest we forget amidst all the old-timey flair in this film that Chazelle brings a Millennial perspective to the director's chair.<br/><br/>Part of that perspective is that movies like these ‚Äî especially musicals ‚Äî are far too rosy. They create unrealistic expectations; those of us who grew up with this art and internalized its fantasies as truths or ideal to strive for have felt burned. This is a particularly common theme among contemporary films and TV shows, but Chazelle is really the first to address it from a place of deep love and intimate knowledge of the genre. To satirize and provide effective commentary on a genre, you kinda need to master it in its most classical form, and Chazelle demonstrates impeccable skill in this regard.<br/><br/>We already knew from ""Whiplash"" that Chazelle could film people playing music in an electrifying way (he's sure to make the world's best music documentary someday), but the way he's able to break out of the two-dimensional viewpoint that most musical directors (even movie musical directors) fall prey to and craft visually compelling musical numbers warrants all the awards attention he's already getting for this film.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" isn't emotionally sweeping like most people want from a romantic musical, but its honest message and craftsmanship elevate it from an interesting experiment of blending old school with new school into a powerful reminder of what it really means to love and what it really means to dream big.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"JMCReelReviews","10","5","15","10 January 2017"," One of the most enthralling, magical and enjoyable pieces of cinematic escapism and entertainment in years.
","A record breaking haul at this year's Golden Globes awards gives some indication as to just how special a film La La Land is. With 7 deserved awards including Best Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Score, and Best Actor gongs for both its lead stars, this has proved to be a powerhouse of cinema which will be remembered for some time.<br/><br/>Directed by Damien Chazelle following up on the excellent and critically acclaimed Whiplash, La La Land sees Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone deliver performances reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in this hugely entertaining love letter to the golden age of Hollywood and traditional Jazz music.<br/><br/>A comedy, romance, drama and musical all encompassed into one sublime production, we follow Jazz musician Sebastian (Gosling) and aspiring actress Mia (Stone) as they seek to follow their dreams, and head down the road of self discovery and sacrifice. Having previously worked together on the brilliant Crazy, Stupid, Love (and not-so-brilliant Gangster Squad), the chemistry between the leads is palpable as they embark on a blossoming romance and enable each other to pursue their own ambitions.<br/><br/>This idea of following one's dream encapsulates the very essence of the movie and it is a theme enhanced by the majestic, fantastical and dream-like world which Chazelle has created for his protagonists; a beautifully crafted stage on which possibilities are endless if you persevere. Indeed, this Hollywood that Chazelle portrays is encased in a sense of nostalgia and romance for the lost magic of what music and movies were all about; art forms within which anything can happen and anything can be created. Such is the nostalgia here, Chazelle even filmed La La Land in wide-screen Cinema Scope as a deliberate homage to the style and feel of the movies from the 50s and earlier. There are references to this bygone age, too, with Mia discussing how she grew up watching classics like Casablanca and Bringing Up Baby. She even works at Warner Brother Studios where parts of the film take place and classic sets from vintage movies are seen. Sebastian, meanwhile, complains that ""Jazz is dying"" in a plea for this particular art to be saved yet struggles to make it relevant for a modern audience. He is asked, ""how can you be a revolutionary when you are such a traditionalist?"" and it is a question which was perhaps considered by Chazelle when creating this homage to a mainstream audience.<br/><br/>This vintage style is evident throughout the film and especially in the sporadic musical sequences in which Gosling and Stone were mesmerising as they performed their dance routines and songs with hugely impressive assurance and skill. Whereas Gosling's singing voice is perhaps on the weaker side, his delivery was perfectly befitting of the character he portrays, whilst Stone was utterly captivating in all of her routines, but particularly during her solo towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Both Sebastian and Mia are such likable characters who complement each other so well that they add a huge element of charm to an already uplifting premise. It's near impossible not to root for the both of them and support them as they pursue their dreams, and as such it's heartbreaking when we witness the sacrifices they have to make in order to do so. It is here the dramatic element comes into play, ensuring La La Land never becomes too saccharine or twee. It could have been easy for Chazelle to get lost in a world of fantasy and endless opportunity but he reigns in the nostalgia and the sentiment by bringing his characters back down to earth and reminds us that following one's dream is not easy nor simple, but that it takes hard work, perseverance, compromise and of course, sacrifice. Credit is therefore heaped further on Gosling and Stone who put Sebastian and Mia through a roller-coaster of emotions throughout, as they celebrate their successes, feel humiliated at their failures, and laugh and cry together. Perhaps the most heartening aspect of all is the way in which they support and encourage each other and refuse to let each other ever give up on their dreams; it's a hugely inspiring notion.<br/><br/>Complimenting this degree of restraint which Chazelle imposes on his protagonists, both Gosling and Stone deliver perfectly pitched and understated performances which also serve to enhance the sheer scale and scope of not just the musical sequences, but the production as a whole. This is perhaps epitomised by the very opening sequence; a single-take shot of an entire freeway traffic jam breaking out into a fanfare of song and dance which sets the standard for the rest of the film; catchy music, sublime choreography, and the panning out of the freeway in order to fit in the vast Los Angeles landscape hints at the grandiose nature of the production.<br/><br/>The music that is played throughout is not to be ignored. Justin Hurwitz had teamed up with Chazelle on Whiplash and returns here with a score and soundtrack that brings La La Land to life. For a musical, there are not actually that many song and dance routines, but music as a medium is a pivotal and consistent theme here and one that Chazelle ensures is not lost amongst the Hollywood nostalgia. The choreography also deserves a mention for enabling some truly memorable scenes, none more-so than Sebastian and Mia's first dance together in a setting which truly embodies the library of classics which Chazelle is paying tribute to.<br/><br/>Perfect performances (including solid support from the likes of J.K. Simmons and John Legend), fantastic routines and wonderful music all combine to tell a relatable message delivered by superbly written characters, which serves to make La La Land one of the most enthralling, magical and enjoyable pieces of cinematic escapism and entertainment in years.<br/><br/>For further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"

","Damn! this movie is my favorite movie of all time. It's really powerful, right from the start. Most people rated his movie low because they thought that the movie had an average story, but they did't realize that La la land is highest of the 'average' kind. It was worth my time and is re watchable. The movie also has a lot of symbolism in it, and they songs are absolutely BRILLIANT (especially City of Stars and Another Day of Sun)! Guys I would definitely recommend watching this movie."
"mariaemma16","10","4","11","7 March 2017"," Emma Stone's Year
","First, I wanna say it's a different movie from the others who were competing in the Golden Globes, Academy Awards, etc. It mixes comedy, drama, musical. Emma Stone did well with her role. This is her year. Her chemistry with Ryan Gosling was demonstrated in the movie. This movie was also different because it didn't have a happy ending."
"darioilg","9","4","11","17 February 2017"," Blending classic and modern musical is possible
","""La La Land"" is nominated for a record-tying 14 categories (obviously including Best Picture) at the 2017 Oscars and it would definitely deserve the win if so. Damien Chazelle is an incredibly talented young director, with both his feature films nominated and both being the greatest achievements in musical films of the 2010s.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is both a love statement to the classic Hollywood musicals and a bold new direction for the genre, that never looked more done for if not for Chazelle. Sebastian and Mia both have dreams of glory and both of them are talented artists: she's a wannabe actress and he's a wannabe jazz player. For two thirds of the movie we're fooled into thinking that nothing will divert from the canon except (more or less) the setting. But little by little an attentive observer notices how intelligent the plot structure really is: the ending feels extremely sour on one hand, and yet happy on the other, which is perfectly represented with those last, beautiful smiles. Some may not like it, but a story like this manages to cover both the dreamlike state of musical characters and the new, more grounded conscience of modern filmmakers, that never touched the musical romance before.<br/><br/>""LLL"" has a lot in common with ""Whiplash"" under a directorial point of view, and yet it manages to stand on its own quite well. They share a love for grand-angular shots and bold camera movements, but LLL stands out with its incredible long takes coordinated with the musical pieces. On that account, LLL stands out once more. Its all-original musics feel modern and classic at the same time and they are sided with fantastic dance choreographies (although sometimes the leads don't seem to dance perfectly, they're still actors, not professional dancers). Chazelle plays to the limit with chromatic effects throughout the movie: the colors on the scene are generally extremely bright and his use of the lens generates strange optic effects of dots of light on the side of some frames.<br/><br/>Stone and Gosling's performances are a true tour de force: they act brilliantly, sing lovingly and dance like they worked in Broadway all year long. As I said, the dance sections are not without imperfections, but to think what these two went through to accomplish this is simply amazing. Stone's performance is particularly noteworthy as she acts like she can't act very well, but not even that badly during her auditions, which is something any actor would want to do that well. Gosling unexpectedly shines more in the musical pieces, solidifying himself as a multifaceted talent.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is definitely one of the Movies of the Year 2016 as it renews a dying genre with vigor, talent and new spirit."
"steerpike_2002","9","4","11","25 January 2017"," Likable, original movie that shouldn't be tied to one genre
","Where to start with a review of the most talked-about movie of the moment? Well, how about with what it is not? Watching 'La La Land' last night I fairly quickly decided that the film was not what the majority of critics had labelled it, a homage piece to 1950s musicals. With the exception of one or two of the opening scenes, the film lacks the giant sound stage atmosphere of a studio musical and is instead rooted much more firmly in the LA of today. It is perhaps better described as romance first, love letter to LA and jazz second, and homage to studio movies in general (rather than just the musical variety) third. Indeed the film's many references, both in dialogue and style, to 'Casablanca' signpost this wider homage.<br/><br/>That jazz features so prominently once again in Damien Chazelle's third movie is unsurprising after the success of 'Whiplash' - it will be more of a shock if it is a centrepiece of his next movie, Neil Armstrong biopic 'First Man', which may give us a better impression of whether he is capable of diversity as well as quality. The direction in 'La La Land' is very solid and gives the impression of a writer/director who knows exactly how he wants his movie to unfold. The pace of the movie is very easy and relaxing and I found myself enjoying each moment without concentrating on what might be coming next, an all too rare experience and one of the most likable aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the only real negatives of the film for me was the freedom given to cinematographer Linus Sandgren, of 'American Hustle' and 'Joy' fame, whose camera work was ostentatious at times and distracted from the more grounded feel that Chazelle and lead actors Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling brought to the film.<br/><br/>Centred as it is on the romance between the leads, the movie simply wouldn't work without the excellent performances of Stone and Gosling. Stone uses her expressiveness with great subtlety, steering the film equally well through moments of emotional drama and romantic fantasy. Gosling will be credited most for his musical talent which is coupled with the effortless, pensive charm that has become his trademark. I have read criticism of their singing and dancing but feel that this is misplaced. Were the film the musical in the Gene Kelly style that many critics have dubbed it, this might be a relevant criticism. However, the film that I saw suited the slightly understated musical performances, which complemented its relaxed, grounded feel.<br/><br/>My final thoughts are on the overall theme of the movie. For a romantic fantasy the movie is surprisingly thought-provoking and presents a nuanced stance on the conflicts between love and success which felt accessible despite its Hollywood glamour. The achievement of this balance between fantasy and realism owes a great deal to Chazelle's witty-yet-believable dialogue and the performances of the two leads.<br/><br/>Approach this movie without the desire to shoe-horn it into one genre or another and I think you will be pleased by how many sizes it fits!"
"patsworld","9","4","11","11 January 2017"," I Can See Why This Won So Many Awards
","I loved this movie. This is not a spoiler but it didn't quite have the happy ending I would have liked. However that didn't change my liking of this film. Gosling and Stone were wonderful. Had absolutely no idea Gosling was such a fantastic pianist. But he most certainly is. A natural. And the music from this movie is wonderful. When you come out of the theater humming the music, it's good. And I did. Here's the thing- instead of the raunchy movies with nothing but foul language in place of real dialogue - why isn't Hollywood making more musicals? It's obvious the public loves them. That we will gladly spend money to see them over and over- and happily buy them when they come out in DVD form. We need more lovely movies like this!"
"needhamdave","10","4","11","10 January 2017"," Unbridled joy and passion
","When a movie starts winning awards, all the awards in this case at the Golden Globes, we often want to know what the message is behind the movie. When a film is up for seven of the most prestigious Golden Globe awards including best picture and screenplay, and it wins every one of them, then it certainly must be a movie with a message. I really liked the film. I was invested in the characters. I liked them, I cared what happened to them. I recommend the film and I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it in the spirit, or under the spell if you will, of the purpose of the movie. If you do I believe you will enjoy it all the more. After the Golden Globes the news of the night seemed to be Meryl Streep's rebuking remarks and whether or not they were justified. For me, however, the focus of the night was on this movie musical and its significant message. In his acceptance speech, producer Marc Platt spelled out the message beautifully and simply. He said, and he put a shout out for more of cinema to do the same, the picture was ""to make us feel, not through cynicism or irony, but with unbridled joy and passion, to dream more urgently, to live more fervently, and love more deeply. And now more than ever to find music and cinema that enters our mind and our soul and our hearts and unites us."" That's the message of this movie. Embrace it and you're going to love it."

"sydney-31856","9","2","4","16 January 2019"," Singing the Praises for La La Land!
","Damien Chazelle (director/producer/screenwriter) is the brilliant director to his second major success. After his previous award-winning movie whiplash, he directed La La Land. This movie is about two people living in Los Angeles California trying to achieve their dreams. The first character we are introduced to is Mia (Emma Stone) who has loved acting her entire life, she writes her own one-act play with hopes to become a successful actress. While the second main character Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who is in love with jazz music is trying to open a Jazz club. After their random encounters, they fall into a stunning romance full of song and dance.
La La Land a musical like no other. Director Damien Chazelle uses the movie's beautiful music in a way that you don't see every day. The music is used to further the characters not just the plot of the movie. In Musicals like The Greatest Showmen, the music is used to tell what they are doing not who they are. You learn more about Mia through her song called someone in the crowd. This song not only shows what is happening in her life but also the life people have as a struggling artist. While the music was amazing the movie also had subtlety wonderful costumes. The entire movie stuck with minimal patterns on the clothes with vibrant colors to make the actors pop! In the first dance song that Mia was in, she was wearing a bright blue next to all her friends wearing equally bright clothes. This just makes the audience feel as though they are with the characters in sunny California. In scenes where Chazelle wanted to send a message, he would dim out all the lights having a sole spotlight on the character. This created a contrast to the brightness of the characters emphasizing the character's intense emotions. The characters Mia and Sebastian were played beautifully by Stone and Gosling. They had previously played in two movies together and in La La Land you can see why their on-stage chemistry is evident. Not only can they act they can also sing and dance, which is an amazing combo to have. As amazing at the actors are they didn't have the script to fulfill their endless potential. We learn very little about Mia's actual life when she is writing and performing her one-act play there is no detail on the process it took to make the play or the people who helped. And when Mia goes into an audition she is asked to tell a story, but she tells one about her life, not her aunt. The character Mia is amazing she would be even more amazing with a history. The scene itself was beautifully done. They do a complete pan shot around Stone as she sings a beautiful story about her aunt. The turning pan shot represents the major turning point in the movie. La La Land made the movie similar to older movies. There's dancing around lamp posts and doing everything they can to achieve their dreams.
La La Land truly is one of Damien Chazelle's best movies. This movie is one for the record books. It's about achieving your dream no matter the cost. It's a symphony of music love and color. La La Land is a musical has one of the best soundtracks out there. This movie makes you feel in sunny California with the marvelous character Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling)."

Never have I heard such bland and uninspired music accompanied by a horribly pedestrian excuse for ""dancing"". The blueprint for how to do the perfect musical was laid down 64 years earlier in a little movie called ""Singin' in the Rain"" ! The filmmakers here seem to have learned nothing from that movie...the characters are shrilling and annoying, the plot, barely existent, and the chemistry between the two leads...well, it just falls flat.

All i felt was boredom and anger as i was constantly awakened from my sleep by the main actress screeching( i would not call it singing that would be an insult to the profession)or the main actor yelling. The thing is bright colors and nice editing is nice enough but i have the firm belief that movies need a nice coherent,touchable story,good actors(Oscar was given to Emma whats her face ? ) and chemistry, not just between the main actors, but also between the actors and the viewer , we have to feel as they feel,and can put ourselves in their shoes.

"Ricc0","7","2","4","23 January 2017"," Amusing but not great..
","A lot of reviews on IMDb thought that this movie deserved a 1/10, and more considered it a great one. And while it seems that this movie is having an undeserved rating, I wouldn't consider it really a bad one. In fact, I had fun watching it and though it is a bit long for its content, it is nevertheless amusing.<br/><br/>Yes, movies are subjective.. but still one can judge a movie for what it has got to offer.. especially for movie lovers a set of artistic principles can be laid.<br/><br/>I'll be quick on its positive aspects: The music (not the dancing and singing) is good. The plot is entertaining.. some of the scenes (especially between Stones and Gosling) are innovative, and others attempted to revive the classics. Chazelle also put a great deal of effort with the camera-work.<br/><br/>Well for the negative side, the singing and dancing were not so good.. and for a musical this is really important. Some said that it was better that the singing was modest, for it appeals more to the characters. But really, a musical should introduce something beautiful for the viewer to get emotionally attached and it won't seem abnormal.. it is a musical after all. Look at West Side Story (1961) or Singin' in the Rain (1952); every song is memorable.. well and that is another issue with La La Land. I forgot the songs the minute the movie ended.<br/><br/>The characters also seemed a bit shallow. Gosling's character was a bit deeper than Stone's, but his acting was bad. Emma made a good effort in acting to enhance her character.<br/><br/>The script also seemed of little depth. So it is about following your dreams (an idea now overused) and the conflicts one may encounter with the person he/she loves.. and while there is nothing indeed special about this, I have to say that the execution makes it somehow dull. The dialogue is bluntly thrown at us with nothing to take hold of. At some point in the movie I remembered ""In the Mood for Love (2000); a drama/romance movie that I found much deeper and better executed.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the movie's last 15 or 20 minutes that would spoil the movie for you.. but I'd like to point out that it is really inconsistent with the rest of the movie. I think many had the same feeling.. and the way the movie neglected some of the details was not helpful at all.<br/><br/>All in all, ""La La Land"" is a descent movie and a fun to watch."

","It's been decades since a studio produced the kind of colorful musical fantasy that ""La La Land"" so affectionately salutes, but writer-director Damien Chazelle is the guy who done the job perfectly. It is high-concept pastiche, filled with beautiful people, beautiful movement, and beautiful colors. At its best, ""La La Land"" probes the irony of its existence, celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times. As a drama, this is less nourishing than the heritage it pays tribute to. But for Chazelle, the story is just a slight rib around which he builds a modern rhapsody. So in spite of its flaws, La La Land has moments of pleasure and satisfaction that are worth the price of admission. It's not that it's a bad movie; it's just not an outstanding entertainment, the way great movies (especially musicals) should be. I go with 3.5/5 for the musical drama by Damien Chazelle and I do think that it is the frontrunner for the Oscars."

","And thats being fairly generous.
I like singing and dancing, and prancing and bouncing off the walls and other moving objects like any other sensible nutjob. But this movie was a bit torturous.
I wonder if it would have worked to slingshot the careers of these two actors 20 years back, though whats his face was already a well known actor, but was still transitioning from that weird moody phase of his ( was he dark haired back then or always blonde? Do I care?).
The film was enjoyable for some really good music and the ideas of people just having to put up or shut up and do what needs to be done was real talk. Growing up can be hard, everyones gotta do it though. Yet for the two characters to just rub each other the wrong way so often and the needless drama...I really have to wonder if thats because producers thought "" this is just what chicks dig"" or I dont know what other reason for it all. Yes, Emma Stone has grown up well and is very funny, interesting and pretty. So along with the cool sequences that are dream like a little, the film was not a total loss.That ending though... 6/10"

","Hearing the city of stars by chance, I was deeply attracted by this song and went to the movies.
In real-life movies, the protagonist develops from the initial acquaintance to the love stage, everything comes so fast. Love is probably a momentary impulse. There is a voice in my heart saying: it is him / her.
The two people in the trough had a sweet and happy time, until the male master's career began to get better, the work became more and more busy, and they gradually had differences.
The most feared thing in the relationship is that the two people do not have the same pace. The one who lags behind has a deep sense of powerlessness, but the other party cannot understand your mood, and even everyone can't understand your mood. They will think that you should be content when you get this, but only if you know it in your own heart, your little self-esteem subconsciously resists this situation.
The male and female owners struggle for their respective futures. The female owner and another person get married and have children. This seems to be in line with the current status quo. No one is inseparable from anyone. The sweet words and swearing alliances at the time would only freeze them at the time, only the people at the time, not the current ones.<br/><br/>
The scene that moved me the most was that after they broke up, the male host received a phone call to inform the female host to audition and went to her hometown to find her. She asked him how he knew she was here.
Maybe the woman is too emotional. Seeing this scene, I even hope that the hostess will forget the previous unpleasant reunion with him. I, who is easily moved, is too easy to be deceived."

","La La Land's magic comes in it's ending. It's a sad ending, but one about moving on and coming to terms with the person you are. It corrects the rights, and punishes the wrong. People hardly know better.<br/><br/>The movie is a love story about a struggling musician and a struggling actress. While the actress eventually attains fame and fortune, the musician ends up somewhat successful, but single and without the actress. In between is a bunch of musical numbers and depictions of the LA lifestyle.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. It's well done. It does get boring, and you get sick of the dancing and music.

","La La Land is really really good and I wish I saw it sooner. I think I might go on YouTube and rewatch some of the songs. (And a never do that.) I honestly don't know what to say, it's just a good movie.<br/><br/>This film succeeds on avery technicol level. The cinematography, set design, makeup, costume design, editing, and CGI is all great. The CGI isn't there that much but when it is it's pretty good in terms of the film it's set in. This segways into my next positive thing: The fakeness. I know what your thinking but the fakeness is a good thing in this movie. This movie is a commentary and tribute to Jazz and Hollywood. The two leads both have big dreams one wants to be an actor the other wants to own a jazz club. They both retreat from their normal lives with these artforms (plus they both live in LA) this also applies when they are dating each other. Also when I say 'the fakeness"" I mean the; CGI, random spotlights, random dancing and montages. It has a sense of Hollywood in its golden age, which I can't really explain. This is called good directing. When you watch it it feels like your watching a beautifully filmed play because of this. The writing is also very good, you get the sense that these people have been together for a while and really know each other.<br/><br/>I got more out of this movie than I thought I would and I enjoyed it very much. This is the best film of 2016 and I highly recommend it. Stay tuned for more reviews coming soon, including but not limited to; Joker, Bee Movie and The Scream Trilogy."

","From the director that gave us in my opinion, 2015's Best Picture winner 'Whiplash' comes another movie about music and trying to make it to the big league. What happens when a struggling jazz pianist keeps bumping into a struggling actress around LA? You get La La Land. A musical that heavily borrows from it's predecessors will always render two questions: first, will it be reminiscent of how musicals were done back in the day and second, does it measure up to the classics. The answer to the first one is yes: from the singing, to the dancing, the costumes, the lighting, etc. As for the next question, only time will tell.<br/><br/>The movie's strongest point is Ryan Gosling. He skipped playing the Beast in the live adaptation of Beauty and the Beast for this (coincidentally enough, Emma Watson chose to play Belle instead of playing Emma Stone's character). He's a singer and dancer (thanks to the Mickey Mouse club), and a very good actor. I've also seen 'the Notebook' and in both movies, he serves up that Gosling charm many find irresistible. On the other hand, I remember watching 'Birdman' where I said Emma Stone will go places once she gets more serious roles. Fast forward to today and her first Best Actress Oscar award. She's good when she's on but sometimes her acting can still boil down to 'Easy A' level. Her best scene was the surprise dinner date and her weakest was that improvisation between her and Gosling when the latter was asking her to try auditioning again. As for the direction, it feels the movie wasn't handled as meticulously as 'Whiplash' but minus the minor lapses, the nomination of Damien Chazelle is well-deserved."

The heroine of this movie, Mia, is worried about her dream which is hard to fulfill. Mia tries to do her best dozens of times, but she always fails. She is a good character, so I can identify with her, and also I want to cheer for her. In fact, I don't like the ending of ""La La Land"".

Every camera angle, every carefully planned twist and turn, is just beautiful. And duh, the music is 10/10 spectacular. The ending is also just out of this world, superb. Unfortunately, La La Land just takes too long to actually get decent. Emma Stone's character is so static and boring. Ryan Gosling is great and a version with just him could have been different.

I'm sure that this kind of situation is not uncommon in reality, and the main characters seemed to be mature enough to be positive about it.

","In terms of music, styling, choreography and acting this movie was brilliant. Utterly amazing, and a big tribute, I feel like, to the old Hollywood movies. But I couldn't help but feel like it lacked something. The love story that evolved between Ryan and Emma's characters felt a tiny bit forced in the beginning, but I still have to give props for the two, since I can't remember seeing these two step dance and sing in a movie before. There was nothing wrong with the actors, I think the story just might have been flawed. These thoughts were all in my head until the last scene, that hit me incredibly hard. Even though the love story felt abit forced in the beginning, you really could se these two characters end up together forever. But at the same time when that didn't happen, that felt okay too. Just because you met a person at one of your lower points in life, doesn't mean that you are meant for eachother, and I praise the director for taking that decision. I was almost one hundre percent certain that Mia was going to turn around, march toward Sebastian, have a big reunion kiss and then live happily ever after. But when I instead was greeted with the sad, and at the same time perfectly happy smiles from both Emma and Ryan, I felt strangely content.
While I wouldn't call this one of my favorites, I still would defnately watch it again, for the music, and all out experience."

There's a 'for the love of Hollywood cinema' about the story, and where it is set. It is unashamed in that regard, and that works for me.<br/><br/>To have too many films of the same theme or take on cinema that this has, would quickly run out of steam, but as it sits alone, and is unique enough, makes it all the more of a gem.<br/><br/>The criticism in the IMDB reviews is often a little too harsh (each to their own), but this film does require you to want to 'believe' in it and get swept along, to really get the most from it.<br/><br/>Great film, that can even be watched again and again in the future."

Maybe I should have seen it before all of the eye so my expectations weren't so high? I'm not sure.

Another thing, the story line, it was so basic. A typical love story that was actually quite underwhelming.
There was such a hype for this film, and it really left me a little disappointed.

","So, the obvious.. both visually and audibly this movie is nothing short of stunning. The colour palette, the score, the costumes; all practically flawless and with great traditional stage lighting to support what amounts to a very beautifully constructed piece of cinematography.<br/><br/>The dialogue was a little too smart at times but it never strayed so far off the beaten path to pull me out of the experience. The characters were likable, even if they seemed to go for the all too common trope of characters that are only flawed because other characters tell you they are, whereas throughout the entire movie they practically make no missteps in any capacity.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, the leads were brilliantly acted but didn't feel quite as fleshed out as I would have liked. The leads, both Gosling and Stone stole the show and the chemistry between them never felt forced to me. Secondary characters were entirely forgettable and I struggle to recall a single notable one.<br/><br/>The plot was entirely competent. Nothing groundbreaking -- but then I don't really feel it has to be, after all; moonlight and love-songs are never out of date~<br/><br/>In summary, a great way to spend two hours.

","After hearing hype about this movie from critics and friends alike, my friends and I went to see it, expecting to be blown away. As a huge fan of modern musicals, I thought I would really enjoy this. After it ended, however, my friend and I both felt kind of ""meh"" about the movie. Here's why:
-Maybe it's just not really my cup of tea, but I thought both the story and the characters were boring. There are long shots of Gosling and Stone just staring at the camera. Gosling's character is incredibly snobby about jazz and how it should be kept ""pure"" which is kind of annoying. Even though a lot of people praise the chemistry between the two leads, personally I didn't feel it. And I still don't really understand the point of the overly long observatory dance sequence. Why??
-Neither the two leads nor the ensemble are really good singers. Any Broadway actor, or even some of the people in my high school theatre group, are more capable of performing in a movie MUSICAL. 
-While the ensemble dancers were fabulous, Gosling and Stone's dancing was just mediocre. Again, hiring professional musical theatre performers might have helped add some shine to a lackluster story. 
-I don't really like City of Stars. And hearing it played 7 times throughout the movie definitely didn't make me like it more. The song from Moana and the ""Audition"" song were both better contenders for Best Original Song, in my opinion. I know I'm in the minority here.
However, here are some things I liked a lot:
-Most of songs are very good, and I've added many of them to my musical playlist on Spotify. I know Pasek and Paul are incredible based on their work in Dear Evan Hansen and The Greatest Showman, so that is no surprise. The music and lyrics shine despite the ok singing. So, even though I'm not a fan of City of Stars, I really like the music in this movie. 
-The instrumental stuff is amazing. The jazz was delightful to listen to, and so was Gosling's piano playing. 
-I love the ending. By the last half hour, I really thought this was going to be another ""boy meets girl, they fall in love, both achieve their dreams and stay together forever"" cliche ending. That they didn't end up together was both a surprising twist and a refreshing representation of what real life is like. Sometimes, you have to choose between the career of your dreams and a relationship, and this movie showed that beautifully."

","These movie has been reviewed from a dozen angles, but I want to highlight the Los Angeles aspect. 
New York has had a number of movies made about it that have the city as a central character; but while LA, of course, has had many movies set in it, few of those are love letters, movies that revel in the appearance of the city and want to display it to best effect. <br/><br/>Till now, my favorite example of the genre has been LA Story, but La La Land is an even more beautiful version of the same idea; an on-going attempt to highlight different parts of LA, and to show them all under the most gorgeous possible conditions. If you live in the city, it's a treat to try to figure out each location. <br/><br/>So that's my recommendation! If you want to see a movie that does LA proud, that shows how lovely the city can be, watch this.

","Lots of people have been asking if I've seen 'La La Land', so I thought I had better give it a chance, even though musicals aren't my thing - better late than never, right? I always list the four most prominent actors when I do a review, but I truly struggled to think of anyone else to fill the 3rd & 4th slots, since this film has two stars, and at least one of them is on screen the entire time, with little time dedicated to anything/anyone else. Maybe not a bad thing, but it does mean the film gets a bit monotonous.<br/><br/>Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone) are easy to watch and are good in this, but I don't think either of them is a particularly good singer or dancer. My main problem with musicals is: why? If a scene's not interesting enough to sustain momentum without having song and dance, then cut it! At least in animated films, they seem to find ways to weave songs in organically - and they're catchy. Here, I didn't find any of the songs very catchy or interesting - most are kind of mopey. Otherwise, it's all quite predictable - they fall in love, they chase their dreams, the end.<br/><br/>The ending is semi-interesting, but every time I started to get pulled into the film when there's a stretch with no singing, it suddenly appears again - always out of context - and pushes me back out. It's definitely not a bad film, I just felt like nothing really happened - sure, there's some romance and they're good actors, but there's no real story or humour to be found."

"Mrbrown43","8","0","0","27 December 2017"," La La land: Singing in the Gosylingstone rain
","If you were into films around 2016 you would have heard of La La land, even if you were just a causal movie goer you would have at least heard the name. People were(still are ) in love with this film, so much so in fact that there was popular backlash to La La land during the time leading up and after the Oscars. Only now has this backlash appeared to have vanished. This was partly the reason why I, someone who loves musicals did not see La La Land sooner. I wanted to wait until things had cooled down. <br/><br/>La La Land tells the tale of a struggling actress Mia (Emma Stone) and wannabe Jazz musician Sebastian(Ryan Gosling) crossing paths and falling in love in the back drop of Hollywood and trying to keep themselves together as professional ambition threatens to drive the two apart. <br/><br/>I love musicals, always have done. One of my favorite movies is Singing in the Rain and La La Land is a clear inspiration/ spiritual successor to the 1952 classic. That if anything was one of the biggest selling points for La La Land and I think it does it very well. From the opening song and dance number to Sebastian and Mia tap dancing against a sun setting bathed hill breathes Singing in the rain that has just enough identity of its own so it does not rip off the inspiration but respect and honor it. There is not one musical number that feels out of place or does not add to the movie in some form which I do think is an improvement to Singing in the rain which did suffer from some dance numbers that felt like padding( Looking at you Broadway Melody). <br/><br/>La La Land's plot might not be the most complex plot in the world but it is compelling and is well paced. The music numbers do not feel out of place and do not derail the plot in any way as well as being spaced out enough so both can exist without diminishing the other. Mia And Sebastian are interesting and likeable, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone give it their all in terms of performances, the romance not only feels believable but also goes to different places then Singing in the rain took it's romance in a ending that is bittersweet and poignant. The ending helps the movie stand apart from its inspiration and give it its own identity, I love it. <br/><br/>Unfortunately as a true successor to Singing in the rain La La land falls short by one key factor. The dancing, the dance choreography is weak and stilted in comparison to other musicals especially to Singing in the rain which as most would know was well known for its ground breaking dance numbers. Another reason why most the dancing is weak would be because none of the main stars were professional dancers (Ryan Gosling did take dancing lessons for this movie, not sure about Emma Stone) so the dancing would be very simple and a little out of step with the music which is almost always upbeat and cheerful, the choreography could have been better if it was going to be a real successor to Singing in the rain. But without the comparison it is fine, not the best but works well enough. <br/><br/>La La Land is a great musical, I would not say that it is one of the best movie musicals but it is one hell of an enjoyable watch. A must see for any musical fan."

","As a musical: excellent, beautiful, wonderful choreography, bright colors, bravo!<br/><br/>As a movie:<br/><br/>I actually avoided seeing La La Land for quite some time because the plot seemed thin and trite to me as someone who had lived in Los Angeles for nearly a decade, I'm not exactly swept away by tales of aspiring performers, to me that's just real life, and this pair of struggling performers seemed especially privileged.<br/><br/>Though highly amused by people singing and dancing on the freeway (it might be the best or second best scene in the entire film) and completely in love with how much the director decided to use Griffith Park (the REAL happiest place on earth) I was distracted by the fact that a barista drove a Prius and lived in an art deco apartment, and that an underemployed pianist not only could afford to live without roommates in present-day L.A. but could afford the gas to drive a car around town instead of taking public transportation. Hey, I know the film is called La La Land (see the aforementioned people dancing on the freeway without dying brutal deaths) but this aspect made the film seem outright classist to me. As an Angeleno I inwardly stewed over the preposterous detachment of reality the writers and directors must have to even suggest such a scenario. While these things may have been possible in 1983, this movie was made in 2015-2016, and it ain't happening unless you have a trust fund. <br/><br/>The film coasted along merrily and was certainly better than average. I enjoyed the jazz music and the multiple shots of alleyways and trashcans and back entrances....but a huge chunk of L.A. was completely erased. The characters only seemed to know West L.A, Hermosa Beach and Griffith Park...there were no realistic scenes of trudging through North Hollywood. nor were there really any memorable shots of the Historic Core in DTLA (except for Angel's Flight). There was no hint of Latino culture. No trains, no Ubers, no hotels....this film was NOT written by anyone with a recent experience of being a struggling Millennial trying to enjoy life in Los Angeles. Pool parties at mansions? Um....okaaaaay. <br/><br/>I was rooting for the happy couple, but by film's end I felt dismayed and betrayed by Emma Stone's character. Not only did she abandon Ryan Gosling for some upper middle class Ken Doll cut-out of a husband and a baby, but she even seems to have abandoned Los Angeles, casually groaning ""I don't miss this"" to freeway traffic and intimating how it might be easier to catch a play ""back in New York.""<br/><br/>Truthfully, I did feel more connected to Ryan Gosling's L.A.- loyal, jazz loving character fulfilling his dream at the end by owning his own jazz club in cozy spot somewhere just off the freeway ramp, but overall, I'm giving this film a 7. <br/><br/>Yes it's better than average, yes I'd watch it again, but it's not the best film I've ever seen, and on a personal level there's something about it that vaguely unsettles me."

","Having waited a year since its original release before I finally saw it meant that I could watch it without the typical Oscars hype that surrounded it. And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about.<br/><br/>The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's ""singing-in-the-shower"" warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarrassment to the resplendent costumes and sets that surround them.<br/><br/>What's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average.<br/><br/>Finally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?"

It does remind you of films from Hollywood's better days. How often do we get to see a script-to- screen musical? I understand that some members of the academy perhaps wanted to encourage more of this kind of film making, and I'd like to see more as well. That said, this is not a great film. It does have it's moments. The story is bittersweet, and the cinematography is wonderful -- LA hasn't looked this good in a long time. I enjoyed the music, especially the theme track. There's a lot of energy in this film, and it keeps you interested from beginning to end. But I don't think the final product deserves all the Oscars, even if I've never thought much of them anyway. Everything is done well, even really well at times. The lead actors are earnest and likable. We're rooting for them, but it doesn't add up in the end. I found the progression of the plot in the final 30 minutes to be a bit of a stretch. These two were never really meant for each other. I found their friendship much more believable than their romance. Neither actor is a skilled dancer, musician, or singer. They pulled it off, but their performances aren't memorable. Viewing La La Land was a fun two hours, but I'm not interesting in watching it a second time."

However, each independent part is just fine, and I say this knowing that she won an Oscar for her performance.<br/><br/>The visual style is beautiful and theatrical. Particularly, the lightning, camera-job, and special effects resemble the experience of theatre rather than cinema. These elements are delicately weaved to produce visual metaphors that transmit the emotions and feelings of incipient love. Hence, the Director's Oscar prize comes without surprise. On the other hand, despite it being a musical, the songs did not inspire me and were secondary to the visual effects and plot.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was dull; an actress trying to find her Hollywood light is clich√© and overdone. However, the onset of the love story changed everything. The eventful plot reminds us of the fragility of love, its dependence on serendipity, and the importance of communication.

It's Chazelle's most successful movie, what has won all seven of its Golden Globe nominations and has made Chazelle the youngest person to win both the Oscar for Best Director and the Golden Globe for Best Director. In starring roles are Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist Sebastian and Emma Stone as an springing actress Mia. The location of the film is in Los Angeles, where the whole story unfolds. Mia is a barista, who dreams of becoming an actress, but uselessly. Sebastian is a struggling jazz pianist, earning money as a restaurant pianist, but his boss fired him. He dreams to open his authentic jazz-bar. They met in in a party, where Sebastian plays in a third-rate 1980s pop cover band. After the two walk to their cars where the following story starts. They started to meet and fell in love. Soon they will approach their goals. Mia directed her one-woman play and Sebastian became a member of a successful jazz fusion band. But they weren't happy-Mia's play wasn't successful and even Sebastian's band was at the top, he knew, he doesn't enjoy this music. After many arguments they grew apart and went on their lives separately, but five years later they both have achieved their goals-Mia is a famous actress and Sebastian owns his jazz-bar. Even if the movie seems at first like a light-hearted musical, it's actually thought-provoking and has a good moral. Because it's a big budget film, it has a great camera work and is aesthetically good to watch. The only weakness is that the movie is a bit predictable. Already at the beginning I knew, how the story is going to move. In general was this the best musical film, I've ever seen. Whith the twist of the story and a good moral, it was interesting and gripping to see it."

","When I wanted to see ¬´La La Land¬ª in a movie theater, I found no company to go with and I let it pass. I asked my friends and they answered, ""It's pretty, but not like the musicals of the past."" Then it won 261 awards and 193 nominations according to IMDb.com and I stopped asking... I finally saw it two days ago and I understood them. Yes, by parts it's pretty, but the problem, in my opinion, is that it tries to be like old musicals and that format changed, evolved, because the world changed and the perception and appreciation of art advanced, and because shows became more eclectic and media stuff (as illustrated by that 2001 spawn called ¬´Moulin Rouge!¬ª). The naive (and perhaps a bit silly) world of ¬´Top Hat¬ª, ¬´Meet Me in St. Louis¬ª and ¬´Finian's Rainbow¬ª no longer exists; and people care very little for products as ¬´West Side Story¬ª or ¬´The Sound of Music¬ª that solved their sociological, economic and ideological issues with someone singing ¬´Somewhere¬ª or ¬´Climb Ev'ry Mountain¬ª.<br/><br/>I felt it since the film began, when car drivers stuck in a traffic jam and under a hot sun, sing a little song that, in the harsh reality, would translate into insults, curses and maybe blows. However, I followed the game and began to like it, the more so when the plot antagonized two realities, two personalities with two very different goals. Ryan Gosling plays the pianist Sebastian, a musician who is trying to rescue forms of cultural expression from oblivion or extinction, anguished because jazz is dying and he does not have a space of his own to practice it and spread it. Emma Stone is Mia, a girl who is after that old aspiration of actors since the early 20th century, who lined up to enter the ""factory of dreams"" (or nightmares, you name it) that is the cinema of Los Angeles - which is not the same as the cinema of New York or Texas.<br/><br/>Immediately, my identification was with Sebastian, although as a theater person I understood Mia. However, it did not take too long before the character disappointed me: Mia has no assistance to stage her show and only gives one performance of her monologue because the opening night was not what she expected and returns home. I have seen openings with fewer people than those who went to see her. In addition, to make matters worse, in one of the most unlikely dramatic (and ridiculous) turns of the plot, some producers propose her to make a film about her ideas. Of course, this may happen, no one denies it, but director-screenwriter Damien Chazelle does not let us see what she did on stage, so we can say, ""Sure, such a good actress deserves that opportunity."" But no, we must imagine that the monologue was great, although, truthfully, at that point of the movie Mia has not shown any trait of genius.<br/><br/>To be fair, Sebastian does not either, but his character has conviction, strength and determination, and he has his great ""commercial moment"" before Mia's, when he plays with a standard band a bad song in front of an entranced crowd shouting and dancing to the tune. Luckily, the pianist reacts and says, ""No, this is not my thing"". Count the awards that Emma Stone won, and those Ryan Gosling got and you will know this world goes only wants ¬´The Voice¬ª and ¬´American Idol¬ª... All in all, I admit that Mia's option is valid, there are many people who want to be the art world and have families. To the effect, the presence of Tom Everett Scott, a nice actor who plays her husband, helps a lot, but Chazelle (and Stone and Gosling in their performances) insinuate sadness and regret for what could have been but was not, as each followed their dreams.<br/><br/>In short, this central conflict between art and personal fulfillment is adorned with musical numbers tinged with romanticism that work very well (those that my friends call ""pretty"") or are very cheesy (like the dance by the stars in the Observatory Griffith) and overloaded with special effects. I guess many miss the expertise of Gene Kelly, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire when dancing, or the voices of Julie Andrews and Mary Martin. But the earth trembles and the hurricane is coming, so nobody has time for the la-la-la of this romantic comfit."
"troestrup","10","4","12","18 March 2017"," Beautiful and unpredictable masterpiece
","Boy, I am glad, I got to watch this at the cinema, because it is definitely worth watching there.<br/><br/>I want to describe La La Land as a visually beautiful, non-clich√©, romantic movie that not only has a stunning love story, but also goes much deeper into topics like 'Dreams' and 'Music', while the movie stays rooted in reality, which gives a lot of credit to the title ""La La Land."" I found it quite easy to understand why, and that is exactly what I personally like about a movie of this scale. It is capable of telling a story about difficult characters in difficult situations and explaining this in a simple way to the ordinary viewer. This is why, I think, it stowed away so many Oscars at the Academy Awards and also, why it received so many nominations. I will just mention a few of the obvious ones here, just to awaken your movie hunger a little, if you haven't watched it yet:<br/><br/>Emma Stone did really deserve that Oscar for a portrayal of the lost actress in L.A. of epic proportions. Ryan Gosling was nice to see as well in a more sophisticated role, where he must have worked a lot harder with the character in this movie than some of his other typical bad boy roles. In addition, I also do feel the need to greatly applaud the entire music soundtrack in this film, as it underlines the beautiful imagery and scenery of the movie. Behind the camera it is obvious that magic was worked here too. I mean, talk about experimental camera angles and zooming... I haven't seen anything like it, since 'Birdman'. So in conclusion, what Damien Chazelle created here as the director and won the Oscar for Best achievement in Directing, is truly a remarkably beautiful, timeless picture that will most likely be worth re-watching again and again."

What I will say is that I was never touched like this by any other work of art. This masterpiece takes itself very, very seriously. It takes its time to deliver the best paced love story I have witnessed, every single act being its own short, supported by almost stupidly well written and performed music as well as jokes which weren't even remotely out of place. Additionally, and by no means I want to undercut the other actors, Emma Stone delivered a performance which simply blew me away. Just 10 minutes in I was absolutely convinced this will grant her an Oscar, thankfully that was eventually the case.<br/><br/>The movie is long, and the songs require your attention, especially when watching in a different language. That makes it very hard to endure if you have a short attention span or just didn't enter the cinema with maximum interest to begin with.<br/><br/>In any other case, in my opinion, this is the movie of the century."

","After years of Hollywood filth, uninteresting, and painful to watch movies, I found this gem of a movie that has tugged at my heart like no other. <br/><br/>I took my wife to see this movie after seeing the trailer, but had no idea it was a musical. We both are not fans of musicals and during the first opening sequence she looked at me and jokingly said ""I'm going to kill you!"" and I just shrugged. After another song, we were both more drawn into the movie. Finally Mia walks into the restaurant that Sebastian is working at, playing one of the most moving, sad, and romantic pieces I have heard in a movie. The soundtrack really helped to set the emotion of the movie.<br/><br/>La La Land is one of the most fun, inspiring, romantic, and sad movies we had seen in years. Ryan and Emma's chemistry on screen is undeniable and made the movie so believable. It's been a couple of days since we have seen the movie and we are both still listening to the soundtrack and talking about the movie."

","An absolutely phenomenal movie that actually is as good as people say it is! It brings a touch of classic films with good songs, breathtaking cinematography, great twists and turns, choreography, acting, and of course the story. It's not going to be a 10/10 for everyone, but the idea to follow your dreams is something you don't see very much in today's movies and is the first film in a long time to do it flawlessly. Tomorrowland, as a comparison, failed with this. To make this review spoiler-free I'll say that everything from beginning to end is satisfying, and must be seen at least once in your life. The journey you go on with the leads is very entertaining and if seen in IMAX you almost feel like you are a part of it. This is the best film in a long time."

","La La Land is a spectacular musical focused on two aspiring stars living in Los Angeles. The story focuses on Sebastian, an aspiring jazz pianist, and Mia, an aspiring actress, and their struggle to get their start in LA.<br/><br/>I decided to watch this movie after learning that it tied for most Oscar nominations and I am most certainly glad that I gave this movie a shot. I fell in love with everything about the movie 20 minutes in. I believe the director put a much deeper meaning in La La Land in terms of whether to follow your dreams or follow love. At first, I wasn't expecting this movie to be something like that, but it unravels throughout the last half of the movie. The movie's score is amazing and Justin Horowitz did an amazing job with everything. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry, just like they did in Crazy, Stupid Love. I highly recommend everyone watch La La Land based solely on the score of the movie. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT."
"LivBrumei","10","4","12","30 January 2017"," Comedy, Drama, Musical..it's all that
","Guess what? It has plenty of scenes that are all about singing and dancing, it's why it's called a musical I would dare to say. So if you don't like musicals, it's quite possible that you're not gonna like this one, but if you are willing to give it a shot, please watch from the beginning to the end with respect, because if you are willing to pay attention it may offer a good moment. I like musicals..not all of them, I am not fond of every word being said while singing, but I usually tolerate and sometimes I quite like it. This movie is much more then a musical. It's a tribute to musicals, to old cinema, to acting, to jazz and yet still manages to tell a typical story in an original manner. When you think it's all about the pretty songs and scenes the movie starts punching you with some reality and then reality strikes. I found it amazing for giving me all those elements. I just read a message and it made sense for me.. I laughed, I felt like singing and dancing some times and I cried. It gave me all that in about 2h so for me that is a great movie, but I think it's not the typical story that is delivered to you, like in stories that are so strong by themselves they basically wouldn't need anything more to be worth watching or Marvel movies that have many effects so it's always an experience to watch so I can understand some people not liking it...it's not typical and if you like that then it's new, fresh and amazing!"

This is a very simple story about love and following your dreams in Hollywood. <br/><br/>It manages to avoid a lot of the cheesy parts and is not your average musical you see on Broadway.<br/><br/>The two leads are brilliant to watch and extremely likable.

Besides having a chemistry in the impressive film, so it is not difficult to imagine them together. The film, besides being a tribute to the cinema of the 40's and 50's, poses itself the problem of: How to be revolutionary, while remaining traditional?

"louisepietrovski","10","4","12","27 January 2017"," Love through music
","La la land is a 2016 musical by the ascending director Damien Chazelle, mostly known for 2014's Whiplash. It tells the story of the romance between Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz lover musician. It has Los Angeles City as background.<br/><br/>Hollywood's musical golden era is marked by movies like 1939's Wizard of Oz and 1952's Singin' In The Rain. Seeing a musical on the big screen in plain 21st century is a bit hard to chew, and I felt this right at the start. In a L.A. traffic jam, people get out of their cars while singing and the first musical act of the movie begins. This reminded me of my childhood fantasies where I'd be in a car and imagined people just stop driving and starting dancing on the roads, so I couldn't help feeling this scene a bit cheesy and tacky. But it was no doubt well executed, with each of the many actors singing different parts in the song and making perfectly executed dance moves up and around the cars.<br/><br/>As more musical acts passed, I felt less like treating the movie as just a corny musical and more as a merit deserving film. In the second act, Emma Stone shows up dancing with her housemates, first wearing sweatpants and then changing to a beautiful blue dress. She is the heart of this movie, with the good acting making you relate to her in happy or sad scenes and understanding the eagerness that the character has for becoming an actress.<br/><br/>Then we're presented to Ryan Gosling's character, who describes himself as a serious musician but ends up having to sacrifice his principles for the sake of being successful. I felt that Mia's scenes outshine Seb's, because her aspirations seem stronger than his. She struggles in auditions where people never give her credit and has to work as a barista to get life going. However, Seb has a really strong point: his love for jazz. Even when he makes speeches about musician I never heard about, the meaning that the music has to him always feels genuine.<br/><br/>The couple goes through the clich√© of first disliking each other and then falling in love. There are a lot of scenes for the development of their relationship where they just talk to each other, and one of my only problems with this movie is that some of these talking parts feel a bit dragged. I feel that their love is much better transpired through the singing and dancing. Mia has a different colored dress for each season, and this marks each of the music acts. Also, the lighting is always beautiful, weather it is the stars shining on the couple as they dance, the L.A's beautiful sunset, the movie screen lightning their faces, or the purple and red toned lights in closed spaces like restaurants and bars. The music and the dance moves are very light. All of these elements make very emotional scenes, especially the one where they float through stars in the planetary.<br/><br/>La la land plays a lot of homage to the classic old movies, for Mia's love for acting comes from watching them. 1955's Rebel Without a Cause is the most referenced, but 1942's Casablanca is the most important. In this last one, the romance of the starring couple is represented by the song As Time Goes By, which is played a lot during the run time. The same thing happens with La La Land's main song: City of Stars. In the beginning it represents the happiness in Mia and Seb being together and in the end, the sadness in them being apart. This might not be the best movie in the world, but it's emotional tone is enough for it to deserve a lot of merit.<br/><br/>A very interest plot point is when Mia continues in the struggle, this time creating her own ""one woman show"" play, and Seb starts making success with his new band. This gets her inevitably jealous. They have an argument and then go apart. Although our lives have the big goal to find love, the ambitions for money and success always end up getting in the way. This makes us less likely to trust people and drives us away from our important ones.<br/><br/>Mia's play is a disaster. However, Seb gets a call from a producer who took interest in her. He runs to the disappointed girl and convinces her to make an audition. In the end, they both get what they want: Seb opens a music bar where he can live only for his love of jazz, and Mia goes to Paris and becomes a famous actress. But they are forever separated. The love and happiness of the classical musicals have no place in here. Even if Mia fantasizes with her love for Seb and her aspirations being in perfect balance, she realizes (while City of Stars plays in the background) that her goals couldn't be achieved had they invested in their relationship. The ending shows the crudeness of real life winning over the fantasy happily ever after, making this musical definitely a remarkable one."
"LeonardKniffel","10","4","12","27 January 2017"," Best Movie Musical of This Century
","This is the one we have waited for--a thoroughly contemporary film musical that balances romance and realism in surprising ways. Director Damien Chazelle pays homage to classic musicals with allusions to, among others, Vincent Minnelli's ""An American in Paris"" and Jacques Demy's ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and ""The Young Girls of Rochefort."" The selection of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone to play the romantic leads is brilliant; their aspirations propel the plot and their very ordinariness makes us believe again that dreams and memories can sustain us through the inevitable separations that life brings. Wisely, every time Gosling and Stone break into song it ends too soon--too soon to bore us, soon enough to leave us wanting more. Pieces of jazz, rock, and classical music are woven through the film, but the thread that holds it together is the Justin Hurwitz score, which includes the enchanting songs ""Another Day of Sun,"" ""A Lovely Night,"" and ""City of Stars,"" as well as popular singer John Legend singing his own composition ""Start a Fire."" Los Angeles has never looked so good, even during a traffic jam, and who knew how much we missed the xylophone?"
"yann-98665","10","4","12","27 January 2017"," My ""La La Land"" review
","LA and jazz lovers, I highly recommend you go see ""La La Land"", the new musical. Made by the writer and director of Whiplash, Damien Chazelle, this film is dedicated to jazz lovers. I am just back and will go back soon: see the Los Angeles sunsets in ""Panavision"" with such an original sound track was amazing! My personal opinion of the film: A real wonder, an enchantment, like if Gene Kelly meets Audrey Hepburn for a new musical! Some scenes are absolutely exceptional, including several shots of several minutes, real wonders and a formidable prowess of actors, dancers and singers. The story behind the movie is also exceptional and will bring you to think differently of the consequences of your own acts in life, especially regarding Love."

The soul of the jazz lover will be nicely satiated and I'm betting new jazz lovers are breaking out all over the world as we speak! A great lesson in living in the present moment, this flick reminds us not to waste a moment in life! This is your time!

","Is this the film some (misguided)people have raved about? I am 15 minutes into it and absolutely hate it. Now I love musical movies and treasure the likes of West Side Story, My Fair Lady even The Rocky Horror Picture Show but La La Land seems to miss on every point. The musical numbers are irrelevant as well as being awful and unmemorable. The opening sequence is as far removed from a tasty introduction to the genre as it is possible to be. I find it hard to believe that anyone could have enjoyed this crap. The characters are uninteresting and I am unable to care what happens to them.I cannot see myself making it much further because I am never going to get that wasted time back.

","I think people expect too much of this film, thanks to the slew of Oscars it has won. I see it as a well-made and expertly-shot musical with great songs and many, many references to films of a prior age. Emma Stone is a much better singer than Ryan Gosling and his dancing is somewhat stiff, but they are actors not professional musicians - I wasn't expecting perfection from the man (or a Fred Astaire impersonation). And to his credit, he nails the piano (not so easy - I know from experience). If you want a good and very colourful film with excellent music and reasonable dancing, this is it - if you want an OK film with some REALLY excellent music and dancing, watch Chicago."

Best movie I've seen - the most entertained that I've been - in several years. The story, the writing, the actors, the music all just fantastic. First off the movie is upbeat and fun. If you need depression in your life, go see Manchester By The Sea which I did not get at all. There really isn't that much dancing in this movie but the music is great. Very memorable songs. Then Gosling and Stone as one of the most believable couples on screen ever. Great plot and Gosling very impressive on the keyboards and Emma Stone gives a wonderful performance. To be honest I haven't seen Moonlight and I heard it's also terrific but I have a hard time believing it's better than LLL. If you want a date movie?

Not bad, but definitely not. Is this the best singing I have ever seen? Note bad but, definitely not. But beyond that this movie has it all: it's dynamic, the cinematography is truly superb, Emma Stone is irresistible (clearly the best on screen), Ryan Gosling is great. Vibrant music and choreography mixing classics and modern, all directed and framed to perfection. Like a nice bottle of wine, it has all the ingredient in just the right proportion to create an elegant ensemble that you cannot stop drinking. La La Land takes you to a whole different world, where you will switch off, relax and dream on for two (short) hours. The magic of cinema, that only very few and the very best can do.

Not the classical love story, certainly you won't regret. I still have some of the songs spinning in my head. Please don't miss it, take the love of your life with you.

"tyson-hunsaker","10","3","8","9 February 2017"," Dream inducing beauty all around.
","La La Land has been met with great anticipation since everyone has been raving about how great it is. Admittedly, I went into La La Land with high expectations considering Damien Chazelle's previous addition ""Whiplash"" was one of the best films of 2014. Fortunately, La La Land didn't disappoint in the slightest.<br/><br/>The film focuses on two young people living in L.A. trying to fulfill their dreams. Both the jazz pianist and actress meet and develop a charming relationship throughout the picture. <br/><br/>First of all, La La Land is a musical; a perfectly made modern musical. During a time where musicals have found appreciation only if they were released before the 80s, La La Land recharges the genre that has been so prominent to the magic of cinema. Everything about this film boasts love, life, passion, and fun. Pure and unapologetic movie magic that's just fun! Anyone who adores the art of filmmaking can recommend this to anyone wondering ""Why are movies so great?"" This is why. No matter how hard someone may try to dislike this movie, it's difficult to deny the wonder and pure movie magic this film has to offer.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone both create excellent chemistry on screen together and present some of the best performances of their careers. Performances are quite excellent all across the board in fact which brings more life into the picture. On another note, Ryan Gosling's work in learning the piano for this role also shows remarkable talent considering all the singing, dancing, and instrument playing is completely genuine. For those expecting stage numbers matching Singing' in the Rain or The Music Man might potentially be disappointed. This isn't a 50s musical - it's a modern musical and correct expectations is important. <br/><br/>What's important to know about La La Land is it's a film specifically for film lovers; real genuine film lovers. Casual movie-goers will also have a grand time if they let themselves but maybe the hype has doomed some film goers experience. For anyone that'll have a good time with this joyful experience, they're in for a magnificent and dreamworld delight of movie magic that's incredibly enjoyable and pieced together quite perfectly. Really everyone should get around to seeing the joy that is La La Land."

I guess it depends on the reviewers own personal story weather this movie will get a 5 or a 10 star review. I was deeply struck by emotions watching La La Land, and it doesn't matter weather Gosling was good or bad, or weather Stone knows how to sing. The scenes of dancing and singing are metaphoric and vivid in colors, expressing their emotions which anyone who's been in a similar situation in life will understand and connect with.

"MaximumMadness","9","3","8","1 February 2017"," ""La La Land""- A wildly charming and entertaining throwback to old-school Hollywood romances and musicals. Though it's a bit too in love with itself at times.
","One of the year's lead contenders for awards season, ""La La Land"" is a memorable and expertly crafted throwback to old-school Hollywood musicals and romance boasting top-notch direction, thoughtful handling of characters and exquisite performances from all involved. It truly is a remarkable film in many ways, and it's never anything less that completely charming and entertaining. It just might be one of my favorite films of the year! ...and yet, I really cannot in good conscience give it a top-notch score because for everything it does right, it does have one major flaw that just barely holds it back from perfection.<br/><br/>The film tells a classic tale of romance in the City of Angels. Struggling actress Mia (Emma Stone) is yearning for her big break in show business, and has a series of chance-encounters with the gruff but well-meaning Sebastian (Ryan Gosling)- a man who is also a dreamer with big goals in life and a obsession with jazz. As time passes, a very tender and heartfelt romance blossoms between the two, which may be threatened when they are both given opportunities to do great things... but also things that will make them question their aspirations and their relationship with one-another.<br/><br/>Written and directed by the phenomenal Damien Chazelle, ""La La Land"" is a powerhouse when it comes to style, production and performance. The film is a sort-of loving homage to the Hollywood of yesteryear, and is filled with bright pastel colors and absolutely stunning musical numbers that capture the imagination in a way few films can nowadays. From a mind-blowing and bombastic single-shot opening dance sequence on an Los Angeles highway through slow and contemplative sequences of dialog where characters muse about their goals and dreams, Chazelle is always at the top of his game. His sense of flow, pacing and tone is just magical, and viewing the film really takes you back to the feeling you used to get when you watched the old studio classics of the 30's, 40's, 50's and 60's. His sense of character establishment and development is also something to behold, and he crafts his story of romance with a keen feeling of grounded realism and sensitivity. Phenomenal work.<br/><br/>The film's stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are just magical on- screen together. And they're a key part of the puzzle that makes the film so enjoyable. Not only do they have an infectious and giddy chemistry together, but both are also just darned good in their own ways. Stone's wide-eyed and innocent optimism is instantly identifiable to anyone whose ever had a dream to do something great, and her emotional turmoil as she goes through the ups and downs of show business lets her stretch her chops wonderfully. And Gosling nicely compliments and contrasts this as a character who wants to do great things, but always seems to have to compromise. He's a perfect foil to Stone, and in a weird way, they can almost be seen as the same type of character, only having gone down different paths.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't help but feel there is one critical flaw that haunts the film and holds it just shy of being a masterpiece. And that is the fact that the film is often in love with itself too much. To the point it becomes a detriment. I know that sounds silly, but that's the only way I can describe it. There's so much to love in ""La La Land"", but oftentimes the deeper concepts and themes that are brought up take a backseat to style and reference. There will be a wonderful scene where two characters share a deep and meaningful moment... only to be followed-up with Gosling dumping a slew of references to famous jazz musicians or Stone having a doe- eyed moment where she looks classic LA iconography. And as a result... well, it becomes uninteresting and pretentious at a few key moments. A film needs to be in love with itself, and everyone involved should love the material. But it goes a bit too far at times here.<br/><br/>That being said, I can't help but admit this is probably one of the year's best films, and this flaw doesn't detract the excellence of virtually every other aspect of the proceedings. This is a work of cinematic art and is filled with love and passion from all involved. And it's just a wonder to behold. It just isn't quite ""perfect.""<br/><br/>And so, I give ""La La Land"" an excellent 9 out of 10. Definitely check this one out on the big-screen. It deserves to be seen in theaters."

I was at a loss for adjectives or fancy lines to define this film so I Simply put the line I loved from the trailer. Starting from the best part is the Music of the best .The movie is one of those old time musical where everyone dances and sings such beautiful songs. It's purely timeless experience. I never expected it would hit me so deeply in the heart but it's really really great. It's something my heart would never allow me to forget and if I forget it I am a rock.Songs like Someone in the crowd , City of Stars , Audition(the fools who dream) and the final number , these are beyond expectations to what I had expected. Damien Chazelle's direction is way too perfect and screenplay is among the best in decades. I really wan thank him for giving such beautiful movie.I don't think I will ever watch such beautiful movie like this ever.I was literally in another world and all those numbers are so so so exciting. The whole score , cinematography and stage production along with best performances of career by Ryan gosling and Emma Stone makes this movie not only the masterpiece or the best but it sits as the very top. THIS IS A CLASSIC. Especially, the last number which is dreamy sequence and throws light on what is dream and what is real. The set and the story paired with each great musical number and a few heartbreaks that showcase the harsh life of showbusiness is here. To break it into small parts , the movie begins with a vast musical number heavily choreographed on a HIGHWAY dancing on top of cars and the lyrics resonates to the whole story and also provide our first glimpse to our aspiring actress and rising pianist. Then begins the theme for both the characters , the story follows another great musical number Someone in the crowd whose mid tempo tune especially during the middle and last part composing of flute is very good and Mia asks herself does she wana meet that someone and what it will be like.The two characters met with some funny scenes and also what's going on in their lives is shown.They met again not accepting there is something between them in Waste of a lovely night which is also very nicely choreographed and especially the cinematography during all these numbers is breath taking , it's like every frame of this movie can be my wall poster. Then there is the very best City of stars which also has a duet in later part of film. The Most Magicl Moment of the film is when shadows of our charcetrs are shwon dancing in circles against the background of Planeterium which is very nice. Sebastian changes his dream a little bit so that he can get is own club, Mia writes and performs her own play only to witness few people showing upfor it and not even Seb as they had a fight earlier. Seb did come but Mia states her drems are over , that scene is really well portrayed by Mia. But Mia later gets a call for audition and Seb manages to convince her to do it and she did it. They confess they will love each other forever. Audition(The Fools who dream) is the song which shows the feelings of Mia and other people who dreams but are considered fools. It's a powerful song and Emma Stone's defining moment probably best of her career. Fast Forward to 5 years Mia is a famous actress , married and have a lovely daughter and Seb has his own club. Mia and her husband comes into Seb's club and then begins the EPIC EPLOGUE which in my opinion is THE DEFINING MOMENT OF THE FILM. It's a Medly of all the musical numbers with only music and no lyrics and showcases the scenario if Mia and Seb would have been together.This nearly 8 minute long sequence is what dreams are made up of. But as it ends harsh reality comes.What happens in movies , doesn't happen in real life. Mia leaves with both she and Seb smiling to each other as the film ends with Humming to City of Stars.Each musical number is carefully crafted with such deliverence it's just soaring and dazzling. Finally Watch it in CINEMA YOU MAY NEVER GET OTHER CHANCE LIKE THIS. IT'S BEAUTIFUL , SOARING , MARVELOUS , ENCHANTING , MAGICAL , MASTERPIECE AND EVERY OTHER GOOD ADJECTIVE PRESENT IN THE DICTIONARY..."
"rondeatheater","10","3","8","23 January 2017"," An ode to classic cinema and a complete joy to behold
","I can't remember the last time I fell in love with a movie head over heels before this. Oh yes I do, it was Whiplash. There's gotta be a pattern there somewhere and there is of course, the magical duo Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz have done it again, delivering another cinematic masterpiece in the form of La La Land. The conflict of hard headed careerism and heartfelt romanticism in Hollywood, a town that manufactures ""fairy tales for adults"", is at the core of ""La La Land,and is unflinchingly examined.<br/><br/>At first glance, before I heard about the universal acclaim the movie was garnering, I thought the title looked corny and upon finally getting the ticket and witnessing the beginning scene, the skeptic in me reared its ugly head, the dance number on the freeway didn't quite appease me even though the song was catchy, it was clich√©d and unremarkable, looking like one of those annoying random flash mobs you get in every city. How mislead I was indeed. Shortly afterwards, the title rolled on and there's Ryan Gosling/Sebastian waiting in the traffic in his classic crimson open rooftop ride, twiddling the radio playing jazz, as the camera panned forwards to the Prius in which Emma Stone/Mia was rehearsing her lines, among the many cars on the gridlocked highway, the cars start moving and Emma didn't follow suit, distracted by her audition lines, prompting angry honks and wtf looks from Ryan which Emma replies by flashing a birdie and immediately I knew I was in for a treat. From then on, what followed was a montage - showing how Mia, a barista in a coffee shop strives to become a successful actress amidst all her disappointing auditions and Sebastian who harbors a hope to revive the dying jazz by opening his own club albeit betraying his passion by going on gigs he hates just to pay his rent and how their paths cross albeit accidentally but amusing and where it all goes from there - so beautiful and mesmerizing, i couldn't help but watch in awe, every part of my body quite frequently tingling with goosebumps with lines uttered or just plain silence and music played. Each and every scene was magnificent, flowing from one frame to another in a manner both effortless and tailor made for each other, such was the beauty of the script penned and lived out to perfection by the leads. Ryan was brooding and sardonic, and limited somewhat but he was effective in his own ways, conveying emotions be it snappy annoyance at someone poking fun at jazz, despair at being misunderstood or unbridled love and joy without so much as a word uttered but brisk expressions and body language. Emma Stone however was simply delightful, she waltzed in and out of every frame she featured in, charmingly expressive with her wide range of emotions and heart failing smiles and eyes that stare and wink at the soul. Their dance numbers and duets together were authentic and charming, which makes them one of the few pairs in Hollywood with sizzling chemistry, the tap dance bit on the bridge overlooking the picturesque glittering city of LA bathed in purplish orange twilight especially quaint.<br/><br/>Of course for a musical, the music is what makes or breaks a movie and here it ticks all the boxes, right from the tap dance number, A Lovely Night to the hauntingly melancholic Mia and Seb's theme, simply a treat for the ears as well as the eyes thanks to the limited yet intimate dance choreography and of course the camera work, the palette of colours on show was quite dazzling, first popping like fireworks and then subdued and luminescent, as Los Angeles is in its full element here displayed in all its glory. The spellbinding sequence entitled Planetarium could be mistaken for heaven itself. While baby boomers would note that the dancing and singing of Ryan and Emma could scarcely be compared to that of ""Singin' in the rain"" for instance, for me it felt real, sincere and modest but no less lovely, which crucially added credence to the story.<br/><br/>However, what makes this movie truly spectacular is the execution and directing, there's not a single scene that was out of place and not a single dialogue that seemed irrelevant, in the same mould of Whiplash,La La Land delivers where it really counts, the storytelling. The placement of the musical segments is controlled and ordered, giving its way to the development of the story effectively. The theme of the film is compelling and relevant to people of all age in modern day - whether you are young with enthusiasm and dreams for tomorrow or old with tender nostalgia of the yesteryears. Not only was it fresh, but it unabashedly evokes our emotions in a way that either makes us grin from ear to ear or hits us hard in our guts and leaves a lasting tinge of sadness, look me straight in the eyes and tell me that symphony of an ending didn't leave a lump in your throat. While the climax of Whiplash was thrilling and pulsating, La La Land's was delicate but powerful nonetheless, pulling curtains over the movie in way you'd never see coming, putting you under its spell which wistfully stays with you long after you've left the theater and driving back home, humming the City of Stars.<br/><br/>A gem that will live on and called back to for generations to come, La La Land is neither over the top fantasy, or gritty harsh reality, it's more about where the line is between the two and how it defines love and this is where the movie trumps above all others, showing us both what we want to see and what we tend to avoid or ignore. <br/><br/>Can't recommend this enough, so go on now and get yourselves lost in this bittersweet tale of passion and pragmatism. <br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie has stolen my heart! I went into this movie with high expectations, and it soared above them. Thank you, Damien Chazelle, for a movie that can be savored over and over. Thank you, Justin Hurwitz, for a brilliant score that has stayed with me and replayed endlessly in my mind. Thank you, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, for being such a great screen couple, especially in the musical numbers. From the first frame to the one that says The End, i was hooked by this tale of romance filled with one of the most infectious soundtracks i have ever heard. Not since Titanic have i cried so much in a movie. The movie is cleverly edited, and a what-might-have-been sequence towards the end is just dazzling to behold. I boldly predict that this movie with its timeless theme will remain fresh for many generations to come, and become a staple for cultists everywhere."
"howard.schumann","9","3","8","22 January 2017"," An enchanting, joy-filled experience
","I've always assumed that referring to Los Angeles as ""La La Land"" was a put down, a pejorative description of the city as the home of illusion and fantasy. Damian Chazelle in his film titled La La Land, however, sees it as the home of a different sort of make-believe ‚Äì an enchanting, joy-filled arena where singing and dancing about life is as authentic as living it. Here Los Angeles plays itself with a mixture of fantasy and reality and a nod to films such as Jacques Demy's musicals of the French New Wave, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort. Reinventing the genre for a new generation, La La Land offers a delightful combo of jazz, pop songs, dance routines, and two people in love dreaming under the stars. It's enough to make you think that our current political scene may only reflect temporary insanity.<br/><br/>In the film, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), an aspiring jazz pianist, and Mia (Emma Stone), a promising actress, come to Hollywood to fulfill their dreams, but find that dreamers are not always in vogue. The now well-known opening scene is shot on the L.A. Freeway, but those who drive it every day probably wouldn't have noticed much difference in the volume of noise, wall-to-wall cars, and people acting out. Here, though the acting out is ‚Äì really acting, though the commuters seem as agitated as always. The fake traffic jam, however, is much more entertaining than the real one as a chorus bursts out with the song ""Another Day of Sun,"" written by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, and you forget that you will be very late for work.<br/><br/>The story itself is bittersweet though it always has an air of innocence. Mia works behind the counter at the Warner Brothers studio lot but still makes time for auditions that may only last thirty seconds or less. Seb dreams of owning his own jazz club but is forced to play Christmas music at a lounge by his boss (J.K. Simmons), a little less overbearing than in Whiplash, but still ornery enough to fire him when he stops playing Jingle Bells. Mia wants to meet the fired pianist after his doomed gig but he rudely brushes right past her ‚Äì no meet cute, there. Of course, we all know they are going to be a couple eventually and when they do come together romantically, they are a charming pair who exude chemistry as they make their way through some of Los Angeles' notable tourist attractions such as Griffith Park Observatory where they fly halfway to the stars.<br/><br/>Though Gosling and Stone are no Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire, they are good enough to elevate our spirits as they sing and dance to the strains of songs such as ""City of Stars,"" a tune that you may even remember after you go home. Although she is not a big fan of jazz, Mia and Seb do have a love of music in common but their relationship becomes complicated when he joins a band led by John Legend and commits himself to going on tour. Mia has put her hopes in performing a one-woman play but it fails to attract an audience, and she is back to square one. Nonetheless, La La Land works hard from beginning to end to make its point that if you stick to your guns, work hard enough and don't give up, things will eventually work out. That, however, may be its most gravity-defying trick of all."
"AdamMitchyCat","10","3","8","22 January 2017"," La La Land: What a Hollywood FIlm Should Be
","Music and movies seem to go hand in hand, and lately, that's been obvious. The last few years have opened the door to many great music related films: Amy, Miles Ahead, Straight Outta Compton, Love & Mercy, etc. But you know what hasn't been popular? Musicals. What was once the most popular genre in cinema rarely enters the public consciousness today. The last major musical release (excluding Disney cartoons) was Les Miserables, and that still polarizes audiences to this day. And then this film came out. La La Land feels like it was tailor made for me. A classic Hollywood musical with traditional sets, big choreographed numbers, bright colors, and throw in some love of Davis-era jazz? It feels like a dream. Thankfully, the film didn't let me down. I enjoyed every minute of it. I loved the homages to classic Golden Age films like Rebel Without A Cause and Singin' In The Rain, and Stone and Gosling were a delight to watch. My one issue would have to be that I feel like they didn't use certain scenes to their full potential. The Observatory space dance and Gosling's number on the pier could've gone on a bit longer. The space dance could've been grand and beautiful, but it instead felt very short and made me wanting more. Still, it's hard not to praise a film like this. It was beautiful, fun, and an all around great experience."
"KineticSeoul","9","3","8","21 January 2017"," Marvelous
","This is a musical that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finished. It's a very vibrant and colorful film that mixes the thematic elements from the old fashioned musicals and themes in the present. And the collision of all the enrollments works together really well. Usually I get bored of musicals, because the songs aren't all that catchy and gets boring to listen to despite the characters emotions sometimes. However in this, just about all the songs are catchy and exciting and some of it even heartfelt. When the song ""Another Day of Sun"" started off as the intro, I just had this had this giddy smirk. Mainly because the song is so darn catchy and old fashioned while having that present suave take to it. The main core aspect of the story is about 2 passionate people trying to achieve their dreams. While the romance parts is basically the secondary aspect of the story. The two actors was great choices for the lead. Ryan Gosling is just really good at bringing about this suave and charismatic jazz pianist. He was the replacement for Miles Teller, as good of an actor Teller is I think Gosling was the right choice. I also heard that Emma Watson was first conspired for this role which might have worked as well. But Emma Stone seem to hit the right notes when it came to the singing scenes. Overall, this is a colorful and marvelous musical that I thoroughly enjoyed. However some overly cynical, jaded or nihilistic audiences might not enjoy this movie as much. But for those that still have hope, dreams, passion and believe in love and romance will fall for it. It's the perfect date movie that couples can sit through.<br/><br/>9/10"

","From the National Anthem to the musical, everything seemed pretty new to me. Starting with a song, it brings so much liveliness to what is being shown. It starts with a lot of vehicles stuck in traffic. A woman steps out of her car and starts dancing to the song playing in her car. The old vintage title card, La La Land appeared. It was so chilling.<br/><br/>SUMMER. The camera slowly moves into a car where we see a girl and there is loud honking. Even the honking seems of a character, the loud old-fashioned Plymouth horns. A young handsome man, seated in a majestic old fashioned car, is in a hurry. He rat-runs through the space near the girl's car, at which she's not very pleased. She has one hand holding the phone she is talking into and gives the middle finger of the other hand to the young man, which he didn't mind. Little did they know that they would meet.<br/><br/>The movie follows the lives of Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Mia, an aspiring actress, works as a barista in a small coffee place in LA Hollywood, and manages to go for auditions, as well. Sebastian is a jazz musician in town, who struggles too. Their characters are bipolar, their struggles being the only uniting factor.<br/><br/>Every object in the movie plays a character by itself. For instance, Mia's house. Her house is no normal house,being decorated with posters of classics like Casablanca, showing her interest for classics. Her dressing is similar ‚Äì colorful,vibrant and over the top ‚Äì to her house. The dressing mirror reflects herself and her character too.<br/><br/>Sebastian is annoyed. He feels that people don't understand what jazz music conveys and that they don't discern the fact that jazz music is dying.<br/><br/>Emma Stone tries to make into Hollywood by making it to every acting audition possible. She is a really good actor but is humiliated every time. It makes us pity her, when the casting officials order sandwiches while she acts and when she's done, the director tells her, ""Oh, we're fine.""- REJECTED.<br/><br/>AUTUMN. Mia is at a pool party with her friends. We get to know the characters of the movie pretty well. Linus Sandgren handles lights to perfection. The camera shots are amazing. The first person camera follow the people diving, into the pool, which is awesome to watch. The way this long movie is cut, the pencil sharp cuts here and there, is beautiful. The production design and the artwork in the movie is so intimate to the feelings. The movie is intentionally made to look like a dreamy, fairy tale type romance which takes place in Los Angeles. They are both artists and naturally are dreamers.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle is the magician who made every frame of his poetry glimmer so high up in the stars. The music in the movie is so pleasing and 'City of Stars' was especially brilliant. The orchestra was so beautifully set. The movie emanates the feelings of the characters through music . The film is so perfectly staged. When Mia and Sebastian talk or dance(which seemed like the same sometimes),the camera travels with them,mostly one shot and creates so much fluidity. The lighting changes all by itself, according to their senses. Ah, this is love.<br/><br/>The way the scenes at Griffith Observatory was shot is simply a miracle. With the music, their dance and how the place is so unconsciously lit with a sense of craving love which is endless and how the galaxy adds poetic metaphors to create on spell bounding inference to how movies are being shot. ""They don't make movies like this anymore"" is what could be thrived upon. But in the end,things need to go the way a dream does. They need to wake up , get ready for work and there might be not much love if you choose to wake up . Thats REALITY. Though they both wake up,reality is likely to be different to the 'La La' in the land.<br/><br/>√óRishi√ó"

The excellent cast, the music and an exciting new director/writer were enough to get me in the door. I'm always a bit hesitant when it comes to filmed musicals.. Will it be stagy, stilted and awkward? Not in this case. Damien Chazelle has made a wonderfully cinematic and loving ode to the dreamers and and artists of the world . It goes away from the predictable musical ending while wrapping up the movie in fellow swoop, opening the audiences' eyes to the entire meaning of the story, beyond the theme of follow your dreams. The idea that dreams are possible when you are willing to strive for them, but life isn't your own la la land. Everything does not end perfectly."

She auditions for roles for different shows but never gets any call back. We later meet Sebastian(Gosling)who is an inspiring jazz musician who wants to make it big in music and wants to open up his own jazz club. At first when Seb and Mia meet on the motorway going doing their every day stuff the two don't see eye to eye but when they meet again they later start to like each other and they sing and dance along the way. <br/><br/>The Visuals in this film are absolutely amazing its a real feast for your eyes when you see the visuals in this movie. The acting is top notch. I loved Ryan Gosling since The Notebook(quite dreamy to look at too),while Emma Stone is another actress I adore. Their singing was amazing especially Ryan's his got this Micheal Buble/Harry Connick Jr vibe about him with Gene Kelly's dancing skills. Emma Stone was brilliant too with her singing skills she was a real 1940s/modern day woman who wants to dream big and is rather negative when it comes to auditioning. Also starring John Legend,J.K Simmons this film is definitely the one to hear winning Best Picture at the Oscars in 2017. <br/><br/>Best bit: The visuals were stunning,singing was wonderful and the story is like going back in time when Musicals were big in the day. Acting is brilliant especially from two leads.<br/><br/>Worst Bit: The ending was a bit of a let down(if you seen the film you know what im on about ,but still I liked the what if scenario).<br/><br/>If you are a die hard fan of old school musicals,Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling then this is for you.

And even if you were never one for old-fashioned movies, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's performances are worth the movie itself, keeping what is a tempting clich√© love story innovative and modern enough to engage with anyone.

Several people have pigeonholed it as melodramatic thing with musical taps, nevertheless, the celluloid transcends its own confines, splitting events course within four branches (the four seasons), which accentuates nature of every chapter in the story; however, although we are witnesses visibly of a narrative segmentation, spectators will not take long to apprehend that it is distributed in three fields directed by different genres and themes, what ultimately leads us to say that they are three independent stories correlated each other.<br/><br/>The story relates idealistic couple's adventures who lives in the district where professional disillusions of the planet settle: Hollywood, an arbitrary fable which will split up our divergent players. She yearns to predominate intransigently in the city of dreams; nonetheless, her aspirations are crumbling and dying by the unsuccessful castings and his job as an assistant in a coffee shop into Warner Bros. (an unbearable face to her suffering). On the other hand, he's a pianist who makes shows at weddings and private bars in order to open his own pub, getting his biggest design: protecting and rekindling the jazz exhausted flame. Later, their lives are adventitiously connected after a nocturnal walk in finding their automobiles, which originates a passionate love, overtakes a series of individual troubles. Although each of them obtained whom they loved, the nature of the unexpected will be at risk and the intrinsic of their relationship will keep them to the edge of the cornice, what in Hollywood would signify a death foretold.<br/><br/>It's irrefutable that Chazelle does not perform a neophyte exercise about actions which unfold with sections accompanied by singing and dancing since in his directional debut ""Guy and Madeleine on a Park Bench"" in addition to run notably his first steps within the matter, also emerged victorious in emulsifying melodrama with dazzling spontaneities. The initial section focuses on setting us in context within the dominant air through choreographic assemblies exuding pure vintage, these performances are honest reminiscences from monumental MGM productions: ""Top Hat,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" ""An American in Paris,"" and more were potential sources for revitalization of classic musicals. The first take, we detail a broad blue sky by CinemaScope, going down gently amongst the congested and multitudinous vehicular traffic. Each individual listens to dissimilar music styles‚Äîan analogy will disperse into progressive musicality‚Äîthereon ""Another Day of Sun"" is the attention epicenter and an ineffable and arduous choreographic display takes place along the vehicle bridge, acts recorded in false long takes as if it were I√±√°rritu. A frantic and exciting prelude, which adjusts the environment where our main leads are going to get along. In the second part grandiose dances ala Broadway drastically lessen and are replaced by sentimental treatment; and what we cannot forget in a film by the director are the symphonic scores which are maintained potent, nevertheless, it provides gradually more preponderance on screen to jazz. This is where the narrative arcs obtained greater strength and Stone's and Gosling's roles shine with profound and authentic performances. After it moves through the crazy musical of the first part and the plausible dramatic affair of the second section, Chazelle concludes with a final flourish with a sudden, indefatigable, agile and the cunning mechanism in the concomitant of the events which transmute narrative in films; It makes you feel as if the tragicomedy would come to an end, but indeed one twist more is coming. Finally, choreographic ensembles break out again, but this time, we have not seen them with the same dynamism and explosiveness, dances are carefully chosen to express story grief. He provided an inspirational greeting with ""Whiplash"", with ""La La Land"" consolidates himself as one of the major American filmmakers, permitting Stone's and Gosling's performances and entire components of the celluloid to receive a guaranteed nomination at the Oscars for this love letter to Hollywood cinema."

","I initially really wanted to see this film on the big screen; but, as wide release got closer, all the rave reviews put me off a bit - was it all hype? Were the Hollywood powers-that-be pushing the reviewers extra hard?<br/><br/>Well, regardless of my doubts, I went anyway and I was glad I did. This film hearkened back to the song and dance musicals of days gone by. But, with the added twist of using real actors; not professional singers and dancers. I felt this added a great deal to the movie - the characters were real people - people that sang and danced well; but, not perfectly. The producers could well have dubbed professional voices ala Marni Nixon for Natalie Wood in West Side Story; but, not doing so made this film so much more real.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is a very good actor. After seeing his work in the film, I'd have to say he is better than good. Has he made it to the pantheon of great actors? I'm not sure; but, his performance in La La Land was outstanding - he ran the full gamut of emotions and he can do more with a sly glance than many actors with better pedigrees.<br/><br/>Gosling had the perfect partner in Emma Stone; who, at times, appeared to be channeling Audrey Hepburn. Her eyes can evoke more emotion than almost anyone. In my opinion, she was quite excellent.<br/><br/>The film is fun and quite emotional at times - not a full box of tissues; but, a good handful would be nice to have.<br/><br/>But wait - there's more... This is somewhat of a musical, after all and I found the score to be absolutely perfect. Unlike most films, where the music can be setting a background mood, the music in La La Land is integral to the plot and the quality of the score raises the film to another level.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to see this film now, on the biggest screen you can find. This is not a film for the home TV, unless you happen to have a full size Hollywood screening room in the basement."

"jfeilteau","10","3","8","7 January 2017"," A Modern Musical
","La La Land is the latest film from Whiplash director Damien Chazzelle, starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. La La Land is a musical that follows Mia (Emma Watson) who is a struggling actress whose path keeps crossing with Sebastien (Ryan Gosling), who is an aspiring jazz musician who wants to open his own jazz club. And through the course of the film we see their romance flourish. <br/><br/>To say the least, this film is phenomenal, from the acting to the music this film is amazing. At a certain point in the movie I realized that I didn't dislike a single thing in the film. One of the best things I can say about this movie is the music, as soon as it started I was entranced, from the lyrics to the rhythm it is masterful. As soon as the movie was over I wanted to keep listening to the music. Also the characters are fantastic, Emma stone gives the best performance of her career as Mia and Ryan Gosling as Sebastian was also one of his best, which is saying a lot. You can feel all of their emotion is on the screen when Gosling talks about jazz or Mia breaks down because she doesn't think she's good enough. These two are at the top of their game. <br/><br/>Now let's talk about the Director, Damien Chazzelle. This man knows how to direct a film, he uses such great camera movement, vibrant colors, incorporates great music, and directs Stone and Gosling incredibly. He uses a lot of tracking shots, which I personally loved and incorporated good humor, which seemed natural and not out of know where like other movies. I don't have any flaws with the movie except of the last ten minutes or so, it's not that I didn't like it. It's just that the movie ended in a way that I would have liked to see go a different way. It wasn't a bad ending I just personally would have wanted it to go a different direction.<br/><br/>Other than the last ten or so minutes no complaints here, the movie was nearly flawless. It had great characters, songs, choreography, colors, direction, and acting. I walked out of the theater with a smile on my face and humming the music. And would highly recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible, and I would give La La Land an A+."

","I had not seen Whiplash or any of the other films director Damien Chazelle has contributed to, so I had no idea what to expect from this film besides from what was in the trailers. WOW! Am I glad I watched this movie. Every scene and every musical number is a beautiful piece of art by themselves but when they are woven together into this little film called La La Land, they become a masterpiece. I barely have any words that can express how much I loved this movie. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are fantastic in it and the music and score compose by Justin Hurwitz make the film sound and feel like a classic. I am so glad I got see this movie in theaters (twice), because that is how this movie was meant to be seen."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","3","8","2 January 2017"," Dreams Give Life
","Emma Stone angelically sings, ""Here's to the ones who dream..."" in a showcase moment in ""La La Land"". Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are enchanting. Director and Writer Damien Chazelle's musical is an ode to the dreamers and to passionately pursuing your dreams. I love ""La La Land"". ""La La Land"" is an amazing love story-- bitter sweet and resoundingly poignant. It made me happy. ""La La Land"" touched my heart. <br/><br/>I did not expect this from an old school movie musical. Director Chazelle lyrically outs this with the opening number as performers sing and dance atop their cars stranded in traffic on a Los Angeles freeway. In cosmic synchronicity lovers, Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone), meet when one flips the other 'the bird'. Yes, only in La La Land‚Äî Los Angeles. In the days of Astaire and Rogers, musicals used to cast gifted singers and dancers, who could act. ""La La Land"" has gifted actors Stone and Gosling, who can sing and dance. <br/><br/>This resonates for ""La La Land"", because it is eloquently about the choices we make in life and the possibilities. As Stone smiles on a bench at the Griffith Park observatory, she is sublime‚Äîboth joyous and sad. Gosling speaks with such soulful conviction to Stone about jazz being ""always new"". Even by narrative design as they burst into song or dance, Stone and Gosling ground with touching authenticity the compromises they sacrifice for their dreams. I read that Stone and Gosling both trained rigorously for months for their roles. Gosling also displays mastery at the piano. Their performances are among the year's best. So is ""La La Land"". <br/><br/>Stone is Mia, an aspiring actress and full-time barista at a coffee shop on a Hollywood Studio lot. Gosling is Sebastian, a jazz pianist working at restaurant and jazz bar, who dreams of one day opening his own club. They meet a couple times before they get the universe's message. They share their dreams. Mia is frustrated with audition failures, and is at heart a writer and wonderful storyteller. Sebastian yearns to make jazz vital and alive for people. Sebastian is estranged from successful band-mate Keith (very cool John Legend). Love arises for Mia and Sebastian in the movie theater in Rialto. Director Chazelle literally transforms gently holding hands into a dazzling dance amidst the stars. <br/><br/>The dancing and music in ""La La Land"" are astonishing. The dancing is particularly moving with Stone and Gosling. They have that magical chemistry. The songs by composer Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are catchy with a few that are memorable. Although, Hurwitz's final musical composition is wondrous. <br/><br/>Life happens for Mia and Sebastian filled with joy and heartbreak, and through it all is love. Mia says, ""I'm always gonna love you."" Emma Stone allows us to see her soul through her eyes. Her performance is amazing. Stone is beautiful and is luminescent on screen. Gosling is so classically handsome, and he disarms with his fearless vulnerability. Stone and Gosling are such soulful actors and are the heart of ""La La Land"". Dreams give life. With them, we surrender to love and what happens will be so. ""La La Land"" made me happy. ""La La Land"" touches and inspires."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","3","8","31 December 2016"," A Great Score Accompanied by Genuine Writing and Performances, Unfortunately Falling Flat in the Second Act
","La La Land follows Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, an aspiring jazz pianist, who meet and fall in love. <br/><br/>Upon my first viewing, I really didn't care for this movie. The music made it stand out, but that was about it. On my second watch, I found that while it could be tedious, it was a very well-made film. <br/><br/>Let's start with the obvious, which would be the music. It's fantastic. Every single number is memorable and a pleasure to listen to well after seeing the film. This effect does die a little after the second viewing, but perhaps that was due to the fact that I saw it mere weeks after my first watch and everything was still fresh in my mind. Regardless, there's no getting around the fact that the score is great. But more than that, it flows into the movie really well. No track feels forced into the movie for the sake of slapping a 'musical' genre sticker onto it. It takes time to both allow the music to play, then the audience to get into it. The music always fits the movie well too, so none of it really feels unnatural, save for maybe one track towards the end. <br/><br/>The acting is very good, and while I definitely don't think these are the best performances either actor has pulled off, they were very impressive regardless. Both Gosling and Stone get into their roles so much that they feel authentic, and moreover seem like they could actually be lovers in real life. Or at least, really good friends. <br/><br/>The performances are a great compliment to the writing, which is also fantastic. The conversations are authentic, and I could legitimately see myself speaking in a similar way. Just probably not about jazz. And sure, the movie follows the typical romantic movie formula, but most every aspect of that formula is handled in an almost seamless way. It takes it's time to build up the two leads' relationship at the beginning so that it doesn't feel rushed, and the end is handled in a very realistic and engaging way. <br/><br/>The directing here is most always stellar. The movie opens with what appears to be one long take of an entire musical number (and probably the best in the whole movie). While that single-take gimmick was easily faked, it still goes on for quite some time in between the obvious cuts. There is one scene in particular aside from the opening in Gosling's character's house that is spectacular. Sure, it could have easily been cheated, but it looks great regardless. There's a style to it, and it's clear that whoever chose that shooting style knew what they were doing. <br/><br/>Despite all the glamour and masterful film-making on display, this is not a film without flaws. While it does follow and improve upon the romantic formula, it still has trouble putting the love into the leads' relationship. The turning point is mostly understandable, but little things about it make it harder to accept as reality. Other little things here and there bothered me, but that was the biggest of those gripes. <br/><br/>My biggest problem, however, was with the second act. When the two leads finally start dating it divulges to the Hollywood clich√© of showing a montage of the two lovers running around together instead of actually developing their relationship. If there was even a little of that in the in between portion to build a bit of 'early- relationship them', I think I'd have liked it enough to put up it's rating. It made a jump that just didn't flow, and I had trouble looking past it. <br/><br/>Overall La La Land is nearly amazing. The performances are, while not necessarily Oscar-worthy, pretty darn close, the music is outstanding, the directing is usually amazing, the writing is authentic, and just about everything else is great too. However, it suffers in it's second act and a few other little places here and there. In the end I would recommend this movie."
"zanecoker15","9","3","8","31 December 2016"," A Cinematic Painting
","There's always 2 or 3 movies a year that are considered ""amazing"", ""10/10"", or ""perfect"", but it ends up being just really good or average, but not perfect? Well that doesn't apply to 'La La Land'!<br/><br/>I drove 30 minutes out of town to catch this at a theater since it was the closest place showing it near me in the state, and it was beyond worth it. Admittedly, I wasn't completely sold during the first 4 minutes, even though it was perfectly filmed and choreographed. But once this film takes off into the story line and characters' lives, I fell completely in love. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have amazing, believable chemistry (obviously). They're able to play off each other so well and make their characters feel very authentic, and they're more than up for the task of dancing, singing, and having great timing with the hilarious jokes that make this the most enjoyable experience all year for me. Also, Emma Stone hasn't been better. She's the stronger of the two, with being able to cross the line between determined and desperate for a career that you almost couldn't tell if it wasn't for the way her eyes water and seem as if they have their own hands trying to reach for success. And her performance of ""Dreamers"" is one of the best movie musical performances ever since Anne Hathaway's ""I Dreamed a Dream"".<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle, the director, created his masterpiece; and this is only his third film, after Whiplash (which I honestly wasn't a big fan of). But this time, him and his team gave birth to a vibrant, precise, and endlessly fun movie that's able to show the struggle of wanting to follow your passion, paired with the best camera work ever and great music. He's able to breathe life into jazz and the movie musical, while saying they were never dead in the first place. Everything in this film jumps off of the screen and fills you with joy. Needless to say, Chazelle and Ryan Gosling's next film together about Neil Armstrong in space already has me excited, seeing how the the space scene in this movie killed me and brought me to life at the same time.<br/><br/>I could say about 3 paragraphs more, but I'll shut up. Long story short, 'La La Land' is everything it's made out to be and more. It's definitely 1 of 2 of my top favorite movies of the year and I'm glad this was the last one I saw in a theater in 2016. Please go and watch this if you can!"

","I found the music and story sweet and heartbreaking all at once. It was so believable and real that I felt at any moment I could hop right on the screen and join them. A true love letter to the City of Stars!<br/><br/>As far as the musical part--it was exceptionally done. They sang and danced in points that seemed critical to the development of their relationship. And although those scenes could be quite fantastical they were symbolic of how people feel when they are falling in love.<br/><br/>I laughed. I cried. I wanted to dance. I wanted to sing. My heart had a funny tug at the end--what more can you ask for in a movie? Here's to the dreamers!"
"nightixu-03971","10","3","8","18 December 2016"," A Musical And More. About Having Dreams And Falling In Love.
","I'll give this movie a 10. To me it deserves that much. The movie has everything. Sure the musical aspect of the movie will not appeal to most people. After all, when people think musical, its either Les Miserable, Grease or Disney Films. <br/><br/>La La Land however is so much more. It is about having dreams of performing , about hope and of course about love. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian who can't afford to pay his rent because he can't find a stable gig. He dreams of opening his own Jazz bar and he has such a passion for jazz that you start to love jazz too. Jazz is dying and he is on a crusade to save it. Emma Stone on the other hand plays Mia who is an aspiring actress. However, she fails all of her auditions miserably. They meet and fall in love and the rest goes like how love stories goes. Except with singing and dancing. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is one of my favourite actors so it definitely helps that he is playing the lead role. And as he is also a good singer, it seems a perfect fit. Emma Stone on first impression seems like a different role than she normally gets. But she pulls it off perfectly. The chemistry that these two have on previous movies together can also be seen here. <br/><br/>The movie definitely has class. The musical scores and the songs especially the jazz. To be honest some of the musical scene might get a little bit draggy but thats only for the 40 mins when you're getting used to having a song sung by the actors after every new scene. It mellows down afterwards and gets bit more serious. <br/><br/>I love the pace of the movie because you get to know the characters and feel their motivation of why they love performing and why they choose to Act or play jazz. I left the movie charmed by it. It is a definite must-see. Not for everyone to be honest. But personally its up there with the notebook."
"rockman182","9","3","8","17 December 2016"," La La Land (2016)
","All I needed was one whiff of the original trailer for this film (accompanied by Gosling's ""City of Stars"") and I was in love. I really loved Damien Chazelle's Whiplash. I'm generally a fan of films driven by music and that film was a great student v. teacher scenario. However, this was on another level and felt so honed. There are so many things about this picture that I want to applaud and I know that if I watched it again I could probably write another essay on a set of different things about this that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>From the very opening scene, the films aura is set. The musical numbers are expertly choreographed and the multitude of vibrant colors are present very often. Some of the scenes are just so gorgeous and pulsating. There are scenes where the backdrop of LA looks magnificent. The original songs are very good. Even if you do not appreciate a particular song, you will love the busy work on the screen. There is something going on in every frame; your eyes will be glued to something. ""City of Stars"" is such a catchy tune. I wasn't surprised that Ryan Gosling was able to sing and perform on the piano as I'm a big fan of that hunk and know he has his own band. Apparently, he learned the piano for this film which is insane (especially if he played the piano for all of his scenes). You would think he's been at it for years. I think there is good chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Emma Stone's character is identifiable. She's the prototype of someone who has high ambitions, passion, and is unsure of whether others would feel the same way. I found this very real. There's an inherent theme of having a dream and how much hard work is involved in succeeding in that dream. Its tough to accomplish the dream because not everyone will feel the same way or identify with what you are doing. At times you have to take the practical road in life. However, if you stay on course for your passion you may achieve something down the road. This resonated so much for me and I loved it, but I don't want to get stuck in talking about that. Before I go off another tangent, let me just say that this was the best performance by Emma Stone yet. Both leads had to show a bit of versatility for this film and they did very well.<br/><br/>I'd say there's not much else going on with the other characters outside of the two leads. The spotlight is on Gosling and Stone the entire time and I liked it that way. The set designs within the film were eye popping and beautiful to look at. A lot of this film is a love letter to Hollywood. You see it in the Ingrid Bergman, the Marilyn Monroe painting, and other places throughout the film. The film is essentially a tribute and revival of 50's Hollywood, which is another reason why I really liked this film. The musical genre is sort of dying in Hollywood (much like jazz in real life and in the film). I did not like jazz growing up, until I took an intro to jazz class in college and started appreciating the art form. So much goes into jazz, its improvisation, and I appreciated the pioneers of the genre who paved the way of not only other musicians of the genre but popular musicians in other genres to follow. I loved that Gosling's character was enamored with jazz and its history. The two leads are so passionate about what they love (another thing that resonated for me). The mix of music and cinema blended so well together.<br/><br/>The last twenty or so minutes of the film honestly floored me and I really wouldn't change any of it. I think a lot of people will enjoy this film. From a technical standpoint I think this is definitely the Best Picture frontrunner. It doesn't have that heavy handed emotionally dramatic plot that the Academy loves but everything else about it screams the favorite for the Oscar. Chazelle did a fantastic job of mixing his love for jazz music and film and finding symmetry with this film. I'd have to compile a list of the best films of the year but this will be somewhere near the very top. Very pleased with La La Land.<br/><br/>One final thing, my man crush on Ryan Gosling has grown tenfold. The guy can rock a suit better than anyone in Hollywood and is as charming as they get.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Some dreams are foolishly unreal. Some,just extensions of our dull real world thoughts. <br/><br/>This dream, is different. It's a painting in motion, with vibrant colors waltzing around in every 'frame of mind'. It's a song where the notes finds their echo in your own heartbeat. La La Land, true to its name, is truer to its essence ,to the core. So once we are happily, musically transported to Los Angeles in the first scene cum song, there, with our hearts and minds soaring higher with every beautiful frame, we enter a dream.<br/><br/>The 'sweet n sour' journey of two struggling artists to reach their individual dreams. And when they reach those 'destinations' , you realize, that the real dream was the journey itself. <br/><br/>Mia (Emma Stone) a wannabe actress,tries her luck in every possible audition and works in a Caf√© to keep the ball rolling. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a Jazz enthusiast, a gifted pianist, and a self-proclaimed romantic, has to play jingles in restaurants to pay his 'real life' bills. It is music and his soulful playing in the restaurant which first brings Mia to him. The sequence as breathtaking, as it is to Mia.<br/><br/>Interestingly, they crisscross each other's paths quite a number of times after this, till they finally find each other's hearts and feet tap dancing to a single perfect tune in a beautifully lit night. The season has changed and you can feel it in your heart. The much awaited love story begins.<br/><br/>Here's a film where the camera is one of the main leads, on screen. Shot in the dramatic CinemaScope, Linus Sandgren, the Cinematographer , has given us some unbelievably long one shots, without once hindering the 'rhythm' of the excellent storytelling by the Director Damien Chazelle. The camera moves almost constantly and captures frames as beautiful as artwork. Moods have been portrayed with brilliant usage of light; emotions have been underlined, by creating meaningful darkness. Who needs spoken words when the visuals are so expressive; music is enough then, to guide you through the lyrical journey.<br/><br/>People fluidly break into poetic songs and we start almost waiting for the next. Mia and Sebastian's story moves forward with an admirable ease. The scenes are as picturesque as in a fairy tale and we are gently glided into the classic era¬Öwhere girls in pretty dresses and men in bow ties dance away into a starry night¬Öbut rrrring goes the signature Apple tune on Mia's iPhone, and we fall back on our seats with a jerk , suddenly awake , to our 21st century 'modern' present.What a brilliant way to break the reverie and show the present time.<br/><br/>Love and ambition, hearts and minds, egos and expectations, do they ever understand each other? <br/><br/>It's like a soothing duet when Mia and Seb's love is in its bloom and it's a silence, when they have their first heartbreaking fight. Just a little glint of tears in the eyes, just a flicker of light on her face and you know,there's a tempest going on, inside both of them.<br/><br/>Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are brilliant actors. They make Mia and Sebastian look, made for each other. From the moment when Sebastian brushes past her in rage, to the special moment they share in silence in the last scene, you can almost feel the electrifying camaraderie between them. Their eyes speak, their smiles talk, their ease in each other's company answers all that we need to know. <br/><br/>But they are 'made' and not 'mad' for each other. They show an admirable grace in handling their relationship. There's always a mutual respect in their conversations, a humaneness in their disagreements, and profound dignity in their regrets.<br/><br/>So you don't need ""Hows and Whys and Whens"", when they meet again, years later, after compromised wishes and much-achieved dreams. <br/><br/>They choose to sing 'their song' instead, he with his fingers, she with her eyes. And through the music, for the first time ever, they see a new dream, together. Of a life of could have been's and would have been's. Of a life that looked just so perfect, only because, it was, in the end, just a dream.<br/><br/>La La Land, is the land of dreams, dreamers and all those people who believe. It's a toast to them and their resilience, to go on and love and live and dare to think beyond. And so,<br/><br/>""Here's to the ones who dream ...Foolish, as they may seem... Here's to the hearts that ache... Here's to the mess we make..."""

Chazelle's exploration and execution of this idea was done so beautifully, that i left the theater feeling all sorts of emotions. Chazelle's execution of this message was really strong and impactful. <br/><br/>La La Land is a great film, even from the opening scene, the amazing cinematography and dance choreography made it clear that this would be a beautifully edited and directed film. Chazelle's brilliant direction, has helped produce a marvelous treat for our eyes to behold. <br/><br/>There are moments in this movie that made me laugh, and some that hit me pretty badly where it hurts. Justin Hurwitz' soundtrack was also amazing throughout and i hope he wins an academy award for his talent. All in all, La La Land is an amazing film which pays homage to classic cinema and LA, if you are a fan of movies, this will be a film very much worth your time."

","I always think Boxing Day is the start of the movie Year , the new releases come out and then the Award movies leading up to the Academy Awards. Well today was New Years Eve I loved La La Land. not everyone will my movie partner hated it but to me it's much more than a nostalgic tribute to old Hollywood musicals, that it is but it's also touching, quirky off beat like the jazz score at times and very contemporary.<br/><br/>No spoilers here except to say it's a bitter sweet love story judge it for yourself .A friend who is not into musicals particularly ,told me last week that he thought this movie could herald a new wave in musical cinema, the way Star Wars heralded a new genre in Sci Fi escape movies I'm not sure but I hope so the world needs to lighten up in these troubling times.<br/><br/>It would be difficult to find a more charismatic couple than Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone their on screen chemistry at times is mesmerising. Think Vincent Minnelli , American in Paris , Umbrellas of Cherbourg and the great musical duos of Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire and Ginger I'm talking about chemistry not singing and dancing ability , even though Gosling and Stone are very talented. Summing up a joy to watch , unpredictable and very entertaining , Academy Award worthy and I also liked the music."

","Modern day Hollywood hype around a certain flick is rarely deserved, and I was one of the doubters when it came to 14 (fourteen) nominations for ¬Ñoscars"" for a musical. To be quite hones, I don't like musicals. Basically, I hate them. If I exclude the classic ones (¬ÑHair"", ¬ÑAll that jazz""), I disliked almost every single one of those who roared across Kodak theater in the '90s and early '00s (i.e. ¬ÑMoulin rouge!"" and ¬ÑChicago""). Hence, my skepticism around the much acclaimed and awaited second Damien Chazelle's long feature was really, really high. And totally undeserved. In its nutshell, ¬ÑLa la land"" is one perfectly balanced blockbuster. Although a musical, the score doesn't overpower the narrative. Although lighthearted and cheerful, it offers some serious existential questions beneath its surface. Although serious for a musical, it doesn't drown in the darkness of modern day US drama. Although funny, it criticizes both Hollywood and the world of music. Although one great homage to the ¬Ñgood old times"", city of Los Angeles, classical Hollywood and jazz, it stays way out of the pool of pathetic and tacky thank-you notes. All of this, thanks to one single man, the genius behind the camera, young and incredibly talented director and screenwriter, Damien Chazelle. Taking total control over this vast project, he shows off in every single aspect of it, nailing the certain ¬Ñgolden boys"" for best directing, cinematography, editing and¬†production design. By casting the best available young actress (immaculate Emma Stone), he secures the reality of his characters, using the male lead (best Gosling in years) to complement her story. And the story is really one of those everyone can easily relate to, giving the widest possible audience the chance to follow it all the way to the very end. Ending is a special piece of Chazelle's art, just like the one in his previous indie hit, ¬ÑWhiplash"". Although a huge musical (jazz) fan, Damien doesn't produce movie fairy tales, although they certainly look that way in one point or another. The ending will lift ¬ÑLa la land"" from its shell of a elaborated romantic comedy to the level of serious drama that will stand the test of time in years to come. ¬ÑLa la land"" is the one of the best American movies in this decade and certainly the best musical in this century. It will make you laugh, cry, think over it and talk about it long after you left the cinema. Just like every great movie in cinema history does."

","Ever wish there was a movie that didn't involve zombies, drug cartels, robots, or superheroes facing off in a post-apocalyptic end-of-world scenario? It seems more often than not these days, that those types of films are taking up all of the theaters at your local movie theater. Luckily, every once in a while, we get something different, kind, and magical. This time of year, we are so very fortunate to get one of the absolute BEST films of the year, if not in the past several years with 'La La Land'.<br/><br/>Director/Writer Damien Chazelle ('Whiplash' & '10 Cloverfield Lane') has gone back to the music roots and made this ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals, but set in present day Los Angeles with stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle really hit home with 'Whiplash', but 'La La Land' is a more light-hearted take of music and love as a musician (Gosling) and actress (Stone) cross paths in Los Angeles, fall in love, and sees if their relationship stands the test of time and fame as both end up making it in their respective fields.<br/><br/>This film really highlights the talent of Chazelle, as each dance and music number is perfectly scored, choreographed with excellent attention to detail in every moment. He pays homage to the old days of cinema without hitting you over the head too often and makes you fall in love with these amazing, yet flawed characters. Gosling and Stone deliver outstanding performances and yes, actually sang and danced on their own, in addition to playing their own instruments. The result was simply magical with an excellent jazz score that I can't stop listening to.<br/><br/>'La La Land' is such a beautiful film that you will be immediately entranced in its brilliance from the first scene, which is a ""one-take"" scene that was shot on location on a 1oo foot bridge ramp in Los Angeles with over 100 dancers taking place in the opening musical number in a simulated typical L.A. traffic moment. The colors and choreography are just incredible and paves the way for the rest of the film. 'La La Land' is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and music- and one breathtaking visual experience after another. This film will be watched over and over again for many years to come.<br/><br/>MUST-SEE!"
"geryshotlekova","10","4","13","23 January 2017"," This is EVERYTHING!
","And yes, I really do mean EVERYTHING! I have never been so influenced by any movie before. It's a true masterpiece - not only on acting level, but on all levels. I don't even know how to begin describing what I've just seen and felt. This really does have everything - flawless acting, brilliant script, incredible cinematography. For me, it was its idea that grabbed me. It is about dreams, about life itself. It shows how a single choice you make can change your whole life - one wrong move and you will end up leading a life you actually hate. One wrong choice and all you have ever dreamed of will stay just a dream. And the other way around - La La Land portrays the way dreams influence your life if you dare to follow them. It simply shows how magically it feels to realize your dreams. This movie makes you part of the dream, of the magic, the happiness, the sadness - everything. You empathize with the characters every second of the 128 minutes. Gradually, you get more and more involved in this bliss and you don't want it to end. Not only does this masterpiece inspire you, but it also makes you think. Rarely are there movies that are both meaningful and beautiful - usually it's only one of these things. It has inspired me to dream, really dream and not be afraid of how big or unachievable the dream seems to be at first, because this could prevent me from turning it into reality, which is one of the best feelings in the world. To sum up, if you want to feel the magic of a true cinematic masterpiece, GO SEE La La Land! Go see Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's brilliant acting, the genius screenplay and the beautiful work of everyone involved in this movie! Every second of it is sheer pleasure. Personally, I would be happy if one day I can say that I am a part of the La La Land generation - the dreamers, who follow their dreams at all cost and aren't afraid of failure. I sincerely thank everyone involved in this movie for giving it to us!!! Pure perfection!"
"diep-16031","10","4","13","11 January 2017"," Forget about all those clich√© love stories! Life is not perfect!
","Beautiful, charming and pure. This is a true work of art!<br/><br/>The movie introduced us to two amazing artists, one was an aspiring actress and the other was a passionate jazz pianist. They were both broke and trying to look for one chance that can change their life. On that road, they met each other, not once, but three times, coincidentally, like destiny. Of course, each one has their own big dream to pursue, and that passion had taken them to each other. But money was a big problem, so Sebastian had decided to give up his dream, temporarily, to join a band even though he didn't like the music he played. The movie went from a joyful, colorful air to a sad one. After these two had a fight and then Mia failed at her show, she decided to end their relationship and went back to Nevada. But Sebastian pulled her back, thanks to a director, that went to her show and discovered her talent. Five years later, Mia had become a famous actress but stayed friends with Sebastian. She even got married and had kid, and that is where I find it interesting.<br/><br/>The movie didn't go to a predictable happy ending, it made a twist, a right twist to remind the audience that life is not perfect and not every love stories end the way it should. <br/><br/>But, once more, the destiny had led them to each other, when Mia and her husband came to Seb's. Sebastian had finally made it, he had his own jazz club. They saw each other, and Sebastian played that one song that Mia saw him playing for the first time. And this time, he turned it into a masterpiece. The song was like an apology to Mia, saying to her that he should've stopped and talked to her when she gave him a compliment about his talent, that everything could have been different, and they could have been together. That's why the song was also his dream, that we can see when they made a flashback, but in that flashback, everything was bright and happy. It was fun to watch that, but very sad at the same time, because what could've been done is not what has been done. And that is what made the movie beautiful, and pure. It left us with a open ending, to keep us wondering, thinking, and believing. After all, destiny had led them to each other once, who says this time is going to be different? That's why I love open endings, because it gives us a chance to use our imagination, our belief, to continue the story ourselves, and for me, it's a way to keep the movie inside my heart. It becomes my own ""La La Land""."

","La la land tells a story of Seb, a jazz pianist struggling to preserve jazz in the modern day and Mia, an aspiring actress who also works as a barista while waiting for a casting. Both of them struggle to make ends meet while pursuing their passion. They always end up meeting together and the two fall in love. While together they were struggling to balance their relationship and pursuing their dreams. <br/><br/>La la land tells the story of love, hope, passion, and what sacrifices are you willing to make in order to achieve your dreams. This movie tells it in a heartwarming and visually pleasing manner that will leave you in tears. <br/><br/>Everything from the opening scene until the ending is amazing. The story flows very smoothly providing with amazing visuals that almost hypnotized the viewers. Side note: I am a person who gets easily distracted. I have a short attention span. Usually when I'm watching a movie my eyes roam around the cinema, checking the time on my phone, sometimes I even watch my fellow moviegoers. But this movie had my eyes glued to the screen, the visuals are that good! <br/><br/>Anyways back to the movie, the music is also amazing, before I watched this movie, I am playing the movie's soundtrack on Spotify on repeat for a whole week. I'm not even into jazz, but this movie made me want to listen to jazz music. Good job Seb! You are preserving jazz. The songs are great and the lyrics go really well with the scene. It really sets the mood the movie is trying to portray. And the way the actors sang and acted out the song. They really stirred up my emotions. <br/><br/>Now to the acting part, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's chemistry is undeniable. Well, they wouldn't be paired for the third time if they don't have any chemistry, do they? The connection between these two is really intense. They really made me feel like they were really in love with one another. They make want to believe that such love exist and they made me envy them. #relationshipgoals. They are cute, funny, and madly in love with one another. <br/><br/>It is a perfect movie with an ALMOST PERFECT couple."

The elements of joy, nostalgic,affection,confusion were astonishingly woven together with stunning songs to create such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Its about dreams that may look maddening in the beginning phases of failure or defeat but with the continuous perseverance and sacrifice, nothing is impossible. It beautifully captures the bond between the two character Mia and Sebastian and how they support each other and love each other even when things were going haywire.<br/><br/>In the end it reveals the bitter truth of life that how one cannot have everything you desire in life.

"putosamofficial","10","3","9","13 April 2017"," Reviving old styles with modern fashion
","Is just incredible how a 32 years old director can bring altogether cinema from the 40s, 50s and 60s to create something fresh and unique. From the opening shot you can already identify a thing that looks like a try of copying something old but that actually you wanna keep watching it. This are some of the things i love in this movie:<br/><br/>-Emma Stone: How many actress can play the role of an actress? Emma performance was marvelous to me, she was meant for this character, end of discussion.<br/><br/>-Ryan Gosling: I gotta say first that i love Ryan (no homo) but i didn't know what to except from him in a movie like this since i was more used to his mysterious not-so talkative characters. BUT MAN, it fitted just perfectly, not the Ryan from The Notebook, the Ryan from La La Land and it was right on point.<br/><br/>-Color: Damien used to the maximum the good things from our century and one of them was the way he worked the colors. Vivid, fresh and meaningful the whole film.<br/><br/>-Soundtrack: It's funny because although this is a musical it doesn't restrict itself with the expected whole-scenario singing and dancing through the whole movie. The fact that one of the main characters is a jazz player/lover makes up that half of the movie soundtrack is jazz and it ends up working pretty well.<br/><br/>-Cinematography: You will be having flashbacks all the movie, it recreates a hell lot of old types of shots and framing but it still feels fresh because it's done with modern fashion. It's splendid to watch, your eyes doesn't want to leave the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, what i think makes this movie so great is that it brings dead cinema to life making the best usage of modern cinema techniques and equipment and without any flaws. There's some much you can breakdown in this film and so little bad to point out in my opinion. In think we could define this movie as neo-musical."

","With all the mess in 2016,here is an extraordinary musical that has built a la-la land for us to enjoy and forget about all the mess we made.It's the first romantic movie that truly moved me.<br/><br/>Its boy-meet-girl story is a little old school,but the musical's art of telling a story never disappoints me.Mia,a waitress in a coffee shop,dreams to be a famous actress but keep failing in millions of auditions.She met Sebastian,a penniless jazz pianist who dreams to open his own club to save the dying jazz.Attracted by each other's passion for their dreams,they fell in love with each other and move on their way to success.However the story ends with a dreamlike epilogue without a happy ending.<br/><br/>Some may say LA is the third leading role of the picture.It's true that ""La La Land"" has shaped LA into a true la-la land.I felt the charm of the city right from the beginning,the opening dance ""Another Day of Sun"",with the optimism of the dreamers chasing all the lights and shine.LA is charming not only for the scenic spot,but also for the ambitious dreamers that make LA a ""city of star"".<br/><br/>A picture without excellent actors can't be fabulous.Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did a great job shaping their roles.Mia resembles young men and women who devoted themselves to the movie industry.Sebastian resembles nostalgic people who hold on to the past.The roles are charming,not because Emma and Ryan look adorable in their fancy costumes,but for their brilliant performance.Ryan expressed the sorrow and anger of Sebastian in his performance of ""Mia & Sebastian scene"" with full of passion.However,Emma Stone did even better in her solo ""Audition:The Fools Who Dream"".With the single spotlight on her,her passion suddenly flooded the performance,which has become the best performance in 2016 without any doubt.Emma Stone danced to the top of her career with her Academy Award.Passion is a necessary quality for a good actor,and Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling has explained what is performing art.<br/><br/>In this picture,music is the best part.With unforgettable song like ""City of Star"",and passionate performance like ""Mia & Sebastian scene"" and ""Audition:The Fools Who Dream"",its music has reached a new height in the musicals of the 21st century.""La La Land"" not only set an example of music that contribute greatly to the whole picture,but also offered a feast for music lovers.<br/><br/>Cinematography and set decoration also did excellent job.I love the nostalgia everywhere in this movie:the lamp under the swirling sky,the set decoration in the ""Light House"",the ""Epilogue"" and Mia's poster of Ingrid Bergman.With a budget of about only 30 million dollars,the movie still gave me the visual impact that I can only be able to feel in well produced science fictions.Together they built a dreamworld that I really enjoy.<br/><br/>All these,of course,thanks to Damien Chazelle,the talented and also the youngest Best Director in history.In this masterpiece,Damien has shown his nostalgia and love for the dying jazz and the already-dead musical.Just like Seb,he was trying really hard to bring musicals back to life,because it's been years since the last good musical.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is perfect in any aspect I can think of(except the badly designed dance in ""A Lovely Night"" though) ,and without any doubt the best picture of the year,despite it lost the award to ""Moonlight"".<br/><br/>Now I'm looking forward to Damien Chazelle's next movie.<br/><br/>La La Land:Here's to the fools who dream."
"olga-levin-1984","9","3","9","26 March 2017"," A Delightful Modern Musical
","I certainly enjoyed this musical and definitely recommend it for anyone to see. I did give it a 9 rating out of 10 simply because I think that it could have been done much BETTER. I had to watch the movie with the thought in mind that both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are not Debbie Reynolds and Fred Astaire, but I think that they did the absolute best that they could for modern times. Therefore, it is wrong to expect them to meet the standards of 50's actors who could sing and dance on top of acting.<br/><br/>I really loved the storyline and loved it how they showed that in order to reach your dream, you have to sacrifice. It definitely showed me how we take what actors do, very for granted and how society has this one-sided understanding of what sacrifice really is. They certainly sacrifice no less just to keep the public entertained.<br/><br/>I somehow feel that they could have trained them up a bit more in tap dancing to do the main dance montage scene in the movie which is mainly why I gave the movie a 9 rating. The singing wasn't bad at all for actors who are not accustomed singing in movies. I have heard a lot worse in my life. Once again, I feel it's not fair to have West Side Story-like expectations of actors in today's musicals simply because they are not cheap to make in today's market and there's not a big demand for them like there was in the 50's and before. Chicago is the only Musical (in my humble opinion) that strongly rivals the classics in movie form.<br/><br/>While a lot of folks didn't like the ending too much, and yes, it is indeed an emotional ending. I like it that it was made to be open to interpretation. It certainly got me thinking deep about all the other possibilities that could have happened between the two main characters while watching the movie at the theater. I certainly do recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, but would advise to watch it without high expectations that it's going to be just as good as a 50's musical."

","Produced excellently, definitely one of the best of the year. It's a ""cute"" movie, and might lack a depth you'd expect from a movie that won 6 Oscars, just by the sheer weight that adds to any production. But it doesn't disappoint. Cudos to Stella Artois for their covert product placement. It's as subtle as product placement should be nowadays - there's no more space for Marlboro and John Wayne. The ending ""could've been scene"" tore me apart. I'm still finding out if I liked it or not - it is both romantically childish that the love between the two had to be shown and could not be left to you own imagination but at the same time entirely fitting to the whole movie proposal. I like to believe a good movie is capable of, in between it's own story, adding something you enjoy to your hall of admirations, as this movie does with Jazz. I can't believe IMDb only has full number stars, as this is definitely somewhere between a 8 and a 9. When I for the year, it's a 9, but when I think for the long haul it tends back to an 8. Let's just have it at 8.5 and leave it at that."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","9","6 March 2017"," A great moment here and there, but overall ""only"" a good movie
","""La La Land"" is an American movie from 2016 and little needs to be said about the cast and production here. It runs for slightly over 2 hours and is the most recent work by writer and director Damien Chazelle. The two leads are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle won an Oscar for his direction, while Stone took home glory for her performance. The movie itself probably lost as close as you could imagine in the Best Picture category. Now about the film: Many people say that this movie is the return of old Hollywood musicals and this is partially true. While the film is set in the 21st century, the music, costumes and the entire atmosphere have something that feels extremely retro all the time. Lets start with the music. It won Oscar for Song and Score and it is probably deserving. The two Oscar-nominated songs in the right context (the winner as a duet) work wonderfully and are among the parts that can be considered heart and soul of the film. But the real heart and soul here is Emma Stone's performance. She has excellent material to work with and still manages to elevate it on so many occasions. I believe that she was the perfect choice for the character here, in the lighter as well as heavier moments and honestly, there were certainly more of the latter. This is much more a drama than a comedy. As for Gosling, I am not so impressed. First of all, it needs to be said that he did not have the material as good as Stone's. We find out nothing (or not much) about his background really, about his family life, about his past and it's clear from start to finish that he will always play second fiddle to his co-lead. I may be a bit biased as I was never big on Gosling, but in terms of acting and face expressions I am not impressed by him in here either. He may not have great material to work with, but he also does not elevate it and ultimately one thing that this film may have needed for making an even bigger impact would have been a better male lead. It's pretty ridiculous they gave him a Golden Globe for that.<br/><br/>Now on a more positive note, Hurwitz' music was good for the most part. I already talked about the two most important songs, but I also liked the very first song of the film, maybe because I just like choir-like ensemble performances. As for the film itself, Chazelle did a pretty good job overall, especially if you take his age into consideration. It's a really impressive feat for somebody around the age of 30. The way he includes parallels is as smart as simple. It is effective nonetheless though and that's all that counts. One example would be the two scenes of a star entering the bar. Another would be the honking references. Another would be the ""what if"" sequence at the end. Another would be the elaboration on one partner sacrificing his dreams for the other, the one when Mia is supposed to follow her boyfriend who is really successful with his band. The other would be again the ""what if"" sequence at the end. And there are many more moments like this. You will recognize them if you see them. I also think this was a much more beautiful film visually than I expected it to be. No surprise and not undeserving that it won an Oscar for the cinematography.<br/><br/>Lastly, let me give you a parallel too, namely between this film and Whiplash, Chazelle's previous successful Oscar-winning work. I am not talking about the brief inclusion of J.K. Simmons here or about the fact that Chazelle is apparently right now the very best filmmaker on the planet when it comes to music-themed movies. I want to talk about love. The way he depicts it in both films, namely as a wonderful state that however becomes very fragile in the face of career development and a status that even needs to be sacrificed for individual happiness makes me wonder if I would categorize this movie as romance. Sure there are lines that somewhat make up for it like when they say they will always love each other, but overall, it's a pretty sober state of things when you see it in the grand scheme, here and in ""Whiplash"". Right/Wrong place, right/wrong time (i.e. coincidence) play a major role here and the message that you should never let your romantic feeling limit you in any way is absolute core for Chazelle apparently. And happiness is still happening eventually and there are no hard feelings as we learn from the final smile that may have ended their relationship once and for all and they will probably never see each other again afterward. And one final note, on why I believe that so many people relate to this movie. And this is one that has nothing to do with the subject of music at all. Stone's character could have been in any profession as we see a character fighting hard for her (professional) success and we all can relate to her and her struggles because even in completely different professions, we probably had been in exactly the same situation at some point. Now for a very last comment, let me ask you the question what you were thinking after Mia's one-person performance. Did you think her career was over after the mean comments? Then this tells you a lesson to care less what people think (about you or whatever) and let only your own opinion be the determining factor. Now your persuasion should be to watch ""La La Land"" as it is without a doubt one of the better films of 2016 and maybe even the best music film in recent time, even if I personally would not rank it anywhere near the vastly superior ""Whiplash"" or ""Les Mis√©rables""."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Mia (Emma Stone) is a barista on a Hollywood film set, who dreams of becoming a famous actress, but keeps having bad luck on auditions. She crosses paths with Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a brash, abrasive musician, who also wants to make it big, and is frustrated at anyone's inability to appreciate jazz. Although irritated by Sebastian's manner, Mia does admire his musical ability, and on this tender footnote they develop a friendship that blossoms into romance, and the ups and downs their paths take from this point.<br/><br/>Damian Chazelle's glossy celebration of Hollywood from a time gone by suffered at the cruel, mocking hands of fate in the most humiliating of ways over the last fortnight, when the unbelievable drama of Oscars night unfolded across the mainstream media and, after being announced as the winner of Best Picture, it turned out this was a mistake, and the award actually went to the urban drama Moonlight. While drawing more attention to this catastrophic farrago seems tactless, I had been planning to see it even if this hadn't happened, and Oscar embarrassment aside, it's still a swirling, magical re-ignition of a genre that was popular in the golden age of Hollywood.<br/><br/>While it's a celebration of something from a by-gone age, it's very much updated to modern times, capturing all the funk, style and spirit of the modern music and fashion scene, and so enthralling to those who are fans of musicals from the olden days, and appealing to those who are up on current trends. Considering the nature of both the main characters, lead stars Gosling and Stone are inspired choices, since their personalities match their demeaneurs so well, Gosling's moody, withdrawn but appealing character perfectly complimenting Stone's sturdy, downtrodden but hopeful and resilient heroine.<br/><br/>And, just so it doesn't forget what it is that makes it so appealing to modern audiences, the song and dance numbers are perfectly magical too, really springing to life at the right moments and lighting up an already beautiful homage to the bygone musical. ****"

With beautiful visuals, stirring music, and a touching story, La La Land is a thrillingly ambitious film that pays homage to classic Hollywood musicals while also standing fully on its own."

","Ineffable; (a.) too great or extreme to be expressed or described with words<br/><br/>I think that movies are an art. And the point of art is to move you, to make you feel something, to make you feel alive. La La Land did this incomparably. It's whimsical, colorful, big, bright, and BEAUTIFUL. I felt as though I had floated straight out of my seat to spin among the stars with them. It's something like... laughing in sunlight, walking while dizzy, looking at the stars, violently purple sunsets, the coolness of tears on your skin, laughing out loud, the sinking feeling after waking up from an amazing dream, driving fast, dancing without a care in the world, spinning in circles until you're laughing on the floor with the world spinning, hugging someone as tight as you can, and the heat of the sun on your skin all wrapped into one ineffable movie."
"randy_orton_fan","Null","3","9","26 February 2017"," Just a Stupid Musical
","This is another movie that shows that just because critics and the Academy call a movie amazing and ""one of the best picture of the year""doesn't mean the movie is actually worth paying money for or sitting through.<br/><br/>It's about a struggling actress who can't seem to get a gig and a struggling jazz musician who eventually gets a gig but Mia doesn't approve because it's ""Sebastian giving up his Jazz dream"" or some stupid nonsense like that. He accuses her of only liking him when he was unsuccessful and they go their separate ways. For whatever reason she gets a casting call and he has to go beg her to come back to do the audition. Cue lame musical scene #89 (that's an exaggeration) and he pats himself on the back for getting her a gig and they declare they will always love each other but don't get back together.<br/><br/>Cue a ""FIVE YEARS LATER"" time jump and she's married with a kid and finds he started his jazz club. Cue lame dream sequence where they imagine what life would be like had it worked out between them and movie ends.<br/><br/>This movie was so, so, so bad. I like Emma Stone and I've never had any issue with Ryan Gosling. But this movie was just terrible. Why is it so acclaimed? It's just a romance musical! <br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't pay for the ticket. I got invited to see it by a friend and she offered to pay because she didn't want to go by herself. Boy, am I glad my money didn't go towards the box office receipts of this stink fest. I'd feel personally offended if it did.<br/><br/>There are too many people out there who base what they think of a movie based on what the critics say or what awards they get nominated for, but frankly, those people need to start thinking for themselves. Because just because a movie is highly rated doesn't mean it's good. It just means that critics are pretentious and they think it makes them look ""cultured"" if they enjoy a musical like this.<br/><br/>Save yourself the time and energy."
"reklaw-45855","9","3","9","24 February 2017"," Not sure which was better. (Moulin Rouge or La La Land) But I loved them both!
","I have enjoyed every movie that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have appeared in together. But this was the best one so far. I had always been a Ryan Gosling fan. But it took me awhile to warm up to Stone. Though I think she is fantastic now! (I think I really became a fan after seeing her lip sync battle with Jimmy Fallon) She has a cute way about her, and her handling of emotional scenes is pretty great. <br/><br/>Very slight spoiler below..<br/><br/>I thought the ending of La La Land was very well done. Showing the sacrifices people make to reach their goals/dreams can be very painful choices. And also made me wonder what different choices could have been made to still be together while not selling out on ones goals."

","I don't normally subscribe to musicals but I was amazed by the opening number, and the subsequent 120 minutes which followed. Some would argue that the realistic aspects of the film clash with the musical numbers but they offer a contrast between the dreamlike illusion of movies and the every day facade of life. Damien Chazelle has emerged as a director to watch out for, his previous film ""Whiplash"" was in my opinion the best film of 2014, and Chazelle has done it once more for 2016. Both films feature endings that are as thrilling as they are emotionally satisfying.<br/><br/>Mike"

","By no means is a movie people will talk for a long time.<br/><br/>I couldn't see immediately so I have already heard too much. Several awards but people saying to be a little disappointed. So I went with less expectations and therefore I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It seems like a simple line, but at the same time underneath is the human comedy and tragedy.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, like entering in other world, colors and wardrobe are fantastic.<br/><br/>I love Jazz, therefore I did enjoyed the music, is extraordinary and luring. I read critics against the musical capability of actors, but I found it authentic. In some numbers is just gorgeous.<br/><br/>I am not sure how to judge acting, but I guess it convinced me, once you accept the premises of the film so fair enough for me. Emma is not the most beautiful actress, but is so attractive, particularly her smile! <br/><br/>Not spoilers but I expected a different finale, but perhaps this way of twisting, is what make the movie even more controversial.<br/><br/>Go with no expectations and judge it yourself."
"alex-klein2424","9","3","9","20 February 2017"," California Dreaming
","The first time I saw this movie was before my resolution to write reviews on all theater movies but I just saw it for a second time which was a very good choice. Being able to watch and enjoy twice added because I was able to not only appreciate the story but see a lot of the technical side, too. <br/><br/>This movie is a perfect romance. The story of not just two people falling in love but two people falling in love with their craft. Ryan Gosling loves jazz and wants to open a jazz bar, and Emma Stone loves acting and aspires to be an actress. The movie follows them through the changing seasons of a year as their relationship develops and they strive for their goals. Oh and there is singing.<br/><br/>I think what changed for me upon second viewing was that I did not enjoy Emma as much as the first time. She is a fine actor but some of her mannerisms threw me especially her singing. Goslings singing wasn't fantastic either but I like that both of them are just being real with their voices and aren't some famous singer like the cameos by John Legend that I still didn't like even on the first viewing. <br/><br/>What changed in a good way was that, again, the technical aspect was amazing. The camera work and coloring along with the directing and cinematography were all spot on. I found myself many times marveling at a certain shot or way that the camera follows people around a busy highway or crowded room. As with before, my favorite part is the ending flashback of what could have been that is so clever and enjoyable I would be fine just watching that part. <br/><br/>There is one final glare that I would like to address and that is the theme of this movie. It has already won massive awards including all seven of it's nominations at the golden globes and will no doubt be represented at the Oscars. This is a movie by Hollywood, for Hollywood, about Hollywood and I don't like that at all. To me it feels like a cop out. Any film maker knows that if they make a good movie about Hollywood that Hollywood will eat it up and give it every accolade that it can give and La La Land is no exception. It angers me because in a year with movies like Arrival, Moonlight, and Manchester by the Sea, I have a bad feeling that La La Land will dominate Oscars as well just because it is a movie about Hollywood and the voters are all Hollywood. Hopefully I am wrong but throughout the entire movie there is that lingering wink towards Hollywood and actors and actresses that this movie is for them which is unnecessary because every movie they make is for them, they don't need extra praise."

Each becomes preoccupied in achieving their dreams. The movie clearly depicts the fact that you have to make some heart breaking sacrifices to make your dreams come true.<br/><br/>I hope Emma & Ryan will win an Oscar for their terrific performances.

"atlasmb","9","3","9","14 February 2017"," A Hollywood Romance
","Why was ""La La Land"" nominated for 14 Oscars, tying the most noms ever? It invokes the fantasies and feelings of many past musicals and numerous film romances. From its opening scene, I found myself noticing the nods to other films because of story or style, including ""Fame"", ""Dirty Dancing"", ""Moulin Rouge"", ""The Way We Were"". ""Invitation to the Dance"", ""An American in Paris"", ""Funny Face"", ""A Star is Born"", ""A Chorus Line"", and especially ""One From the Heart""--Coppola's musical in-studio masterpiece of camera techniques.<br/><br/>It is easy to understand its popularity in Hollywood. Its views on acting as a profession are very relatable for actors.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play the romantic leads and are credible singers and dancers. Gosling even plays the keyboards for his part.<br/><br/>Mandy Moore (""So You Think You Can Dance"") provides the choreography, including duets for the two stars that are reminiscent of Astaire's work.<br/><br/>Gosling plays a jazz musician, so the film's soundtrack has a jazz-infused sensibility that reminded me of Swing Out Sister's ""Breakout"". Two of the songs written by the Hurwitz/Pasek & Paul team are nominated for Oscars. One won the Golden Globe, though personally I prefer the other.<br/><br/>Will ""La La Land"" win all 14 nominations? No, but it has a shot at as many as 9. For those who love romantic films, well-made, it is a joy to experience. The ending of the film provides a surprise twist that expounds on the film's conception of life (and love) as cinematic experience."
"johan123456","10","3","9","7 February 2017"," Repentance
","I have always seen myself as an atheist in terms of musical genre. I simply have not believed in the genre; I have considered it to be extinct, painfully melodramatic, pathetic exaggerated, yes, the list of negative words ‚Äã‚Äãassociated with musicals goes on ... But then I saw La La Land, and now I'm a believer.<br/><br/>The film is a punch in the face, on several levels. It is a liberating punch in the face against my cynical, intellectual and rational calculating side. To paraphrase Sebastian, one of the film's characters, the word ""romance"" should not be used in a bad sentence - and this film made me regain confidence in the romance.<br/><br/>The film is also a punch in the face regarding all technical elements, such as photo, scenery, costumes, music, etc. Pure enjoyment! The scene when the camera (Linus Sandgren) jumps into the pool to the accompaniment of music and dance, is brilliant! <br/><br/>Finally, the film is also a punch in the face in terms of the emotional journey the audience goes through. I must say that the end is ingenious! (Spoiler alert) First, the director Chazelle reminds the viewer of the deep, sweet love. Then he strengthens the love. And just when we think the love story has reached it's climax, then we got a stab. Chazelle stabs us right in the heart. Ingeniously bittersweet!<br/><br/>Without this ending, the film would not be as emotional as it is. The bittersweet is more emotionally and physically tangible than the sweet and sentimental. James Cameron used this recipe in Titanic and it became a big win, and I think La La Land will receive the same fate."

","I didn't see top reviews coming from laymen when it comes to musicals. The too praising come off as insincere or pretentious, while the too critical feel snobbish and honestly a little psychopathic .. <br/><br/>It does a fantastic job of letting the viewer take away the meaning of the relationship based on your own personal experiences. If you're jaded, like myself, then be prepared to open old wounds. The ending felt as if I was being talked to directly, and held my hand down a dark tunnel of thought. Where i was forced to evaluate decisions and there unfortunate consequences. <br/><br/>It's a little ironic how it's being judged harshly when it comes to plays, since Ryan Goslings character IS them and harbors same feelings but with jazz instead.. but hey, I am young and dumb so what do I know."
"taylorhammons","9","3","9","4 February 2017"," Critics are failing to see this movie for what it is
","Let me start out by saying, I loved this movie. It didn't pretend to be anything it wasn't, it was just fun- something I usually look for in a movie. The problem is, the critics of this movie are trying to shoehorn it into categories it has no business being in, trying to force it into being something it's not. Well, then what is it? In order to answer that question, we must first answer the question of what it is not. <br/><br/>1. It's not a copycat, 1950's musical. I will admit, I loved some of the throwbacks to the old timey musicals of the glory days of Hollywood. Singing in the Rain is probably my all time favorite movie, so seeing La La Land pay homage to it, as well as some other classics, certainly made me happy. But that's all it was: an homage. This movie certainly had the feel of the iconic '50s musical ,but it's not. It's a modern adaptation of those musicals, one which allows us to see the flaws in the '50s musical way of looking at life.Comparing this film to others will not allow you to see it for what it truly is: a gem in and of itself . <br/><br/>2. It's not a mind bender. While there are definitely lessons and messages to be taken from this movie, reading to much into it causes you to lose sight of what it truly is. While there's certainly a place for the mind blowing, soul searching storytelling that we see in movies like Inception and Schindlers List, there's also a place for a story that just allows you to enjoy yourself, to laugh, maybe cry a little, to sit back and sing along as you allow yourself to have a good time. <br/><br/>So we've established what it's not, what it doesn't need to be compared to, so then what is La La Land? <br/><br/>1. It's a reversal of the traditional Hollywood stereotypes. You know the kind. The aforementioned '50s musicals are famous for them, although there are countless other examples throughout cinematic history. Boy with dreams meets girl with dreams, love gets in the way of dreams, love finds a way to overcome all odds, guy and girl both get to live our dreams with the love of their lives and ride off into the sunset together. Roll credits. How many movies do you know that fit that storyline? Because I can think of about a dozen off the top of my head. That's not how real life works, ladies and gentlemen. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you want to fulfill your dreams, or if you want to have a classic Hollywood romance, you're going to have to make sacrifices. Likely, you're going to have to choose one over the other. This film does what I've seen no other do: it allows the characters to make those sacrifices, to separate amicably, and still be happy. They don't regret their decisions. They are happy, even though they wish they didn't have to make those sacrifices. Through the traditional Hollywood ending that it montages at the end, you see how the musicals of old would have ended this film, what it could be. And then you see what is. The reality of the struggles of being a musician, of being an actress. It's hard. It takes sacrifice. And it allows the audience to see the effects of that sacrifice.<br/><br/>2. The music parallels what's happening in the story and continues the reversing of Hollywood stereotypes. A Lovely Night is essentially the polar opposite of every Hollywood meeting. And it's exactly what happens in real life. They know they like each other. We know they like each other. But they're not about to admit it to the other one. In fact, they're going to sing for 2 minutes about how they don't like each other. And Start a Fire is essentially the Hollywood version of love. Like the music that they want Sebastian to play, Start a Fire is a representation of what Hollywood pretends romance to be: dumbed down for the masses, all passion and no substance. Likewise, The Fools Who Dream glamorized the appeal of a career in Hollywood. It's all about the perks, and nothing about the hard labor and the sacrifices. . Perfectly placed and expertly written, the soundtrack is an excellent contrast to what a traditional Hollywood film would have done with this storyline. It allows you to see what Hollywood would have done with it, while at the same time, turning the whole notion on its head with the story itself .<br/><br/>3. It allows you to have fun. As I said, this movie can be sad, particularly at the end. And yet, it's thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. It doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. It's sappy. It's cheesy. The actors aren't the best singers or dancers. So what? It's fun. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me go out and buy the soundtrack, for goodness sakes, something I rarely ever do. It's just fun. And it proves that movies don't have to be any more than that. <br/><br/>So let the critics rail on this movie. Let them say it's overrated. I still maintain that they're trying to make it into something it was never meant to be. And I firmly believe that, if you see it for what it is, you will enjoy it just as much as I did. Say what you want, but I will be belting out every word to The Fools Who Dream in my car for years to come."
"Ed-Shullivan","10","3","9","3 February 2017"," ooo-lah-lah !!!
","Friday is date night and tonight it was my turn to pick the picture. To Mrs. Shullivan's surprise I picked the musical La La Land. Normally I would have picked a comedy or a good thriller, but we both wanted to see why there were so many mixed reactions to this feature film. It seemed to be a 50/50 split between loved it and hated it. With us two Shullivan's we were not on the fence, we both loved it.<br/><br/>Okay so neither star Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone can sing or dance very well but that was some of the charm emanating from La La Land and this will certainly be a memorable romantic/musical film for decades to come. I don't rely on determining the quality of a film based on how many Academy award nominations and/or wins a film may be awarded because as far as the awards shows go most are just for the pompous farts who produce their own films and they do not like to share significant awards at all. Thus we never see any comedies or action/thrillers even receiving award nominations, just some really big box office revenues. So who needs awards shows when you have everyday critics like IMDb viewers who provide realistic feedback, sometimes good, sometimes bad.<br/><br/>What Mrs. Shullivan and I liked most was the latter half of the film as jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and wannabe actress Mia (Emma Stone) resolved their personal issues with each other and they bonded as live-in partners in support of each others dreams. Of course in any relationship there are highs and lows and Sebastian and Mia certainly had their share of ups and let downs. <br/><br/>We loved the bright rich diverse colors of all the actors and dancers costumes as well as the rich hue of the Hollywood California landscapes that writer/director Damien Chazelle integrated into many of the song and dance numbers. The cinematography was brilliant during the song and dance numbers performed by all of the cast, especially Ryan and Emma's significant song and dance number that is displayed as the film's cover art. This scene takes place just after Sebastian and Mia leave a party together as they first get to know each other a little bit better than just as acquaintances'. As I said maybe Ryan and Emma are not classically trained singers/dancers but how many of us normal couples fell in love while listening to great music and shaking the old hips 'ala one, two three? Isn't that what makes romance such a magical experience.<br/><br/>I do not want to give away the ending but I will say that this musical has some unexpected twists and turns that in my humble opinion make this what will be considered a classic musical/romance in the following decades that hopeless romantics (like Mrs Shullivan and I) will want to see a couple of times in their lifetime, maybe even with their teenage grandchildren who will also fall in love with La La Land for many generations to come.<br/><br/>This film covers Sebastian and Mia's relationship as it evolves over all four seasons and then some with new musical numbers that include songs by the world class musician John Legend, some old style 1950's big dance numbers with vibrant costumes and reminiscent of Martha and the Vandellas who would in 1983 sing ""they would be dancing in the streets"", literally. <br/><br/>There is no mixed feelings about this film for Mrs. Shullivan and I, we don't care how many Academy awards La La Land wins or loses. All you really need to know is that we loved the film, yes it will eventually be rated as a classic musical/romance film and yes I am giving it a five star rating, a perfect 10 for 10 score. We simply just loved it, from the beginning and especially through to the ending."

","Amazing movie! A new way of making musicals that even people that don't like these type of movies comes out surprise after seen it. Emma Stone made a excellent job even though she had a hard time learning the dancing parts. A must see movie of this century. The musics in the soundtrack are amazing, all of them especially the City of Stars, A Lovely Night and the Audition one. The fact that Damien Chazelle brought back the importance of the jazz and how it has been forgotten through generations, brings back the beauty of it into a generation of people. Definitely the best picture nominated in this years Oscar. A picture of the real world and the difficult of pursuing your dreams, the rough path to make it and the big ""What if?"" that make us think in the things that are throw in our way and that changes our journey."

","I have never written a review before on IMDb. But I have to say a couple of things about this film.<br/><br/>It wasn't all about love, It was also about life itself. It was so real. There was sadness and happiness at the same time. The film was so colourful but it wasn't girly at all. It was't like the other clich√©<br/><br/>Hollywood films. The soundtrack, the casting, the costumes were all great. I watched Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together in ""Crazy,<br/><br/>Stupid, Love"" and ""Gangster Squad"" too. But these two films were not that stunning. Maybe the scenario wasn't good enough. But their roles in ""La La Land"" were perfect for them. That's why they both are nominated for ""Best Actor"" and ""Best Actress"" Oscars."

","""City of stars¬Ö are you shining just for me?""<br/><br/>Mia, an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian, a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.<br/><br/>Before I dive into the film I'd like to say that I stick to my ""no spoiler"" style and that this is a really biased review, taking into account that my partner and I are both actors dreaming and planning to move to the ""City of Stars"", therefore you can guess how I felt about ""La La Land"".<br/><br/>""La La Land"" mixes perfectly the nostalgia of the golden age of Hollywood musicals with an old story, wannabe artist move to Los Angeles thinking she is going to make it, dreams crush, has to work doing something she is not passionate about.<br/><br/>This could have led us nowhere but this is where Damien Chazelle succeeds, he knows exactly what he is talking about, if you've seen ""Whiplash"" you get an idea of where this guy is coming from, some of his themes are repeated here: jazz, perfection, dreams about succeeding on what you love, difficult choices: love or giving your 100% to what you love.<br/><br/>Mia and Seb ( Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling) are two unique creatures lucky enough to find each other, two dreamers, two of a kind that we recognize. I can't think of any other actors that could have done this job better than Gosling and Stone, both have this quality that makes us believe whatever the do, they're not acting, they're living and breathing these characters, their chemistry is great, it looks like if one is about to fall the other is ready for the rescue and we want them so badly to love each other and make us dream with them.<br/><br/>The score is a triumph , Justin Hurwitz you're a fantastic composer, every song is moving and heartfelt which is very rare these days, where everything feels too much in your face, the music becomes another character in the film, taking us into a journey where we feel as the characters, hopeful, passionate, discourage but always willing to carry on with the show.<br/><br/>And all that jazz¬Ö I'm devoted to jazz since I was a child and I saw ""The Talent of Mr. Ripley"", since then I've been obsessed by it and as Seb, I don't understand people who don't like it. Jazz contributes on creating rhythm , is like life, improvise, stop, wait, carry on, listen, play solo, go with the band, and this is how ""La La Land"" feels.<br/><br/>Last but not least, J. K. Simmons, is there anything not to love about this man? Doesn't matter how much on screen time he gets, he is pure magic and has a wonderful moment that I won't spoilt but it really puts a smile on your face.<br/><br/>As I said, this review is totally biased, I still feel that the fourteen Oscar nominations are well deserved and this a must watch for 2017 and one of the best musicals I've seen in ages.

","Before watching this movie i know that this movie is gonna be good, because i've hear ed a lot of good reviews and ratings on this movie and also i love musical movies and Broadway. All i can say on this movie that it was fantastic. One of the things i love on this movie is the story telling the way they tell the story especially that ending probably one of the best ending i've seen on a movie or any videos i've seen. The songs definitely fits the movie, i feel like on the first minutes of the movie they sing too much song but as the movie goes by i feel like is the Right thing. I love the costume that they use it definitely fits the movie also Ryan gosling. I've noticed that Ryan gosling used the same shoes or maybe i'm wrong. Also the lighting fits on the movie. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is probably one of the best things on the movie, the way he carry's his character is so natural especially his singing and piano skills (GOLD) Also Emma Stone is good, awesome performance. John Legend character feels like just a cameo but still good.<br/><br/>Some minor things that i don't like on the movie is the transition on scene to scene. I feel like it's a little bit fast especially on the summer time the transition looks like awkward, The way Emma stone said that she hate jazz feels kinda force and the transition to the ending.<br/><br/>So that's my take on the movie La la land, it's definitely must see movie, probably one of the best movie i've because i love musical's. I will not be surprise if this movie dominated Oscar because it's really good. I will give this movie a 9/10."

"filmsbyq","9","3","9","18 January 2017"," La La Land - how musicals should be.
","Damien Chazelle loves music. Jazz music to be more precise. A quick peruse through his IMDb credits shows that. Writer-director Chazelle made one of my favourite films of 2015 in the brilliant Whiplash, an intense study of a young music college student, who longs to be a great drummer and the maniacal music mentor, who drives him to the brink. Whiplash soundtrack is an ode to jazz, with classic jazz staples played throughout.<br/><br/>For his follow-up film, Chazelle once again shows his great affection for jazz. A very different film in every other aspect, La La Land is an extraordinary film, whilst still showing a Clint Eastwood-esque level of love for jazz.<br/><br/>Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress, working as a barista in LA. As well as working, she is caught up in the soul-destroying circus of audition attending, that is the lot of actors everywhere. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a pianist. A jazz pianist. He can play other things, but he only wants to play jazz, much to his own detriment. He dreams of opening a nightclub where like-minded individuals can come and eat chicken and listen to jazz.<br/><br/>Mia and Sebastian first meet, briefly, on the LA freeway, where a tailgating Sebastian, angrily sounds his horn at the inert Mia as she sits it the traffic learning lines for an audition. They cross paths again when, having had her car towed after a night out, Mia wanders into a bar and is captivated by the piano player; Sebastian. When she goes to compliment him on his playing, he brushes past her, ignoring her completely. Their next meeting is at a party where Sebastian is working as part of an eighties tribute act, playing the keyboard. When leaving the party, Sebastian saves Mia from a boring writer and their relationship flourishes on the walk to her car.<br/><br/>Everything is great until they realise that their individual dreams will ultimately take them away from one another. So it proves when Sebastian decides to shelve his dream of 'pure' jazz and a nightclub, to join an old friend, Keith's (John Legend) modern jazz band, thus beginning a life of touring. Meanwhile, encouraged by Sebastian, Mia writes a one-woman stage show, that flops on the opening night. Crushed by its failure and disappointed that Sebastian could not be there for the show, she leaves town and goes to her parents.<br/><br/>Sebastian receives a call from an agent looking for Mia. He goes and finds her and tells she must do the audition. The audition is successful but the job entails going to Paris. Mia takes the job. Five years pass. Mia is a star. Sebastian has a nightclub. They are no longer together.<br/><br/>That is the bare bones of the story, but La La Land is so much more than that. For one thing, it is a musical. I am not a big fan of modern musicals. I love the classics; West Side Story, Sound Of Music, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, My Fair Lady, Singing In The Rain and so many more, those fifties and sixties, technicolored extravaganzas, that had characters burst into song for no reason other than it seemed right too. La La Land is that kind of musical. From the opening number, I was hooked.<br/><br/>Unlike some modern musicals penchant for singing every line, La La Land goes the tried and trusted route of songs interspersing with the story. The songs enhance the story, maybe not the dance routines so much, but the energy and commitment of Gosling and Stone make even the musical indulgences a pleasure.<br/><br/>Neither actor is what you would term a 'singer', but their ability to carry a tune is more than adequate in the film, both singing - and dancing - their parts happily as if veteran stage performers. They also really work as a screen couple, which I feel is down to Stone's innate, doe-eyed, femininity.<br/><br/>Even though it was the strong character of Olive in Easy A that brought Emma Stone to worldwide attention, as an actor, she has not felt the need, it seems, to take on feminist icon roles, her roles to date being a mixture of lead and supporting lead parts. Gosling does Gosling. That is not a criticism. In this film, as the jazz classics obsessed Sebastian, it absolutely works. His cool detachment and suppressed emotion, contrast with his total passion for the music, the connection, that is jazz. You believe that he lives for the music.<br/><br/>The film is also a bit of an LA travelogue, making the watcher yearn to visit LA. Colours are crisp and bright, city visages, clear and inviting. The greatest compliment I can pay this film is that I am not sure I can ever visit Los Angeles. To find out that it is not actually like Chazelle's La La Land would be a massive disappointment. You may never go to Los Angeles but you should definitely go see La La Land. Beautiful."
"alindsay-al","9","3","9","16 January 2017"," A fantastic unique loveletter to musicals
","I had heard so much about this film that I knew I had to see it and I have now seen la la land as I really really love this film. The premise of this film sees a jazz pianist fall in love with a failing actress and we see there journey. Ryan gosling plays Sebastian the jazz pianist and he is fantastic in this film, he just has so much charisma in this film and you see him as the coolest guy in any film. He has such a passion for jazz that you want to see him succeed and you buy him as a character. Emma stone plays Mia the failing actress and she is truly great in this film, she is incredibly relatable and like gosling you want to see her succeed in her dreams and you really care about her character. Gosling and stones chemistry is what really carries this movie and I ended up caring about There relationship as the film progresses and develops. However, my one negative in this film is the fact there is a supporting cast in this film that is just there to sing and dance which I thought could have been used in a better way. There is a cameo in this film that I didn't know was coming so I am not going to spoil it in case you have missed it too but it was gratifying. But it does make you wish this cameo was in this film allot more. The story is a great journey of two people that have different passions but you see there relationship develop and you really care about how there relationship develops throughout there movie and how both characters own personal journey takes twists and turns that are great to watch. The script has great dialogue that make these characters charming and relatable to anybody really. But when the drama hits it also feels pretty real and you see the drama play out very well. The style of this film is probably the most unique thing about this film, this is a loveletter to musicals of old and it does it pretty well the songs are memorable and catchy and it does help the main characters characterization. The dance moves are also great and helps make this an easy watch. Overall I liked this movie and then for the next few hours I was thinking about the film and I ended up loving it, so even if you are not a fan of musicals this is worth a watch."

The movie is simply sensational - I rarely go to a movie and get up at 6:30 the next morning haunted by details and trying to find explanations and sense.<br/><br/>Really, go to the cinema and get past the first 20 minutes.

","La la land is a spectacular piece of cinema. In fact I would go as far as to say that it is not a film but more of an emotional journey that both the characters and audience go through.<br/><br/>The acting and dance choreography is very impressive and has clearly taken along time to perfect but it is definitely time well spent as the finished product is dazzling to watch. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have an excellent screen presence that really draws you in and makes you look that ever bit closer at every frame. <br/><br/>The cinematography of the movie is beautiful and the shots in the film are like paintings. The vibrant colours and camera movement are everything that's good about the film industry that somehow went missing. From watching the film it is clear that director Damien Chazelle had a strong vision that he and his cast and crew brought to life. <br/><br/>The music of La la land is hypnotic and makes you feel nostalgic. It is strange how it works its way into your mind. I have a feeling that I will be humming along to the tune of La la Land for awhile. <br/><br/>The ending of the film is very refreshing and I am tremendously glad that the film ended in the way that it did. I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a passion for cinema or who simply just loves to watch a good film. On paper I could see how this film could be a gamble from the perspective of a producer, but I am happy that the gamble was taken and I have no doubt the La la Land will go down as a classic. Overall I would give La la Land 8 out of 10 as it is one of the best films I have watched in a long time."

","I want to think about there are very worthy comments about cinematography and technical details that I don't know for this picture. But, I couldn't imagine which romance movie can make me excited. There are several reasons why I loved La La Land.
First of all, Damien Chazelle could choose masters of love or the most popular actors and actresses that people love them such as Eyes Wide Shut. But, Chazelle wanted to tell another story between man and women different from classic romance movie.
Secondly, some magnificent landmarks of Los Angeles inspired me to travel. That landmarks has been used like a painting that I want to buy for my home. So, that is precious to most of us.
Third, the soundtrack of La La Land is magical. Justin Hurwitz, who made them and won two oscars makes a perfect defination about jazz. Every single record touch my emotions and I probably listen them at the traffic, sleeping, studying rest of my life.
As a result, I think most of people can find something precious about love, art, or life experience from La La Land. The saying ""Why do you love that, it's overrated"" is unfair."

","I must confess I could not finish it and that is RARE for me. I hated the CHOICES the director made, the camera angles, the dance moves, the plot points, the Ryan Gosling character 'jazz musician' was pure phoniness. Jazz musicians are not poet-hermits, they are in constant group interchanges and complex inter-relationships. It is the very essence of the authentic jazz scene.

","I have no idea how this musical saw the light of day or how this movie of it has garnered an 8+ stars here on IMDB. Weak is the one word that comes to mind after watching this. Weak songs, weak story ... just weak.<br/><br/>I'm a big Ryan Gosling fan and saw this in a list of great movies of this century so far and watched it because I didn't know he could sing. He does fine but there aren't many demands put on his voice. This is odd though since the leading man in this musical doesn't really have a signature song that showcases his voice. But then the 'signature song' from this musical, the one that won the Oscar, is forgettable. Completely forgettable. I mean I couldn't whistle it with a gun to my head.<br/><br/>And speaking of whistling, let's just put this musical to the Old Grey Whistle Test. This is an old English theatre district test where you stand outside the theatre as people leave and if the old gray-haired patrons are whistling a tune or two from the show, it's going to be a hit. There isn't one song in this musical that could pass that test ... and since I'm an old gray-haired guy I can tell you there isn't even a phrase I could whistle. Even the little phrase they repeated half a dozen times or more can't be summoned up. I'm a musician. I can hold onto a chunk of new music in my head if it's memorable. None of these songs were.<br/><br/>And what happened to the forty-five minutes or so in the middle of the movie when it stopped being a musical completely?? Okay, a musical is a show where everybody is singing their lines (for the most part) rather than just speaking them. There's a huge chunk of this movie that has no singing at all. What happened?<br/><br/>Really? 8+ stars? I don't see it."

The film has a generic digital look and at times feels like GLEE the movie, with overhearsed dance sequences and generic tunes; only one repeated refrain makes the viewer feel anything.

"leb-90382","10","2","5","27 September 2017"," Intro to Film Class Online Review
","I have never seen La La Land before, but I had heard mixed reviews. After finally seeing it almost a year late, I must express that La La Land exceeded my expectations and literally blew me away. The main female lead Mia played by the brilliant Emma Stone, works at a coffee shop on a movie set in LA dreaming of landing a role in Hollywood someday. The male lead Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling dreams of owning a jazz club, trying to make sure jazz will not die with the older generation. They set out on their dreams together while being romantically involved. The story of Mia and Sebastians adventures teaches us that you're never too old to chase your dreams, and that giving up when you fail is not an option. Overall, I thought the plot was pretty basic and clich√©, however the chemistry between Stone and Gosling was memorable. The determination of the characters trying to chase their dreams gave the audience a heartfelt story and definitely was an all around ""feel good"" movie. La La Land is a modern spin off of our favorite classical musicals Singin' in the Rain, Casa Blanca, and many others. As a musical theatre enthusiast, I enjoyed the filmmakers choices to make La La Land an ""ode to the originals"". Connecting to classic musical films spoke to younger generations in a way to show them that the ""oldies"" shaped modern musical theatre into what it is today. The production design for the movie was absolutely brilliant. The use of vibrant colors through costumes and lighting brought the story to life. The main color choices of red, yellow, and blue grabbed the audience's attention and made each scene stunning. The choreography in each dance number was lyrical and stylized, again brought the story to life. It made it seem as if I wasn't in class watching the film, I was actually there. Much credit given to the choreographer for putting on the most memorable dance number of the film, the opening scene ""Another day of Sun"". The accuracy of synchronization made the number exciting, upbeat, and concrete. Overall, I was very impressed with the film. I thought the plot was good, the songs were classical, and the colors were vibrant. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys musical theatre."

","Had this musical won the Oscar for best picture of the year, there would have been an outcry far greater than when An American in Paris won in 1951. Both these musicals suffered from a complete lack of plot.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes of this film is a complete waste. Gosling and Stone even killed the Oscar winning song when they sang it. Their dancing was no Fred and Ginger either.<br/><br/>The story might have taken off once they attained success but their careers would separate them.<br/><br/>The film by itself could put you in la-la land. This was a real sleeper of major proportions. The Academy must have been in la-la land when they were voting Stone as best actress and other awards. Warren Beatty, you're certainly vindicated for naming the wrong film, this one, as the best picture. Film needs to be put asleep."

","This movie started out very well. A Broadway type production in Hollywood! However, it soon became , not an expose on tinsel town, but Motown. The show featured the main character Ryan Gosling, in a black Rapp band playing music, which he doesn't like, because of the monetary rewards. The other Canadian actress, his sister, is soon killed by bears. I was left concluding at the end of this film, that it is much closer in themes to the Planet of the Apes movies, than to real live America. A tragedy, where two Canadian immigrants are killed by white- hate groups."
"hatsunemiku-27340","10","2","5","11 September 2017"," Subverting Expectations
","La La Land is, without a doubt, one of the best technical films I've ever seen. There's so much going on, minutiae you'd miss after three or four viewings. For instance, notice how Emma Stone's character is pretty much without make-up through the whole movie. It's jarring given we've seen her wearing make-up heavily through much of her career. Here we see her raw and clear until she becomes a movie star. Then, suddenly, it's the Emma we know, wearing makeup and more artificially beautiful because of it.<br/><br/>La La Land starts with a big happy musical number that doesn't fit in and I think is the weakest part of the whole film. It sets the optimistic and glamorous tone but has no bearing on the story. As it goes along through the first twenty or so minutes we see Mia (Emma Stone) living a fantasy life essentially, doing everything she can to make it big in Hollywood while making coffee for the stars. Everything is bright and colorful, the music is reminiscent of the golden age of Hollywood musicals. It's a fun time.<br/><br/>Cut to Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and his mundane, poor, uninteresting life. He's basically in the same boat as Mia. They're both struggling to make it in Hollywood, him in music, she in acting. But the colors of the film are more subdued here, there's not a bright palette and the scenery isn't dreamlike and fake. He lives in the real world.<br/><br/>It takes a little while before these two characters get together, but when they do the film is wonderfully whimsical and almost satirical. My favorite moment of the first half is when Emma Stone just happens to have tap dancing shoes in her bag for a big musical number. The movie knows the tropes and does everything it can to either subvert them, or make a joke of them.<br/><br/>The romance is wonderfully human, with great chemistry between Gosling and Stone. They're funny and likable, awkward and sweet.<br/><br/>And then the movie begins to turn.<br/><br/>La La Land's final act is not forcibly depressing but it does bring the fantastical down to the human level again. It goes from a tale of romance and chasing your dreams to how attaining your dreams mean giving up the things you love, selling out. The final montage, a beautifully realized and extremely effective culmination of every emotion in the movie, is a middle finger to convention as well as a reflection on all the choices we make in life that have left us in the predicaments we are in. Everyone has wondered what their life would be like had they done A, B, C, etc. It's a touching finish because it subverts our expectations for this type of movie while also applying that subversion to our own lives.<br/><br/>Another piece of the film I loved was the jazz storyline, how Sebastian was forced to sell out to the modern jazz he seems to have disdain for in order to make a living. It's an interesting case of selling out that's handled extremely well. Mia doesn't mind the music and I would go so far as to say that John Legend's song in the film, a modern jazz tune, is the best piece in the whole movie. But while the movie is celebrating classic jazz, it also celebrates the idea of metamorphosing jazz to fit with the modern day.<br/><br/>La La Land is actually my favorite movie of the year so far and I can't stop humming some of the music. It sticks with you long after watching and is so packed with exceptional technical prowess that you can't help but be enchanted by the films spell. The script, the music, the cinematography, the sets, the costume design, the acting; it all combines to create a movie that is both a throwback to classic Hollywood romance and musical films while subverting every expectation and bringing them to a human and realistic level. It's an absolute masterpiece of a film."
"Bob Pr.","10","2","5","3 September 2017"," A new form of musical movie
","I was eager to see this movie after hearing it had won so many Oscars but it left my local movie house too soon and all 18 of my public library's DVD copies of the film were checked out with a waiting list over a month long. So I rented a copy and am quite glad I did.<br/><br/>Near the very beginning, this movie has a scene that tells you that expected reality will be occasionally dismissed in favor of music and dance: As hundreds of cars become temporarily halted on one of LA's multi-lane trafficways (those of us who've driven there know that's realistic), one person gets out and starts dancing and soon that serves as the catalyst to prompt 100s of others to do the same thing (pure fantasy).<br/><br/>The primary characters are Mia (Emma Stone) and Seb (Ryan Gosling). Emma is an aspiring actress/playwright who temporarily works as a barrista in a coffee shop until she can get her break. Seb is a jazz pianist in a club where he's forced to play the kind of music he doesn't like so he aspires to own his own club in which he can feature the kind of music he favors. <br/><br/>The two meet, develop into a romantic couple, consoling and finding various ways to support and/or rescue each other when needed. They each do finally get their ""Big Break"" -- Emma as the lead in a movie that'll be filmed in Paris and Seb in a traveling band that pays him enough to accrue enough money to start his own club in LA.<br/><br/>""LaLa Land"" (""La"" is a ""play"" on ""L.A."" for Los Angeles) has lots of spots where the viewer must infer what is happening or has happened because we don't see it unfold or be dramatically portrayed in the film. E.g., when Mia is shown back in LA from Paris with a child and a husband who's not Seb, that suddenly strikes us viewers that the Mia-Seb relationship won't be one in which ""they'll live happily together ever after."" With her husband, Mia & Seb do later meet (in Seb's new, apparently successful club), comfortably & briefly acknowledging each other, but continuing on in their separate ways no doubt privately grateful for the role the other did play in bringing each to their new levels. <br/><br/>But that's also quite realistic, isn't it? -- I think many of us are grateful for how our loves in the past have helped us to go on to new levels. So perhaps this ""LaLa Land"" will prompt other film makers to experiment with finding new ways of combining music & dance with human hopes and more realistic outcomes."

","Mia Dolan is an aspiring actress working at a coffee shop at Warner Studios and Sebastian Wilder is a jazz pianist reduced to playing familiar Christmas tunes in a restaurant¬Ö inevitably they are going to meet. Actually they meet three times before they finally get together. It first it appears that they won't get along; their earlier meetings were fairly confrontational and then she tells him that she hates his beloved jazz. Not surprisingly though they form a relationship but things aren't perfect; they each encourage the other but when one of them compromises on their dream and finds success that takes them away while the other struggles with their own dream.<br/><br/>I'd heard great things about this film and while it wasn't quite as amazing as some reviews suggested it was still a delight to watch. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are impressive as our two protagonists; the rest of the cast are solid enough but it is the two leads who dominate. The songs are decent enough but didn't feel too memorable; of course this may be because I've only watched the film once. The story does occasionally go in directions I didn't expect. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who wants a feel-good musical that harks back to the classic era for the genre rather than relying on familiar songs."

","The production is slick. Supporting roles are strong -- casting John Legend as a musician takes money, I guess, but it's an easy 'win.' But making a musical requires leads who can sing and dance. Gosling can't sing at all well, and Emma Stone simply can't produce pleasant sounds. Neither can dance at all well, and in at least one scene Stone not only danced badly, but repeated her moves (a failed trick in Flashdance, and no better here). The movie lasts too long, given its weak themes, and then, when it could be stopped and the audience blessedly released, it generates an alternate ending (no visible reason for this dodge) that makes it another 20 minutes or so long. If I were at home I would have turned it off, but my significant other had a very large bucket of popcorn to finish, so I had to sit through it."

","Plot; An aspiring actress and a struggling jazz musician try to balance their burgeoning love with chasing their dreams.<br/><br/>I should preface this review by saying that as a rule, I don't like musicals. That makes me a less than ideal candidate for this breathlessly praised Oscar winner, but I felt an itch to see what all the hype was about.<br/><br/>La La Land is certainly pretty to look at. Having only just passingly watched the trailers, I'd assumed it was a period piece. Imagine my surprise a minute in when a group of Prius driving Los Angelinos break into song on the highway. It's a contemporary setting shot in a classic style, and it helps to soften the modern edges and give it a golden age feel. The Los Angeles board of tourism should send writer/director Damien Chazelle¬†some flowers.¬†Unfortunately the musical numbers, the beating heart of any musical, are very weak. By their very nature, such songs are typically right on the nose ""I'm in love!"" ""I'm sad!"", but they're also supposed to be tuneful, and the numbers here barely pass muster (What does it say when I found the intentionally wonky covers of 80s new wave tunes to be far and away the best songs in the movie?). The accompanying dance numbers are reasonably well done and help to lift the scenes, but they never quite soar or have that buoying quality because of the music. Music aside, the film rests on the shoulders of its two principle stars, and they're up to the task; Particularly Emma Stone. I quite like Ryan Gosling, who always brings a little refreshing quirk to his roles, and he's fine here, but his character isn't very interesting and the movie flat lines when he's on screen without Stone. The latter is the real star, and what works does so mostly thanks to her.<br/><br/>Again, this isn't a movie in my wheelhouse, so take the above with a giant grain of salt. I appreciated some things, enjoyed a few others, but La La Land didn't dance its way into my heart."

John Legend kicks the whole thing up a couple of notches.<br/><br/>The ending is appreciated by those that have experienced a good friendship that inspires each other but causes each to follow their own paths.

","""La La Land"" has obviously resonated with film-goers. With a $30 million budget, the film has taken in over $440 million in international box office receipts. But the question that must be asked how does ""La La Land"" compare with other film musicals? Arguably, the answer is: not very well.<br/><br/>One of the joys of the older musicals is the ability to enjoy watching Judy Garlands films over and over. It would be difficult to avoid using the fast forward clicker in a reviewing of ""La La Land."" In the tradition of the multiple film versions of ""A Star is Born,"" the musicals would also offer a social commentary on the insider world of Hollywood. Indeed, that is the goal of ""La La Land,"" which seems to suggest that one can live out one's dreams in Hollywood, but it might take a toll on one's personal life. What a difference this is from the serious and indeed tragic tone in ""A Star is Born,"" especially in the Judy Garland-James Mason version.<br/><br/>Another major shortcoming of ""La La Land"" was in the music. While there were several nice songs, it was painfully apparent that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did not have much range in their voices. Much of the pacing of the film was labored, and the narrative never made clear why Sebastian and Mia drifted apart at the precise moment when they were on the threshold of success in their careers.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of ""La La Land"" was in the romance. Yet the chemistry between Gosling and Stone was not terrific. And it was never made clear precisely when the characters fell in love. Sebastian was extremely callous to Mia when she was about to give him a compliment after a song he played in the restaurant. The filmmakers had the obligation to make the relationship believable and organic. One of the taglines of the characters came in describing ""the mess we make."" But parts of this film were also a bit messy.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" was clearly intended as a romantic fable. One underrated musical fantasy that might be just as good is Francis Ford Coppola's ""One From the Heart"" (1981) that had more depth and imagination than ""La La Land."""

","I have heard about all the positive reviews about this movie. The moment I went to the theater, I was expected a lot and hope to come out from the theater and tell everyone who haven't seen it to watch it. But it came out as disappointment. The movie is good but it lacks if the complexity in the plot. The story was way too light. It just simply a simple story that use musics as the dialog. The movie as whole was enjoyable but it didn't really draw me in.<br/><br/>The fact that his movie got dominated for 14 Oscars is just unacceptable. The movie was good at the opening and make the viewers think on what's going to happen next, but in the middle of the story, the story seems to slow down and run in the weird pace. It was just simply boring. The ending part was brilliant and I like it."

","This movie was not bad, the leads were dynamic in their acting skills and what was refreshing was relying purely on the merits of the story and not having women exploited and objectified in cheap sexist scenes. Yet I felt this movie was OK. I did enjoy the actors being authentic in song and the unique spin which I won't advise details on. Worth a watch and it may touch you a bit, yet it cannot compare with movie greats worthy of such praise. If you are looking for a light and fun film, this movie is your ticket even though it will make you think and invoke sadness at a point. Perhaps it will help people better look at their own lives and how they value priorities, if so, then it would be worth suggesting for a night out."
"SteveMierzejewski","7","2","5","24 January 2017"," High School Musical Meets West Side Story
","Hmm, that was something different. This is kind of like two movies in one. The first half was surprisingly amateurish with respect to the singing and dancing. I give Ryan Gosling a pat-on-the-back award for trying both of these skills, but anyone who is expecting Fred Astaire or Gene Kelley will be sorely disappointed. I get it. I get the fact that the film inserts stylized re-enactments of old Hollywood movie scenes. That's nice, but it didn't sell me on the film. For the first half of the film, you will see performances that can be matched by performances at your local high school. What I don't get is Emma Stone. Sure, we all have our personal preferences but she seems completely unsuited for the role of Ryan Gosling's romantic obsessions. However, if they ever decide to film ET's Revenge, she has my vote.<br/><br/>Just as I was ready to write this film off completely, it turned around. This happened, it seems to me, during the observatory dance scene. That was creative. Around this time, the film begins to develop some angst and the relationship between the two characters suddenly becomes much more complex and intriguing. Some will like the ending, some won't, but, for me, it did seem a little forced. Still, the second half of the film brought into focus more serious points about relationships and life, in general, to save it.<br/><br/>Should you see it? Well, watch the opening scene. If you can take that, you can survive the film. Trust me it gets better. Should it receive a best picture award? Well, it's at least something different, reminiscent of the award winning, The Artist. Let's just say that if it wins, I will grudgingly accept the Academy's verdict."
"andreaaviado","8","2","5","23 January 2017"," An epitome of good storytelling.
","La La Land is an epitome of good storytelling. There isn't anything unique about the story itself but the way on how it was told to the audience is what made this movie stand out among the others. The director must be so proud for turning his vision of the story into picture because, personally, I really did appreciate it --a lot. Partnered with great cinematography, awesome soundtrack, superb transitions, funny dialogues and nice acting with some singing and dancing --I can say that this film is a definition of entertainment. Kudos to the production team for delivering such an above-average film.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, one of the issues that I noticed in the film is the flow of the story. I really like how the writer gradually introduced and built the characters and their world in the beginning, however, when the movie was nearing its conclusion, I found the flow faster compared at the beginning which caught me off guard that the movie is about to end. In addition, I am not really a fan of how the story ended but is of the film's ending. I really like how the filmmakers depicted the story if things went the other way around --a style I've always wanted to try. <br/><br/>Moreover, I am also not a fan of the film's scenes wherein the character's background fade into black and a spotlight focuses on the actor. Personally, I find this style and aesthetic amusing in crucial scenes but is not in those which I perceive as not that relevant since this decreased the depth of the message.<br/><br/>Generally, La La Land is one of those movies which made me leave the theater with a smile on my face. What made the movie remarkable for me and for most people probably, is its depiction of life embodied into two distinct characters that most people can easily relate to. Personally, I have seen myself in some of Emma's scenes portraying Mia. I'm really glad that I did not waste my time and money seeing this film."
"starcommand","7","2","5","10 January 2017"," A naive homage to the musicals of yesteryear
","If you've seen classics that clearly inspired multiple facets of this film, like ""An American in Paris,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""A Star is Born,"" and lesser films like ""Xanadu,""and ""Fame,"" you may find ""La La Land"" less than inspiring, despite its decent songs. Emma Stone was very good, but Gosling nearly ruined the film with his saturnine presence; there are many actors who could have done a better job. Overall, it presents a heavily romanticized version of L.A., giving the impression that the city is largely defined by Pasadena, Griffith Park, the Santa Monica Pier and the Hollywood Hills. These and other script elements certainly betray director/writer Chazelle's youth and lack of real-life experience. Most actors in L.A. never get (paid) work in films or TV, and the small percentage who do mostly get work in commercials and as (non-union) extras. Most would gladly eat out of dumpsters for months for the chance to get a SAG card. Given that jazz clubs are few in L.A., and regularly feature established artists of the genre with a lot more experience than Gosling's character has, some of his character's actions and attitudes are largely preposterous. In short, a derivative diversion with some good songs and a luminous performance from Emma Stone. It lacks the zest and joie de vivre to make a strong impression on the big screen. It may play better on video."

The scenes in the movie also accurately depicts the stress and the rejection aspiring actors face in the movie industry and the problems of a long distance relationship. However, this movie also has its own flaws. The story line is predictable and some of the parts were draggy, for example, the concert that Sebestian was performing at. The actors were passionate about their roles and the stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had great on-screen chemistry.

","My head hurts. I haven't had this great of a cinema experience since Whiplash. Not only is it a love letter to old Hollywood films. It's a love letter to achieving your dreams. It's a love letter to LA. It's a f**k you letter to the industry in LA. Honestly, it's the definition of great filmmaking. It's the reason I go to the cinema. Lol, it could literally win 14 Oscars and I wouldn't even mind. <br/><br/>Ugh, the way it switches between modern style of musical to the Singing in the Rain vibe, it shook me. I was blown away by the cinematography, production design and especially the editing. After seeing Whiplash (and wow can we talk about all the Whiplash references Chazelle put in there?!) I knew the editing would be superb, but this was just.. they even made me like the fade effect which is usually a big no no for me. Not only is it a tremendous script, but the way the lines were delivered, it's like they're already classics the first time you hear them. Even though the film was already greatness, the ending is what really defines it. An iconic, timeless masterpiece. Just like Whiplash's ending. <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle truly is a god I don't deserve and I cannot believe I'm saying this out loud but La La Land was almost as good as the legendary Whiplash. Go see it. Don't listen to the fools giving it a 1/10. La La Land is sitting on 14 Oscar nominations and 7 Globes for a reason. If you don't like it, go argue it with your mama."
"ojvhakkinen","10","4","14","23 January 2017"," Never expected to love a MUSICAL this much
","When I first heard about La La Land, a musical film directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, well the first impression was mixed. Although Damien Chazelle convinced me with Whiplash. It an was excellent film about jazz what I'm not big fan of. It was truly a thrilling experience and my arms and body were shaking at the final act and JK Simmons performance was just...well as good as everyone says it is.<br/><br/>But now La La Land. If I have to choose my least favorite genre of movies, that would be musicals by far. When all the praise and hype met my ears, I even at that moment was ready to judge the film to be again an overrated Oscar-bait film that is not that great at all. But it was directed by Chazelle and it stars two actors who I like, I decided to give it a shot. I went to see it in 15th of January hoping the best and fearing the worst. And it crushed my careful expectations to little pieces.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is now becoming for a little by little one of my favorite actors. He is not that type who's just sticking the same role from a movie to movie. He can sing (for an normal actor), he can act, he can do believable performances in romantic flicks like this and in for example dark crime movies like Drive. He nailed it as a jazz pianist. But true star is Emma Stone. Her character is not an original. Not even close. But Stone blows so much fresh air to a very typical young woman who is dreaming being actress but the auditions are not going very well. She makes her character likable and more than that, she translates her to almost real life person with you can sympathize. Gosling does great job, but Stone is the true star, with her Oscar-worthy work in this film. Kind afunny that there was only two true characters to follow. The others were just side-characters who were there just to push the main two's stories forward.<br/><br/>Cinematocraphy is one of the best I've ever seen. There were plenty of scenes that left me just wondering ""how could the do that"". It follows the characters and leaves free space to them letting them express their feelings patiently. Chazelle droves Los Angeles a picture of true, colorful dreamworld that takes you to the 2-hour unforgettable experience. I loved the whole movie. The opening was nicely shot, songs were memorable and ending is not a typical one. All editing, sound etc. were top notch. Films story is pretty much typical but in my opinion this film is not about the story. It is for the ones who dream.<br/><br/>It deserves all that praise and is joining club of my favorite movies. And I don't like musicals at all. I can't force you to like this film, but I recommend it to everyone. Give it a shot. I gave and I am so happy about that. 10/10(Sorry for my English, not my mother tongue)"

","But the movie it is a musical. And even if a couple are fine, and one is excellent (""City of Stars""), the true is that I just can't understand the fascination with these genre. √Ç¬øWhat is the interesting part of hearing music that you wouldn't ever in your entire life? Music that is not necessarily even good? Sung by actors that aren't close to professional singers/musicians? And with songs that need less harmony and rhyme so they can tell complex stories instead of being beautiful? I just don't get it, unless every song is at the level of ""City..."". It's not the case.<br/><br/>Besides that fundamental flaw, the rest of the movie is excellent (even If clich√É¬©). The characters are fun and the actors gave them a bit of distinct personality to differentiate them from the archetypes they probably are without them. Even Emma Stone is good on this one (I don't think she's good, but here she is). Visually is excellent. The director of photography catches the attention more than the director here with a gorgeous to look at movie. The script, again, a bit clich√É¬©, but it's understandable given the genre, that the movie couldn't get too complex anyway. The music (not musical set pieces) and all that is related to it, is great too (Jazz).<br/><br/>In the end, if you enjoy (for some reason) a musical, then you would love this movie. Because I barely can stand them, I hated basically half the movie and loved the other half."

","Opening scene of La La Land is spectacle. It is good to see, that there is still a place for a old kind of musicals.

It is not a realistic movie, but it as a musical it is a perfect hit. If you don't have a two weeks lasting earworm after this movie it is a miracle. Story is sweet but not too sweet and the ending is bittersweet. Something to expect from Hollywood's dream factory.<br/><br/>Emma Stone's and Ryan Gosling's chemistry works and feels right. Even La La Land is quite old fashion movie it is well done and feels fresh. It is a kind of movie that you wish to see many more in the future. It is must movie for all romanticist and all the people who want to watch old fashion musicals. Perfect Sunday entertainment."
"Jellywishes","10","3","10","2 March 2017"," Very original film worthy of its hype (if you appreciate filmmaking).
","I don't like musicals at all, but I loved La La Land. The reason for this is simple: It's unlike any movie I've ever seen. I have a huge appreciation for the way films are made, so when I watch one as innovative as this, it's really special.<br/><br/>The plot of La La Land isn't really what the hype is all about. Two twenty somethings fall in love while trying to achieve their dreams in L.A. That's pretty much it. The plot moves slowly at times because a lot of the film relies on visuals, not dialogue. I think this is the main reason people don't understand the hype surrounding La La Land, and I totally get that!<br/><br/>However, if you know anything about the way movies are made, you understand EXACTLY what the hype is about. The cinematography is so unique. I've never seen light implemented quite like this before in all my years of watching movies. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is palpable, and even though they aren't professional singers by any means, there is so much heart in their singing that it doesn't matter. The score is superb. The costume design is effortless and brilliant. The musical talent of Gosling on the piano is wonderful. La La Land is reminiscent of old Hollywood in a way that will make you feel nostalgic for a time and place you've never even been to.<br/><br/>So, if you don't like La La Land, that's totally fine, but I recommend you watch it a second time with a more careful eye. The hype surrounding this film isn't about what you see at first glance, but about all the little details that bring it together. A movie like this doesn't come around very often -- that's WHY it's ""overrated""."
"momanjra-53141","9","3","10","23 February 2017"," Magical and warming, a true cinematic great.
","Admittedly this was the first time experiencing a romantic musical at the cinema for me, and I was a little apprehensive. Drawn in by the accolades it had received however, my wife and I decided to give it a go and took our seats at the local movie theatre on a Saturday evening. <br/><br/>How good could a musical love story really be? Two hours later I had my answer and that answer was very very very good indeed.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes or so of the movie is very much a full on musical affair, songs, huge dance sequences, very vibrant and colourful, and its OK if you like that sort of thing, but then there is a moment when the two main characters connect, and you connect with them and from that point onwards the film just gets better and better until the ending which stays with you for days afterwards along with the haunting piano melody of 'Mia and Sebastians' theme tune. <br/><br/>Gosling and Stones on-screen chemistry is the best you'll see all year, natural and believable they draw you right into the story. I can't imagine another two actors who would fit this movie as well as they do. <br/><br/>The other real star of the show is Los Angeles. This movie is a real homage to the city of angels. The sunsets, palm trees, beaches and warm colours of the horizon seen from the Hollywood hills adds to the romance and is all shot so beautifully that it makes you want to book a flight and visit.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie to watch at the cinema if you still can. If you connect with the characters and story then you most definitely won't regret it."

","There was so much hype surrounding 'La La Land' before it even came out, so I thought I'd go and see if it was worth the hype.<br/><br/>The answer happily is yes. 'La La Land' is a modern musical, that is also reminiscent of classics from the past.<br/><br/>It boasts two very good central performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and a story line that allows us an audience to root for both parties.<br/><br/>It's a musical, so of course it's all about the songs. And again there are some lovely ones. Some leave you wanting to clap along, while others can leave you close to tears. If that's not what music is supposed to be like I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some slower moments, but on the whole this is a rare film that is worth the hype."
"mark-durfor","9","3","10","12 January 2017"," La La Land was absolutely delightful
","As big and daunting as Los Angeles is, it's also a relatively small town, especially if you're trying to get into show business. Mia (Emma Stone) is one of those many hopefuls. She's working at a coffee shop on the Warner Brothers studio lot, giving the actors who are doing what she longs to do their caffeine fix. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is another hopeful, also currently scraping the bottom of the barrel. To keep the roof over his head in his dumpy apartment and to pay what bills he can, which isn't many, he plays jazz at any club that will have him. Mia and Sebastian first meet in the notorious LA traffic. She is holding up traffic going over lines for an audition, he is stuck behind her. He passes her with a glare, she responds with another unfriendly, but definitely Los Angelan gesture. Their paths cross again later that evening after a party that Mia's roommates encourage her to attend after a bad audition. She leaves on her own, walking home after her car was towed and hears Sebastian playing at a club she passes. She walks in just in time to see him get fired for not sticking to the Christmas set list. She tries to compliment him, but he brushes right by her. Months later at an 80s party, Mia gets some revenge as Sebastian is performing with an 80s tribute band. They end up leaving together in search of their cars and start a wonderful song and dance duet a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.<br/><br/>After a number of close calls and missed opportunities in La La Land both professionally and personally, Sebastian encourages Mia to write her own show. She agrees, though terrified of failure, and writes a one-woman show she will also perform. All Sebastian wants is to own his own jazz club, but he doesn't have the money, so he reluctantly takes a gig with a fellow musician. The group is very successful, but it's not the type of jazz Sebastian wants to play and it's keeping him apart from Mia. With glimpses of romance with each other and opportunities for success in the dog-eat-dog world of entertainment, the two must make some tough decisions about what they really want out of life. Ultimately, they both decide what is most important to each of them and they live happily ever after . . . though, not quite how you might assume.<br/><br/>La La Land was written and directed by Damien Chazelle who recently shot into the spotlight with his critically acclaimed writing and directing achievement with Whiplash. While both deal with music, La La Land is completely different than his dark and torturous Whiplash. If Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Judy Garland, or Fred Astaire were still making musicals today, La La Land would be their product. They don't make movies like this anymore, but hopefully the will after this. We've seen episodes of How I Met Your Mother, Psych, Scrubs, Family Guy and even South Park pay homage to the art of yesterdecade. We've also seen musicals revitalized with Mama Mia!, Moulin Rouge, Rock of Ages, and Jersey Boys. But a musical set today with the feel of the 50's is long overdue and it's been worth the wait as La La Land combines traditional old school movie sets mixed with some of the modern movie special effects that they couldn't even imagine in Singin' in the Rain or Grease.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone lit up the screen in the preview, coming across as the perfect kids you're rooting for, both in their pursuits of their passions and in their blooming romance. They delivered as did La La Land. If you like any of the movies I've named, just watching the preview probably made you smile with anticipation. It just cleaned up at the Golden Globes with wins for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. I gave La La Land a very hopeful 4 Star prediction but I'm boosting it up to 4.5 Stars. It was nearly perfect. Gosling and Stone are a perfect match in their wit, comedic timing, sincerity, romance, singing and dancing. If this is the first of many more modern day musicals to come, then we are in for a real treat. If this doesn't spark more of its kind, it would be a shame, but we were blessed with this rare gem and I'll be adding it to my collection for sure.<br/><br/>marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"
"writers_reign","7","4","16","9 October 2016"," So So Town
","I spent a lot of the running time trying to decide if this was an 'homage' to or a send-up of Movie Musicals back in the day. The Opening sequence for example (which prefaces the title) plays right into the hands of those anti-movie musical types who argue that it's unrealistic for people to break into song whilst walking down a street, accompanied by an unseen full-scale orchestra. The sequence in question tops them all; we're on the freeway in L.A. and it's gridlocked. We gradually home in on a lone girl in her car. She begins to sing softy, then louder, she leaves her car and dances down the freeway threading between the gridlocked cars and before you can say Busby Berkley she's joined by what seems like 50 other people singing and dancing in perfect alignment; eat your heart out, Berkley. Oh, and by the way, this has no connection with anything that follows. Then we're introduced to the two protagonists - they did appear, again separately, in that opening sequence but only as two drivers caught in the gridlock - she is an aspiring actress dealing them off the arm between auditions, he is a jazz pianist by talent and inclination but again playing in Mickey Mouse outfits and dreaming of opening his own club. It is, inevitably, referential, the story - they get together for a while - is New York, New York, moved to the West Coast, there are several song and dance sequences that echo Fred and Ginger and a lovely rip-off of the Dancing In The Dark number as perfected by Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in The Bandwagon. It runs a tad over two hours and yes, I would watch it again."

"yawn-2","9","3","11","13 March 2017"," Something new, not really comparable to the classic American musicals
","Aside from being one of the most genuinely enjoyable movies I've seen in years, La La Land is a very interesting film without any direct peers (although I suppose, in a way, it is ""Whiplash After Anger Management""; it will be interesting to see if Damien Chazelle has another story in him). As others have pointed out, it's more like Jacques Demy's musicals than anything else, but it's really not much like those either and nobody under around 50 (aside from dedicated musical freaks and faithful attendees at repertory movie houses) has seen Demy anyway. <br/><br/>You can't compare La La Land to any previous American musical romance, not directly (the few people I've talked to who say they didn't enjoy the film insist on doing exactly that). What Chazelle has done is tweak just about every element of the classic formula for the modern audience, then integrate those elements into a very modern, very emotional storytelling form. In doing this, he's actually created something entirely new. It doesn't matter at all that his leads aren't particularly great singers or dancers and it doesn't matter at all that the score is a little thin; it's the total package that has made this movie such a stunning success with audiences. It's modern cinematic alchemy which draws on the past glories of the American musical without actually copying them. As a film it completely avoids nostalgia, even as its lead characters drown in it at times. That's quite a trick to pull off, just as it's a real achievement to employ magical elements like ""dancing in the stars"" with a modern audience and not get laughs where you don't want them. <br/><br/>By current standards, virtually all classic American movie musicals are defined by their episodic structure. About a month before I saw La La Land, I saw the TCM revival of Singin' in the Rain, which is probably the consensus choice as the most enjoyable musical of the classic era. It's also one of the very best written, but it's still a collection of outstanding production numbers linked by a plot that is almost incidental. That's perfectly fine and it's what we expect from the classic musicals; it's part of what makes them so much fun. <br/><br/>La La Land is a different kind of fun. It's all about its own structure; it has a story-driven flow to it and is far more dependent on strong acting than the old musicals ever were. It's not just a matter of removing mid-century corn from the script; it's built around a very modern form of storytelling that was just starting to emerge around the time musicals went out of fashion. It is much more emotional than it is technical (in its music and dance as much as in its words) and it wouldn't work at all without top-flight acting, something you definitely can't say about even the greatest classic musicals. <br/><br/>Since it's unlikely we are on the cusp of a glorious new age of musicals, La La Land will likely stand as a singular achievement: maybe the most emotionally realistic musical ever, while still a total escapist fantasy. I find that very often the best films are the ones that had the least chance of getting made; it's a perfect example of one."

Get out of the cultural idiocy and stop being so biased and calling it 'inclusivity', I call BS on those whom criticize this movie for being rascist when it is obviously objectively NOT. <br/><br/>I am glad I read the negative reviews because I think they actually made me like this movie more, as most of the insults were ridiculous, and missed the point. The most ludicrous being that because it is led by attractive white people that it makes it racist... In fact criticizing a film for not having 'enough' of a certain race, is actually racist, as it is a biased based on skin color, newsflash, that's what racism is! FYI people, if I apply that to ""The Whiz"", ""The Color Purple"", or even ""Hamilton"" those would be racist because they exclude white people either altogether, or have only have a few cast members that are white. It goes both ways, racism is not exclusive to a certain skin color(BTW, I like ""The Whiz"", ""Hamilton"", and ""The Color Purple"" despite their flaws). However, neither of those are racist and neither is ""Lala Land"", yes, it does harken back to the golden age of musicals, only with less musical numbers. Lala Land has many black cast members and it lovingly dedicates a large portion of their film to Jazz, which was started by black people, and it lingers on jazz players (which outside of the male protagonist are black), and definitely puts them in a very very high regard.<br/><br/>My only caveat is definitely that it needed more musical numbers, I read an interview with the composer and he said there were many left out of the film, so if this gets transferred to Broadway as there are talks of, we'll hear them, but I do wish more of them were actually in the film. One main theme runs through the films, but if anyone is familiar with the older films which this pays homage to, particularly 1950's movies, this is not uncommon, I think of ""An Affair to Remember"" where the main song for that is played or sung at least 4-5 times throughout, and is integral to the story, as is the main theme that is played or sung throughout ""Lala Land"", it was fitting and appropriate, especially because the main character is a Piano Player and a Songwriter! <br/><br/>This film very much pays homage to musicians and the musical process (I write songs myself, and also used to act a good deal) and I felt, portrayed what it is like to be a musician who is just trying to get by, but also has a bigger dream, and how that process plays out. The acting side, with the auditions very much captured those feelings of the highs and lows of auditions and why being an actor is not always fun and games, unless you actually make it, but it is hard work in the process, and often degrading(I have done numerous singing and acting auditions over the last 15yrs). <br/><br/>The singing was not at all bad, Ryan Gosling sang very well within his range, if you want bad singing go watch Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris in ""Camelot"" or Pierce Brosnon in ""Mamma Mia!"", all phenomenal actors, but terrible singers! Ryan Gosling has limited range, but he he used it very well. Emma Stone's singing was very girly and pretty, a bit too airy at times, but I really enjoyed her solo song towards the end where she finally shows her real chops, she has a very fine voice indeed. No, the dancing is not plentiful, but it is well done. While I wish there was more tap dancing, I am also a tap dancer, I enjoyed what they did have, although I would have liked it if they were stronger dancers, I just appreciate that it was well-done enough and that they got actors who were fairly competent and at least had rhythm. <br/><br/>The Cinematography was beautiful, the splashy colors were a lot of fun, I loved the bright color palette, which also hearkens back to the days of Technicolor, very much like classic musicals such as ""Hello Dolly"" or ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" or even ""Westside Story"", most pre-1970's musicals actually. There were many creative uses of the camera, a lot of blurry shorts to make focal points clearer, it was very creative. <br/><br/>While it is not perfect film, as I said, I wish there were more songs and dancing, I truly felt it captured the lost feeling from the great musicals of the past, and I really hope this does what Moulin Rouge should have done in 2001, fully reignite the modern movie musical as a monetary force. When I left the theater, I was humming the song, and I still have the song that Ryan Gosling's character plays with the ""jazz"" band he joins and plays a few times, it is a great song. All of the songs were very beautiful, and well-written. By the way, I cannot think of many musicals I actually remember the songs to after only seeing it once if I never heard the songs before, that didn't use pop songs as their score. I can only think of one, and that is ""On My Own"" from Les Mis, I had never heard that song before and it stuck in my head, but no other song, from that 30 plus songbook did I remember that I had not already heard, but they were still great songs! I can say the same for, and don't laugh, ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"", great cult film, and has great music, but not extremely catchy. Not all music, including musicals, is extremely ingratiating the first time you hear it. I don't remember any of the songs from ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" or ""Hello Dolly"" the first time I heard them, they took time to sink in. <br/><br/>I still feel really good from watching ""Lala Land"" the next day, it made both me and my husband giddy after watching it, and the whole theater clapped after it was over. That may not be your experience, it seems to be polarizing, but it is not because it is bad film, it is a great film, it may just not be to your personal taste. <br/><br/>God Bless ~Amy"
"sinkingboat","9","3","11","15 February 2017"," Extraordinary!!!
","The beginning of the film did not really attract me and I was afraid then that it might be a disappointment given its so many Oscar nominations. But it turned out to be no big deal. The story between Mia and Sebastian went frantically romantic instantly when they met each other. The songs, the dances and even the backdrops were too romantic to bear. (Almost made me cry!!!) Well, I must say that I have listened to the soundtrack long before the release date. But it is at the theatre with every single move and word of the characters that the music began to strike me. However, it is not the music that makes the film such an accomplishment. The story is simple, also a bit old-fashioned, but really heart-warming. And the ending is simply perfect. They met each other, dreamt about having the life with each other, but faced the real world where the romance is only to be held in mind. It is not so unrealistic but meanwhile offers the audience warmth at the maximum. In other words, you will find yourself stuck to the chair in the theatre when it ends, everywhere on your body seem to melt away with the story. I give it a 10 just because of the story. And themusic, I think, should be extra bonus."

","This movie is a dream come true, and I know it sound weird but it is true, at least for me. The screenplay is just the perfect combination of romance, comedy, and drama. The whole idea of dreams, chasing them, admiring the ones who have already achieve them; is really inspirational. Also the dancing, most of the time is was tap, but even a waltz comes near, which was a perfect touch. I love musicals, and this one is not an exception, it is one of the best I have ever seen. Chazelle is a genius. And also his work as a director was outstanding, from beginning to end. Talking about beginning, the introduction of this film was amazing. The songs, are really good, also the dancing. The performances made by the two leading roles, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, were incredible, really really good. Especially Stone's one. How both of them have their own history and passion. The custom design were classic and pretty, but at the same time very modern. The cinematography is just perfect for the motion picture, and film editing made me want to cry because it is excellent. I love movies, I love musicals, this movie is just perfection to me. ""Here's to the ones who dream!"""

","I teared up often during the show. At the end, I got the same feeling I did with other Oscar Best Pictures: this show will win it this year. It's that good.<br/><br/>Aspiring actress Mia comes across as more normal than many of her contemporaries, which also makes her less likely to succeed as she fails many auditions while working as a barista. Sebastian (or Seb) is a jazz- loving pianist who wants to help the genre succeed, but has to compromise by taking on paying gigs that don't inspire him.<br/><br/>As they meet, initial clashes give way to chemistry and they inspire each other to pursue their dreams, but to what ending remains unclear.<br/><br/>There are many levels to the movie, with homages to old and new movie musicals. Dancing and choreography are great, but don't expect Astaire and Rogers. Bright primary colors grace the screen throughout, particularly on the wonderful costumes. <br/><br/>About the only thing I didn't like was the excessive motion and swirling of the hand-held cameras. While our couple are the stars, the music is what holds it all together and makes it the greatest. You will leave feeling inspired and wistful."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","3","11","27 January 2017"," A Fine Musical in Every Way Imagineable.
","La La Land is an incredibly colourful, refreshing and creative film in the otherwise disastrous year that was 2016; this movie makes you happy to be alive and take any given opportunity you have. There's lessons to be learned here but it never forgets to be escapist fun at its core. La La Land is a film about dreams and goals, what it takes to achieve them and coming to terms with what comes out of personal circumstances. This is a film for dreamers and those looking to have a good time at the cinema. This rejuvenating musical is exactly this; and more.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle, the writer & director of Whiplash (2014), wrote and directed La La Land; he takes the concept of music's importance in both films but tells completely different stories in each film. The thing these two share in common is that it's about the desire of the protagonist/s to pursue happiness. Both films do this without feeling overly pretentious or sappy, and that's a hard way to tell these kinds of stories; it's personal in a way that the viewer has complete and synchronized empathy for the characters: we've been in their shoes before (emotionally).<br/><br/>La La Land is a love letter, re-invention, and resurrection of the classic Hollywood musical. From An American in Paris to Singin' in the Rain, La La Land is a retro film set in the modern day but it has the high-flying and gorgeously colourful spirit of 1950s musicals.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, please do so. It's a day-brightener and will put a smile on your face for sure. It's a movie you can relax to.<br/><br/>Enjoy the finest film of 2016."
"soso_mandreams","10","3","11","24 January 2017"," LA LA LAND: A modern fairy-tale in a realistic world.
","Before the release of La La Land, people were already pretty excited about the movie , mainly because of our favorite duo, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and also because the expectations went for an epic love story to take place. I was pretty excited too although I usually get turned off by people over enthusiasm for a movie.<br/><br/>Now, that I have watched the movie; I can say that this is by far one of the most wondrous movies I've ever seen. La La Land is a musical comedy following the lives of an aspiring actress, Mia (Emma Stone), and an ambitious Jazz singer, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) as they try to forge their paths through art and music, while falling in love all at once. It might seem a bit clich√É¬© simple story but it's a dreamy one that only gets better thanks to the magical touch of music and the theme of dreams. La La Land is the kind of movie that instead of a scenario, you watch the actors singing and dancing. This instantly brought to my mind Grease, Sound of Music, and West Side Story and others. The only difference is that La La Land takes place in our contemporary world, yet still it gives off the retro feels,and that's how revolutionary La La Land is. Having previously worked on ""Whiplash"", Damien Chazelle has done more than an excellent job when he made this simple story into a piece of art narrating the story in a dynamic unexpected way. This is a genius work in my opinion. It was far from simple.<br/><br/>The cinematography, camera moves and shots, colors, costumes and lights, this all was the soul of the movie. <br/><br/>As for casting, I love Ryan Gosling for so many obvious reasons just like I love Emma Stone. However, at some point while watching the movie, I had this feeling that what if Mia wasn't Emma Stone? Don't get me wrong, in fact she was really amazing, she had a warm voice, but she is replaceable, unlike how things are with Mr. Gosling. Their successful chemistry, though, is my solace.<br/><br/>I can talk about the theme of the movie for days. I needed a movie like this, I needed to believe not only in achieving my goals but also in fairy tales because that's what we miss in our world now. The clash between your dreams and the sacrifices you have to make in the process was more than brilliant, because unlike fairy tales, this is purely realistic. Having someone in your back, telling you not to put your dreams in the back burner, reminding you that you are not stupid but letting go your dreams is. <br/><br/>The soundtracks couldn't be better, Justin Hurwitz is the master of the beautiful tracks, the best of which for me is City of Stars and Mia and Sebastian's theme. The dance moves weren't that exceptional but was more than enough for me.<br/><br/>Again, having a musical comedy in a contemporary world with a touch of retro, is something I never thought to be a thing. That one definitely deserves the 14 Oscars nominations."

","Horrible in every sense. The dancing and surrounding action is all so unconvincing. It constantly looks like a chain of commercials. Those that color did not set properly yet.

I do not know if this was before or after the Oscar mishap. Both of them are like frozen, look more like wooden dolls flapping their hands and legs around. Well at least they move in rhythm.<br/><br/>The movie was so not interesting that I found myself in the middle of it googling some music. How did it happen that this went so bad? I do not know. I guess the idea is that it was necessary to phone everything in so it would look old. It does not look old, it looks vivid-less. Just bad. Hairspray is hundred times better.<br/><br/>Again I do not think this movie deserves 1, but I cannot give anything else. That is how bad it was for me."

","La La Land is completely unoriginal, with the most forgettable and Lack of Entertainment Value Songs a ""Musical"" has ever Produced. Simple Review. LA LA LAND IS TRASH and OVERRATED"
"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","1","2","6","26 January 2018"," Still recovering from my recent Ear-ectomy
","I love musicals. It would be trite to list all the great ones. And would only cause grief to list the ones I think are bad. 
But if The Music Man is the greatest musical ever put to film - and I submit that it is - La La Land is the worst. Cast as badly as West Side Story. Sung as badly as Paint Your Wagon or Goodbye Mr Chips, danced as badly as Elaine at the staff Christmas party in Seinfeld, choreographed as badly as Flashdance, and acted as badly as Dirty Dancing, this is as close to a zero-star movie as you'll ever get. 
The opening number is total cheese but I hung in there. The girls get hyped for a night out and I think, OK, this is a throwback to the Technicolor marvels of the 50s I'll run with it. 
But then it's just obnoxious people meeting other obnoxious people for 2 hours. Emma Stone's face looks like a fish. Ryan Gosling looks like he's been sniffing glue. The former can act, the latter cannot. Neither can sing or dance a lick. 
First I started muting it during the musical numbers (not kidding) to avoid bleeding to death out my ears. Then I started skipping it to avoid throwing a heavy object and ruining my big TV. At the 75-minute mark, give or take, I bailed. 
If this is a 10-star, 14 Oscar-nom movie I'm Richard Branson."
"adanteseay","10","2","6","25 September 2017"," The film is about a pianist and an actress who hope to fulfill their dreams through hard work in a modern-day setting.
","""I'm letting life hit me until it gets tired. Then I'll hit back. It's a classic rope-a-dope."" Spoken like a master of perseverance. The film La La Land took some time for me to understand that the film was more than just a musical. The opening scene with the cars on the highways reminded me that the movie was a musical with creativity. But as the movie progressed I got to see some great character development through not only the music but the dialogue and the environment the characters were in. The emotions the film gave me not only were saddening but influenced me to stick to my dreams to the very end.<br/><br/>The film is about a pianist and an actress who hope to fulfill their dreams through hard work in a modern-day setting. Through their long journey in the stunning city of Hollywood, California, they meet each other and find love in both their support for each other and the bond that is created. I think the film's plot is very realistic with the characters having up and downs and trying find purpose in the mystery of life. La La Land can be described as a piano with many keys because there are so many elements that make this film great.<br/><br/>The character development is what makes this film memorable and authentic. At first sight, we see the two main characters on a highway was of chaos, with no intentions of meeting anyone. Then we start to learn who Mia and Sebastian are? As the movie goes on we eventually learn that although they have many differences, they both have the same dream of persevering through their hardships to get what they want. Mia's example of this can be seen when she gets some of her earlier call backs for acting. In each call back scene, we see she is set back multiple times however through her endurance she got the acting job. Sebastian does this by finally opening his dream club for authentic Jazz listeners and players. Another thing they share is understanding that sometimes to achieve your goal you just need a little push from someone else. Both characters kept one another on the path to their dreams. Sebastian made sure Mia went to her big call back about her story while Mia made sure Sebastian didn't sell himself out for what other people wanted. I think this is what really drives the film to have great characters development.<br/><br/>One strong element the film use of colors. The colors are unrealistically bright and serve a great purpose in the plot. For example, When Mia and Sebastian are arguing about their two contrasting ideas on how they should deal with what they want. We see two complementary which help in creating a visible tension among the two characters. Each color is a separate being with its own ideas. I think the director distinctively uses colors is to acknowledge that colors can be mixed to create a new color or relative to what the movie is about, two different dream can create something extraordinary. <br/><br/>The end scene was incredible and made me a little emotional. It allowed me to understand what La La Land was all about. It revealed that this movie is about understanding that each path you take in life will have its own rewards and setbacks but once you make those decisions there are no do-overs. So, you should make the best out of the decisions you make. The character Mia really encourages this idea when she has the dream of her and Sebastian living life together when she sees him in the Jazz club at the end of the film. I start to want their fantasy to become reality but then realize that even though it seems like the right thing to do according to the plot, I understand that they are both happy and content with the decisions. Henceforth, gives the film the name La La Land. Understanding that we must be happy in the real world and not dwell in the fantasy we wish was real."

"bkoganbing","7","2","6","9 May 2017"," Short of greatness
","Tis said that a really great picture is one where even the small character parts truly stand out. Gone With The Wind boasts not just its four memorable leads, but a whole flock of memorable characters who stand out. Dr. Meade by Harry Davenport and his wife Julia Meade by Jane Darwell are two examples and there are many more.<br/><br/>La La Land stands short of real greatness in that it only concentrates on its two leads with the rest of the characters well into the background. But the two leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone being nominated for Best Actor and Actress and Stone taking home the Oscar gold.<br/><br/>La La Land is a salute to those old time backstage musicals in an age when movies just don't have the talented musical performers to do those films any more. Emma Stone had some nice notes, but Gosling did his singing in the tradition of Rex Harrison who as I recall won Oscar and Tony for being Henry Higgins with talk/sing role.<br/><br/>Gosling is a musician, a jazz pianist in the tradition of Earl Hines and Count Basie and he wants to bring back jazz. He truly hates contemporary music and the fact he has to play keyboard in a rock band rather than do what those aforementioned gentlemen did. I really identified with Gosling, in my own life I'm posting music with Bing and Frank and their contemporaries on Facebook and care not if no one else listens but me.<br/><br/>Stone just wants the world to notice her talent and in that cruel and heartless world that can be show business getting noticed about 3/4 of the battle. She does do a reckless move that would and could dishearten anyone so the world will notice what she has to offer.<br/><br/>Besides Stone winning Best Actress and young Damian Chazelle for Best Director, La La Land won 6 others and several more nominations like Gosling's. The music is fine though I wish we had people like Frank Sinatra or a Gene Kelly to perform this stuff now.<br/><br/>La La Land is a wonderful film that falls a tad short on greatness."

Then there is a scene where the two of them walking on a studio lot while filming is happening, they stop and talk. That would never happen. They would be asked to be quite or move on. The film for me had no heart. The production design towards the end was so tacky. Very disappointed. Am I the only person that notices Ryan Gossling has a problem with one of his eyes. He is still a bit of eye candy."
"Deathstryke","6","2","6","12 March 2017"," An alright film, but not a great musical
","I enjoyed ""La La Land"" as a piece of innocuous, colourful escapism. The two leads are endearing and funny, the cinematography is dynamic, the sentimentality plucks rather than gurns and overall I found the dramatic conclusion to the two young dreamer's relationship emotionally fulfilling. <br/><br/>However, the 'musical' element of the film was lacking. It's obvious that the spectacle of the old Hollywood sing along exists in La La Land to counter the real downturns and compromises that Mia and Sebastien are forced to make in their own relationship to achieve the success they crave. Real life isn't like the movies, basically.<br/><br/>The problem is that the songs themselves are rather dull and uninspiring, notably the recurring 'music box-esque' piano theme which, while tender and sweet in the right moments, is very simplistic and even childish in structure, sounding curiously unlike anything Sebastien, a jazz pianist, would ever really play.<br/><br/>The large ensemble dance numbers are only at the start of the film. Again, none of these are particularly special, though the weaving camera work in the opening traffic jam number was impressive, the songs didn't stay in my memory for very long and Mandy Moore's choreography is more of a set dressing than a feature to be wowed by. The sporadic duets between Mia and Sebastien are also weak. Their voices are thin, lacking substance and their dancing is at best high school play material, filler for the transitions. These peter out by the film's last third to the point where I wondered why they even bothered making it a musical at all. I would not be running to see this on stage in the West End.<br/><br/>That said, as a movie experience I enjoyed La La Land. It made me smile, even giggle quite a few times, but I do feel the whimsy and nostalgia for old Hollywood is clouding people's judgment of this as a deserving Oscar winner (even though, in the end, it wasn't one). <br/><br/>""The Artist"" this ain't."
"martin-55292","4","2","6","12 March 2017"," Great movie, not so good musical
","I will probably get a lot of hate for saying this, but this was not the musical pleasure i had hoped for. While the plot and movie in general was great I thought they could have done so much better with the music. They replayed the same song over and over again so much it annoyed me. Yes I know it was their song and it was romantic, but it got to a line where they almost didn't care for any other song. There were a few songs, maybe 2-3 that really told a story and moved the story forward, the rest were happy pills where they danced for 10 minutes or played the same song. The story was great, I loved it, but I wish they musically could learn a thing or two from movies like Mamma Mia and Dreamgirls."
"Imdbidia","8","2","6","10 March 2017"," Beautiful film but overpraised
","I am going to be honest. La La Land was getting into my nerves before I watched it after so much full-on publicity. I watched it just because it was recommended to me by a a friend who is not usually into this sort of films.<br/><br/>This is the story of the artistic and personal struggle of a couple of young artists who fall in love at the wrong time, and struggle with the harshness of pursuing a dream, not making it, and having to find a way of life to pay their bills, and keeping the relationship. This is also a film about what-would-have-happened-if, A Sliding Doors sort of reflection. Indeed, the best part of it, or the one I enjoyed the most were the last 10-15 minutes of the film, which kept me crying for about 15 minutes non-stop. <br/><br/>Emma Stone really deserves the Oscar, it is not that she dances (OK) and sings (OK), it is that her performance had a great coloratura; she shows an incredible dramatic register and versatility in this film. I liked Gosling as well, and he is a great dancer!, he also sings (OK) and plays (decently), but his acting was a bit more monochromatic. <br/><br/>I know that the film has been praised as a musical, but I think is just a decent musical, not a good one. It is just that they don't make musicals like in the old times any more, and the first one that comes out is like wow. Was it wow? Well, no. The film mimics the style of the musicals of the 50s and 60s (on which I fed for years) but never gets to the level of mastery in the music, dancing, singing and production that those films had. On the other hand, I think this film has more value as a drama than most of those classic films, and that is what I enjoyed the most: the story and the acting (beside the musical part). All the musical numbers are enjoyable and well realized, but I wasn't wowed by them. Perhaps the thing that moved me the most was Emma Stone's singing at her final audition, and watching Gosling dance with such great style and easiness. <br/><br/>One of the things I enjoyed the most about this musical is the ode to jazz embedded in the story. The conversations about what Jazz is, between Sebastian and Mia, and between Sebastian and Keith are really wonderful. The soundtrack is very good, needless to say. <br/><br/>I enjoyed La La Land immensely, but I don't think deserved so many Oscar nominations or such an insisting pedant heavy publicity and praise. Good, yes, wow no."

The romance between them seem contrived. I don't know but maybe because it's the directing and editing failed to show them. Second the dance, it's seem lacking.

It's not bothering me but for you who like to see musical movie and think depth will surely be annoyed. I don't care about singing quality of ryan and emma because i think anyone can sing to enjoy themselves. It's a bonus though if actor and actress can impressed the audience with their singing ability.<br/><br/>The last but not least is the story. It's slow and i think there isn't much to see, but when you're ready to stand up and go, finally it blows you. This 'emotional blow' in the end, is exactly the same if you watched cinema paradiso. If you want some more, there is this movie from Korea, My Sassy Girl, that have this same kind of experience but i don't like it because they took and gather climax from many movies which makes it unnatural. This kind of story which the climax in the end is the most important thing, that makes you understand the whole movie and how it related to real life, after wondering all the time sitting and waiting before that, will always work to impressed the audiences in the end. If you like this kind of movies, you'll rate this very high.<br/><br/>I don't know, but some of you will feel irritated because you think there should be an explanation for the one thing that happened in the end (it's important but i am not going to tell it here because i think it's a spoiler) but for me it's just perfect. In the end, it won't matter anyway, it's happened in life, in this sense it's perfect and kudos to the director.<br/><br/>Initially i am going to give this film six stars but i like emma stone very much in this film, watching her is the only thing that makes me sit and keep watching the movie, so in the end, without thinking i add another stars making it seven. Forgive me for this but emma deserved it. Hehe.."

","slow and drab...dancing was terrible in both technique and choreography. Only one tune was good and that played throughout the whole movie. On a positive note,it was a far more realistic portrayal which I liked compared to the usual American artificial stuff. But it was not a powerful awesome story that deserves such high rating...it reminded me of another Ryan Gosling movie that had awesome reviews, called Drive. It was so slow and the dialogue was so slow...I laughed during an emotional stare between the 2 in love as no words came out...perhaps this is a Ryan thing that he gets away with as he is kinda cute and lovable so you cannot help but like him...so my only conclusion is slow movies must be arty hence get the ratings. Whereas I like a movie to ""entertain me"" and this and La la land did not."
"Martin010","6","2","6","9 February 2017"," Hype Train to La La Land
","The rating of a movie should be purely subjective, but I get the feeling that people get influenced by the things critics and amateur reviewers write about a movie. Especially with La La Land, which got praised so much in the media that it got this hype train rolling. People do not want to miss the train, so they jump right on it, like sheep. But please, take a step back, forget the hype and just rate in accordance to your personal experience watching this movie. I only see 10/10 ratings or 1/10, which both are ridiculous. It's a good movie for sure, but there is definitely room for improvement. The story of young artists struggling to make it in Hollywood is not original. It being a musical, I expected better singers and dancers than Gosling and Stone. Great in acting, but not the best singers/dancers. And the slow pacing in the middle section of the movie got me losing my attention a bit. But overall a good movie. Personally musical and romance are my least favorite genres, but I do recognize quality in this movie, so I rate this movie 7/10. If you do like these genres, I could understand a rating of 8/10, maybe 9/10. But please stop acting like this is the holy grail of movies, it's not!"
"celia-loureiro","9","2","6","19 January 2017"," True they can't sing or dance - but does that has to be the soul of a musical?
","La La Land... I was seriously in suspicion about it. I'm not very much into Musicals (apart from The Sound of Music and Singing in the Rain), but both Emma and Ryan stole the picture. The movie isn't about dancing or singing well... It is about the land of dreams (wich could be L.A. or your neighborhood, it just puts more pressure into them since it is L.A.). To me, this movie is about two young people still very attached to their childhood dream, and struggling to keep it afloat while everyone asks them to grow-up. What's beautiful to me - heart clinging beautiful - is that they believe in each other so much. They help the other get there, but it is a lonely road out there. Its tribute to jazz and is also touching, so both characters have really solid dreams, and both are being dragged away from them for failure and background noise pressure.<br/><br/>Though none of them can sing or dance so well, I don't think that was the point. It wasn't supposed to be flawless - I believe this movie wants to keep it real. You may feel like you're walking on clouds, but you're not such a good dancer, and there's some tenderness in being kind of clumsy. I believe it is intentional. The love between Mia and Sebastian is easy to believe, it is respectful and tender and inspiring. Either romantically or not, everyone should have a Mia or a Sebastian in his life, to help us and motivate us when doors slam on our face. I absolutely loved the ending, which, in my opinion, consolidates it as a modern day love story."
"arne_bischoff","9","2","6","17 January 2017"," Great Musical
","If you're into Musical films, this movie is the right one for you. If you don't like these films or deprecate their characteristics (chant, dance - including tap dance, romance, imagery) but expect action or breath holding suspense, you should avoid the movie. <br/><br/>La La Land is a homage to those movies and archetypal in his narrative style. Spoiler: But it's more than just a tribute movie. The story takes place ""here and now"". Its message (missing readiness to compromise, ego centrism) reflects our modern society. So the movie is an ""update"" of the genre with vintage structure and a contemporary point of view. <br/><br/>PS: I'm not a native Englisch speaker, so please excuse mistakes."
"LolaVavoom","9","2","6","17 January 2017"," An exquisite pleasure - the kind that leaves one ultimately unsatisfied
","I liked this film very much - the time flew by and I was completely transported to a place of dreams and high emotion. It felt fresh, na√Øve without being sickening, romantic without being cloying and had a a very nice touch of Casablanca about it. As someone who grew up surrounded by Art and artists, I am very familiar with both the romanticism and impossibility of a lasting relationship between two artists and that sentiment rang very true.<br/><br/>The film is of a very particular type of pleasure though - the exquisite kind that leaves one ultimately unsatisfied. Perhaps it is as it should be - or perhaps it could have been truly magnificent if it had a little more understatement and a little more flair where it counts. I have great respect Emma Stone and she was terrific - and yet, in my opinion, this film could have been made brilliant with a lead who'd be more elegant, stylish and lush, someone like Jenna Dewan or Scarlet Johansson.<br/><br/>All in all, a perfectly dreamy, romantic, emotional and bittersweet musical and miles better than most Hollywood films in the past 20 years, nearly worth all the hype."

Gosling and Stone put forth some of their best performances to date, and just when I thought I couldn't like them anymore, they dazzled me with much more than just ""good acting"". They took me back to what a good movie is and should be, a movie with a great story line, meaningful music, and overall a brilliant 128 minutes. Its the kind of movie that you can't just leave the theater and forget about, it compels a discussion afterwards. Thank you Chazelle for surprising me just when I thought I couldn't be surprised any longer."
"bankofmarquis","9","2","6","1 January 2017"," Charming, engaging and visually intriguing
","I have now seen the film that WILL WIN the Oscar for Best Picture of 2016 - LA LA LAND.<br/><br/>Did I mention it was a musical?<br/><br/>Directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash), LA LA LAND is a love letter to Los Angeles, Hollywood and the Movie Musicals of the 40's and early '50's sprinkled in with a healthy dose of 2016 reality. The images are lush and fantastical, the music is emminently hummable, the dance numbers are sharp and to the point and the performances of the two leads are charming and engaging.<br/><br/>Starring Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress, she meets Jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) - love, fantasy, songs and dance ensue.<br/><br/>There are times when you see a film and you think ""No one but this person could play this role."" Recent examples of this are JK Simmons in WHIPLASH, Cate Blanchett in BLUE JASMINE and Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Such is the case with Emma Stone's portrayal as Mia. Her aspiring actress is charming, eager, enthusiastic, jaded, naive and worldly - often at the same time. Her dancing is sharp and ""spot-on"" while her singing is very good.<br/><br/>Fairing less well in the singing category is Gosling. While his singing is better than other ""actor/singers"" like Pierce Brosnan in MAMA MIA or Russell Crowe in LES MISERABLES, I would rate Gosling's singing as ""passably agreeable"". Fortunately, his character is a pianist, so he spends more time on the keyboards and less time singing. But when he gets up from behind the piano and interacts - and dances - with Stone, the magic happens. There is great chemistry between the two leads and that chemistry and charm radiates the screen and pours out into the audience.<br/><br/>Special notice needs to be made of the choreography from Mandy Moore (Dancing with the Stars) - it is spectacular and perfect for the mood and feeling of this film. At times, when one sees a musical, the dancing stops the story. In LA LA LAND the choreography enhanced and furthered the story and I can't wait to see this film again just to see the musical numbers and the choreography.<br/><br/>Director Chazelle shares with us a vision. The Cinematography and images portrayed are intriguing and beautiful and the story and acting moves along crisply (for the most part). The film was also written by Chazelle and it is clear that he had a clear idea in his head that he did not waver to put on film.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No. The film drags abit at about the 2/3 mark and the ending isn't exactly what I was expecting, but was appropos for what Director Chazelle set us up for. I see multiple Academy Award nominations for this film and wouldn't be surprised to see multiple trophies carried home - Costume, Design, Cinematography, Score, Song, Director and (especially) Actress (Stone) and Film.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"vyahsi","9","2","6","31 December 2016"," A spellbinding film!
","Rarely does it happen! You sit back in your seat, expecting to watch a good film; but the film engrosses you, taking you to the depth of an ocean where you are charmed by magical scenes in which love has been depicted. La La Land is a film I have longed to see for years. The theme, the plot and acting are all good enough to make it a masterpiece. It is a wonderful musical, and the songs are certain to last for ages. Love is framed realistically, avoiding simple fantasies. As handicaps threaten love, the viewers become a captive audience. I loved the film so much. I want to watch it again with my friends, and I will advise many not to miss this great film."
"dobolevente","9","2","6","31 December 2016"," Here's to all the dreamers
","Damien Chazelle did it again! His Whiplash knocked it out of the park two years ago, and La La Land is everything we can ask for and more. The fabulous score and the skillful direction make this piece a thoroughly engrossing experience. The chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone works like a charm. Chazelle shows us how to craft a movie that is as well-tuned as a seasoned jazz pianist's instrument. We can enjoy the harmonious relationship between the cadence of the plot and that of the melodies weaved into the fabric of the story.<br/><br/>La La Land is much more than a musical; it speaks to anyone who lets themselves be awed by high-quality, professional art. The entire movie feels just right in its pacing, its style and, surprisingly perhaps, its message. It is uplifting when a film manages to encourage us to chase our dreams without being naively ignorant of life outside the movie theater. We are told a Hollywood story that rises above itself. It brings value into a frivolous genre with ease, joy, and all the right moves."
"aciessi","9","2","6","28 December 2016"," Coming out Swinging
","""They don't make em like this anymore"" is the thing most people will say when they leave the theater as the credits roll on La La Land, and they're right. La La Land is a 1950's movie musical, made in 2016. It's an absolutely romantic experience in every sense of the word. Romantic in it's visual scope, blazing off of the silver screen in Technicolor. Romantic in it's gushing, devastating appreciation for the art of Jazz. Romantic in the on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Stone, who make a sizzling hot couple for our times. I got a Seldon/Lockwood vibe, for sure. We've all heard the hype this film has been getting, and it's for a pretty good reason... ""They don't make em like this anymore"". Damn right, they don't. La La Land resurrects an era of filmmaking that many have thought to be long dead. It's reinvigorated a filmgoing spirit that once dominated the entire industry, and by any luck, might just dominate it once again. You can thank Damien Chazelle, who in one decade, cemented his name into film legend, and may almost certainly walk home with a shining Oscar this year.<br/><br/>So with all of this in perspective, did the film blow me away? Sadly, I have to report, that it just didn't give me that perfect experience that I wanted. It's a great film, without question, but the problem is.. I've seen this musical. Singing in the Rain is my favorite musical of all-time. I've had that lighter than air, skip in my step, heart singing feeling before, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. Many people, especially millennials will be feeling this for the first time with La La Land, and that is something that I deeply respect. It's remarkable that films can still do this to people, in our jaded, desensitized, and often cruel world. Perhaps this is what people needed after enduring the unusually dark and divisive year that was 2016. A film like this needed to come along and lift our spirits up, and that's precisely what La La Land does.<br/><br/>It's a feel-good romp, and we get this right as the film opens, with an absolutely swinging musical number on top of a disgustingly busy LA highway. I loved, loved, loved the music. It's absolutely the film's strength above all else. I'd give it two years time before La La Land ends up becoming a hit Broadway musical that gives Hamilton a run for it's money. Oh yes, it's that good."
"jadepietro","9","2","6","27 December 2016"," Let The Music Play
","(RATING: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ¬Ω out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An enchanting modern day love story set to music.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Set in modern day LA, two dreamers sing, dance, and fall in love.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Who says they don't make movies like they use to? Damien Chazelle's La La Land restores one's fate in the creative process and modern day filmmaking. A daring and thrilling project, the film is a simple boy meets girl tale, set in Tinseltown, that harks back to the kind of musical that MGM would churn out regularly in days of yore. This homage to the old Hollywood musical is simply a class act all the way. (And boy, do we need it now!)<br/><br/>They meet cute, these star-crossed lovers, caught in a traffic jam, one that begins our story with such skill and exuberance. This unexpected opening dance number efficiently sets the right tone for the film mixing realism with musical fantasy. (Special kudos to Mandy Moore's spellbinding choreography. Her opening number, Another Day of Sun, is a stunner and the camera angles swoop and spin with such fluidity, as do the dancers. Jacques Demy's The Young Girls from Rochefort is its direct inspiration...and there will be other musical salutes throughout the film.)<br/><br/>Of course, we know the two will eventually get together against all odds, singing their way into your heart. Mia (Emma Stone), an out-of-work actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz pianist, have destiny guiding their every move (and fortunately Mr. Chazelle doing the same).<br/><br/>The songs by Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are clever, moving, and highly memorable. They bring with them the necessary range of emotion that advance the plot so effortlessly: bittersweet moments, love and heartbreak, dreamy romance. (The haunting love theme, City of Stars, and Ms. Stone's 11 o'clock number, The Audition (The Fools Who Dream), are two unforgettable highlights, as is the closing number, a pastiche that tips its hat to such films as An American in Paris, Casablanca, Roman Holiday, and Singin' in the Rain. Yes, this is a movie that will cause one to swoon.<br/><br/>The screenplay, also by Mr. Chazelle, takes our two lovers on a journey that confronts life's on- going question about love, relationships, and art. It literally sweeps you off your feet and send you into space with a sense of giddy nostalgia and joyous surprise. Yes, the plot is paper thin. Some of the musical numbers seem forced and do not blend with the reality surrounding our lovers. Yet, the overall effect is still captivating.<br/><br/>The core to the movies' success or failure is firmly in control due to the performances of the two lead actors. Both Ms. Stone and Mr. Gosling have shown that they have a strong chemistry together in other films, but here, it is so crucial to the film that we buy into their romance. (Some may not. I did totally. Call me a romantic.) While Ms. Stone's and Mr. Gosling's musical talents are limited and rarely come near the superior footwork of Astaire, Rogers, Charisse, or Kelly, the two actors are more than competent and quite charming in their roles. They compensate with their strong dramatic acting choices that impress and emotionally involve the movie-going audience.<br/><br/>Mr. Chazelle stages his scenes with flair and style. He transitions from dramatic scenes into musical numbers with ease. The physical production dazzles with its Technicolor dreamscape of pulsating candy-colored hues. Linus Sandren's cinematography is gorgeous and the production design by David Waco uses the old time movie sets to create the artificial world of movie musicals. (I particularly loved A Lovely Night, a tribute to the Dancing in the Dark sequence from The Bandwagon, complete with lamppost.)<br/><br/>La La Land honors the lavish Hollywood musicals of the past, those rare breed of movies that became extinct as moviegoers' tastes changed. Let us hope this film brings about a renaissance of sorts. La La Land is a film about love and made with love. It is a exhilarating cinematic experience not to be missed!"
"themovieparadise","9","2","6","27 December 2016"," A Charming and Magical Film
","The performances in La La Land are spectacular. Not only do Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone sing the hell out of these songs, but they also have to dance and act at the same time. Their chemistry was some of the best I've seen this year, and it really made the movie. There was so much great, playful banter between the two that it made you fall in love with them as characters. Gosling and Stone really knocked it out of the park with this one. But I think the true star of the film is Damien Chazelle. As of right now, he is my personal pick for Best Director this year. Everything about this movie was excellently directed. The elaborate musical moments with tracking shots and complex dance moves were done with ease. The personal moments between Gosling and Stone were filmed to highlight the intimacy. The music montages were filmed to entertain entirely. There isn't a dull frame in this movie..."

It sounds clich√©,like the typical drama films you probably have watched but it shows that in a different way. I thought I wasn't going to be able to relate to this movie 'cause it has been called ""a movie for those who love happiness"",I personally enjoy dark and touching films but this movie is magical, it'll surely give you and utterly gorgeous mix of emotions and no matter how hard I try to find words to explain this movie, they won't give it justice.

"anubindtiwari-310-820214","9","2","6","24 December 2016"," A Retro-Musical with Contemporary setup
","I went to watch this film without any expectation and knowledge of the film, all I knew that it is a musical and is directed by Damien Chazelle, I loved Whiplash and that is the only reason I went to watch this film I am not a fan of musicals, in fact this is the first musical I watched. La La Land starts with a song and a very retro set-up, this reflects in the whole movie later. The movie is a romantic one but not a love-story, it revolves around two main characters, Sebastian, an aspiring jazz musician who loves old Jazz style and in do not like how people are moving away from it, letting it die, and Mia, a struggling actress who grew up watching old Hollywood movies and have always fantasize about being an actress. These are the only two characters we see in the whole film, JK Simmons have the 3rd highest screen time that also last for around 5 minutes in two shorts. This can seem weird but it is not actually, because in this way the director has a lot of time and space for the main characters to tell their story, how they meet, how their relationship starts and what happens next, which is important for a romantic film. Both the characters are very well defined and Damien Chazelle have explained each of their back story and completed the set-up in first 20 minutes or so of the film (not sure about the actual timing, this is what I felt). As the film progresses we get to see that their struggle in the city of Hollywood. This films tell story of two lovers who understand, support and help each other in achieving them their dreams, something which we all desire but difficult to find, however in the end they did not end-up together that show the harsh reality that you might not get everything that you desire or to put it in a better way that things don't work-out the way we want. The set design, costume and lighting are extraordinarily well, they give the film a 60s film look, this I loved the most about the film; it is feast for eyes to watch the set-up of old glorious Hollywood musicals. The costume add to this, Ryan Gosling wearing suits is very nice, part because the old Jazz players used to wear but also give the movies the old look, same goes with Emma Stone, they gave her similar retro style dress, colors of their dress were in contrast just likes their characters. Lighting was used in an exceptional way; I have not seen such a brilliant in recent past, Damien Chazelle used lighting to bring the actor in and out of focus in the shots blew my mind, as it is such a simple technique yet so effective. There is no need to say who good the music was, Justin Hurwitz out did himself. Damien Chazelle is as good writer as he is a director, the story and screenplay is overwhelmingly good. The movie contains a lot of long single take shots, I personally love those as the keep the continuity of the film and as the scene progresses you see the thing unfolding. There could not have been a better couple playing these roles than Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone both the actors have proved themselves in the industry and have delivered what was expected of them. Overall this is a must watch and going to be big winner in this year's award season. Each and every minute of the film is enjoyable."

","This is a normal review from a normal, average viewer of movies. I say this is non-biased because I don't rant and rave over musicals, nor do I actually enjoy them on a regular basis.<br/><br/>I went with my wife to see this movie on a date night. The opening scene was a traditional break into dance sequence that was kind of a turn off... but after that, the movie got better.<br/><br/>The acting was great, as Gosling and Stone are always good in their roles. Not to mention, their chemistry on screen was fantastic as always. They are just really believable as a couple.<br/><br/>The director couldn't have picked two better actors to portray the roles on screen.<br/><br/>There was quite a bit of singing and some dancing on screen but hearing it from Stone and Gosling made it believable.

Absolutely awful. I own a top spec TV and no matter how I adjusted the settings parts of the dialogue are completely inaudible.

Then suddenly I was cringing at other parts.<br/><br/>There were parts where I was glued to the screen, others where I started nodding off.<br/><br/>Overall, at the end of the rollercoaster, I was confused. Why. Why was this movie made? What was it for? Was it retro? Was it modern? Was it comedy? Was it drama? Was it fantasy?<br/><br/>I'm far from being an expert on musicals. Moulin Rouge I enjoyed. It was clear from the start what it was and it did it well. A star is born... Is that a musical? I dunno but it was good, it had a style, it gripped me. This? La la? I'm just not sure what I've just watched. And I definitely have no clue what the people making it had in mind.

I never liked musicals and Its a hollywood thing i never Will never fully understand. The chance for it to fail as a movie is huge. because it looks so ridiculous when all the superhappy smiling yerks start dancing and jumping spontaniously.
It works well in some classics like wizard of oz because of the beautiful sad songs. It works in nightmare before christmas because of the gothic aesthetics and dark fairytale ballads.
In moulin rouge cause kidman is so gorgeous you cant take your eyes of her.. It works in westside story and grease also because of the rebell teenage freedom, the cars and the leather.

","Was so happy to finally see this movie and shocked how little I liked it. The theme: girl meets boy, they don't like each other at first, but they fall in love, dance and sing. Unfortunately they don't have the love, patience, and commitment to sacrifice and work for a measly few years to accomplish their dreams together. The entire goal of Hollywood musicals was that they were fun lighthearted entertainment with extremely talented song and dance actors that broke into song and dance designed to take us out of ourselves and make us laugh, hope and dream. This doesn't happen here. A negative story could be forgiven if there was great dancing and singing. These two actors couldn't dance themelves out of a box. Their dancing looks like the handful of steps a choreographer teaches a celebrity so they can hoof a bit in front of professional dancers for an award presentation or late nite TV show. It was absolute pathetic. The worse unexplained scene by far was their first argument in the middle of the movie. Stone berates Gosling for getting a good paying job in his field instead of following his dream of opening a jazz night club...because opening a night club when unemployed is a doable thing in L.A??? This made absolutely no sense. So many other scenes made no sense either...That explains the La La in the title. Spend your holiday time watching Singing in the Rain. Here the protagonists also fight agains the Hollywood machine but do it with a happy ending and some of the greatest dance numbers of all time. Then watch this piece of junk and wonder how it got all the awards."

","I'm doing a bit of catching up with some 2016/2017 titles and La La Land has been one of my most anticipated. The film is absolutely brilliant from every standpoint. Obviously it gets ton of credit for the cinematography, score, songs, etc, but it's all for nothing if it doesn't have emotion...I haven't been this moved by a film in a long time, the ""full of real life"" ending is where the film rises to the masterpiece category. There's something bubbling under the happy-go-lucky cover and I kind of got similar nostalgic vibes from the story than what Boyhood (2014) offered.<br/><br/>""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" is a fantastic song that tickles all the right senses. Obviously every review has to also mention the opening scene...done! The two juggernauts of that year's awards season, Moonlight and this, are both something special, but I'd probably give the slight upper hand to La La Land. A very rare four and a half stars out of five from me."

I felt betrayed by such an ending. 
I was led to a insane hope in an timeless masterpiece. 
Even those lead roles didn't convinced me. 
At the city of angels gods are expected.
As provincianism may fit the shoe, only after the Oscar ceremony gaffe I begun to understand my feelings about the movie. 
Well, I thought, the winner was a good movie, but...
As a cinema observer, one may put our expectations too high, and I believe that the same has happened with many over the continents. 
So, with a tone of apology, I rest my humble review.

Could It be a cut avoiding that somewhat flavorless finale? Could it be happy happy? 
I must expect such a special Cut.

"doublejespejwan","3","1","2","9 August 2018"," Disappointing
","I am a HUGE musical fan. I've been involved with musical theatre for the past twelve years and I always enjoy watching new musicals. For all of the praise this movie got, I thought it was going to be a showstopper to stand the test of time. I had listened to the first song and loved it, so I thought I'd give it a try. <br/><br/>Suffice to say this movie is VERY disappointing and VERY overrated. <br/><br/>Before I get through with this review, I'll give some positives. The cinematography was awesome, the jazz in the show is fantastic and the first song is hype as hell.<br/><br/>Now let's get into this. The premise involves two struggling artists trying to find themselves in LA. They find each other, start a relationship, which is ultimately ended abruptly before the two go on their separate ways. The movie tries to play out as a romance, but that's sorely missing seeing as both Stone and Gosling's characters abandon their obvious feelings for each other for their careers, which in a sense is an ironic yet realistic representation of Hollywood. The story is nothing special and the plot advances almost nowhere before making a huge timeskip out of nowhere at the end of the movie. If you want a long romance movie featuring Ryan Gosling, you're better off with ""The Notebook.""<br/><br/>Despite being a musical, this show has a surprising lack of songs that are memorable. The ONLY song I like is the opening ""Another Day of Sun"", which, despite being awesome is extremely misleading. The tone of the movie is vastly different from the fun and cheery opening, taking a more depressing route and not really veering from it. There really isn't a variety of songs either. <br/><br/>And while I like the lead actors, specifically Stone, who I LOVED in The Help, neither of them could carry a tune or dance to save their life. Now, actors don't necessarily have to have a musical past to be good singers or dancers. For example, Renee Zellweiger had almost no experience in musical theatre but KILLED IT in ""Chicago"". Natalie Wood wasn't a good singer, but the directors had the sense to have someone sing over her in ""West Side Story"". Neither actor in this movie had particularly any talent in singing or dancing and it showed.<br/><br/>As a romance musical, ""La La Land"" was devoid of any meaningful romance or memorable music. Movie musicals like ""West Side Story"", ""Grease"" and even to an extent ""Hairspray"" drive the romance and musical aspect home without losing any charm; something ""La La Land"" was not able to do. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a better movie musical that didn't start on Broadway, ""The Greatest Showman"" is loads better. The music and choreography are both fantastic and memorable. It's loud, colorful and vivacious without being distracting.<br/><br/>In short, ""La La Land"" is about two moody hopefuls in Hollywood who get into a shallow relationship that shatters after one fight, ultimately abandoning each other for their careers. In the age of social media, neither character bother to contact the other about their success.<br/><br/>All in all, after watching the movie, I feel both disappointed and robbed of my time. What I thought was going to be a showstopping, upbeat modern recreation of shows like ""42nd Street"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" turned out to be a depressing and hollow movie not worth your time or money. Don't let the bright colors or jazzy beats fool you. This was simply a pandering to Hollywood and the elitists who live there.<br/><br/>You'd be better off watching any other movie musical. It's just simply not worth the hype."

I was pretty excited more of hearing the songs and hope they can be memorable like the Greatest Showman movie. And in addition, this one has a higher rating and bagged many awards. Sad to say, it was not appealing to me. I hardly remember any song after watching the movie. On the acting, I don't know what's with Ryan Gosling but I feel bored watching him. And it felt like he and Emma didn't gel very well. On the story, well.. that makes up most of my rating.

"danren121","6","1","2","3 February 2018"," Lala indeed
","The opening scene features a women singing to the camera whilst sitting in a traffic jam, however it really looks as though she is miming which in a way is quite fitting because after all the film is called lala land and in many ways the makers of this one had carte blanche when it came to putting it together. The best thing beside the walking baselines in the soundtrack are probably the references to the 1950s Hollywood cinema as the whole spectacle is very much a self addressed cinematic love letter. The aesthetic is pleasing, but this is all form and no substance, if you want to see something truly unoriginal then you should give this a try. Really this is like watching a computer game trailer for a classic movie."
"smatysia","6","1","2","29 January 2018"," A notch above ""Just OK""
","I see a lot of 10-star and 1-star reviews here. I cannot see the justification for either. One of the goals of cinema is ""spectacle"". Yes, you have drama, and comedy. But another way to get to spectacle is the musical. I neither love nor hate musicals, but probably lean closer to not liking them, than liking them. So, I am no expert about singing and dancing. As far as I could tell, the dancing, and much of the singing in this movie was adequate. Nothing blew me away, and nothing made me cringe. Emma Stone has a pleasant voice, and she looked very nice in a girl-next-door sort of way. Ryan Gosling, though, seems singularly non-charismatic, and his singing was ""meh"". In times past, producers would dub better singers for the actors in certain musicals. Everyone knows that Marnie Nixon provided the singing for Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady. I saw some of Hepburn's tape from when she was singing those songs. She wasn't bad at all. But she wasn't Marnie Nixon. Maybe they should have done something like that for Gosling. Overall, I found the film a notch above ""Just OK""."

","L.A has always been a dream place for many people.Sometime, you may find that it is more interesting than New York City.I think it may due to the weather, winter in N.Y.C may be very frustrated.The Snow makes everything its vitality,but L.A hardly snow,which is a little bit like Shanghai where I stay.Also, Hollywood, jazz music ,Disneyland and so on,are also very attractive.So, in my view, maybe this is the reason why La La Land is in L.A rather than N.Y.C.<br/><br/>The story is common actually.Mia is an ordinary waitress who is working in a cafe in Hollywood neighbor.The cafe is just across the balcony in the film Casablanca.Life is just like this,you are so close the dream place in your mind.However, it is very attractive but hard to make you get closer.Mia tries to achieve them because it is her dream since childhood.At that time,she watched so many movies introduced by her aunt.And that is why she writes a one-woman show,it is about her aunt in Paris,another dream city just like L.A.She went so many auditions but all failed, At this time,many people would choose to give up, but she sticks up. Sebastian ,a guy who tries to open a jazz club because he is so crazy about Jazz.But the reality is very cruel,he can not find a job he likes, he can not play his own song.All in all,he tires but fails again and again.The truth hardly goes as you wish,just like the Jazz club will change to a snack restaurant.Two lonely souls but filled with dreams,meet in a party, a love story begins,a common but very impressive story.Finally ,they broke up but they achieve their goals.The most impressive maybe the last part,5 years later,Mia is a famous actress,she marries and has a lovely baby.Once, she and her husband goes out, they find a bar which is very interesting.And the name is really the Seb's which Mia suggested.I think many people will be impressed.Then Seb happens to see Mia, then the music began, they went a dream,the happy ending.However, the truth is they can never be together, and that is real life,you can never get everything,you gain ,you must lose .<br/><br/>I suppose that the most enjoyable song is City Of Stars,not because The Academy gave the reward to this song.No matter Single version or the version they both sing along,are really beautiful.Sometimes,you walk on the street while listen to this song,you may sing along unconsciously.Even if you stay at home, you can imagine the beautiful night in Los Angeles,just like you stand on the Hollywood mountain watching them,and it is of course very fascinating.Just like the song sings, it is the characters' thought ,also your own thought.The star is shining for everyone, any individual who is trying their best to chest his\her dreams.You will fail so many times, but it doesn't matter,today is awful.Tomorrow is just another day of sun.Life will keep moving.<br/><br/>Finally,I have to say it is not my favorite movie.But it can be the most impressive along with many films.This is the first musical drama I have watched,and it would remind me a lot stuff.Imagine 20 years later,I listened the song,it must be impressive and touchable,like meet an old friend."
"s-66411","9","1","2","21 January 2018"," The Music Is Better
","Right, just as I have said ,the soundtrack is much better than the movie itself. I have drown into the soundtrack sometimes, but it was 2 mouths after I have watched the film.The soundtrack can remind something which is beyond the movie.It is the first musical film I have seen.So,as for a musical drama, it is pretty good but not so excellent to win so many awards and nominates.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple actually.Just a couple of lover who is chasing their dreams,Finally,they achieve their goal, but lost the great relationship,which is really a pity.And that is what life supposes to be, you can't get all you want.<br/><br/>Now ,it is about the music,it is greatest part.The most amazing may be Epilogue,.It collaborate all the climactic of the soundtrack,But not for me.I enjoy the Engagement Party and Mia&Sebastian's theme,it is marvelous,isn't it?At least it is in my view.In this two pieces of music ,you can imagine your future, remind the past beautiful life,always your own story, also it is easy to remind the movie.I don't i am gonna care about that.Then,maybe the humming of City of Stars after the light is already on.The song itself is very amazing. The Academy can not resist it ,the reward is very right.No matter what version ,all good.L.A is usually be a dream city for many people.Hollywood may the important but not the most.And this song is a very good explanation. In some aspects ,maybe NYC is less attractive than L.A.<br/><br/>All in all, the soundtrack can let you listen again and again.IT does not matter not see the movie in the theatre,but it can really a pity miss the concert if you really love this movie."

With their many improbable finds, all of the latter are superior ways to find entertainment, intellectual stimulation, or simply the inducement of sleep. Even sitting in a corner doing nothing is a less expensive way to waste two hours and eight minutes. There is better production design and more imaginative cinematography to be found in your average halftime television commercial. <br/><br/>And yet: Six (6) Oscars: Emma Stone (actress); Damien Chazelle (director) as well as cinematography, music, song, and production design.

"ajg-52410","7","1","2","28 September 2017"," La La Land is a new age musical about the life of an aspiring actress and jazz musician who fall in love while trying to follow their dreams.
","Damien Chazelle's La La Land is a new age musical with many throwbacks to the classic films by Gene Kelly. The ending leaves the audience feeling content and sad at the same time for both the characters and allows for the viewer to interpret what it means to be happy, to do something you love or be with someone you love. The movies overall feeling is joyful yet grounded in reality; the speed was fast paced but slacks a bit in the middle felling like it was dragging on. The movie has many references to classical musicals which should provide great entertainment for anyone familiar with the films by Gene Kelly. The camera movement and use of colors and music to illustrate emotion was nothing short of stellar. For example, in the end of the movie Sebastian is bathed in yellow light while Mia's face is covered in a blue lighting while the background was a dark green showed that for them to fit into the world they needed to change the path they were on, because together they both made the color green and made their way into the world but apart from each other. Another simple thing that illustrated change in character was the 360-degree spin around Mia during her successful audition showing her divergence from the path she was already on. The music also played a key part during Mia's revelation of what her life could have been with Sebastian playing the same tune that they both met. Chazelle's commitment to classical filming techniques truly made this movie a joy to watch that evoked far more emotion than any other film of that year. The twist at the end really gives a certain tone to the movie that the world isn't a fairy tale and you need to sacrifice other parts of your life to succeed in another."
"txk-75811","7","1","2","28 September 2017"," Review
","La La Land is a movie by Damien Chazelle which brings back together with old musicals like Singin' in the Rain, Broadway Melody, shall we Dance and much more. Overall it is a movie about movies. The whole movie plot is about potential but struggling actress Mia who thought that she can be an actor because her aunt showed her some ""Casablanca"" posters when she was younger and jazz pianist Sebastian who is currently stuck with the idea of bringing back the glory of jazz like before. The beginning of the movie took my breath away, even though I am not a big fan of the musicals, but that bridge scene was stunning. Later, the whole plot of the movie was about following struggling lives of actors until their paths came across, and then guess what, they fall in love, nothing to be surprised for. Later, they started to support each other towards their life dreams, until Mia dumps Sebastian because he was going for guaranteed success instead of opening jazz bar. Mia went home to her parents and giving up on her dream to become actress until Sebastian comes and saves the day by persuading Mia to go to this promising audition, and then something happened that I didn't even expect to happen, they both went separate ways, until they met again in future Mia as successful actress with family and Sebastian with this dream achieved to open successful jazz bar. That scene was interesting because I didn't even expect it and it kept the dose of reality, it was a happy ending but not as usually one. This film had some interesting moments from technical / shooting aspect. The cinematography is good and the movie is visually perfect, but what can you expect from the movie with more than 30 million dollars budget. I really liked that the movie was shot in the way that somehow it reminds you of old days, because of the visuals you could say that, it is only because of the usage of modern technologies like iPhone, new cards etc. it is obvious that is modern age. This movie includes one interesting scene that can be referenced as slight return of Mise en sc√®ne, scene where Mia and Sebastian were on their first date, there were in cinema watching ""Rebel Without a Cause"", the situation between them were starting to get bit more serious until the screen goes black because of technical issues, and then everything stops. The lighting and colors were playing a huge roll in the movie, colors were crucial in displaying the current emotions. The blue color was used a lot, it surrounded Mia few times, for example, the moment when Sebastian had the first concert with a bend, she also had a blue dress at the party, and the city was shining blue after she left the party. The yellow played a huge role because it symbolized the change ahead. Like the moment when Mia and Sebastian danced after party, Mia's dress was yellow and before that, they were in not so friendly relation but after the dance, they looked like more than some friends. Also, the moment when they were on dinner they both were bathed in yellow color while the background was green in the end that scene resulted with the possible break up. I really liked the moment where they shot the 360-degree scene with Mia singing the song, it looked like she is alone in her own universe telling the tale about her struggling to reach the stars. From the analytical aspect, the movie is decent but I have expected more. The story was so basic that even clich√©s had clich√©s, even though I was really surprised by ending it caught me off guard, there was that dose of reality trough whole movie that I really liked."
"tolson-56820","6","1","2","14 July 2017"," Alright but don't believe the hype
","I'm not particularly into musicals, but when done well, they can probe into an area of enjoyment that regular films don't bother with.<br/><br/>This movie does not do that, not at all. It's almost as if some amateur theatre troupe discovered a suitcase of money and decided to spend it on their life's dream: hiring some Hollywood heavies to shine-up their B-grade overworked musical romp. The movie looks good, it moves nicely, editing is fine... all the hallmarks of money spent getting pros to do professional work.<br/><br/>None of it saves the cringe-worthy opening, the unexpected and unexplained changes in personality of the characters, nor the general feeling of algorithm-driven movie construction (insert jazzy swing number here).<br/><br/>La La Land starts out musical-heavy, singing and single-take popping it's way through several muffled numbers, until after about 20 mins I began to start forming the words in my head: ""this movie isn't for me honey, I'm going to go do something else"".<br/><br/>Clearly someone with contacts had conned their good friends in the media to spread the word: pure awesome clean fun had been condensed into a two-hour chocolate bar. But the lyrics were machine-gunned out, the songs boiled out like coke poured onto hot concrete and every side character looked like they were trying to over perform with their 2 minutes screen time.<br/><br/>But I stuck with it and held a sort of scrunched face grimace on my dial through Stone and Gosling dancy-dancing their way around an LA hilltop (""look Ma they teached me to dance good""). Check it out fools: we've got chemistry, listen to the foot scrapes and our near-synchronisation. I know next to nothing about dancing but it reeked of average-skilled people trying really hard to emulate things they've been taught, like the way you feel when a picture-perfect CGI character starts awkwardly moving their lips. Like an uncanny valley of dance instruction.<br/><br/>Then abruptly, the musical push fades, Gosling's character stops being a douche and Emma Stone becomes 3D. And then I actually started to enjoy myself. OK so we find out very late in the piece that she already has a boyfriend, but what the heck, he's a big-haired vain suit and she evidently can't stop thinking about the permanently squinting unshaven skinny white jazz enthusiast who opened with road rage, but captured her heart with a bit of careful stalking.<br/><br/>It gets almost good - I'm non-convinced of Stone's character ever having a chance of ""making it"", but Gosling's pianist-with-old-school-values almost starts to work. The John Legend bit works. Their early love works.<br/><br/>Then... |insert here: well-meaning love gesture that ends in an epic argument|. Back to algorithms, he sells out, she criticises him for not following his dream, he understandably gets upset says unreasonably dumb things, it's immediately non-reconcilable. He puts on a Kevin Federline outfit and does a photo shoot, missing Emma's one-shot fragile heart output to an audience of 10 (wait are they here one-dimensional friends in the crowd? Gee guys were have you been?) She breaks up, runs off home, he goes back to being a douche. No wait! Her show was a success, one of the ten was a power-hitter, they invite her to audition and she ad-libs a song under the notes ""emulate Anne Hathaway"". The movie falls away.<br/><br/>At times I quite liked it, the ending is fine, but there are huge holes all through the middle and for me, almost all the song and dance parts just don't work. Like so many people have said, get properly skilled people to do this, not well-known actors who try really hard whilst ultimately failing.<br/><br/>Not the worst movie I've seen, the 1-star reviews are excessively harsh, but anyone who rates this a 10 has, for me, been fooled by the media and awards hype."

","I am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. <br/><br/>The best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.<br/><br/>Yes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with clich√© than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.<br/><br/>7/10"
"p-jonsson","6","1","2","6 July 2017"," Surprisingly okay to watch
","This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia's bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.<br/><br/>Everything else about this movie is¬Öokay. Okay acting, okay story etc. As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.<br/><br/>I cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.<br/><br/>I did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would."
"Wizard-8","Null","1","2","11 June 2017"," Pleasant but ultimately forgettable
","I'm not really sure why ""La La Land"" got both critical acclaim as well as a pretty good turnout at the box office. Maybe it's because Hollywood musicals are a rare thing these days, so it seemed fresh and original to people. It's not really a bad movie, I admit. The photography is first rate, the lead actors are likable, and some of the direction of the musical numbers is eye catching. However, the songs in these musical numbers, while easy on the ears, sound pretty much alike for the most part. And they are not really memorable; you'll forget the songs a few hours after watching the movie. Another problem is that the movie moves at a really slow pace. While at first the leisurely pace is refreshing in this era of in-your- face and strident movies, eventually you'll be asking the movie to simply get on with it. The movie is best reserved for a time when you want some pleasant background noise and images while doing a task that involves your main focus. Don't worry about missing any plot points - you'll be able to fill in the blanks easily and correctly."

","I've read a lot of ONE-STAR reviews here for this movie and have to say all of them say ONE THING: ""I am a pessimistic non-dreamer, who hasn't any connection to artistic, magical masterpieces like this one.""<br/><br/>This movie is for dreamers and people who want to dream. If you are none of them...you miss out on life and you miss out on the beautiful message this movie has to give to many of us.<br/><br/>I LOVED LA LA LAND! I went to 3 screenings and looking forward to the fourth. The Story is beautiful without being too cheesy or anything near boring. Don't expect a typical Hollywood Romance-Comedy. Expect a modern love story, coated in vintage Hollywood floating on musical wonders. What i felt watching it for the first time and what came to my mind was: MAGIC! You have to let go and take this movie and its wonderful music in. THE MUSIC....the music is so touching it makes you wanna cry because you can't handle the feelings. The characters and the music have an amazing bond. Just go and see it and if you don't get goosebumps at any point...i am sorry for you!"

Starting for the idea that unlike most of the musicals are based on the fact that almost all the movie is singed with no purpose, this film have the particularity that the characters only sing when they are feeling so great emotions that cant be expressed with only talking, so they start to sing and dance. As i said, and as you could see, they are not the best voices in this movie because the movie doesn't focus really on that (as most of the musicals) this movie shows a very human story which the one you can fill identified. Art, music, image and the complement of all this elements is just out of this world"
"cschultz-2","9","3","12","30 January 2017"," Entertaining...and Moving
","The decision to either abandon one's dream of success in the arts, or to compromise one's own artistic vision and modify a dream to conform to someone else's, is a heartbreaking and emotionally traumatic moment in the life of a performer. And it is during that transitional moment in the lives of two performers‚Äîan actress and a jazz pianist‚Äîthat the movie La La Land occurs. How the two reach that decision, how they visualize it‚Äîand most importantly, whether or not they can survive it together, as a couple‚Äîforms the plot of the picture.<br/><br/>And what a picture La La Land turns out to be‚Äîa 128-minute swirling, colorful explosion of a movie, equally brimming with elation and heartbreak, drama and comedy, but all filled with singing, playing, and dancing not in movies since¬Öwell, maybe ever. Comparisons to 1985's A Chorus Line or 2002's Chicago or even 1933's 42nd Street are inadequate. And to measure the film against 1952's classic Singin' in the Rain, often considered the best musical ever made, is just simply inappropriate.<br/><br/>La La Land stands on its own--it is its own unique, exhilarating self. Even for those of us who don't enjoy musicals, La La Land is an inspiration, because more than about art or music or performance, it's about life itself. You think you've had a bad day? Take a look at these poor unfortunate souls as they realize they might have squandered their entire lives on a dream no more substantial than a Land of Lollipops and Cotton Candy, Somewhere Over a Rainbow.<br/><br/>Just after the movie screen opens up and widens to reveal the picture will be presented in glorious CinemaScope, the widest and largest film presentation available, and in vibrant and breathtaking Technicolor, the very first scene takes place on a steamy day in a traffic jam outside Los Angeles. One single, frustrated driver exits her car and begins to tentatively sing a song about how she's remaining optimistic despite the misery of the day.<br/><br/>That solitary driver is soon joined by another driver, and then another, and another, until moments later the entire freeway is filled with a breathtakingly entertaining musical production piece involving hundreds of drivers, all performing an optimistic song to a driving tempo while displaying spectacular synchronized jumps and whirls and high-steps in a variety of dance styles. It's a tough act to follow¬Öbut as Al Jolson said in 1927's The Jazz Singer, Hollywood's very first musical, ""You ain't seen nuthin' yet!"" Nominally the stars of La La Land are the vibrant and lovely Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress, and the laconic, handsome Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, a jazz pianist performing for tips in a lunchtime restaurant. Stone and Gosling also teamed effectively earlier in their careers, in supporting roles in the 2011 comedy Crazy, Stupid Love, starring Steve Carell and Julianne Moore.<br/><br/>In La La Land, Stone's Mia is a young actress toiling as a waitress at an upscale coffee shop. Mia accepts the slights, low tips, and casual cruelties of both customers and co-workers with an indefatigable sense of optimism while religiously attending auditions for acting roles, when she can find them. She believes in her dream, and is aggressively pursuing the opportunity that will vindicate her vision and show that all her effort has been worthwhile.<br/><br/>Emma Stone with her luminescent eyes and expressive smile opens her heart, and shares with the audience nuances of every tiny triumph and discouraging failure‚Äîher feelings quickly become ours, until we're praying for her success almost as much as she is.<br/><br/>Gosling as Sebastian, the jazz pianist, turns in a less effecting performance than Stone, but that might be a subjective point‚Äîsome viewers simply don't quite comprehend the actor's performance method: Gosling often appears inarticulate, murmuring his dialogue while looking downward or away from the other character, then looking up to assess the impact of his lines, followed by a wistful smile, as if the actor's recalling a sweet memory from long ago. Gosling is effective in his role as Sebastian, but some of that success is earned as a result of the belief Mia places in him‚Äîwe trust her trust.<br/><br/>Both Gosling and Stone, however, dazzle in their musical scenes‚Äîtheir singing and dancing are impressive, and at times exhilarating. The canny viewer will notice, however, that often the dancing is presented in very small segments of two of three seconds duration, edited together to create the illusion of one continuous performance. It's a trick of Tom Cross' expert editing, but it works beautifully: Stone and Gosling are not Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, but watching them dancing together you'll hardly notice the distinction.<br/><br/>But the real star of La La Land is writer and director Damien Chazelle, who also delivered the inspiring and challenging Whiplash in 2014. Plainly sufficiently inspired by music to largely build his movies around it, Chazelle is also canny enough to appreciate that the non-musical sequences are equally important to the overall success of the picture. <br/><br/>Also enormously impressive is Justin Hurwitz' music‚Äîwords, lyrics, and orchestrations. If the ballad The Fools Who Dream doesn't draw a tear from the viewer's eye, call a cardiologist, quick. The song is delivered by Stone toward the end of the picture, during the audition that will make or break her career. And the wistful delicacy of Stone's performance of the song nicely summarizes the emotion of every man or woman who knows the feeling of making a decision based on their heart rather than their mind.<br/><br/>Plainly, La La Land is a movie made by people who love movies, for people who love movies. Proceed with caution: See this picture only if you want to be moved as deeply as you want to be entertained."
"Argemaluco","10","3","12","26 January 2017"," La La Land
","I definitely have to join myself to the multitudes acclaiming La La Land as a ""love letter to Hollywood"". I would just add that it's in fact a love letter to the IDEA of Hollywood... not the neighborhood from Los √Ångeles full of homeless, drug dealers and ""trannies"", but that Utopian ""dream factory"" where love is instantaneous, sincere and eternal, and where talent, with a bit of luck, invariably leads to stardom... or at least absolute happiness. It's the same, isn't it? And when we add the musical numbers, the result is a delicate confection which is similar to a cotton candy: delicious but almost intangible. The difference is that La La Land will remain on our palate for a long time due to its sticky songs, excellent screenplay and extraordinary visual style. In conclusion, an unforgettable experience which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation to the fans of cinema and the musicals in general. In the leading roles, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone display their talent and charisma once more, and both form a magnetic couple. And then, we have the wonderful musical numbers conceived by director Damien Chazelle and his talented creative team, including composer Justin Hurwitz and choreographer Mandy Moore (not the one you are thinking about). From the first seconds of La La Land, Chazelle establishes his amazing vision with a musical number set on a Los √Ångeles freeway, during the rush hour. And, in case that wasn't ambitious enough, cinematographer Linus Sandgren employs a graceful camera which moves through the scenes like one more dancer, with fluid and spontaneous movements which hide their careful planning. In my humble opinion, the camera work of La La Land rivals the one of Birdman, and I'm not exaggerating. I won't reveal the rest of the musical numbers, but I will just say that each one of them works perfectly to display the music, the actors and, of course, the city of Los √Ångeles. The screenplay is perfectly written, and it doesn't only work to introduce the musical numbers, because it tells a very interesting story by itself. And even though Gosling and Stone are the absolute owners of the movie, I also have to mention the presence of J.K. Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt and John Legend (yes, the one you are thinking about), who bring energy and conviction to their brief roles. In conclusion, La La Land is a brilliant musical movie, and as I previously said, I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm. And, yes, we have already understood that Chazelle loves jazz (his previous film was Whiplash); I suspect that his secret purpose was implanting that musical style into our heads, in which it will remain for many days after leaving the cinema."

I would definitely like to watch again some of them more carefully.<br/><br/>Perhaps the way the story is unfolded might be classic, but in many other ways it's intriguing, and surprising eventually.<br/><br/>The actors did an excellent work. In this movie I laughed, I felt sad, I felt frustrated, I felt happy, I cried, I got angry, I screamed, I started pulling the hair on my head... The mix of the story, the performance and the music really made me feel part of that world. Except...! At some points you will figure out. A lot of emotional work can be felt here.<br/><br/>About the music... I think I started hearing it everywhere. It's so lively and colorful. It is just life as it is. Mr. Hurwitz must have gone through really tough nights playing, composing, experimenting...<br/><br/>The end of the movie... I think it's fantastic. It just speaks by itself. I think it has been made so easy to understand for most of audiences, and it transmits quite a strong message or two.<br/><br/>I will probably want to watch this movie again in a few months, or a year, just to go through all this story and all these feelings one more time.

"shaht-16429","9","2","7","26 May 2017"," Catchy songs, great characters, beautifully shot and expertly performed
","La La Land is a musical that tells the story of three different loves stories, Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) developing a romantic relationship set in Hollywood. The other two love stories revolve around Mia and Sebastian's love for their respective career choices, Mia with acting and Sebastian with jazz music. Both of them are struggling to make it in the world, but as they gain momentum their romantic relationship starts to disintegrate. <br/><br/>This is a story that has been done before, Sebastian wants to own his own jazz club but is struggling to make money because the world around him wants him to compromise his taste of music with popular current music. Mia wants to make it as an actress but cannot take rejection after rejection after rejection. La La Land however subverts the musical genre and gives the characters some great songs and great characterization. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great in the roles, especially Emma Stone, they still have great chemistry even after 2 movies, (Gangster Squad and Crazy, Stupid, Love) and for people who have never really sung before, they do an great job, but they are not the real stars of the movie, the real star is setting, Hollywood.<br/><br/>Hollywood is beautifully shot in the movie, the direction and cinematography are immaculate. Stellar use of long takes and moving cameras and used to show the beauty of the city. The city is really able to become its own character, it does almost become the antagonist of the story for both Mia and Sebastian, not only for their dreams and aspirations but also for their relationship. It is almost hypnotizing how the film almost draws you into the scene, not only with the setting but also the songs. The songs are well done, they give off an aura of old time classic 1950's music but also sound modern enough for young people to enjoy. However, the use of music sometimes overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>La La Land is around two hours long but honestly it doesn't need to be, there are some scenes that just feel like they were included because they look pleasing to the eye, and they do, however it does not justify its means of existing. The scenes where Mia and Sebastian are falling in love last around ten to fifteen minutes but feel like thirty and contain no dialogue, so it can actually be done in around five minutes of screen time. There are a myriad of dance breaks which are supposed to show the chemistry between Mia and Sebastian, but there are at least three scenes that already do that before they finally spark a connection. Also as for other flaws, some of the lip singing done by supporting members of the cast, for example Mia's roommates or the people singing 'Another Day of Sun' are pretty transparent and while I do think the ending was poignant and sticks true to the overall message of the film, I could do without the final montage.<br/><br/>Overall La La Land is a very enjoyable time at the movies, if you love musicals you will have a blast with this one, if you don't like musicals you will probably hate this, but you could enjoy it for the beautiful shots, scenery and acting. Out of the two movies directed by Damien Chazelle, I do prefer Whiplash but the movie is still very engaging, I never found my self escaping to my very own La La Land."

I just want them to be delivered to me, right up there on the screen (or on my computer, or DVD player). <br/><br/>First viewing, I did not particularly like 'La La Land.' Watching people dance - eh, I've seen better. My attention wanders. I'm checking e-mail. I'm thinking that Emma Stone is no great beauty. I'm wondering how it is that these two, Stone and Gosling, are going to 'carry' this movie. <br/><br/>They do - they make this movie work. Emma Stone looks like - and becomes - a plucky film star wannabe. Ryan Gosling looks like - and becomes - a musician. He learned to perform the jazz pieces, no need for faking it, without, amazingly, starting out an accomplished pianist. <br/><br/>I don't think I appreciated how much promise there was for their powerful romance until they exchanged a certain glance. <br/><br/>This is a very very LUSH 'Umbrellas of Cherbourg' type film, in my opinion. Can Los Angeles look any more beautiful? <br/><br/>'La La Land' does not match the romantic dramas of the 30s and 40s. Emma Stone does not have the inner tenderness that peeks through the cool exterior of a Bette or a Joan. She does convey something fresher, though, of a youthful actress today."

","So, what IS the big deal about La La Land? Is it really just overrated Hollywood garbage?<br/><br/>Let me just start off by saying that I went to see La La Land with an open mind (as you should with any film). I entered the movie theatre holding a cocktail mix of polarized reviews varying from those who praised it for its brilliance, to others who bitterly criticized it for being an overrated white-washed film. <br/><br/>And after finally seeing the movie, I was taken aback by how amazing it was. Where do I begin? I'll put it this way - I have never been more grateful to experience such a beautiful film in cinema. La La Land manages to check off all the prerequisites of a well-made film. <br/><br/>First off, the cinematography is breathtaking. The film itself captures the classical charm of a bygone era through so much attention to detail in costume and set designing whilst eloquently integrating these themes into the modern world. The richness of the colour and lighting play a huge part in setting the overall tone, romanticizing each moment through a retro 20th century movie-esque lens.<br/><br/>Also, whoever created the soundtrack for La La Land deserves a big high-five from me. From hauntingly beautiful heart-felt love songs to vibrant musical numbers, the music in this film gave me goosebumps and had me bouncing in my seat. Thanks guys, I now listen to the soundtrack on repeat. My two favourite songs are ""Someone in the Crowd"" and ""Another Day in the Sun"". <br/><br/>And no, Emma Stone is not a professional singer, but who cares? She's not meant to be, she plays an aspiring actress. I was impressed with both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's performance.<br/><br/>The film resonated with me because it was a story about falling in love and following your dreams, and all the adversities that come with it. So unless you're a naturally bitter person, you will find this visual feast incredibly moving."

","I vote ""excellent"" because I *judge* a movie only from the perspective as a pathetically passive audience member whose only power is either to stay or walk away. The movie is excellent because of its integrity. It doesn't polish up the actors (like they did in earlier days), the movie doesn't even bother to make the characters look ""cool"" or their abodes look like they were designed by your favorite interior designer. What they deal with every day (the songbook, ""is this gluten-free?"") is also real. If I would be living in LA I would go through exactly the same. Even their romance feels real to me. The song and dance parts are of course a manipulated hyper-reality, but they are real in the sense that they are not trying to dazzle me, the audience, with impossible moves and taped-up smiles. With a little practice I can make those moves. Failure to become an actress, selling out principles, experiences are real too. But neither falls back to clich√© behavior like drug use and violence, which makes it also real, most people move on after they tried ""the acting thing"" and become insurance saleswomen and not druggies. What's also real is that you have to put yourself out there to get noticed. What's also real is that when you want your own club you have to have some earned money in the bank to realize *your* dream. You also have to have people around you who have your back and willing to take that extra step; pick you up from Colorado to do an important audition. It's also real that success trumps people in Hollywood and although the ending seems confusing, it's beyond *real* that people in this hyper-capitalistic state we are in opt for money and status over another human being they deeply love. I think it's cynical, but, the real clinchers is that if you or I would be in a similar position would we ignore the pain that is tearing apart our heart and pour ourselves into the next song or the next role?"

","When I went to see La La Land I was sure I wouldn't like but as the first scene started I was amazed, completely transported to a musical world of sing and dance. I really think it is worth going to see. Going back to the first scene on the Santa Monica Freeway! For about 5 minutes were just dancing and singing! I really thought that gosling and stone were PERFECT for the roles and if Emma Watson and Miles Teller would have been terrible in those roles. The Music is just incredible and the jazz is perfect!!!! GO SEE IT!!! ITS AMAZING!!!! If you are into love and chick flicks you will love it, it really shows you what life would have been like in the 1940s. And as soon as I got home from the cinema I downloaded the soundtrack to listen to my 3 favourite song Someone In the Crowd, A Lovely Night and City Of Stars.<br/><br/>It really is worth going to see xxx"

","Emma Stone's acting and graceful dancing was superb. In my opinion, it is a movie that kind of like those from Audrey Hepburn's time. It is for the romantic, for the dreamers. Ryan Gosling's acting was okay for me. About the ending, it is a realistic one and well this movie portrays what really happens in real life, from the hard work you put in to follow your dreams, the love of your life that eventually fails, and you end up marrying someone else to walking into your past and finally walking away, muttering under your breath, ""oh well"" Fascinating movie actually. Transition between scenes are good, very old school, which is a great thing. I think that Emma Stone is very beautiful although when she speaks, she has this ""TH"" sound going on, distracting honestly."

","WHAT'S LA LA LAND ABOUT?<br/><br/>An aspiring actress and a struggling jazz musician fall in love and inspire each other artistically.<br/><br/>IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: A)<br/><br/>Featuring truly dazzling film-making and strong performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, La La Land is an enchanting blend of modern and retro. Taking place in present-day Los Angeles, but made in the style of classic Hollywood musicals, it's a delight. The leads are merely passable as vocalists, but strong as actors and dancers. Their undeniable chemistry, combined with the sensibilities of writer-director Damien Chazelle (who places one foot in bittersweet reality and the other in whimsical fantasy) make for an unforgettable cinematic experience. <br/><br/>The songs, choreography, wardrobe, production design, editing, and cinematography are top-shelf. It could use a bit tighter pacing and the ending may divide some audiences (I thought it was beautiful), but this unconventional love story is a must-see.<br/><br/>IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS?<br/><br/>La La Land is rated PG-13. It has one f-word and a few moderate profanities, along with two vulgar hand gestures. Swimsuits and dresses reveal legs, abdomens, and mild cleavage (frankly it's no more revealing than what's shown in old Gene Kelly movies if you go back and re-watch them). There's some drinking at Hollywood parties. Some couples dance sensually in the background, but it's not raunchy or explicit. A man and woman kiss and live together; we see them cuddling fully clothed in bed. There is no sexuality.<br/><br/>ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES?<br/><br/>Be grateful for the people who inspire you. Pursue your dreams with tenacity and integrity. The direction your life takes hinges on the decisions you make; choose wisely. Surround yourself with people who believe in you but also hold you accountable."
"midas-jacobs","9","2","7","29 January 2017"," Amazingly directed and acted film, with a well written script and good songs
","""La La Land"" is about two people, one an aspiring actor the other one a jazz enthusiast, who both fall for each other and whose story gets told via the manner of a musical.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle returns to create his second movie, also music-centered. His previous film, ""Whiplash"", was one of the better films of 2014. In that movie he showed his talent, but in this one he even surpassed his previous achievements. Chazelle used incredibly long, beautiful shot takes, often accompanied with a good song, more on the songs later. These scenes are seamlessly cut together, whereby sometimes they make it seem that the scene was shot in one take, but actually had some cleverly hidden edits in them. Often these were hidden behind quick camera movements. The movie by the way begins in such a fashion, as I just described. That scene was done fantastic and set up high expectations for the rest of the film. What Damien Chazelle also did was to use vibrant colors throughout the whole film. Green, purple, yellow, red all return multiple times in the film, each end everyone having a meaning to them, which made the film more interesting.<br/><br/>The songs were written with care and added to the film. They each told a story that had something to do with the scene or the story, and weren't just useless songs, there to fill up the moment, or to be there and later to sell a soundtrack to double their earnings. No, they are there, because they have a meaning. The songs were beautifully written and performed, and I really understand why the Oscars have picked out two of the songs, which I also found to be two of the best songs in the film. There were of course some songs that were lesser good, but even those I found to be amusing to listen to. Not only the songs sung by the cast were good, but also the instrumentals in the background were fantastic to listen to. Those also added to the scenes that they were setting up. I do have one problem with how some of the songs were presented, but that problem mostly lies with me, and not with the movie. This problem is that at times it feels kind of forced how they start some songs. At times they just burst out of songs, which was unfitting to me. But that's the nature of a musical, so what did I expect? But at times those scenes where handled very well. I liked how the lights drained out, only focusing on the one who's going to sing, and at times the singing also happened naturally and didn't feel forced, so it's kind of a double edged sword.<br/><br/>I want to come back to the directing of Damien Chazelle, because I want to say a couple of things on his visual directing. That looked absolutely gorgeous. Like I've said, he used vibrant colors, which really made the scenes stand out more. The use of vibrant colors is also something that you don't see that often anymore in films, which is a shame, because look at the result ""La La land"" got. The framing was good and the camera movements to were fantastic. Chazelle used shadow and lightning brilliantly to created good-looking shots, and he also masters the use of focus. <br/><br/>Enough about that, let's move on to the acting. Ryan Gosling once again shows that he is a diverse actor and can play a whole host of characters. In this movie he gives a fantastic performance and it's no surprise that he has gotten that Oscar nomination. Emma Stone too gives a fantastic performance, at first I was a bit skeptical with her, but after the first thirty minutes or so, she persuaded me into enjoying her performance. The both of them had great on screen chemistry, whereby their relationship only became more believable and realistic. <br/><br/>The script was very good and the characters stood out to me the most. The story itself was straightforward and easy to follow. Nonetheless it was a good story. It was realistic and grounded, just like the characters, and that's why I liked them so much. Most of the times you get to see unrealistic characters, but here that wasn't the case. In ""La La Land"" you can see two relatable people, fighting to reach their dreams, accompanied with the struggle that fight brings them. Because these characters are so realistic and relatable, you also start to care for them. What I also liked about the film is that it made me appreciate jazz more, because of one particular scene, in which Ryan Gosling is enthusiastic about it trying to convince Emma Stone how good jazz can be. The scene was wonderfully written and in that scene he didn't only convince Emma Stone, but also me. The ending was weird at first, but when I realized what was going on, I started to appreciate it more and more, until the movie ended with it satisfying, yet heartbreaking conclusion. The film really plays with your emotions, and can make you feel sad and happy again in a spit second, but at the end it all felt like a feel-good movie created for people who have dreams and have trouble reaching them, what I very much appreciated.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" was a very good musical, and this comes from someone who generally doesn't like musicals. The songs were good and so was the acting. Damien Chazelle created one of the most well directed films of the year, and that's why I am giving this one a 9.2/10."
"dierregi","8","2","7","29 January 2017"," A pleasant break from reality - just like during the Great Depression
","Usually, musicals are about a boy, a girl, a bunch of good songs and some dancing. I am not a big fan of the genre, but I definitely prefer any Astaire-Rogers movie than later productions with loud, long songs and too much dancing (anything with Gene Kelly).<br/><br/>Therefore, I enjoyed La La Land. It has a very simple plot, some pleasant songs, among which the great ""City of stars"" and most of the dance numbers are not overdone - apart from the first one, of course.<br/><br/>The opening scene made me fear for the worst, being a bombastic number with amazing acrobatics and many people involved. But then boy and girl meet not so cute, with some minor road-rage, and the show tones down a bit. Gosling is Sebastian, a would-be jazz pianist and Stone is Mia, a would-be actress.<br/><br/>After the bumpy start, they get together and support each other's dream, until their professional success becomes the main problem. Not a groundbreaking plot: from poor and happy, to rich and famous but not so happy anymore. The slightly melancholic ending wraps up the story perfectly.<br/><br/>I usually do not like much Gosling, but he was OK as Sebastian and Stone is lovely. However, in too many close-ups of her face, her eyes and lips look disproportionately huge. Neither is a great singer, but their imperfection is quite endearing. They had enough chemistry and their songs and dances were fine.<br/><br/>My only negative remark is about some corny dialogue. Both Sebastian and Mia encourage each other ""not to care about what people think, but to do to what they like"". As performers, they should care a lot about pleasing people. Lots of ""artists"" are out there doing what they like, with zero or very little following - and very rightly so, because they don't respect the public. While integrity is appreciated, self-absorption not so much....<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling better than when entered, which lately happens quite rarely. Maybe it is the hard times or the stress of life, but this movie was definitely a pleasant break from reality."
"billcr12","8","2","7","25 January 2017"," Gosling's film
","Ryan Gosling proves to be one the most versatile actors working today with his performance in LA La Land. Who knew that he could also sing and dance. My previous favorite film of his is Lars and the Real Doll in which he plays an oddball who falls in love with a mail order doll and his family and friends to along with his illusions. His partner here is Emma Stone as an aspiring actress who works as a waitress and struggles to survive. Gosling is a jazz pianist, and, of course, they fall in love as they pursue their dreams. The music is good, including John Legend as a singer and band leader who provides an established star for Gosling to work with. I am not a fan of the musical genre, especially actors singing lines at each other. I find the format tedious. I was able to overcome my previous prejudices and actually sit back and appreciate the story. The ending in not a typically Hollywood one, so La La Land is one of the best movies of 2016."
"eleagece","9","2","7","22 January 2017"," Are you shining just for me? ‚ô™‚ô´
","Everyone loved this movie. So I got ready to hate it, to find any possible mistake in order to rip its heart out and feel more intelligent than anyone else. I tried hard, really. But when Mia experienced her catharsis listening to the background jazz music during the dinner with Greg I experienced my own: I knew I was going to love La La Land.<br/><br/>This city of stars has the feeling of the Hollywood golden age but at the same time has its own personality. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are stunning and in some ways I felt like I was watching a classic Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon love story."
"davidrefaeli","9","2","7","22 January 2017"," In the Realm of Kitsch
","This movie puzzles. I watched it two days ago and I'm still a bit confused. There is no doubt it is well done. It touches you. The last scene is amazing and brings a tear to the eye. It also full of interesting commentary on life, like when Gossling's band-mate asks him ""How can you be a revolutionist if you're such a traditionalist?"" There's amazing freshness that the director brings to the screen - for example, the long car horn flashback, and it's subsequent use throughout the film. <br/><br/>But there's no denying the film has issues that - depending on what you're expecting - will affect the way you see it. <br/><br/>1) Is it too long, or too slow? It could be. The first-kiss scene for example, seems to be an endless impossible build up. But the question is - is the kiss really important? If you don't care about rushing to anywhere, maybe you can just enjoy the long dance and talk and fantasy that precedes it. And that's true for the whole film. <br/><br/>2) Is it full of clich√©s? Yes. It is. You will enter the Realm of Kitsch. But hey - it's a musical for heaven's sake! And it's even called ""La La Land"". So why should you expect anything else? There is no effort to avoid clich√©s or kitsch - on the contrary, they are sought after and elevated. This movie is an ode to innocence. To the old naive cinema. The characters are not complicated - they have simple drives. The narrative isn't complicated (an important evening, the other promises to be there, but he/she forgot that they have other engagement, etc. - a pure and clich√© expression of the conflict between love and life). It sells you the big dreams of ""being an artist"" and not ""selling out"", of romantic love that transcend time. But so what? These are universal themes, that we all should be reminded of sometimes, even if they are far-far-far from our realist and complicated life. <br/><br/>3) There's also the tiny con that the actors didn't always hit the note too well. But it's not too bad or noticeable. <br/><br/>I think if you will take all this into consideration, you will enjoy this movie tremendously. But even if you don't - it's still a good fun movie that is definitely worth seeing."
"ultrademonwarrior-32589","10","2","7","22 January 2017"," Man, I loved this movie. I'd say the best of 2016.
","I saw this for my 15th birthday, and it's great, from the opening Cinemascope card to the very last frame. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a man who wants to start a jazz club to enliven the genre, and Mia (the always talented Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who is also a waitress. Naturally, these two meet, and the film follows them and their ups and downs. I hate giving away spoilers, so I won't.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film is very catchy, the opening scene alone is a musical number in a traffic jam, and I reckon if your kid is mature enough to understand the film, there is very little inappropriate content (but the PG-13 rating in the US is because Ryan Gosling says an F word once, and there's a little bit of bad language), and the chemistry between Ryan and Emma just feels very natural. The film is a hybrid of a musical and a serious romantic drama, and the singing from these actors is pretty good, the dancing more so, but when it needs to be emotional, it is. When it needs to be funny, it is. There is just a magical quality to this that I can't describe.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I can nitpick, it's that the film can sometimes be a little slow. But that's nitpicking.

"danielharden","9","2","7","21 January 2017"," Here's to the ones who dream
","Are you a rusher or are you a dragger? Writer/ Director Damien Chazelle had us all asking this question after he released the spectacular movie that is Whiplash. Now off the back of an amazing directorial debut and having just co wrote one of the best films of 2016 (10 Cloverfield Lane), Chazelle is back with his second film and boy is he back. La La Land is a beautiful film about falling in love and chasing a dream, but is also about the difficulties that come with both.<br/><br/>Chazelle blows us away with the films opening scene. The opening highway gridlock number is perfectly directed by Chazelle; singing, dancing, cycling, parkour, it's all there and is all seamlessly choreographed by Mandy Moore in a scene that is shot as if done in one take (I am not certain if it is). The scene perfectly sets the tone for the films first act, which is that of a sophisticated homage to Hollywood's golden age of entertainment.<br/><br/>The first act introduces us to our two protagonists and their dreams. Mia is a woman trying to make it as an actress in Hollywood and is played wonderfully by Emma Stone, and Sebastian is a struggling musician aspiring to resurrect Jazz music and is played phenomenally by Ryan Gosling. The two leads work fantastically well together and their on screen chemistry is the best I've seen since Her. Personally I got behind Sebastian and his dream more than I did with Mia and I believe that is Chazelles intention as evident in the films ending. But I'll come back to that later. Sebastian's dream was a small thing and is achievable and realistic. Paired with Goslings passionate performance I really felt his love for the music and so was drawn to him. The reason I didn't connect with Mia was because her dream is clich√©, although her reason behind it is one that I understood, it's still a very vague and clich√© dream and so I did not connect with Mia. But as I said this is Chazelle's aim and due to this the films ending is so much more emotional.<br/><br/>After the film pays tribute to Hollywood's golden age and establishes our characters, their relationship and their dreams. The second act brings us back down to a more sober reality. Now that we have come attached to these characters we experience the roller coaster ride that is their relationship and their dream chasing. It's up and it's down, it's hopeful and it's hopeless, it's heartfelt and heartbreaking. What was once a tale of optimism, now begins to question itself, the characters question themselves and the dream and relationship conflict each other. The stand out scene has to be the dinner table argument. A well written and acted scene that has been built up to rather subliminally by Chazelle, for example I read Sebastian playing piano on the left side of the stage (from our perspective) as him not enjoying the music he's playing.<br/><br/>The third act brings back some of that nostalgic hope from the first act before building to it's bitter sweet ending. After endorsing in these characters hopes, dreams and relationship we now wait eagerly to know how it ends for Seb and Mia. Chazelle both writes and directs possibly the most perfect ending for the film imaginable. The 'how it could have been' sequence is mesmerizingly saddening as classic Hollywood set pieces and dance numbers reemerged all the while we are feeling Sebastian's regret, and with my connection to him this makes the sequence all the more emotional when they exchange that one final look.<br/><br/>Overall, La La Land is beautiful homage to the golden age of Hollywood the then fittingly becomes a sobering reality until building to it's perfectly bittersweet ending. Wonderfully acted by Stone and Gosling and Fantastically written and directed by Damien Chazelle. Mandy Moore should also be praised for the films choreography and Justin Hurwitz for his beautiful score that ironically seems to have achieved what Sebastian wanted. La La Land is a near faultless movie, that is personally a close second to Whiplash, but is likely to grant Chazelle what he deserves and that is the Oscar gold."
"tims1000","7","2","7","18 January 2017"," Let down right at the last
","For the most part, Damien Chazelle's Hollywood-based musical is a truly sumptuous affair full of glorious highlights with a touching romance between Stone's wannabe actress and Gosling's jazz pianist at its centre. Then the words ""five years later"" pop up on screen and you realise that it is, in fact, trying a bit too hard. It suddenly appears uncomfortable with its own whimsy, thrusting an unnecessary ""reality"" upon its audience in the final moments which undermines the joyousness of what has gone before. To an audience surely now fully invested in this dazzling couple, anything other than a future together is pointless: the attempt to marry dancing on top of cars and among the stars with a more modern truth is too awkward. A closing montage showing us the more traditional happy ending makes it even worse for the romantics, almost suggesting with its Chaplin-esque routines that any alternative to the proffered conclusion would be ridiculous. The brilliance of La La Land's setting, soundtrack and performances should not be forgotten, it's just a shame it decided it needed to carry a message."

","Okay so. I hate when people start reviews that way BUT this is a bit of a take a breath moment and keep it real. Sometimes in cinema a director/producer/writer etc will try to reinvent a genre. A revival if you like to make something popular again. Horror has been reinvented for generations, as have westerns and periodically, musicals. Unfortunately this movie will not revive the movie musical. As pleasant and mostly well meaning as this is, after hearing mostly positive reviews I walked into the cinema with warm expectations for a couple of hours of guilty pleasure enjoyment and walked out at the end in silence with the rest of the audience in a "" that was quite good "" kind of way. The story is not all engaging.The songs are not overly memorable and the pacing is fairly pretentious. It's a musical that is in denial about BEING a musical.I went to see an early run showing of Les Miserables in an IMAX cinema when it was released and the movie being applauded at the end because people had a fantastic experience. The mostly Luke warm experience of this with the occasional vaguely exciting dance number and the expressive quiet of the audience afterwards leaves nothing really left to say except. Pleasant enough and ultimately forgettable."

"sirnicolay","Null","2","7","11 January 2017"," Reality vs Musicals
","A Review of 'La La Land' (2016, Damien Chazelle)<br/><br/>When one watches a musical, the moviegoer braces himself to watching a story of a la la land, where the colors are bright, the songs and dances are loud (and gay--happy and otherwise), and the characters scream their emotions to the screen. Musicals are usually hammy and fun. One ends up leaving the cinema, humming a few songs from the film, hoping to extend the magic of the musical and make the positivity seep into one's reality.<br/><br/>La La Land is not a moviegoer's typical musical. The colors are mostly muted, most of the songs are not the ones to give you a severe case of LSS, and the character's emotions are contained, subtle even. The moviegoer gets out of the cinema, not humming, but thinking of how this new musical worked despite not following the tried and tested conventions of musicals.<br/><br/>I applaud how the director, Damien Chazelle, fuses his love for jazz music in this film, reminiscent of his earlier fantastic work, Whiplash. The unexpected, quirky nature of jazz parallels the turns in the movie's narrative, elevating this simple musical to its a dizzying, profound, rich climax.<br/><br/>The performance of both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are sober-ly appropriate, as if one has seen a jazz concert and the players are too cool to admit that they slew their performance. But I have to hand it to Emma Stone, where in one singing scene, she stole my heart with the subtle emotions in her face, both in cathartic mode AND in perfectly melodic tune.<br/><br/>Admittedly, La La Land seems like a shoo-in for award festivals, because it is the kind of movie that Hollywood loves. It is set in City of Stars after all (La La Land as set in Los Angeles, so yeah, wordplay on 'LA' La Land). Filmbuffs would rejoice at some references to classics like Singin' in the Rain and Casablanca. But the casual moviegoers would still be able to identify the reality that the lovers have had to deal with.<br/><br/>It's a classic love story spoiled by practicality; it is a classic story of how the dichotomy of appearance and reality interweave and catch up with one another. The movie in our head wants the musical, but our modern selves also believe that the musical is too ideal, too good to be true. The last twenty minutes of the movie takes the moviegoer to this dilemma and we ask ourselves if we have become so jaded that we do recognize that the musical has to give way to a saner, sadder conclusion.<br/><br/>After a long time, in La La Land, we finally have a classic musical that represents our current decade, our reality, our times. Though our now is steeped in financial practicality getting in the way of our passions, jaded ideals of love and courtship both online and offline, there lies within all of us a subtle, oftentimes ignored, voice that still longs for the music and magic even just to rekindle that spark--or at least to remember how deliciously beautiful our past and dreams were."

","Liked everything about it; acting, singing, dancing, direction, screenplay, etc., and it all works. Can't remember when I saw a more entertaining picture. I am a big fan of movie musicals and, strictly speaking, ""La La Land"" is a musical, with some tuneful original songs and a few dance numbers. It starts off with a production number in a highway traffic jam - right off the bat you say to yourself, ""this will be a special picture"".<br/><br/>Midway through it switches gears into a straight romantic drama, leaving the singing and dancing behind. By that time, though, you are thoroughly invested in the story and you hardly notice. Gosling and Stone are not known as singers and dancers but they get through just fine, he with a three day growth of beard and she with a Senor-Wences-hand-puppet endearing face. Writer-Director Chazelle has put together a movie which will draw some Oscar noms come Academy Award time. A rare picture with no apparent flaws.<br/><br/>Just saw it again and it was better the second time. The ""No"" vote crowd will be very disappointed at AA time.

Together with Mia (Emma Stone), who aspires to be an actress and playwright, the two embody the dreams of young people then and now, crystallized in Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with Gene Kelly thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The opening musical number sets the joyous mood by breaking into song and dance during one of the monumental LA traffic delays on 405. It's choreographed with eye opening color and mirth, an appropriate antidote to LA's notorious torture chamber. However, all is not sunny Hollywood, for the dramatic arc takes us through the difficult times this radiant couple must endure while pursuing love in a loveless land.<br/><br/>This joy and sorrow is directed by Whiplash's brilliant director-writer, Damien Chazelle, whose devotion to the spirit of '40's and '50's Hollywood dream factory is matched by his willingness to portray its vicissitudes and not end just the way you would have expected. The integrity of this film lies in his showing the power of ambition and the unwavering sacrifice to fulfill it.<br/><br/>Besides Chazelle, the success of this winner lies at the feet of Stone and Gosling, whose song and dance are not perfect, all the better, but so romantic that it is hard to believe they are not professional musical actors, and maybe more to the point, not romantically involved. Yes, their chemistry is that good.<br/><br/>La La Land has already received wide acclaim, and rightfully so. It refreshes the musical genre of old Hollywood, and it reminds us ""we are such stuff as dreams are made on."""

","Review (with Spoilers)<br/><br/>Noted Actor(s)<br/><br/>Mia (Emma Stone) & Sebastian (Ryan Gosling)<br/><br/>Storyline<br/><br/>A struggling actress and a struggling jazz pianist. One too many chance encounters lead them to actual pursue each other's company and make a vested interest in each other. But, like with any film dealing with romance, as things change, dreams are realized or die, can the relationship still survive?<br/><br/>Highlights<br/><br/>Emma Stone<br/><br/>With no shade to Ryan Gosling, this movie was really about Stone. Her charm was on high, those big doe eyes of hers were in full effect, and she had the same comic appeals which made her a star in Easy A. Though what really made this a highlight is Stone wasn't tasked with trying to break the mold on what we know her for and as. What I mean by that is, she isn't suddenly trying to pull a Tilda Swinton or Meryl Streep out of her back pocket. She pushes the boundary of what we may expect from her, but not so much that it would look like she is trying to prove something. Like, this film doesn't seem like she is out here trying to prove she is a serious actress who shouldn't be pigeonholed. She knows what she is good at and expands on what we are used to seeing by adding song and dance numbers. Alongside giving a bit more depth to her character than we are used to. Allowing you more so to ease into the idea that she may not always choose to be a goof ball, romantic interest, or the supporting role to a stronger character.<br/><br/>The Dance and Music Numbers<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't walking into this movie thinking or knowing it was a musical. I knew Stone would be singing music and Gosling would play a piano, but I wasn't expecting at least 5 or 6 verbal songs and a lot of jazz music. On top of that, I wasn't expecting tap dance numbers and things of that nature. But, let me tell you, they were such a welcomed surprise. For while Gosling you expect to be adept at it since he grew up in the house of mouse, Stone does seem like the type with two left feet and who sings off pitch for fun. Plus, you'd kind of expect her to be tone deaf.<br/><br/>Truth is, Stone gives as good as Gosling when it comes to the dance numbers and watching them move together reminds you why, for decades, one of the main exports out of Hollywood were grandeur musicals. For the songs, oh the songs. Whether Gosling's jazz music, of which a song or two feature John Legend, or listening to Stone sing, you could go from something that makes you want to groove, to perhaps cry, and maybe even want a nap. It's such a whirlwind that you do get to understand why so many nominations are being announced for this movie and why it is being awarded accolades.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>One Key Question About Them Goes Unanswered<br/><br/>Conflict is necessary in any movie and with romantic movies, the conflict is usually somewhere out of left field and is usually the low point. This movie, despite everything else, is no different. The problem is, why we are made aware of what may have caused the major rift, but there is no exact detail. Did they grow apart, did their careers just consume so much of their time they broke up and decided to become friends? Friends which kept aware of what the other was doing but didn't have much communication (think friends you had in high school or college you are connected with on social media but never speak to). This isn't answered. We are just teased with a possible way the movie could end which for some maybe unrealistic.<br/><br/>Overall: Positive (Worth Seeing) - Recommended<br/><br/>If I was to be perfectly honest, if Stone wins an award for this it is because of her doing a golden age of Hollywood-style musical and because of her charm. Acting wise, while this character has more depth and consistent growth than her past roles, she isn't at that point yet where she really grabs you. She is still is one of the most entertaining actresses of this generation, but this is but a taste of what is to come more so than perhaps the best she may ever put out there. As for Gosling, he kind of is forgettable. The movie does its best to keep him from being a second fiddle with bringing in a sister for him, an old friend in John Legend's character and giving him a life outside Mia, but ultimate Stone eclipses him in almost all aspects outside of the song and dance numbers. In those moments, they are equals and they make this movie more than just another romantic film. They remind you of the actors of yore who could sing, dance, act, and tell a quality joke. Something sorely missed and why I fully expect to probably watch this more than once in my lifetime."

","Whiplash was my favorite film of 2014. It showcased a filmmaker that could control audience emotions with brains, tone and brilliant pacing. So I was very much anticipating director Chazelle's return to the big screen with La La Land, a decided change-of-pace that is getting almost universal acclaim, and rightfully so. Where Whiplash was an intense drama about ambition and loneliness within the jazz world, La La Land is bright musical about ambition and loneliness within Hollywood. Fully embracing the constructs of old-fashioned Astaire / Rogers pictures while floating them effortlessly into the 21st century, it's a joyous song-and-dance rom-com that dances far beyond its pretenses. Gosling and Stone are phenomenal, playing two wide-eyed dreamers looking to make something of their artistic abilities. With the lovely romantic melancholy of Once, the dreamlike song numbers of Singin' in the Rain, and the character motivations of each, the film wraps itself around our nostalgia before nudging us out of our familiar comfort. The songs are lyrically moving and ready-made for Broadway, and the sets and dances accompanying them would be considered experimental if they weren't so charmingly classic. If it seems like La La Land skates by on its charisma, think again. Playing effectively with the line between romance and reality, both in relationships and in aspirations, it asks us if one is inherently better than the other, and is it truly possible to have both? In our search for purpose, must we apologize for every mistake, or can we accept them & even love them? To quote one song directly, ""Here's to the messes we make."" That's where true love is found. That's where life is found."
"abouhelier-r","10","3","13","12 January 2017"," La La Land
","A jazz pianist falls for an inspiring actress in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>There was a moment back in the 1970s when the image of people bursting into song and dancing in the middle of a motion picture wasn't simply cheesy, it had come to be seen as downright strange. But not anymore. Our era is immersed in a retro musical culture. Damien Chazelle wants to make a musical that celebrates the classic Hollywood vision of love as a spiritual perfection. This is is really quite beautiful and as another Oscar season begins, this time under a dark cloud of controversy, movies like this one take their natural place: escapist wonderment that reminds audiences and cinephiles like me why they bother staring at flickering images on a wall in the first place. <br/><br/>The heart and soul of this movie are rooted in the past and so are its characters. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is a romantic that almost feels chemically balanced to perfection. These two belong together because of Gosling, his malice dipped in honey, and Stone, her vivacity and pensive awareness; creating a teasing romantic connection. But mostly they belong together because... they dance like this. They are the new Gene Kelly and Shirley McLaine. <br/><br/>Their not-so-""meet cute"" takes place on the freeway. Indeed, the film opens with one of the most extraordinary sequences in years: a musical number, set in the morning commuting and traffic jam along with a vast stretch of L.A. freeway. The camera hurls with astonishing choreography intricacy among the passengers on their way to work. Cinematically the sequence makes the impossible look easy. It also serves as a setting for optimism and emotional expectations. By staging this number Chazelle invites us to return and stay inside an enchanted romantic universe. In my opinion, Damien Chazelle's La La Land is the most audacious big-screen musical in a long time. An irony of ironies, that is because it is the also the most traditional one. <br/><br/>Director pays an awe-inspiring homage to the look, mood and stylised trappings of the Hollywood musicals of the 40's especially, the 50's with starry nights and streets lamps lighting up the innocence of soft-shoe romance and two people who were meant for each other literally dancing on air. The ""stroll"" scene is one of my favourites as Damien Chazelle stages a gorgeous scene over a view of L.A.'s glittering carpet of lights that merges into pastel twilight. They sit, talk and start dancing, just like actors did on sets in the 1950s. Sooner, she lays her eyes on...him. Across a crowded room. A stranger playing the piano. Except that the look on her face tells you that he is no stranger at all. She is not just starring - she is falling. That is the sublimity of Old Hollywood where we believed that it could happen, just like that. <br/><br/>Maybe only French cinephiles of a certain age will realise that the writer director's true inspiration here is not as much from vintage Hollywood musicals as from the late French director Jacques Demy's two landmark 1960s musicals with Michel Legrand, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort - especially the latter which was far more dance and jazz oriented. What I love about Damien Chazelle's movies is that he incorporates music in his movies, he did that with Whiplash and he does that more than ever here. The music becomes a character among all other characters. Moreover, L.A. has rarely looked this gorgeous in films, a credit to the director's romantic imagination as well as to the technical expertise of Swedish cinematographer Linus Sandgren (American Hustle)<br/><br/>Finally, La La Land is the story of old-school dreamers trapped in a world of entertainment commerce that is designed to crush the life out of you. It is a reminder that the often self-destructive act of dreaming is the very elixir of life. This film is a love story to passionate people, people who have a dream, people who want to succeed in doing what they love. Someone who is going to, no matter what anyone says, go ahead. This film grabs the shoulders of anyone who is passionate out there, shaking them until they get out there and follow their dreams.<br/><br/>Overall, La La Land is an unapologetically romantic tribute to classic movie musicals, splashing dream - chasing optimism everywhere. I was utterly absorbed by the film's simple storytelling and the terrific lead performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling who are both excellent, particularly Emma Stone, who has never been better. They both carry Chazelle's musical numbers off with delicacy and charm."

"akecic1996","9","2","8","28 September 2017"," Modern Movie with all the right vibes from old classics ‚Äì Spoilers Ahead
","La La Land is a beautiful movie by Damien Chazelle that brought back everything we love and adore about old musicals and brought the genre back in our lives. La La Land is basically a movie about a movie ‚Äì it is masterpiece that follows the lives of Sebastian who is an aspiring musician, and Mia who is an aspiring actress. The story follows the lives of these two artists ‚Äì separately at first until their paths cross and they become the point of support and motivation for each other. Even though the plot takes some time to develop and in the first part of the movie you are not really sure of the direction it will take, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Obviously, it is not a perfect movie and it had its cringey moments that are so Hollywood- ly obvious like when all of a sudden there was a very important casting director at Mia's show and she has one final audition that would of course change her life and give her everything she dreamed of. What I specifically liked about Sebastian's character and his development is that he did not stick with the band but he ended up opening the bar and even though his dreams did come true, there is still mention of how the bar is doing just fine ‚Äì it is not the number one place in LA to have a drink in, which gives it the more realistic and less fairy tale ending unlike Mia's.<br/><br/>However, if we neglect those minor details I think the movie ended on a good note. Not many movies have a great script combined with the great director and I think what Damien Chazelle did with the ending was amazing. As this was in fact a movie about movies, he did in film what directors do in real time ‚Äì they film several endings only to decide in last minute which one to use, and Chazelle gave us an alternate ending in addition to the real one.<br/><br/>If I were to focus less on the plot of the movie and more on its style of filming, lighting and cinematography in general, I would say this movie was destined to be a classic. It pays beautiful homage to the classic musicals from 1950s and if this movie were in black and white I am sure everybody would agree that it would blend into era carelessly. Though Damien Chazelle has the advantage of digital technology to assist him in how movie is photographed, edited and distributed to the public, over directors in the 50s, he used them very elegantly and has created a beautiful art piece that is obviously a result of combined efforts of many artists who worked on the movie.<br/><br/>Emma Stone was just fantastic and delivered beyond my, and I believe many, expectations. And, although I am not a huge fan of Ryan Gosling I must admit that he was just amazing and was a perfect cast for the role of Sebastian, as he delivered the character so seamlessly. Justin Hurwitz did an incredible job on the score, and the music follows the storyline and the character development perfectly. The only thing I would hold against him is that for a movie in which main character is obsessed with jazz, there was not enough jazz music, but otherwise I loved the score! Linus Sandgren and Tom Cross also did a fantastic job in cinematography and editing and Mary Zophres just excelled with costume design. Every color of every dress, every suit and every outfit was planned in detail and fit the old musical vibe as well as the new modern era in which the movie was actually taking place in. Set decoration and production design by Sandy Reynolds-Wasco and David Wasco is what impressed me the most! Again, little details that were randomly placed around set were hidden enough that they did not take away from what's on the screen, but at the same time when combined together they created that what made this movie feel like a set in 1950s while at the same time we see that main characters are in fact driving modern cars and using iPhones. All the decisions based around decorations, set, production design and costumes, among others, fit right into philosophy of the big studio era which is that aesthetic elements of the film should be maximized ‚Äì and there we have La La Land ‚Äì beautiful movie with beautiful people.<br/><br/>The lighting of the movie is absolutely on point and perfect. My favorite part about watching the movie was figuring the meaning of colors in it. If you happen to see it more than once, you will be able to realize how Sebastian's color is blue, while Mia's color is red and when they are together and in love, they are surrounded by purple. Chazelle obviously never ceases to amaze with his devotion to detail and color was no exception. Movement is another part in which this movie excelled because the dances, the grimacing, emotion and acting perfectly matched character development, plot twists and score.<br/><br/>Overall, you are guaranteed to love La La Land if you are a fan of old musicals, and if you are into discovering meaning behind every costume, dress, color and act. If you loved the 50s and wish you could somehow relieve the era, this movie is guaranteed to take you back in time, and it will do that with such detail, precision and a perfect blend of now and then, that it will feel like a dream once the credits role after the final scene is over."

I couldn't believe they managed to pull off a complicated musical number in one shot on an LA freeway of all places. That's quite an opening. From there, we're introduced to our two leads - Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - who still clearly have chemistry left over from their previous film together. It's such a joy to watch them on screen together. It's hard not to find them sympathetic. The story isn't anything we haven't seen before in stuff like A Star is Born, but the witty dialogue, stars' chemistry, and musical numbers help set it apart. Sure, Gosling and Stone are far from trained singers or dancers, but they do just fine. Their voices never soar like you'd expect from a big Broadway belter, but then again, they have a camera 3 inches away from their face.<br/><br/>If I had any nitpicks, it would be that the sound mixing is sometimes a bit off. In the opening musical sequence, I couldn't really understand the lyrics either due to bad mixing or the singers ""whisper singing."" If it's playing near you, definitely go check it out."

","Remember the name. Damien Chazelle. Writer and Director, aged 32, without a doubt he is upstaging those in the industry for decades. If he builds on this momentum his reach will certainly be endless. He is 2 for 2 with WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND. Its way too soon to stack him up there with the Allens' and Scoreceses'. But without a doubt Chazelle is ""now"" noteworthy.<br/><br/>This original screenplay and direction is as inspirational as its beautiful. Its mellow yet potent, its tranquil and flamboyant, it's a motion picture but theatrical in its essence. The simplest of stories unfolded in the most enchanting of ways. The theatrical approach, the balance between the new and revolutionary whilst preserving a semblance of tradition. The last I recall being this engrossed in a movie of this genre is with MOULIN ROUGE.<br/><br/>Nominated for 14 Academy Awards tying the record of TITANIC and ALL ABOUT EVE, LA LA LAND is story of love. A Jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) and an actress (Emma Stone) find their lives intertwined in a struggle of finding themselves and love. Gosling isn't new at toying with emotions, he does so with a strange aura of simplicity surrounding his performance. Its ethereal. Stone is almost as good as she was in her role in BIRDMAN. Both characters are built blandly from ground which makes it a challenge for the actors. Its magical what Gosling and Stone do with it.<br/><br/>Appreciating LA LA LAND is a test. Losing interest isn't arduous. Musicals are not for everyone. Considering the initial half hour of the movie and its slow start, this title necessitates patience. Further it's a work of art holistically. The mesmerizing soundtrack, the vibrant set, the acute direction and the impeccable acting eventually makes it all worth you while.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Let your self wander into the world of LA LA LAND.

"cengizozder","Null","2","8","14 February 2017"," say hello to musical movies
","La La Land is a musical and it is a fact that the current movie audience is different from the audience in the 50s who loved musicals. Even the great movies like dancing in the rain and an American in Paris where Gene Kelly dances are not being watched by the new generation who has grown up listening to this rock and other modern music. Some peoples initially say that 'the period of musical films has passed, this film does not do business. (but apparently the viewer liked this film.) However, La la land is opening with a stage where the people who stuck in the traffic, starts to dance with joyful drums playing jazz rhythm which also catches the audience. It is said that after people watch the movie they return home with a happier, better and higher mood. But in the La La Land, on the background is not only classic jazz, but a rhythm-dominated popular music and jazz-blended musical genre surrounds a broader audience. Unlike past musicals, dance and music alone are not enough. It is a solid production in the dramatic direction, for example, the characters' dialogues are very strong. It can respond to the expectations of the younger but more intellectual audience of today. Director Damien Chazell stated that his favorite films were 'The umbrellas of Cherburg' (1964, directed by Jaques Demy, actress Catherine Deneuve).<br/><br/>Chazell is a very young director and writer. We remember him from the film 'Whiplash', which he wrote and directed again in 2013. Cinematographers remember that movie with a drummer who struggles in the hands of a tyrannical music instructor. The director seems to have a mission to make people love jazz music, and this new film continues to progress from that track.<br/><br/>The main players are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling's biography is pretty full. Emma Stone entered the cinema with her 2010 film 'Easy A'. Though the filmography is not yet rich, it seems likely to win the Oscar with the perfect game in La la land. So we are almost witnessing the birth of a real star as if it were in the same movie role as this production. J. K. Simmons, who plays the role of bullying trainer in Whiplash, is surprised by a small role (boss who does not understand the music).<br/><br/>It's about the impossible love of Sebastian who wants to play refined jazz but forced to play music that he dislikes in ordinary places and Mia an ambitious cafe cashier who wants to be a player. The American dream is brutal. Whether you want to pursue a career, or climb to the fame, even the bonds of love are as weak as cotton yarn. I recommend that the audience pay particular attention to the final scene. It's as if referring to the final scene of the unforgettable Casablanca movie."
"christian94","10","2","8","9 February 2017"," Life-Affirming Artistic Masterpiece Awaits Awards
","Damien Chazelle dazzled with Whiplash (2014). Pace, acting, music, struggle and storytelling sure hit. He had toyed with the musical idea when at Harvard with low budget and black & white Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009). He now delivers beyond any expectations.<br/><br/>An Oscar-tying record of 14 nominations and rave reviews if just a reflection of how good this is. More than all that this movie is a collection of transporting feelings: freedom, love, passion, infatuation, nostalgia. It explores dreams, hopes, fears, sacrifices and reality. It has gorgeous and appropriate fantastic elements that add layers instead of detract from the story. Like Titanic (1997), although a different beast all together, I cried, I laughed, I smiled and was transported.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone sell ever detail with their extraordinary skills and dedication. They are often spell-binding. An on-screen chemistry and crafted from an assured writing and directing vision that take us places movies have never taken us before. The best Musical since Moulin Rouge! (2001) fifteen years ago with added cool choreography and gusto. <br/><br/>Cold Fish (2010) was the last movie that blew my mind in such a graphic, edge of the seat, emotional, artistic, fantastic and physical way. It also had a theme of planetarium and stars. I am so glad I saw this in theatres too and in IMAX with incredible image and sound. <br/><br/>Talking about sound and music, Justin Hurwitz gets 3 Oscar nods for his score and two songs: quirky City of Stars and adorable Audition (The Fools Who Dream). Audition is a tour de force visual and visceral scene from Stone and bittersweet song. Hurtitz should come home with one or likely two statuettes after been looked over in Whiplash (2014). The Jazz in both films is magical, but here there are other elements of music (even to the choice of 80s pop music in the mix) and there is the explanation of jazz origins and essence that enhances the music as art and is contrasted with John Legend radio-friendly record-selling reality which books tours and pays bills.<br/><br/>Sharp (C-sharp?) Chazelle deserves his two Oscars but has though competition in both writing and directing including the return of writer/director Kenneth Lonergan after bar-raising You Can Count on Me (2000) and Margaret (2011). Canadian Denis Villeneuve's Arrival (2016) which is nominated for 8 Oscars and 9 BAFTAs is also a contender although not my personal favourite film of his.<br/><br/>The only assured Oscar win would be Tom Cross for Editing who won for Whiplash (2014) and put every beautiful detail of Damien in a dizzying and delicate succession, but I predict La La Land could sweep the Oscars. I guess it could get from 10-13 Oscars potentially beating the 11 wins tree-way tie of epic Ben-Hur (1959), Titanic (1997) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). It won 7 out of 7 Golden Globes and should win a fair share of its 11 BAFTA Awards nominations this Sunday. Wishing it long life and success. Hard to beat something that steals your breath and hard beat for 2 hours like this.<br/><br/>Not just a movie experience, a revelation! Rejoice, live, love, sing and dance...<br/><br/>L.A. Hollywood - La La Land is the best Hollywood film of the decade or maybe the millennium..."

","Finally, I got to see La La Land and finally I understood what all the fuss was about. I'm not much into romantic films and so I had my doubts about it. I couldn't be more wrong! I don't know if it's the best film of 2016 (I still have a lot to watch), but it certainly is one of the most amazing and memorable cinematic experiences of the year.<br/><br/>La La Land, written and directed by Damien Chazelle, follows Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) as they're both trying to fulfill their ambitious dreams in the city of Los Angeles. Mia, currently working in a coffee shop, wants to become a famous actress while Sebastian dreams of revitalizing the jazz scene by creating his own jazz club. They fall in love with each other and together try to achieve their goals. For a while everything seems perfect, but the challenges they face test their faith in both their relationship and their visions.<br/><br/>The film has won a record-breaking 7 Golden Globe Awards and received a record-tying 14 Academy Awards nominations. Surely, you can't always trust the Academy on deciding which is the best picture of the year, but this many accolades cannot be overlooked. So what is it that makes La La Land so special. Well, first of all, it is technically flawless. Cinematography, editing, costumes and acting are top-notch. Emma Stone is one of my favourite actresses and she is absolutely dazzling. However, two other things are what make the film stand out.<br/><br/>The first is the music. The score of Justin Hurwitz (who also composed the music for Damien Chazelle's two previous features) is utterly enchanting. Hurwitz also wrote most of the songs with two of those being nominated for an Oscar. It really felt that the songs were woven together, like every song was just another verse of a bigger song. The second thing was its thought-provoking ending. I'm not going to spoil it, I just want to say that I spend days trying to figure out what it meant and what message was the film trying to transmit to the audience. It came out unexpectedly to distinguish the film from the average romance film that, satisfying as it may be for teenage girls, lacks any significant substance. <br/><br/>For these reasons, I believe La La Land will be remembered for years and years to come and I wouldn't be surprised if it broke the Academy Awards record.

","Rhode Island born Damien Chazelle graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Visual and Environmental Studies. He has captured the attention of audiences throughout the country with is own story which he also directed ‚Äì LA LA LAND ‚Äì and likely will become a Hollywood staple. Perhaps the chaotic mess in which we find ourselves, daily sinking into a dark hole created by our change in political face, is the reason this little slight escape piece is finding such favor. Or maybe we just want to remember the happy ever after ending to dreams that were abundant in early musical films that makes this film the talk of the Oscars and making so much money.<br/><br/>The film is about dreams - their illusions, consequences and rewards. Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between auditions and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.<br/><br/>Apart from Stone and Gosling dancing and singing their way through the endless colorscapes of Los Angeles and Hollywood, there are few other actors involved ‚Äì JK Simmons, Damon Gupton, John Legend, Tom Everett Scott, and others ‚Äì to make the plot have any broad strokes. But it is what it is ‚Äì and it is being applauded as the probable best picture of the year. Go figure¬Ö."

","La La Land is a masterpiece. It is a declaration of love to cinema, art, music, poetry. It is a life-story of Los Angeles, a story of dreams and disappointments, with a strong moral regarding the subject of ""Dream, Believe, Fight for it"". Chazelle confirms himself as one of the greatest directors of these days, improving his skills from his last work Whiplash. He's great. Emma Stone is incredible. She has been perfect in everything; she's a huge actress, I personally love her since Birdman. She is the movie and the movie goes on thanks to her: beautiful, talented, seductive. Ryan Gosling is really appropriated for his role. I considered him as a kind of ""single-man-supporting-cast"" for Emma (whom I consider the only true protagonist of the movie), and he has been really good.<br/><br/>Songs are... astonishing, involving.<br/><br/>I really loved that. Waiting for the DVD to be available."
"spencergrande6","9","2","8","31 January 2017"," Classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being
","The perfect amalgamation of Hollywood past and present. The slow transition from the wistful allure of dreams to the tangible pop of reality. The music and the songs are instant classic (by the second viewing it felt like coming home they fit so snugly and felt so right).<br/><br/>What's equally amazing is the character work, the re-molding of archetypes. How neither is an answer so much as a piece of a bigger puzzle. Seb's passion and devotion are his own undoing. He gets what he wants but he also is let down in nearly every other facet of his life. He doesn't ""save"" jazz. John Legend's Keith saves jazz (or at least starts to) and gets the best speech in the film when he tells Seb that he's too traditional and that jazz is about the future. But that's because Seb is selfish and he only cares about what he wants, at least insofar as it pertains to his dreams. He changes for Mia, but also realizes he has to let her go. Ironically this unselfish act leaves him alone. His passion, which we normally prize so much in films like this, doesn't make him big or famous, but instead leaves him small and alone. His type, the classic bold and passionate man with a dream who can't be stopped type, isn't real. But as an example to others it does (much like a good musical on our lives, more on that in a bit).<br/><br/>Mia in her empathy, grace and selflessness attains her dream and makes a family. Yet she doesn't have the person who helped her achieve all this. She tells Seb that his passion will become other people's if he believes in it enough, but it's his passion for pursuing A dream that affects her and causes her to write her play and sing a song and nail her audition. Her sensitivity is what makes her strong, a conduit for passions on screen and off.<br/><br/>What this movie could be suggesting, much like Whiplash's carefully constructed ideology about the costs and sacrifices of pursuing a dream, is that everyone needs a push. A push in the direction that you may not be capable of on your own. Mia developing a backbone, believing in herself because Seb does. Seb dropping his stubbornness and pride so that he can make money playing for a real gig so that he can open his club later. <br/><br/>And that this is in effect the true beauty and romance of our lives. What the epilogue suggests is not ""what could have been"", so much as ""what could never be."" Life is a beautiful breathtaking musical of love and passion and romance and adventure, even if it doesn't end up how you think and doesn't follow a tightly scripted path. If you spend too much time worrying about why your life isn't a Hollywood fairy tale romance, you will miss out on the musicality and the truth of the present. Classic musicals are a state of mind not a state of being."

","After Whiplash, which is a masterpiece of its own, comes another one of Damien Chazelle both mesmerizing and hypnotic.<br/><br/>That movie can make you laugh, cry, feel sorry for them but happy and the same time. It's something in a whole new level achieved by not so many movies. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are simply wonderful, funny, with passion about their dreams, never giving up.<br/><br/>It gives us a beautiful story of never letting your dreams go, always chase them and you'll see they'll come true, even at the expense of big sacrifices.<br/><br/>Even better was to have the opportunity to choose the end, either the real one or the ""fake"" one, that makes us happier.<br/><br/>It will surely be around for the next years as a unique and wonderful movie, destined to be a huge classic seen by grandchildren everywhere.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend!"

","I've come to realize that current award season paranoia is more detrimental to the film industry than beneficial. Whether lobby riddled or tailor made, the very release calendar is designed to make the biggest splash for award recognition, rather than allowing every film, every topic and every discussion to have room to exist and grow. Or not.<br/><br/>La La Land is one such example of a film that gathered momentum from its early premiere and rapturous reviews in Venice until a disproportionate attention worldwide - not undeserving (it is every bit justified) but because the attention was given for all the wrong reasons. Musicals are not an easy sell by definition; progressivists may consider it is way past its sell-by date and purists may consider the latest outings as travesties or lacking the charm of the classics.<br/><br/>News flash: La La Land proves exactly the opposite. It is an unambitious, unpretentious, anachronistic love letter to old musicals, jazz, Los Angeles and love stories. It is a hard sell and specially not a product for everyone. Just because marketing momentum rubs a film in your face, it doesn't mean it is for you. An essential characteristic of being a film lover is understanding that every film finds its audience and not the other way around; and while some films appeal to a wider audience it doesn't mean that every film that sweeps individual award recognition amounting to a considerable number has to appeal to all. <br/><br/>La La Land is a film that haters love to hate; not and for years to come. For those who don't deliberately walk into it with either cynical or preconceived disposition to destroy it, you'll find a heartwarming ode to a dying art (musicals or jazz alike), never mind thinly plotted, or with a sparsely uneven pace, that will pull you to a carefree make belief alternate world. Isn't it the point of the genre anyway?"

","Well there you go. Three things I really hate: 1. Musicals. (with the exception of Grease and RHPS) 2. Clich√©s 3. Whistling. Given that; I expected to hate this movie but wanted to give it ti's dues strictly because of the amount of nominations it received. Yes, it had cheesy singing, I don't think you can have a musical without cheesiness. Yes it stole from other classics but it did it on purpose, with meaning, and while paying homage so I give it props for that. It was respectful of jazz as a genre and I respected the movie for it. The overall story was clich√©d but delivered with conviction and I found myself with a cheesy grin on my face for a good chunk of the movie and certainly didn't expect to shed a tear. (shut up there was something in my eye). Would I watch it again? Probably not, but would I recommend it? Yes"
"classicsoncall","8","2","8","21 January 2017"," ""It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.""
","I'm quickly coming to the conclusion that this year's Academy Award nominations for Best Picture will be one of the weakest ones in recent memory. This film is the third one I've seen among likely nominees, the others being ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""Arrival"". Taking nothing away from this film's principals, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, I couldn't help thinking that this is the kind of picture I might have gotten a kick out of if I was still in high school. It seems geared to adolescent fans of musical drama and Academy folks who will be enthralled by the doomed romance aspects of the story, leaving a wide range of movie goers in between for whom real life has a lot more to it than dancing away one's road rage on a jammed freeway.<br/><br/>With that, I don't have too much of a problem with the production aspects of the movie. It's bright and colorful and there's some gorgeous cinematography at work but it doesn't seem enough. I'd have to say that Emma Stone does a remarkable job with the range of emotions she's expected to convey; I'm actually a sucker for anyone who can cry at the drop of a dime the way she does here any number of times. Ryan Gosling is not quite her match in that regard, but still pretty competent in his role as the conflicted jazz man. Considering they aren't professional dancers, the scenes calling for them to strut their stuff are done quite well.<br/><br/>I thought as well that the frequent Griffith Observatory scenes were overdone. Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone) weren't rebels without a cause; they had inspired goals in mind that they pursued with diligence and patience. The ill fated aspect of their romance at the heart of the story will bring a tear to the eye of many viewers, but within the context of the story it felt contrived and telegraphed long before the break up actually occurred.<br/><br/>With that, the film stands at number twenty four on IMDb's list of all time rated movies as I write this, right between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Can anyone explain that? It will almost certainly adjust downward as time goes by, but it's personally frustrating for me to see brand new releases accorded the same stature as films that have stood the test of time over decades.<br/><br/>One bright spot though - the scene with Miles Anderson as the photographer in that 'bite the lip' segment - that was hilarious."
"michael_hope","9","2","8","20 January 2017"," A love letter to Hollywood with a modern twist
","The first half and last scene of this film are simply, outrageously gorgeous. Amazing music, clap-your-hands-with-delight-dancing with quite the cast. It brings tears to your eyes, goosebumps to the back of your neck and a nostalgia even this 26-year-old can appreciate. <br/><br/>The middle third/half of the film brings the modern twist to this film; it shows the audience that the optimism of youth sometimes has to give way to practicalities of life; that sometimes means that you might have to 'cash-in' to fulfil the dreams of your younger self. This I think, is a great narrative to live by, especially for the generations after mine who seek fame for fame's sake rather than attempting to be the best at something first. <br/><br/>Now, I know some people say that there is a lot of 'mansplaining' in this film; that's for other people to decide. Since I'm a white male, I can't really comment on that. Another criticism that I had was the opening scene - as brilliant as it was - needed more......WOW factor; it's the opening of a musical, you can ramp up the volume, make things brighter and happier. Whilst it is amazing and awe-inspiring, you were straining to hear what was being said and - after the hype of this scene - you felt a bit.....meh.<br/><br/>Another criticism has been the last scene, personally, I loved it. It's a classic 'what could have been' that everyone feels at some point in their life. The idealised view that life could have been happier and racier. However, they have gotten to where they want to be and would they have managed that whilst being together? Who knows.<br/><br/>As the title says, this movie is a love song to classic Hollywood whilst poking fun at itself and having a liberal sprinkling of modern touches. I loved it though I do acknowledge the criticisms, some of which I accept, some I don't quite buy."

","La La Land is written & directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Rosemarie DeWitt and J. K. Simmons.<br/><br/>A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Who said Hollywood's Golden Age died back in the 1960s? In Damien Chazelle's remarkable La La Land, it's back in full force with all the glitz, glamour and fun energy that made the classics so enjoyable. <br/><br/>Our two wonderful leads; Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) and Emma Stone (Mia) are an absolute treat to watch as they pursue their dreams, taking us through the colourful city of Los Angeles around them. Presented gloriously in CinemaScope and featuring a stellar soundtrack, La La Land is a triumph in filmmaking only to be experienced in cinemas. The technical skill on show is undeniably careful and gracious, acting as the perfect supplement to the aforementioned leads.<br/><br/>As the screen opens and the CinemaScope logo appears, we pan down from the pale blue sky over the city and straight into the first musical number, which may need some time to settle but nevertheless kickstarts the film with joy. At first glance you'll notice and appreciate the presence of a soft and subtle film grain, created only when shot on celluloid. Natural lighting is used for most scenes in the film, as well as real locations all over the city of Los Angeles, securing a sense of realism in the story and characters.<br/><br/>Once the rocky first quarter comes to an end, the real magic begins. With some fine trimming, La La Land could be a perfect masterpiece, but the duration of the film (or rather, the time management) is my only complaint. Chazelle's writing is spectacular and reminiscent of his previous project, Whiplash, which also saw major success and received high approval from critics and filmgoers alike. A small cameo from J. K. Simmons branches the gap between this film and Chazelle's last, with Simmons playing a similar character to that in Whiplash. <br/><br/>The soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz is pumping with life, carrying on his funky jazz style, accompanied by Stone and Gosling's strong vocals. The numbers are entertaining and skilfully performed, with vivid visuals to aid the original score, also composed by Hurwitz.<br/><br/>In preparing for their roles, Stone and Gosling were required to learn to dance and move to specific cues during the lengthy one-shot takes. Gosling also decided to learn the piano in order to dismiss the need for CGI doubling, further showcasing his talents as we watch in admiration. <br/><br/>La La Land is a work of art, a true love letter to Hollywood's Golden Age. Although taking place in the modern world, with smartphones and social network tools, Chazelle takes a unique approach and combines old and new. There are vibrant sets and exciting sequences that seem as if they've been pulled directly from the 50s/60s alongside modern vehicles and coffee shops, providing a marvellous backdrop for our characters to interact with. <br/><br/>Each and every individual involved in this project have done a remarkable job in creating a world everyone can get happily lost in. Awards season is underway and La La Land has already made Golden Globes history with its impressive 7 wins, further attracting filmgoers and selling out show after show around the world. This is simply fine work and all involved should be greatly proud of this superb accomplishment.<br/><br/>Here's to the ones who dream.<br/><br/>Verdict; Lights, camera, action! Classic Hollywood is back with Damien Chazelle's hugely entertaining and dazzling La La Land.<br/><br/>La La Land, 8/10."

","As I watched this movie last night, I was indeed very excited to see Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together in the movie. In the beginning, I'm really feeling already the musical vibe that the film has to bring the viewers. It was very refreshing, the music and scenes itself are amazing and on point! I like it when a movie like this one, which rarely can be seen has managed to comeback in a big screen with so much great music in it. I'm so in love with the story and how it was put together and become a MASTERPIECE. La La Land is truly a must see film and the taste of its music is very catchy and astounding! Emma Stone is really great with her acting same with Ryan Gosling and they do both need an Academy Award for this as well with the movie itself! I was really amazed by how this movie made me realize that 'when reality strikes you hard, you just got to learn how to be positive and just continue to move forward.' This movie, I can say is really a great way to start the year of watching some of the best and unforgettable movies ever!! I recommend this movie to everyone and I'm proud to say that you'll surely going to love it!"

","I'm not a big fan of musicals, this genre is probably my least favourite film type, and consequently I was not looking forward to seeing this. So this describes my initial attitude. <br/><br/>The film opens with a huge musical number, the scene is set at an enormous traffic jam where the drivers begin singing and dancing on bonnets, everyone eventually joins in. My heart sank at this point because this is NOT what happens when you're stuck in a traffic jam, not at least for me. I didn't need to worry, from there on the one third music blends very well with the two thirds standard dialogue.<br/><br/>Stars Ryan Gosling, a struggling jazz pianist and Emma Stone a struggling actress. Both actors' characters have ambitions. Both are following their dreams. Both sing and dance (Ryan learns to play the jazz piano) ‚Äì both are extremely competent, and they both have great chemistry.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes and a reoccurring theme tune, used to drive the narrative. For instance, Emma's character doesn't like jazz so Ryan takes her to a club and explains how to appreciate jazz and how he hears it ‚Äì he says ""it's all about conflict, compromise, always different and very very exciting"".<br/><br/>The film is very emotional, the stars fall in love, but their paths diverge and they eventually go their separate ways. At its conclusion the film quickly plays through an alternate ending, which is brave for Hollywood to finish on anything less than sickly sweet!<br/><br/>If you like old-school musicals then you'll like this. If you like jazz then you'll like this film, even if you don't appreciate jazz you might be encouraged to listen to some more after seeing this. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","So, I loved the movie; my wife hated it... When we talked about it the chances the movie took worked for me and didn't for her (while this may seem vague, if you see the movie you'll completely understand what I'm meaning). I think not looking at the movie as a musical and more of just an experience, because if you're looking for great singing this isn't it. The flaws of the singers make it beautiful, they aren't out to be anything they aren't and it also applies to their dancing. This movie isn't for everyone but I feel like if you are the person it hits, it hits hard. The movie moves a bit slow but it's the first time after a film where I've personally wanted to applaud (I usually make fun of those people) but I held it in..."
"grantss","9","2","8","9 January 2017"," Not simply just a musical or a romantic drama - this is so much better than that
","Mia (played by Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress, working in a coffee shop. She gets auditions but nothing has come of these. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a struggling jazz pianist, playing small venues. His dream is to open his own jazz club. The two meet, but don't hit it off. Over time, however, things change...<br/><br/>I generally dislike musicals and romantic dramas. Romantic dramas tend to be incredibly formulaic, schmaltzy and unrealistic. Musicals are irritating because instead of spoken dialogue you have someone singing words at you, and it all seems so contrived and out of place (thus is if you're lucky. Many musicals just use music as padding).<br/><br/>So it is with some trepidation that I watched La La Land. The opening few scenes didn't help my fear that this was going to be a campy West Side Story-like implausible song-and-dance fest or a Les Miserables-like constant stream of nails-on-blackboard irritation.<br/><br/>However, it soon became clear that La La Land is better than that. The answer to ""How much better?"" increases the more into the movie you get.<br/><br/>What sustains the movie initially is its warmth: the wonderful, often-funny dialogue and the interaction between the two main characters. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic and their performances (especially Emma Stone's) alone are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Even the music is okay - sporadically used, not as intrusive as it could have been and it seems to integrate into the plot well. Moreover, rather than just serve as padding, it helps move the plot along. (This all said, I would have preferred genuine dialogue!). <br/><br/>At this point the movie was still heading down a rather safe, predictable ""boy meets girl...yadda yadda...happily ever after"" route. The stuff of easy box office dollars rather than genuine art.<br/><br/>Then writer-director Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame) ups the ante, moving it from a mere romantic drama to a drama that covers a host of themes - artistic integrity, the price of fame, chasing dreams, the trade-offs between relationships and careers, missed opportunities and life's big ""what if?"" moments. An incredibly emotional, bitter-sweet ending ties it all together perfectly. <br/><br/>What appeared to be a quaint-yet-innocuous film turned into a wonderfully profound, hard-hitting work of art."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought this was going to be a cheesy musical with dancing and singing. But in reality, this movie was a celebration of the fools who dream. The music was fantastic and the choreography was on point. I was impressed with the whole plot of the story and the amount of drama. The romance between Stone and Gosling was definitely fantastic and they did fantastic in this movie. Well done to the cast on such a great production. And here is to the fools who dream. Also, this movie is nominated for many golden globes and it would be great to see this take some home. I also enjoyed the intro and the ending Music because it matched with the movie. Well done."

","Now the awards season is here, the hype is a soprano 'A' on this movie musical. However, the first half hits some flat notes before rising to a soaring crescendo, and this was the problem for me in viewing La La Land.<br/><br/>I wanted to praise this movie so much more than I did. I love the previous work of all involved, and whilst they are all sublime, yet again, the first half seemed all a little too conceptual and made it hard to invest in the narrative.<br/><br/>However, it is in the last 30 minutes, this film is bang-on perfect, and the chemistry between the two leads really lands.<br/><br/>Part of what spoiled the movie for me were the previews. Too many of the dazzling scenes were revealed and I wasn't surprised enough by the story or execution, as I would have been if they had played their cards a little closer to their chests.<br/><br/>La La Land may well sweep the award season, and I wouldn't begrudge the film if it does so. I just so wanted it to be the classic many others purport it to be."
"Troy_Campbell","9","2","8","30 December 2016"," A triumph of cinema.
","Musicals are a rare breed in cinemaland these days. Once every so often a big budget effort (Chicago, Les Mis, Into the Woods) comes along to remind us they do still exist, but even these films don't do much to entice newcomers to the genre. Now I don't know if La La Land will succeed where others have failed and prove to be the birth of a musical reconnaissance, but if any movie can achieve it, this is definitely the one. Vibrant, funny and superbly shot, this tongue-in-cheek throwback to the upbeat musicals of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire is a toe-tapping delight from the ambitious highway-set opening number all the way to the closing what-could-have-been sequence. Following up after the phenomenal Whiplash, writer-director Damien Chazelle has definitively announced his arrival into Hollywood; the combination of flair and technical mastery in which he executes each diverse set piece is astounding. The song and dance numbers continually build on the story ‚Äî a struggling actress and a budding Jazz pianist juggle life, love and their lofty dreams ‚Äî whilst always bringing something fresh both visually and musically, whether it's an 80s parody dance sequence or a soulful jazz interlude. Director of photography Linus Sandgren must be given his due praise too; the camera-work is both enterprising and stylish, the frequent unbroken tracking shots adding another level of pizazz to the proceedings. Yet for all of the wonder and awe brought by Chazelle and his crew, the film still requires a headlining duo capable of providing an emotional core that can match the song and dance fireworks. Step up Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. In their third movie opposite each other (after Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) the ridiculously talented acting pair not only boast a sizzling chemistry on screen, but also get to show off their dancing and singing skills that, much to the normal person's ire, are obviously brilliant. More accessible to the average moviegoer than many previous modern musicals, La La Land is a triumphant convergence of music, dance and awe-inspiring cinema."
"gingerrdriley","9","2","8","22 December 2016"," Yeah, more like Blah Blah Land amirite?
","It's actually a bit shocking to see Damien Chazelle produce this masterpiece after having directed Whiplash, which is arguably the best film of 2014. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if most audiences having watched La La Land feel that Gazelle's latest work is once again the best of the year. <br/><br/>It's perhaps redundant to say so, but like Whiplash La La Land is musically intensive, the difference being that, while Whiplash was a grounded real world narrative centered around music, La La Land is more so a musical in the classic sense. Scenes taking place in a grounded narrative transition seamlessly into elaborately choreographed song and dance numbers which are a far cry from the intense jazz drama of Whiplash, though jazz is prevalent in the score for this film. <br/><br/>The great thing about this film being so dramatically and stylistically different from Whiplash is that Chazelle takes full advantage of the format to elevate his musical far above its peers. From the opening shot it's evident that every song and dance number has been carefully blocked and rehearsed, resulting in the camera effortlessly navigating the halls and roadways of every scene and allowing the audience to fully soak in the talent on screen. <br/><br/>To speak of the talent on screen, it's needless to say that all performances meet the standard of excellence that Chazelle set for himself and his actors during Whiplash. Though the bouncy and fast paced tone doesn't always allow for the most profound character depth, the emotions and nuances of those characters are on full display with each song, dance, and montage.<br/><br/>As far as those songs dances and montages are concerned, that is perhaps where objectivity gets muddled for me. While I enjoyed the music in this film greatly, and appreciate the subtle variations on what seems to be the ""main theme"" I am fairly ignorant where music theory is concerned. I honestly love the music in this film and would say that it's great, but someone who is better versed in the field may have a different perspective. The point is that if you don't like the music or don't think it's good then I'm not sure what to say. I think it's great, but maybe it would be more appropriate to say that I really liked it.<br/><br/>The reason I liked the music, beyond it being pleasurable to listen to is that it was utilized perfectly to emphasize the tone of every scene and give context to the emotional state of the characters. The ""main theme"" is repeated several times, to the point where some might be irritated with it's prevalence in the film. That theme however changes subtly for each appearance creates different meanings for the characters and their relationships depending on those subtle changes. <br/><br/>This film is an absolute masterpiece, and arguably surpasses Whiplash. Hopefully in the near future Chazelle returns with yet another masterpiece to rival his latest."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","2","8","13 December 2016"," A Mother of a Good Musical
","I grew up on musicals. My mother, the pragmatic, working professional that she is, would often take the time to instill in me a love for good music, good food, and good movies. I called her the night I saw La La Land. I called her to tell her I loved her and thanked her for raising me.<br/><br/>La La Land is about as thematically distinct to my sentiments as you can get. It's the seemingly simple story of two struggling neophytes turned lovers, pursuing their dreams in the glimmering monolith that is Los Angeles. Mia (Stone), is an aspiring actress whose constant auditions and casting calls have landed her a part-time job at a studio coffee shop. Sebastian (Gosling) on the other hand, is a talented pianist who can't seem to keep regular gigs due to his insistence that his work has some semblance of purity. They meet - they fall in love - and over the course of a year they conflict, compromise, excite, motivate and adore each other for the messes they are.<br/><br/>Director Damien Chazelle initially studied to become a jazz drummer in his youth. that's a biographical detail that makes a lot of sense when viewing his sophomore directorial effort Whiplash (2014), which was one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the last decade. What translates to La La Land (other than a love of jazz) is a sense of timing. The score, the cinematography, the choreography all simmer and pop with lively syncopation. The visual references are quick to recall Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) but the timing - the timing is pure, delirious montage filmmaking.<br/><br/>As our two stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are an organic recreation of the quintessential Hollywood coupling. They shared the screen only twice before, making Crazy, Stupid Love. (2011) into the underrated romantic classic that it is, and making Gangster Squad (2013) watchable. Here however, the story, the characterizations, indeed the very frames the film rests on are made lovingly for them. Any boy do they ever runaway with this film. Both ooze pure starlight from their pores and ally ever so perfectly with La La Land's master thesis.<br/><br/>And what is La La Land's master thesis? Well in an interview with The Guardian, Chazelle briefly spoke about ""the struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human."" Wanting to create something in he vogue of a golden age Hollywood musical, Chazelle stated that he wanted something ""more grounded in reality."" It is that central tension that drives the plot in La La Land, and does so in new and surprising ways with both Mia and Sebastian struggling to plug in the expectations of others into their artistic mission. Both are motivated to compromise, both are willing to commit, and we as the audience cherish the idea they'll find their way in the end.<br/><br/>La La Land, more than being a feast for the eye and a virtual smorgasbord of visual homages, is a film for the heart. A crowded theater cannot help but erupt in in laughter, tears and applause when faced with a film spirited enough to be sincere. It's all even more awe inspiring when you consider the camera stops and fauns over real singing, real dancing and real piano playing on the part of Mr. Gosling.<br/><br/>La La Land is a delight - a wonder, a superb and significant film that has the moxie to fill any heart with joy and the originality to make it all stick. Much like my own mother, La La Land is audacious in its ability to capture the imagination with a poise and class that simply cannot be matched. It left me with a renewed sense of hope and a song in my heart and here's to hoping it does the same for you."
"CineMuseFilms","8","2","8","10 December 2016"," A beautifully filmed dazzling retro musical about young dreams.
","It is a great loss to modern cinema that the most escapist of all film genres, the Hollywood- Broadway musical, has been presumed buried for decades. Born in an era of world wars and depression, the musical was the most effective happy pill ever invented. Only in the musical could you find the unbridled eruption of emotion expressed through spontaneous song and dance with scant regard for narrative or dialogue and even less for everyday reality. Closely related to the fantasy genre, the Hollywood musical has resurfaced in modern hybrids but the traditional form exists only in libraries and memories. That is, until you see La La Land (2016).<br/><br/>The opening scenes are a perfect example of old fashioned musical showbiz, driven entirely by spectacle rather than logic. High on a Los Angeles freeway a young woman jumps out of her traffic-jammed car and bursts into song and dance. She is copied by scores of other motorists all gyrating in sync, filmed from above, in a single take. A boy and a girl make eye contact (not in a nice way) and this is where the story begins. Mia (Emma Stone) spends her days humiliated by repeatedly missing out on auditions for her 'big chance' in Hollywood, while Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a surly dreamer who wants to open a jazz club for people who love jazz. It's not a good start for romance, but a pre-dawn song and dance routine ‚Äì a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ‚Äì sets them up for love. This is a story about dreamers and the dream factory, carried aloft by music and generously wrapped in nostalgia.<br/><br/>Beneath it all there is a narrative but it feels inconsequential to the music. The bitter-sweet romance is harmonic scaffold for songs and dance that lift you with promises and hopes then land you onto the soft sands of life's disappointments. The characters of Mia and Sebastian are not developed in great depth because they are avatars for generations of dreamers who have been drawn like moths to fame. Their synergy is palpable.<br/><br/>This film is full of memorable moments. The scene where Sebastian talks passionately about the dynamics of jazz musicianship is captivating; the moonlight walks through the city are surreal; and the final scene against a painfully hesitant piano solo of 'City of Stars' will squeeze tears out of anyone ‚Äì and then make you hum the melody for days.<br/><br/>Great cinematography is not unusual these days but the La La Land camera is like an artist's brush that composes beautiful portraits against stunning urban landscapes in colour palettes that are richly retro yet totally modern. This is a film to bathe yourself in, let its exuberance, musicality, and nonsensical scenes of flyaway romance dazzle you. Today's world needs more la la land."

","I find it difficult to believe this thing has an 8.0 rating. I kept watching it, hoping it would show some kind of reason for a number that high, and it failed miserably. The songs, such as they are, are repetitively wretched - especially the one that gets repeated ad nauseum as some kind of leitmotif for the main character's ""relationship"". The choreography veers heavily to the bland, and the acting - dear god, the acting... pieces of 3/4"" plywood could do better.<br/><br/>I can see what they were trying to do, but from the opening number it's a big time fail, sorry. While I applaud Gosling for learning to play the piano as well as he did (and I'm presuming that a good chink of this is him actually doing the deed), we see next to nothing of Stone's abilities as an ""actress"" - in particular the play she spends so much time writing and producing. Was she that terrible? Maybe so. But as with all Cinderella stories, she gets The Big Moment that turns her into a Major Star just in the Nick of Time.<br/><br/>I really do not understand the love for this film. It's shoddily written, formulaic to the extreme - even the ""American in Paris"" scene at the end in which Stone imagines what might have been is clunky as all heck - in a desperate attempt to be something it simply isnt.<br/><br/>Nancy Walker did far better with CANT STOP THE MUSIC."

","By that I mean the musical closet (gotcha)! What a visual masterpiece, some say being critical about something shows how much respect one has about what is being criticized (worthy of critique), I feel La La Land has received quite a bit of mixed views, because somehow it portrait a telltale which is very dream like if not unrealistic. Is that really the point? La La Land praises the very medium it is being portrayed through, film and cinema, it does so in a thoroughly enjoyable way, by delivering the panache, colour splash and the dazzle most of us actually dream of. It is an optimistic vision, in a world full of anger. It is a nostalgic protest, a loud praise for musicals of old and it is beautiful. The cinematic execution is out of this world, the production, music, fidelity, filmography, costumes the love for the form is transpiring through the silver-screen. It makes you want to dance, sing and celebrate, are those feelings hard to enjoy? It also makes you sad and angry, at times it surprises, it is FUN. It delivers all that with what I would call a perfectly fitting ending. The scene on the clouds, why care if it was corny? All the awkward bits play into our own subconscious anxieties and insecurities, at least for some. Oh well... a solid bloody 10!"

"CinematicInceptions","7","2","9","23 February 2017"," You can't deny that it writes its own rules.
","In some ways this made me not enjoy the movie quite so much, but it did make me appreciate it more. The slow beginning and the inconsistent rules of how the musical numbers worked were more acceptable once I realized how they fit in with the world of the movie. There's been a lot of hype surrounding this movie particularly with it's pending Oscar nominations, so I had rather high expectations when I entered the theater. The praise it has received is well-deserved; the technical work that was put in is phenomenal and I would not argue if it won Best Picture (though I haven't seen any of the other nominees). The only nomination I disagree with is best screenplay. There were scenes that I thought were well-crafted, but as a whole the script was flawed. I don't mean to say that it was bad, but I would hope that there were better scripts written.<br/><br/>Thematically it was very good, but speaks mostly to those with careers in the arts. As one of those people, I loved how Sebastian and Mia drove each other to pursue their real dreams and not just half of their dreams. It's a trap that I'm sure many people fall into when pursuing a career in show business. The ending was spectacular in capping off the themes that had been presented. Sebastian's dream of what he wished had happened showed how much he and Mia had to sacrifice in order to achieve their dreams, which I thought was great. So often we see movies that end with the protagonist achieving all of his/her goals in some capacity. It was great to see the protagonists feel the weight of the emotional sacrifices that they had to make for each other; and more than that, they chose their dreams at expense of their relationship with each other. A lot of people may see that as a heartless ending, but there are plenty of movies where couples throw away their jobs to be together.<br/><br/>The musical aspect of it is not that prevalent. The opening number with everyone dancing around made me skeptical because I don't care for musicals, but thankfully there was little dancing in the rest of it. There is still music, but it comes in a more natural context. If you haven't already guessed, the film is very artsy, which could mean that more casual viewers might not like it so much. It will probably keep your attention, but it's main goal is not to entertain. However, if you are okay with that, try to get out and see it in theaters. Overall Rating: 7.6/10."
"lruenesm","10","2","9","2 February 2017"," I could give it a 10, but it would have to be multiplied for each and every single thing on it that has a 10. If you can, go watch it right now, it deserves your attention
","Movies about how great movies are. Only by that the viewer can already feel excited, and more, if it's well executed. This film is definitively the case. It's a musical, and a love story, but that doesn't keep it from shining. The film gives a perfect balance between the epic elements and the dramatic elements, while also having very good and clever comedic moments. Damien Chazelle has consecrated himself as one of the greatest, most influential contemporary directors, he will win every single accolade for it, because he deserves to. ""Whiplash"" was great, but certainly no masterpiece, ""La La Land"" surpasses the boundaries of what a masterpiece should be. The script is not being treated as good as the rest of the film, but I disagree, the script is powerful, deep, and compelling. The acting is top notch, and the musical numbers are exhilarating and exciting. Some people are unfortunately bashing on it, without any good or constructive explanations; yes, it's OK if you disagree from the objective perspective, but if you hate something just because it's nabbing all of the attention, you are being hypocritical; being jealous of something that's good in stratospheric levels will not prove any point. Some people are also not getting the ending. I'm not giving any potential spoilers, but the ending is not for everyone, but if you're lucky enough, like me or my parents and my sister, who saw it with me for the first time, and you get the idea and understand the subject, you'll get it, and you'll love it. It's been nominated for 14 Oscars, I wouldn't be surprised if it swipes them all, I would instead be surprised and very disgusted if it doesn't win at least the big five awards (Best Picture, both Leading Actor and Actress, Directing, and Screenplay). If you haven't go give ""La La Land"" a watch. I give it my highest grade and recommendation, it deserves that and much, much more."

"bob the moo","Null","1","3","5 June 2018"," Pleasant enough but ultimately superficial and a little smug
","Blockbuster season and awards season - two periods of the year where it is easy to get caught up in the hype but not always easy to find really good films. In the awards time of year it is particularly hard since everyone is talking up films as much as possible, and lots of 'proper' films come out around then in order to qualify. Last year was no different and La La Land was one of the films that we were all told was a big contender and would surely merit its place surrounded by the great films that had gone before it. Years of disappointment has told me not to get caught up in the hype but just catch things later when they are cheaper and have lost their promotion. With La La Land, that time was now, but the distance has actually only hurt it.<br/><br/>More on that in a minute. Generally speaking, La La Land is perfectly fine. It is a pleasant film that has charm and good grace mostly. It wallows in an image of Hollywood that doesn't exist, and fills its delivery with nostalgia and simplification; it is easy to see why it was so popular with those successfully in the industry, and those all hoping that their big break is just around the corner. As a story there is not much too it. The delivery isn't as charming as it needed to be; the musical numbers after that first great one are mostly only okay - they try hard, but they are only okay. The characters are thin, although they benefit from good performances - mostly from Stone, who I really enjoyed. It is nothing special, but it works in a sort of cheerful fantasy way.<br/><br/>One year on though, and the #MeToo movement and associated revelations cast a different light on a young woman in Hollywood trying to get ahead. La La Land was a bit smug and fantastical before this, but after it has an air of denial to it too - unintended of course and not the film's fault, but it is there nonetheless, and the cheerful ""have a dream and get your break"" theme stands out badly. Like I say though, not the film's fault - but even without that problem, the film is at best just pleasant to watch but not more."

","A few days ago, my friends showed me La La Land. They loved it and raved about how amazing and beautiful it is, and got mad at me when I said i didn't really care for it. Why is there such a hype about this film? I don't understand why it's gotten nominated for so many awards. I just didn't like it. The beginning starts out like any other musical: a huge catchy dance number. We meet Mia, an aspiring actress, and Sebastian, a wannabe jazz musician. Both aren't succeeding with their dreams. They keep bumping into each other, and eventually fall in love. But Mia breaks it off when Sebastian seems to be giving up on his dreams. He got to her, takes her to one last audition, and she makes it as a huge actress. They don't stay together. At the end, Mia and her husband go to a jazz cafe, she sees Sebastian, and there's a montage of what their relationship could've been. I loved the music, and I love the costumes. That's about it. The movie is centered around jazz, which is historically from an African-American background. Yet Sebastian, who absolutely loves jazz, is white. And so is Mia. I think it would've been a lot better with a more diverse cast. To me, the first part didn't match the second. The first part is like a regular musical, except Emma Stone can't sing. But the second part tries really hard to be an artistic, abstract, unique film. Those two parts didn't mesh together at all. Was this meant to be artistic, or a big musical? When I mentioned to my friends that Emma Stone cant sing, they said that that's the point. That it's meant to feel realistic. Yet, the singing audio of her is obviously inserted from a studio. If it's meant to be realistic, why didn't they sing live? Also, why were none of the main songs in the musical jazz songs, if it's meant to be centered around jazz? I did like that Mia and Sebastian didn't end up together. However, I think it could've been done so much better, with a smaller cast, smaller budget, live singing, and a diverse cast. Overall, I thought La La Land wasn't too horrible, but it definitely wasn't great. I don't understand how a movie can be beautiful with such a mismatched style. I wouldn't watch it again. But I do listen to the soundtrack."

","I am quite late to the party, but I finally saw La La Land today. It's hard to give a numerical rating to a nontraditional film like this one, and I have to say I am so fresh from watching it and the feelings are percolating still, but here goes.<br/><br/>I am not usually a fan of musicals, and I must say I found the storytelling at first to be more goofy and comical than serious and dramatic. It took me a while to ""get into"" it, so to speak, but I finally became interested in Mia and Sebastian's story when Mia requested a certain song from the band at the party that Sebastian happened to be playing in.<br/><br/>Once I got involved in the characters and their coinciding story lines, I got invested in their successes, failures, and relationship. At the point in which Sebastian returns home to their shared apartment, his place originally, and prepares Mia a surprise meal, then she walks in and they begin talking--checking in with where they are both at in their lives, that's when the disappointment set in. <br/><br/>I was hoping it would play out differently. Sure they both succeeded in their ""dreams,"" but they did not succeed together...and to show a ""faux flashback"" where it shows them together, succeeding, with children...all while he's playing their song, it was manipulative. It showed me what I had wanted for them, and possibly what they had both wanted, yet.....it didn't happen. So the ending was sad and it made me frustrated and a bit angry.<br/><br/>Of course, I see why this film is a top rated and Oscar winning film. I cannot argue that. The music was lovely, and their song was catchy. Emma and Ryan were perfect in their roles....8 out of 10 stars, merely because it had a bittersweet, sad ending, and because it still seemed to lack the intensity I like to see in films."

","Damien Chazelle's Whiplash was a fantastic movie so I was excited to see what he did next, and La La Land is probably my favourite ""musical"" ever.<br/><br/>Musicals are not my type of movie and this movie of course has the scenes of people getting up, singing and dancing their hearts out, but in no scene does it without progressing the story in some way which I loved. Not only is the non-stop use of music actually good, but also never feels like it was forced into the movie. <br/><br/>Damien Chazelle is a genius, and his obvious love for jazz seeped through the screen throughout the movie and contains one of the most underrated scenes in this movie where Ryan Gosling talks about jazz and his love for it, and this theme is probably my favourite of the film.<br/><br/>The only downside to this movie is the inevitable lack of people being interested in a musical as they may not believe they will see a great story as well, which is definitely evident here.<br/><br/>This addition to Damien Chazelle's collection is very welcome and one of the best musicals in recent memory. We can only hope that Chazelle expands his work outside of movies about music so he can be appreciated by a wider audience. With La La Land, he has proved that he is capable."

It makes me play the saxophone or the piano again since I was a junior high school student.<br/><br/>Also, it's private, but I'd been in LA for a year until last summer, and I like Los Angeles very much as I mentioned above. So, I really feel nostalgic Griffith Observatory and even the traffic in this movie. I guess anyone who watches it will want to go to LA. It's a very nice city."
"the_ed_blog","9","1","3","4 August 2017"," Does La La Land Live Up to the Hype?
","La La Land is an absolutely beautiful movie. The sets, the outfits, the scenery, the lighting, the colors, the cinematography √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú all gorgeous. The cinematography is of special interest to me. Chazelle and Sandgren implement luscious, long takes, lovely wide shots, and a style that is judicious and flashy at the same time. The dance choreography is fantastic as well, and the two come together lovingly to create a delicious feast for the eyes. To say that La La Land entranced me from start to finish would be an understatement.<br/><br/>The story, too, is great. Just when you think it is going to turn conventional, predictable, and sappy, it doesn't, but I'll not give any spoilers. Just watch it. Suffice it to say that the movie brings out two real truths among all the glam.<br/><br/>The first truth is this: The road to success runs difficult and steep. Many obstructions lie in your path, and you must strive and sweat and, sometimes, suffer in order to reach your goal. You will probably never see success overnight, and hard work and hard time must be put in to see your dreams fulfilled. The weak of heart should not set out upon that road, but the persistent may see victory.<br/><br/>The second truth is that there are people in our lives, whom we befriend and even grow close to, people who help us along, aid our growth, and we aid theirs. We should love and cherish those people, and always remember them. However, those same people don't always get to follow us into the next stages of our lives, the stages that they helped us reach. Sometimes, in order to reach our goals, a decision must be made to either forgo our life's path and follow the other person's or persons' or to leave them behind and continue our own way. It is a sacrifice that must be measured and made, and it does contain consequences.<br/><br/>There is a third truth in there, too, when I think about it: Success doesn't always mean fame. Sometimes, we must forgo fame to achieve our success. Success is the meeting of our life goals.<br/><br/>I could continue talking about La La Land, but I won't go on long. I only have one negative with the movie. In some ways, the almost- celebration of Hollywood kind of overshadows the themes that the movie's story presents. Other than that, this is a near perfect picture. Gosling and Stone give one-hundred percent, and they have a charming chemistry. The supporting actors and actresses are all good, and it's cool to see John Legend in a movie. The music is amazing, and I especially enjoyed the focus on jazz and its merits as a genre. The characters are excellent, and their story arcs are engaging and satisfying. I've already mentioned the cinematography and production. The movie is extremely creative, and the nods to old musicals are handled quite smoothly.<br/><br/>Oh, one other thing I forgot to mention. Yeah, in case you didn't know, this is a musical. I√Ç‚Ä¶ don't really like musicals. But this one, I loved it! The musical numbers all grow organically from the screenplay, and it never feels like, ""Oh! Time for another song and dance number!"" Even if you hate musicals, watch this if you love movies.<br/><br/>One more thing before I go. Fans of Tom Hanks's under-appreciated That Thing You Do! might catch that Tom Everett Scott, who played the main character ""Guy,""appears in a small but important role here. When you see it, you'll say, ""Half your luck, Guy!""<br/><br/>So is La La Land worth all the hype? I say, in many ways, yes!"
"suemtgh-11983","8","1","3","8 July 2017"," The film did not live up to my expectation.
","That Ryan Gosling takes role as a male main character reminds me of the film 'The note book' (2004), which also has the quite similar storyline to 'La La land' (2016), except the 2004's one left me with better impression and absorbed in thought. I have heard many compliments on 'La La land' before and my friend also recommends me this film. But after spending 2 hours for it, I end up feeling disappointed and let down. The plot is relatively regular and not hard to predict. However, I'll give an 8 for the stunning view and the marvelous starry sky scene."

","La La Land is a musical masterpiece! It has everything you want in a movie its got terrific performances, excellent music, beautiful scenery, and a great story. For all you jazz and/or musicals fans out their I highly recommend La La Land for you.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and 'make it', while Gosling is a jazz purist (""Anyone who doesn't like jazz just doesn't have the right...context"", he insists) who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it succinctly - ""Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams"".

","I have mixed feelings about this movie. I really like musicals and also like jazz a lot so this movie should have been perfect for me. But it isn't. <br/><br/>It started great with ""Another day of Sun"" and ""Someone in the crowd"". I really enjoy these songs. But it was only downhill from there. There are only two more sung songs in the movie which is already pretty bad for a musical. But they are also very weak because the main cast can't sing. ""City of Stars"" is awful. Must be one of the worst main songs of a famous musical I've ever heard. ""The Fools Who Dream"" isn't that great either. It's really telling that the two good songs have (almost) no contribution of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. <br/><br/>The plot is okay but told in a really boring way. <br/><br/>But there is also light.<br/><br/>Emma Stone acted amazing. What a performance. The cinematography was superb. I really enjoyed the lights, costumes and camera work. The epilogue medley was great too. <br/><br/>I expected a musical but I got a mediocre love story with a bit of singing."
"jb_campo","8","1","3","18 June 2017"," Wonderful, refreshing
","They really don't make movies like this anymore. La La Land really should have won Best Picture Oscar. Ryan Gosling was terrific as Seb, the down on his luck jazz pianist who didn't want to see his treasured music die. Emma Stone was equally terrific as the stereotypical young woman in Hollywood trying to catch that one in a million break.<br/><br/>This movie was great because it was refreshing to see Hollywood make fun of itself. Emma's character Mia was a jab at the shallowness of the Hollywood scene where interview after interview ignore her after a sentence of two. See Penny in the TV show Big Bang Theory for another jab at Hollywood. But Mia keeps trying, to her credit. When she meets Seb in an on-again off-again relationship, it's fun to watch. The dancing and music scenes are terrific, especially the opening famous scene played out on an LA freeway - wouldn't anyone in a big traffic jam love to have that entertainment?<br/><br/>But there's a story here too, and it's very well told. Don't ever give up on your dreams. Are your dreams worth sacrificing for love? What happens if you move on? Can't both people in a relationship live their dreams? Oh, the sadness and joy of success.<br/><br/>La La Land is a fantastic movie that you should not miss. You'll laugh, cry, and sing the songs for days and days. Enjoy."
"swalden214","7","1","3","7 June 2017"," Good but...
","Somehow I thought Ryan Gosling wasn't the right guy for the part. I liked the music and the staging but the characters and script were not complicated enough and needed another couple or something to play off of. The story didn't draw me in as much as I wanted it to, not really the actors fault. And the movie didn't quite come together enough for me to give it more then a 7. The movie looked difficult to make and that made me love it a lot less. However still worth seeing again."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","7","1","3","16 May 2017"," A Love Letter To Musicals
","I love movie musicals. They're hard to find these days but in their time they were some of the greatest movies made. To this day I can sit and watch SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and never once be bored. The MGM musicals of the 50s were some of the most entertaining films ever made. There have been others made since that are just as good. Which brings us to the recently heralded LA LA LAND.<br/><br/>The film opens with a huge traffic jam on the LA freeway. It doesn't take long before someone breaks into song and everyone is out of their cars, singing and dancing about the beautiful California sun and how each of them came here with the hope and dream of becoming a star. As the music fades the camera pans into one particular car where Emma Stone as Mia is reading through her lines again as she prepares for an audition paying so much attention to them that she fails to move when the traffic lets up. Behind her Ryan Gosling as Sebastian honks and then swerves around her.<br/><br/>This is the first encounter between these two characters, dreamers with hopes of making it big, of achieving their dreams in a world where everyone wants the same thing. Stone eventually makes her audition but like all of the rest before it's a casting call where tons are seen but few are chosen and she hasn't been chosen yet. When not making auditions she works as a barista in a coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot.<br/><br/>Down but not out, Mia's roommates convince her to go with them to a party in hopes of making contacts in the business. More singing and dancing follows and Mia leaves the party to find her car has been towed. Walking home she hears a piano playing in a small club, enters and sees Sebastian at the piano playing something that enchants her. Unfortunately he's supposed to be playing Christmas music and is fired, brushing past Mia before they can be introduced.<br/><br/>We bounce back in time to their earlier encounter and find out about Sebastian. He's a jazz fanatic and dreams of the day he can open his own club, playing real jazz and not some twisted version of it. His sister wants him to grow up, to date someone and to abandon his dreams for reality. But he hangs tough. In the meantime to pay the bills he plays in a cover band which happens to be performing at a pool party that Mia attends. It's obvious these two were meant to find one another.<br/><br/>The chance encounter leads to another song and dance number between the two and off the road to romance they go. It's a slow beginning with a few hiccups along the way, but they do indeed get together finally. The question is will they be able to stay together? Not only that but will they be able to achieve the dreams they both have, dreams that everyone who comes here has? Will they both achieve those dreams and if not what if one rises while the other falls? The story seems simple at its base but the ribbons wrapped around it make for a decent light hearted drama. Many musicals were formed this way. As I said, I love musicals and when I heard about this one I thought it was a dream come true, Hollywood returning to a genre thought dead. But the end results are mixed for me. Some will love this film and others hate it. I fell in between.<br/><br/>The imagery on hand here is fantastic at times. Glimpses of LA at its best are mingled with fantasy sequences that stun. But at the same time it feels forced, a sort of look at me type film that tries so hard but doesn't quite achieve the status of the films it celebrates. It isn't one thing that does this either. The performances by both Stone and Gosling are wonderful. Their singing and dancing numbers together remind you of those old movies. And yet I never felt invested in what was going on.<br/><br/>For me the weakest part perhaps was the music. It's not that it's bad, it just never rose to the classics I remember. I didn't hear a song that I knew I'd be singing in my head later on. The lyrics were not the sing song back and forth type from those old movies, songs that I can remember to this day. Here I can't recall many of the lyrics for any of the songs I heard. The same holds true for the tunes that those lyrics are wrapped around.<br/><br/>In the end the movie was a fun film to watch. It reaches its goal of trying to bring back memories of those bygone days of movie musicals. At the same time my guess is it won't ignite a spark in Hollywood to make more and that's sad. The movie musical deserves to be a genre that carries on to this day. If this film doesn't at least inspire someone to make more perhaps it will at least keep it alive with the hopes of their return some day. At least it gives us something to enjoy until then."
"cunningpal","7","1","3","1 May 2017"," Enjoyable movie, but too long and slow-moving.
","This was an enjoyable dramatic semi-musical, though too slow-moving and lengthy. The last half-hour, with Mia's day-dream about what might have been, wasn't any good, or necessary. I could watch the movie again in two or three years, doing a lot of fast-forwarding. Memorable acting was done by the two stars. The ending should have been after Mia is revealed as an (unmarried, in my version) film star and Seb as having achieved his dream jazz club. They could meet unexpectedly, then have a conversation about re-establishing their relationship. Would they or wouldn't they? Seb asks, Should he call her? Mia smiles, friendly but enigmatic. The End. Not to exceed an hour and a half."

","OK so this kind of movie really isn't my thing. I'm certainly not into musicals. Although I appreciate great acting and great music. However I do like jazz, so that certainly helped me get something from it. If you dislike musicals and jazz, I'd suggest you give this a wide berth!<br/><br/>The opening part on the freeway and some of the later scenes had me reaching for the sick bag...and now a song, for no reason, staged backdrops and jumping around, clich√É¬©. Why not make a movie with all the great music but have filmed stage performances and rehearsals instead of interjected 'and now...a song' moments? I suppose it wouldn't be a musical, but whatever.<br/><br/>It would never be my go-to movie, but for some people, probably many wives and girlfriends it's a nice little comfort-blanket escapism piece of enjoyable fluff that's sincere, competent and harmless.

","La la la la...afterwords I left the cinema theater dancing with my girlfriend lifted by a strange feeling that my dancing, the film, the la la la life is not real. Anyways, movies are not real but part of reality. I dislike liking La la land. That was a kind of film with all the right musical formulas applied to it, but something was wrong. See the leading actress, Emma Stone. She seemed pretending to be that girl who strives in the artistic lifeline waiting her turn. The same happens for the main actor. They are good actors; the screenplay helped the film to get its end in a professional way. In the end, a good moral message. This total sum is less than its parts. Why? Maybe musical films are out of date because our era is an era of breaking stereotypes and most musicals bear lots of stereotypes. To watch La la Land was like to eat the same favorite sandwich over and over because it feeds you well but you are undernourished sorry. La la land is good but after an hour or so you feel kind of hungry."
"Sergiodave","7","1","3","19 January 2017"," A very pleasant surprise
","There has been a lot of hype about La La Land. A modern take on the old style Hollywood musical, dancing, singing and romance with everybody living happily ever after. This kind of movie doesn't normally float my boat, but Damien Chazelle, the director, made the brilliant 2014 hit 'Whiplash', so I thought I'd give it a try. I had a smile on my face through most of the movie, the songs, while not greatly memorable fit the scenes well. I'm more Fred Ward than Astaire, so my knowledge of choreography is zip, but the dancing seemed fine to me. There is a good chemistry between the lead actors, played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and I think the cinematography is superb, the use of colour is fantastic. Overall, not being a lover of musicals, I was very surprised by how much I liked it. A solid 7/10."

"cherold","8","2","10","30 March 2017"," Solid musical slightly let down by the musical numbers
","La La Land clearly wants to evoke classic movie musicals like Singing in the Rain or the Band Wagon, but it's casting is closer to later star- driven musicals like My Fair Lady. The difference is that the former starred people known for their dancing or singing, while the latter cast non-musical stars likely to carry the movie with their star power.<br/><br/>In terms of star power, La La Land does pretty well, with a good performance by Ryan Gosling as a jerky musician and an amazing one by Emma Stone, who is every bit as good as she was in Birdland. The stars have good chemistry as the follow the traditional Holllywood trajectory from sniping to googly eyes.<br/><br/>In My Fair Lady, Rex Harrison didn't try to sing (he just talked through the numbers) and Audrey Hepburn was redubbed, but in La La Land the stars are singing and dancing as best they can, and the movie bows to their weaknesses with songs that aren't difficult to sing and dance numbers that stay pretty simple. <br/><br/>Because of this, there are no great musical numbers. There are some cute ones, with songs that are almost memorable and dance numbers that replace impressive performance with cute ideas, but there is no Astaire dancing on the ceiling, and there is no Minelli telling us that life is a cabaret. The sort of performers whose singing or dancing could power an amazing number - Gene Kelly, Ann Powell, Jennifer Hudson, Donald O'Conner, Tommy Tune - are in short supply nowadays. <br/><br/>The choreographer may also simply have lacked the adventuress spirit. The first, non-star number is fun but non-musical Malcolm X's one musical number was more memorable.<br/><br/>My girlfriend liked this slightly amateur-hour approach, and felt it was unfair to contrast the film with something like Singin' in the Rain, but I disagree, because La La Land really goes out of its way to say, ""look, this is just like those old movies with a slightly more complex view of relationships!"" I feel like La La Land really does want to have an amazing dance number but knows it doesn't have the stars to pull it off, which may be why the film's most striking set piece, which comes right at the end, isn't a musical number at all even though it references a few.<br/><br/>I liked the movie. It's fun, escapist musical entertainment. But I find the critical raves a little puzzling. It is a good, solid movie, but it pales in comparison with truly great musicals like An America in Paris, Cabaret, Sweet Charity, or West Side Story."

Thanks to my older son (15 years old and fan of ""Whiplash""), yesterday we went to the movies to watch your film ""La La Land"". I have been working for fifteen years in audiovisual production here in Argentina looking for the magic of the movies and it was really hard to find it still. I live in a country that constantly debates in between commercial and author movies. And rarely occasions allowed us to see being born a director ready to unite those two worlds and the people of my country with it. To make as feel one at least for a couple of hours. Is evident that your movie comes from a genuine romantic soul who has experienced in the body and conscience ""The Love"" in his pure (no) form and crossed like a ray of light that make U time travelers as Einstein discovered before, and showed us in his formula that you transform beautifully for non mathematical readers. Up to this point, that would be enough achievement and example for millions of humans souls over this Heart. But, and here we go, being able to transmit all that emotions trough the Main Stream Commercial American Studios is, with no place for doubts, an antenna we must keep on following. But after this great success, relax and take your time, you don't have to keep on filming because the wolfs ask U to until the ideas don't come again from your own heart and desire. From ""Love Story"", going to ""All that Jazz"" and a little drops of ""Birdman"" in the way you use the camera around the characters and places in that flow way, or movies like ""Mary Poppins"", ""Singing in the rain"", ""Le Bal√≥n Rouge"" and all Meli√©s movies. Everything is delicate and focused in a simple, human and profound story that leaves our seven musical notes open to leave the Theatre and keep listening the sound of music we all carry inside and usually don't let go out and to unite us with our environment, embracing us to go out and dance on the public places where usually souls get scared and keep inside hidden, bureaucratized for surviving adaptation in rigid forms. Free (play) jazz is alive, don't be scares about that, don't be afraid. Bodies include brains and they are founding the reunion slowly and the all word is receiving the message. There is only one truth and you know it. And know how to transmit it. Thank you so much again for permit us to support over your play to use it as our floor, as a trampoline to keep dancing the music of life. Of course, years ago, this text would have been written full of envy... Pero today, near to the woman of my life, the one i love completely in the way she loves me, I can tell without the filter of my ""ego"" the same love than you deposit in this product of magic. Because without you, ""La La Land"" wouldn't exist¬Ö That makes you a ""Cham√°n"" of the new millennium. Of the new Acuario Era. You has encouraged to do what was necessary long time ago but nobody was doing, in order to follow the rules that culture and industry impose as a prohibition.<br/><br/>The greatest icons has left their old bodies, but are coming back in younger ones. And is completely clear you have been chosen as their package. <br/><br/>Lucky us, they have founded you focused and working on your art.<br/><br/>Kind regards, from an Argentinian friend."

","Damien Chazelle mesmerized people with his film ""Whiplash"" in 2014, so I had a feeling that this film of his would be good, especially since I am a sucker for musicals, but this was exponentially more than that. This film is by far the best film of the year and will get several awards in the near future. Including highly likely wins for best picture, best director, best original screenplay, best lead actress, and several others in costume-design, production, and score.<br/><br/>The film follows the life of a struggling actress, Mia, played by Emma Stone who is waiting for her big moment and a traditionalist jazz pianist, Sebastian, played by Ryan Gosling who is hoping to revitalize the beauty of jazz music by opening his own club. Both, who seem quite disparate at first, become intertwined in each other during their search for an answer for their disorderly lives. Mia and Sebastian blossom into a beautiful couple that plays perfectly thanks to the help of some great dance numbers, brilliant dialogue, and hints of comedic genius. Despite the amazing chemistry between the two protagonists, their relationship is sadly short-lived upon the realization that their dreams are a higher priority than one another. The film fast-forwards 5 years after the two of them drift apart into their respective careers, with Mia being a successful actress married to another man and Sebastian being a credible jazz club owner. The two former lovers run into one another at his club and the best part of the film ensues. Chazelle takes the audience through an epic ""what if"" montage that highlights what their lives could have been had they decided to stay together, but more so representing the delusional ""La La Land"" that they once had and could have maintained. Overall, we have a tendency to hold onto our convictions and this film takes that concept and demands us to continue to do so no matter how crazy they may seem because there is always hope, regardless of the outcome.<br/><br/>Amazing cinematography, perfect use of lighting, and some of the best music I've heard in a movie in a while. Everything about this film was done with such radiant passion from Chazelle, who may have done just enough to bring back the big-screen musical that once dominated the box office.<br/><br/>Ali's Rating: A"

","As charming as can be, as creative as can be, nearly perfect as can be. 'La La Land', if musical films are of any interest to you, will demand to be watched from start to finish. Right from the start, the highway music number is an incredible watch. From production to performance, it is an absolute delight to and is simply the beginning for what 'La La Land' delivers for two hours.. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone take what is a two character performance and runs with it. The film rarely feels dull or boring as one or both of these two are on the screen no matter a spoken performance or musical number. The charisma and charm bleeds out of these two with every passing moment with a chemistry that is through the roof.. Damien Chazelle shows his love of music, and specifically Jazz, with yet another brilliant music-oriented film. First, he delivered us 'Whiplash', which remains to be one of my favorite films, and now we have 'La La Land', a film I did not expect to love AS much as I did due to it being a musical but Damien is simply a brilliant mind when it comes to these films. I am excited to see what he will continue to deliver to the public in the future.<br/><br/>A special note to the true meaning to the film: That you never stop working for your dreams. No matter how many times you fail or are told ""No"". ""Here's to the fools who dream, foolish as they may seem.""<br/><br/>'La La Land' is an incredible piece of film. As I said before, I gained interest simply because I loved 'Whiplash' and what Damien Chazelle does with his films but I never expected to love a musical film as much as I did. With a phenomenal performance by the duo of Gosling and Stone as well as simply a near perfect production background.

","Many audience members and critics have stated that the modern musical is dead. While this may have been true for certain films such as Mama Mia and Burlesque. This year Damien Chazelle proved this statement to be false.<br/><br/>This film is about Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a passionate jazz pianist, the film chronological their relationship as it evolves and changes.<br/><br/>Once again Damien Chazelle proves himself a more than capable director. This film is perfectly directed with brilliant long takes, perfect framing and pitch perfect performances from every single actor involved with the production. <br/><br/>There are one or two problems with the film however. For example the two leads are not perfect musicians, their singing voices and dancing abilities are not as perfect as other 1950's musicals that it homages. but these problems aren't enough to ruin the film for anybody.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the best films of the year and if you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend that you do so, right now."

","I went and saw La La land without knowing much about it (I didn't know anything tbh), and I ended up falling in love with the film. The acting is amazing, the cinematography is spectacular, but the music is the lure. It's the backbone of the film, and it's also the glue that holds it together. <br/><br/>The movie is a love story, not only between the two main characters, but between them and their dreams as well. They are in a constant struggle between satisfying their relationships, and the music appropriately and beautifully reflects the constant shift in emotions. Ryan Gosling's Sebastian explained it perfectly when he talked about Jazz music speaking for those who can't fully express themselves through words. That's what the music in this movie does for the audience. It supports the telling of the story. <br/><br/>The dancing in the film is another excellent source to show where the characters emotionally. When they're happy, the choreography is fast. During the romantic scenes, the movement is more slow and flowing. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were phenomenal during the dance numbers, especially when you consider that some of them had long continuous shots. <br/><br/>Besides the music and dance numbers, I thought the acting was incredible. Ryan Gosling is perfect at being both smug and charming, while Emma Stone can put on an entire performance without uttering a word. The expression she can convey just in the movement of her eyes and brows is nothing short of amazing. <br/><br/>In the end, I fell in love with this movie, and hard. The story and acting opened my heart, but the music is what warms it."

","I've always said Ryan Gosling was meant to do comedy. I think very highly of the guy, but I hold the unpopular opinion that he's not necessarily the best dramatic actor in the world. In La La Land he gets a chance to utilize some dramatic-acting skills, but strays away from his usual angst-filled characters as he showcases his humor chops.<br/><br/>It helps that he and Emma Stone have such great chemistry. With their third feature together (Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) the pair demonstrate why they may be our generation's Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers--two actors that are paid homage to in this film.<br/><br/>La La Land is about a struggling actress, Mia (Stone), who is constantly being rejected at every audition she has, and a mercurial jazz pianist, Sebastian (Gosling), who dreams of opening his own jazz club. He is a talented musician but often finds himself going against his own integrity playing pop music and simple lounge standards. The two meet in a way that would make any classic cinephile proud, and over time develop a relationship, each dealing with his and her own floundering careers is the process.<br/><br/>The film acts as a love letter to Los Angeles. It's not necessarily a nice letter, but it's not a breakup letter either. More like a letter to an abusive partner who you keep coming back to for some inexplicable reason, only for them to spit on you and tell you you're worthless.<br/><br/>It pokes fun at the city, constantly saying out loud the things most of us would be tried for treason for ever thinking. But they've all been actual thoughts lingering in our minds at one point or another.<br/><br/>It's a quixotical view of what LA is supposed to be--or used to be. The two characters are old souls adamantly romanticizing what they view their ideal careers to be, only to realize that they view this city in an antiquated way that no longer really exists in today's world. Things such as technology and loss of nostalgia are ruining it, and they struggle to find the balance between the new and the old without wanting to compromise much.<br/><br/>The film, on the other hand, compromises the new and the old very well in its every moment. The songs don't feel modern, but they don't feel dated either. They're not necessarily poppy and affable at first--fitting well into the film's jazz theme.<br/><br/>Gosling and Stone are not fantastic singers, but they're not bad either, which makes their performances all the more appealing--they're one of us.<br/><br/>Much like a non-New Yorker can empathize with a film that pays homage (or lack thereof) to New York, one doesn't have to be from Los Angeles to get what the film is trying to say. Viewers can see where the movie comes from. LA is everywhere. We experience it in almost every movie we watch in one way or another.<br/><br/>La La Land isn't just for Los Angeleans. It's for dreamers and people with big visions. For people who have been rejected over and over and over again, told they're not good enough, and still, for some reason, keep going back at it. But like anything we love, it takes a lot of work. La La Land makes you believe in your dreams again.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"

","A musical composed of the moments in dreams, reality, and everything in between. La Aa Land is a soul-thrilling, intensely felt, rollercoaster of emotions that even Acrophobians will enjoy a ride on. This movie is strongly structured with a soundtrack that will steal your heart, purposeful camera techniques, the subtle and realistic execution of acting, and major characterization throughout the entire film from the opening scene to the ending credits. Mia (Emma Stone), a barista with aspirations of becoming a big time movie actress, is too set in her bland reality to pursue her dreams. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), is just the opposite. A jazz fanatic wandering his dreamworld, hoping that one day it will all be his reality. And in the meantime, unwilling to settle for any job that doesn't fit his perfect idea of starting his own jazz club. When Sebastian and Mia find each other, their first few run-ins are some what of an unpleasant nature. From road rage during a heat filled LA traffic jam to a rude encounter at a bar, childish teasing during a party is what could have been the end of their encounters. However, fate falls into play and Mia and Sebastian fall into each other.
After a long LA party, Sebastian and Mia walk to their cars together. Along a lamplit street and a sunset sky, the two share a dance and sing a duet saying that they simply have no feelings at all towards each other. It's ironic that the two sing such things in perfect harmony. And with the synchronized choreography (by Mandy Moore) the scene is portrayed with such charm that it's overwhelmingly captivating and honest. The chemistry between them is as electric as the LA city itself. It's very clear that the two complete each other, strengthening their weaknesses through the others strong suit.
The way that a movie is shot makes or breaks a film. Every angle, every movement, every frame, means something. For instance, when Mia went to Sebastian's concert, she started out close to the stage. When the music picked up into a sound that wasn't Sebastian's style, the camera (Linus Sandgren) takes on a wide angle shot and shows the crowd of strangers pushing Mia back farther away from him. This shows us that as Sebastian morphs into someone Mia can't recognize they will grow apart. Another example of why the filming is so important is when Mia and Sebastian go to the movie theater. As their hands fumble into each others for the first time, Sandgren decides on a close up shot to make it seem like that is solely the only thing you're meant to notice. However, the dialogue of the movie that plays in the background, the one no one would ever pay attention to, discreetly hints at the ending of the movie. Simply due to the shot chosen, you only subconsciously pick up on it. This is clever because you might not even understand they you knew the ending all along it until you watch it a few times through.
Being a musical, it's obvious that one of this movies key components is the score. Justin Hurwitz (La La Lands Composer), did a miraculous job at creating music that allowed the audience to connect and become invested with the characters and their performances. With three Oscar Nominations for his work in La La Land, it's clear to the ear that each musical number was deliberately written to enhance certain emotions of every individual scene. The music in this film often arise from a soft dream-like tune to a lively, upbeat, and loud one. This aids the audience in getting a sense of the reality verses the dreamworld and even gets them caught in between the two. Although nearly every song goes back and forth from soft to loud, one specific song stick out. The movies most popular song, ""City Of Stars"" is played many times throughout the film in different renditions. Each carry a unique mood. For instance, it's first introduction to the audience is when Ryan Gosling sings about the city all by his lonesome as he walks along a pier in the early evening. He sings the song as a hopeless romantic like Sebastian would, in a rather pensive and calming tone. Expressing that he's drifted into another dream. In the second version of the song, Ryan and Emma sing alongside each other. It's played with a more upbeat mannerism. At some points in this version, the two even giggle playfully with each other. This symbolizes that together, the stars have never looked brighter. It shows that they both have a positive outlook on life and feel that dreams are achievable. In the third version, the simplicity of Emma Stone humming the songs tune leaves the audience with a light hearted giddy feeling, almost like a daydream. It shows the effect that Sebastian has had on her. And at the end of the movie, after we've witnessed all that Mia and Sebastian have been through, the track plays once more. This time it's morphed into all the songs from the film for the big finale. This brings back all the emotions we felt at once. It overwhelms us in the best way possible, and it's an experience everyone should have. The melody of this final rendition of ""City Of Stars"" shifts from a hopeful and curious tone to one of remembrance. As it is played differently than its past debuts, you get a sense that it's no longer a turned page but the closing of a book.
Aside from the technical aspects of film culture such as filming, score, and acting. La La Land was enjoyable to the fullest extent. Not once was there an unintended dull moment, and it's not doubted to be one of the best films to arise in 2016. With 12 Oscar nominations and 5 winners of best actress (Emma Stone), best cinematography (Linus Sandgren), best director (Damien Chazelle), best original music score (Justin Hurtwitz), and best production of design (David Wasco), you should not worry about walking out of the theater disappointed."

Excellent casting in both Ryan and Emma and I thought their singing and dancing was good.

"spbelisle","Null","1","4","26 September 2017"," La La Land: Why didn't I watch it sooner?
","Musicals aren't for everyone. I certainly thought they weren't for me. However, La La Land struck a chord with me. It was capable of maintaining an unoriginal story with stereotypical characters, while still being memorable and, dare I say, phenomenal. It did this through the intense use of colors to express distinct emotions during just about every scene in the movie, as well as acting as a homage to several older movies and the styles they were made in. <br/><br/>La La Land can be described as a drama, with comedic elements and a strong reliance on musical scenes. It follows Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), two dreamers in a land full of opportunists, yet lacking opportunity. Their drive to accomplish their goals is what brings them together, yet also drives them apart. The impossible goal that is achieving one's dreams and keeping one's relationships in the land of dreamers is shown in dazzling color through the story of La La Land. In the end the very thing that brought Mia and Sebastian together is what breaks them apart, yet I'd argue it's the best possible ending for both of them. Both professional dreams had been achieved, and all that remained was one last glimpse into what could have been, for better or for worse. <br/><br/>The first thing that comes to mind when thinking of La La Land, for me, is color. The movie is colorful, in so many different and amazing ways. Not only is it the best use of color I've seen in a movie, but it's what grabbed my attention immediately. Even the opening scene of the movie was vibrant, full of motion and color; it was the epitome of memorable. As Louis Giannetti states about color in his book, Understanding Movies, ""It's strongly emotional in its appeal, expressive and atmospheric rather than intellectual."" La La Land is made to invoke an intense emotional response from the viewer, and it subconsciously influences us into this response through the use of color. <br/><br/>The atmospheric use of color in the movie is particularly incredible. Examples include the green back-lighting in the dinner/fight scene, with a strong yellow glow on both the actors. Normally both of these colors would invoke more positive feelings, such as yellow bringing joy and happiness, or green meaning loyalty and trust. However, this scene turns those on their heads, it uses them for the opposite and the effect is jarring yet memorable. This continues into the scene outside the theater, after Mia's one-woman show that Sebastian missed. They're surrounded by a bright pink light that fits into the surroundings but not the mood. It brings an almost ridiculous air to the scene that further enhances the intensity of the fight. It is a very jarring effect that's utilized extremely well in these moments, and is one I was not familiar with prior to viewing this film. Of course, there is also a very consistent theme throughout the movie, using lighting and color (or lack thereof). Several times, the camera zooms in on a character while all the lights but those pointed directly at the person of interest fade to black. This is an example of emphasis through lighting, albeit an extreme one. It works due to the already formalistic nature of the film, and in many cases highlights the intense emotions a scene is trying to convey.<br/><br/>In addition to the incredible use of color to make the film truly ""pop"", La La Land loves to include references to old films. Not only that, but it was also shot in CinemaScope, a popular filming method in the '50's and '60's. It truly immerses itself in the culture of those movies, and that allows it to play off their tropes in a new and refreshing way. It's a modern masterpiece of ""just clich√© enough to not be clich√©"". Examples of the references would include the multiple nods to ""Singin' in the Rain"", like near the beginning during Mia and Sebastian's duet where he spins around a lamp pole, as well as a very literal reference to ""Rebel Without a Cause"", a film from 1955, which was screening during their first date. It also had some scenes shot at the Griffith Observatory, which was visited in a subsequent scene. La La Land is a movie about movies, and as such has much more room and credibility when it comes to using countless movie references. It just fits the story, makes it more interesting and provides extra layers for the audience to pick apart. <br/><br/>One last interesting part about La La Land is the variety of shots and filming techniques used throughout the movie. The most interesting one, in my opinion, was the reliance on what seemed like hand-held (or at least shaky to slightly shaky cam) footage during the more intense scenes in the movie. It provided a sense of realism to them, completely separate from the mostly formalistic design of the movie. Throughout, it relies heavily on the use of expression through color and music, and often times places them in what could be considered ridiculous situations to start breaking into song and dance. Granted, this comes with being a musical, but it was capable of breaking away to a more realistic style when it needed to through the use of its filming.<br/><br/>La La Land is truly a masterpiece is my eyes, and one that I wished I had watched sooner. It's use of color, lighting, camera movements and nods to classical cinema are what bring it it's intense emotion, charm and memorable story. It's capable of taking something unoriginal and reinventing it using old techniques and clich√©s, something that I have never seen before, and never considered could be done."

Firstly, Stone and Gosling are perfect cast with their try-hard, glee-loving, pure-loveliness personalities. They are not the best singers or dancers. They are the high school drama kids who made it big. They are drama geeks and that's exactly what this movie is about. It's drama geek heaven. It revels in the old Hollywood clich√©s.

"please_stand_by","8","1","4","10 June 2017"," Dreamers in a World of Classic Spectacle
","La La Land's opening musical number is perhaps its most incredible moment, being so catchy and beautifully filmed so as to immediately impress and engage any viewer who doesn't outright despise musicals. The amusing thing is that this scene could be cut from the film and have absolutely no impact on the story; it is purely for show, but what a show it is. This element of showiness is true for much of the film, which is certainly no insult given how impressive such a classical spectacle is in our current cinematic landscape that is almost completely devoid of such things. It's rare to see a musical released to the silver screen that isn't animated, a parody, a remake, or an adaptation. And that alone makes this film noteworthy. The fact that it is put together with tremendous talent and care also helps.<br/><br/>Almost every aspect of this film is executed with great flair and confidence. The cinematography is beautiful. The singing and dancing are fun, well-choreographed, and varied in style. The music in and of itself is enjoyable, and a perfect fit for the story and tone. The overall aesthetic is evocative of a colorful quasi-fairy-tale world. The characters are developed thoroughly and compellingly. The acting of the two leads is great. Romantic clich√©s you'd expect are present, but the strength of the overall product makes them forgivable. And the story itself is a well-crafted vehicle for all of these things to work in tandem, directed with great confidence and stylish precision, the lynchpin for it all being the classic, simple theme of pursuing one's dreams. Though admittedly if you're the type of person who is cynical about the film industry, then the constant bright-eyed Hollywood worship may get pretty grating for you.<br/><br/>The ending is where the movie either makes its mark or misses it, depending on your interpretation. Without going into much detail, it involves a beautifully clever musical sequence juxtaposing fantasy and reality, which I think most will agree is a highlight of the film. However, following this sequence the film ends very abruptly, which is jarring. It felt to me like it lacked the last ounce of closure needed to bring everything home, instead leaving a hollow, indecisive feeling in its wake. Perhaps this was precisely the intention, but it seemed out of place in a story that was otherwise mostly light, fun, and easy to digest.<br/><br/>That said, by breaking away from expectations the film is likely to make a more lasting impression on the viewer. In a way, this actually elevates the material from an objective film-making perspective as opposed to being predictable and derivative, though whether it works for you or not will largely depend on whether you come into La La Land looking for fantastical reality or realistic fantasy."
"RResende","Null","1","4","20 February 2017"," Marsalis, not Miles
","Once in a while this happens: a film that does everything well enough to avoid major criticism. The perfect blockbuster according to the book of David O.Selznick. A few things are required:<br/><br/>-a pair of lovable and bankable stars (girl and boy) that have the sympathy of a majority of the film-goers, even some people who don't go so often to films but recognize them as stars. They have to be given roles that fit their mold, where they can act as lovable as everyone expect them to be;<br/><br/>-give the film a story-line as easy to follow as possible, a simple romance that holds all the plot points that will make it look as something big and breath-taking. Aquaitance, fall in love, crisis, redemption...<br/><br/>-put that story-line in the context of a bigger theme and twist it in a way that will ultimately prevent the lovers from the desired happy- end. This is melodrama, where the bigger context affects the smaller lives (war in Gone with the wind; religious prejudice and politics in Ben-Hur; the shipwreck in Titanic...). In this case we have Hollywood and a simple dynamic of love vs the pursuit of dreams;<br/><br/>-produce the whole thing as lush as you can and as likable as the pair of stars: colorful saturated photography, songs everyone can easily hum, dance numbers that tap into the memory of older loved musicals. Competent and safe craftsmanship.<br/><br/>-Sell the whole thing, invest as much or more selling the thing as in producing it.<br/><br/>The self-reference here is obvious and falls along two lines, both equally safe and obvious:<br/><br/>-the movie is set in movieland, she even serves coffee in a movie studio. it works the most ostensibly artificial film genre of them all, and in the way makes obvious and safe quotes of classical musicals (plus the Rebel even more obvious bits). Among those quotes is one where they walk through the 4th wall and we get to see the whole film crew, equipment, lights, etc.<br/><br/>-the jazz bits. Our boy is a conservative jazz fan, the bop guy who thinks Miles's fusion is rock or pop, or whatever. So are the people behind this film, or so they show themselves to be. This film is supposed to stand for the ""new films"" as old jazz stands for ""new jazz"": genuine and ""true"" by comparison.<br/><br/>The by now very celebrated ending, with the alternative version where the two lovers stay together is the ultimate safety device employed. They sink the ship, and kill Jack, but just think that maybe the viewers will be put away and so they relive an alternative version of the last third of the movie and film in a few minutes, crammed with music and narrative information, the script draft that was thrown in the garbage for the sake of the ""tragic"" element of grand love themed blockbuster.<br/><br/>If you want a film that is well crafted escapism while seeming more than that, this is it. This is being canonized by Hollywood, and for years to come you will hear bits of the music in academy awards ceremonies and see it in lists of best of, etc. But if you want adventure, if you want risk, than this is the total opposite. It's obscenely safe, and ultimately pointless. This is the cinematic version of Marsalis, sailing competently and expertly through the Seas that others have charted long ago, kind of a cinematic version of a tribute band. I think I'm going to hear a Miles record after writing this.<br/><br/>PS ‚Äì this rather conservative effort is, as I write, ranked 57th on the top250 list in IMDb! At the same time Trump is sitting in the White House. Birdman is now past, its adventure over. In a few decades America (and the world by default) will observe this, and maybe process how mainstream poor/conservative storytelling habits correlates to political manipulation of the masses."

","You would think, considering the almost hysterically positive reviews, that the new Citizen Kane had been released with La La Land!<br/><br/>I very much liked this film, a toe-tapping, sun-drenched, thoroughly entertaining ode to the musicals of yesteryear with a modern twist in the inventive dance numbers and slyly adult song lyrics.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and (particularly) Emma Stone are on ripe, breezy, fun form and clearly relish playing opposite each other.<br/><br/>The photography and lighting are stunning, showing off the varied colour schemes throughout.<br/><br/>I just felt a better, more subtle marriage of the light musical and heavy dramatic moments was needed to meld all the wonderful elements together."
"richardbolden32","7","1","4","15 January 2017"," Original, fun and surprising. But does it need to be a musical?
","I must admit that musicals are not my choice of genre but I went into this with an open view. Given its feedback I had high expectations despite not being my usual cup of tea but must admit that throughout the majority of the film I wasn't blown away. It was quirky and fun and both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were great (as expected) but the first act was drawn out and it didn't do much to distinguish itself from any other romance film. The opening sequence was also far too High School Musical/Glee for my taste and I found it hard to take to seriously after this. That being said it recovered well and actually the end sequence was a pleasant surprise and done in spectacular fashion. Whereas the observatory scene seemed out of place when the pair began flying through the room, the dream-sequence at the end was a great way of emphasizing the passion of their relationship and really hit the spot as it left viewers knowing what could have been. It was also refreshing to see a film of this genre wrap up without the clich√©, go-to happy ending.<br/><br/>But the biggest feeling that I was left with after leaving the cinema was whether it needed to be a musical? Obviously the intention was to be a musical but I feel the film would have been just as much a success without the few, average songs. The songs really did not stand out and bring much to the film other than break up its flow and I would be surprised if any are remembered ten years down the line. This was certainly no Grease or Moulin Rouge but is almost as good a film for the reasons beyond the music. <br/><br/>Again this is just my view and is probably so because its not my typical genre but I would be intrigued to see what others think of whether this movie took the best direction it could."
"IanFRobinson","7","1","4","15 January 2017"," Would have been better without the musical bits....
","La La Land has been winning all the plaudits recently. With almost everyone and their dog singing its praises. Pun intended. It also cleaned up at the Golden Globes, and will likely do the same at the Oscars, unless there is a backlash.<br/><br/>I'm going to take the contrary position and tell you that I don't agree. I liked it as a film, but think it would have been better without the set piece bits that make it a musical. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any music in it. Quite the opposite. The music in the film that is performed in jazz clubs and concerts is excellent and fits into the story perfectly. There is even a version of City of Stars sung in the main characters apartment that advances the story. The City of Stars motif recurs throughout the film and is a fabulous piece of music. But there are about six sections in the film where the characters sing and dance rather than have a normal conversation. I think that these sections could be cut and it would make it a better film. Even if they are not replaced with anything.<br/><br/>Just my view. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of musicals. I rated it 7/10. It would probably have been a 9/10 if it wasn't for those six or so musical sections."
"kingbk-2","7","1","4","9 January 2017"," Great Film that Needs an Editor
","Hollywood always loves a good story about itself, whether it's the fall from graces mystery of Sunset Boulevard, the tongue-in-cheek satire in Singin' in the Rain, or the sophisticated translation of The Artist. La La Land follow this tradition. It's a wonderful film that needed an editor, hence why I gave it a 7 even though I think there is so much to love.<br/><br/>The film stars two young dreamers in Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling) and Mia Dolan (Emma Stone). Wilder is a struggling musician who is a rarity in the City of Angels: A native Angelino. He drives a older convertible which fits his persona: he was born in the wrong decade. He sneers as he sees his city gentrify and much of the older culture vanish. He dreams of owning a jazz club as he himself looks for any opportunity to make a quick buck, whether that's playing Christmas standards as a lounge player, assisting an 80s cover band at parties, or touring with a pop band that stands for everything he's against. Dolan, on the other hand, is like many in the city: from elsewhere. A native of a small town in Nevada, Dolan drops out of school to become a barista (aka actress) while frequenting auditions that go nowhere. Naive and hopeful, she's the counterbalance to Wilder's cynicism and pessimism. They immediately connect on one particular thing: pursuing their dreams. <br/><br/>I think that Gosling and Stone have excellent chemistry. I see some people complaining about that and I have no idea what movie they were watching, as I thought their romance was genuine and real, unlike most we see in film/television. I loved the magic the film had, reminding us of what great cinema can do in taking us to another world. Appearances by J.K. Simmons, John Legend, and others provide great additional support to the film. The music is beautiful and will stay with you for a long, long time, from the high energy opening number, which sets up perfectly for someone coming to L.A. for the first time, to ""City of Stars"" that encapsulates what we think of when we think of Hollywood. Another thing I see people complaining about are the numerous party scenes. As someone who lived in L.A. for a while as a starving artist, I can attest that yes, this film captured them perfectly. Most of them are insufficient and very rarely does anything happen at them that causes anything important. That's why I think the film does a great job at making them seem unimportant: they pretty much are, yet artists in the city go to them with the hopes that maybe it'll be the one that'll change everything.<br/><br/>I have one major beef with the film, but it's a big one. The editing was bad. There are scenes that point to future scenes, but sometimes these scenes lead to nothing, which makes me wonder why they were still in the film. Also, I think cutting about 30 minutes off of the film would have made it better. It got long in certain parts and I think you could have made it about 90 minutes and it still would have been an excellent film. <br/><br/>La La Land gives me hope, like those of new citizens of L.A., hoping to make it in acting, or directing, or writing, or music, or comedy, etc. Damien Chazelle is a very talented and young filmmaker who has given us now three excellent films. Maybe he can lead a new revolution for film in Hollywood similar to what happened in the 90s when filmmakers like Fincher, Payne, Tarantino, Lee, Singleton, Ritchie gave us really creative and groundbreaking original work. It's desperately needed in superhero/sequel/reboot obsessed Hollywood.<br/><br/>I recommend La La Land and call it a 9/10 star movie trapped in a 7 star film that needs an editor and some polish."
"castingsamparker","8","1","4","8 January 2017"," A love poem to the myth of Hollywood
","LA LA LAND: Spoiler Alert - this is a movie MUSICAL. Characters randomly SING and DANCE in said MUSICAL, frequently with no warning. There are several occurrences of HOPE and JOY in said MUSICAL. Such occurrences may be an anathema to your personal world view. This review is an attempt to defend the aforementioned motion picture MUSICAL specifically, and the above referenced occurrences, generally. You have been warned.<br/><br/>Hell yes, I am bitter. How could I not be, with practically everything I love being cheapened or destroyed by going digital, with America (or is it 1933 Germany) days from being governed by the most amoral kleptocracy imaginable, and with the human race basically shrugging off finding practical science-based remedies to save our only planet? I know I am not alone.<br/><br/>And so it seems appropriate, even fashionable, to be cynical. Survey the sum output of the Hollywood juggernaut and ask yourself how many films, TV shows, and recordings are steeped in a nihilistic world view, and conversely how many are at their core hopeful. Between dour entertainment and the-sky-is-falling social media, it makes one want to never wake up. Yet when something different comes along - a piece of work that tries to embrace joie de vivre, people can't wait to trash it. A few of my friends claim to have walked out of La La Land, and several more hated watching it. It begs a question: what would they prefer instead?<br/><br/>Writer-director Damien Chazelle has emerged with a singular gift for creating characters driven to the edge of disaster by their fervor to do good work. In Whiplash, both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons found profound inspiration in their characters' drive. In La La Land, the auteur has written Emma Stone's aspiring actress Mia and Ryan Gosling's jazz pianist Sebastian with similar uncompromising passions, and in a story arc as old as the movies, they must each lose his way and almost give up on her dreams before finding, at their lowest ebb, the missing piece that leads them to artistic fulfillment. Clich√©, yes, but isn't that still the dream of the adventure we call Hollywood? Isn't that why thousands still venture to the coast from every corner, willing to subsist on PA and extra work while taking acting classes, mounting original plays, making short films, performing songs at open mics, or burning the midnight oil working on screenplays?<br/><br/>In a world scarred by relentless cynicism, how can one not admire the ambition and unabashed optimism to make an old-fashioned musical? Even if it's far from perfect? Even if some songs are just passable? Even if the lead actors aren't the best singers or dancers? Even if Mandy Moore's choreography is only sometimes inspired? Even if, and this is a big one for me, Gosling's fingers aren't anywhere close to matching the sound coming out of the piano? Ryan said he took three months of piano lessons to prepare for the role, but the directorial choice to use his hands in closeup when he clearly can't play is a head scratcher. But still. This movie got made!<br/><br/>The true star of this show is DP Linus Sandgren and his team's exceptional, fluid cinematography. While not the most technically perfect images of the year, the sheer effort of precision required to choreograph and capture a five minute thirty second dance routine with hundreds of dancers, and dozens of camera marks to hit, in focus, in rapid succession, perfectly in sync with the music, and all without hitting anyone in the head¬Ö in a SINGLE TAKE¬Ö is mind boggling. Several of the dance routines are single take affairs¬Ö at magic hour. No pressure there! Sandgren's bold color choices and complex lighting cues make the film a joy to watch.<br/><br/>If we can, for two hours, believe that people can fight battles with light sabers, or that Spiderman can scale buildings, why is it so hard to believe that friends can break into song to express how they feel? It's all movie magic, all make believe, and it all requires that good old-fashioned suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Mia, at the end of her rope, poignantly sings her way through an acting audition in a moment of magical realism that is the crux of this picture. It's a perfect distillation of the requisite sacrifice required to live as an artist. It is her Somewhere Over the Rainbow moment: the universal longing for a life less ordinary. For me, it was heartbreakingly real.<br/><br/>Hollywood friends, if your sense of hope is not hale, if your lust for the dream not vibrant, if you are unwilling to let your heart be broken with every audition, every pitch, in the hope that out there somewhere lies a big confirming payoff for your endless sacrifice, then why, seriously, are you still at it? <br/><br/>This movie rekindled my fire. Here's to the ones who dream."

","WOW!! What an incredible surprise this movie was. I bought the DVD this afternoon, having not seen it at the cinema. I had much trepidation about it in view of the many, many, many poor or terrible reviews it's received on IMDb but, you know what, I think people just don't get musicals these days. There was a time when musicals were popular because they provided fantasy, often a love story of boy meets girl and there was usually a happy ending. <br/><br/>Before I go further, let me say I am not usually a fan of musicals myself and that one of the things that I hate most in the world is modern jazz, or ""musical mast*****ion"" as I often call that. I loved ""Whiplash"" despite its concentration on what I would call modern jazz. So, although I didn't like the jazz aspect in LLL, I still thought it a great movie and deserving of many of its Oscars, one of which was I believe for cinematography. The movie is just gorgeous to look at; every shot is beautifully composed and lit to perfection. <br/><br/>The point of the movie should be evident to anyone. It is a fantasy, a what if something we choose had happened slightly differently, what if the first encounter of the two main characters was the only interaction they ever had in a city the size of Los Angeles, what if she hadn't finally landed a part in a big movie, what if he had given up on his dream of the jazz club. <br/><br/>The ending, I think, was perfect. Not a saccharin thing but something beautiful. I really was incredibly surprised by this one and I look forward to watching it again soon with my wife. <br/><br/>Go into this one with an open mind and you should be rewarded. It is a very fine movie.<br/><br/>JMV"
"AmyJenson1995","10","1","5","14 April 2017"," The kind of movie we don't make anymore
","La La Land is one of a kind, a true gem I so wish we would be able to see more in theaters. It deserves the buzz and success it got and surely should have been awarded the Best Picture award at the last Oscar ceremony. They had it for a time until they finally gave it to a movie everyone barely knows. But that's OK as long as we the general public give the full success it deserves. And we do.<br/><br/>So where should I start? There are so many assets in this movie I don't think 1,000 words would be enough.<br/><br/>First the story is so well written. It's full of hope, love but most importantly, lightness. This movie is so carefree and poetic we're getting in another universe. That scene for example at the LA Observatory where Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are dancing among the stars gave me chills. I felt transported it was amazing and I remembered me and my companion holding each other hands tight as it was so powerful. La La Land is such a great tribute to the legacy of Hollywood and the musical genre in general.<br/><br/>Emma Stone is Mia, a young small town girl who wishes to make a name in Hollywood like many other girls but is not achieving real success until she meets Sebastian, a carefree pianist who lives through Jazz and wish to open his own Jazz club to give the genre a second youth. Recognizing each other's talents, they fall in love and take together the path to stardom. Both actors are truly awesome in their part and they display such a great chemistry throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Now I'm not a true fan of jazz but I love the spirit and the songs are matching perfectly the lightness displayed throughout the movie. City of Stars is my favorite so far. I love the dance scenes too including the very first one which get us straight to business. I'd so wish waiting in the LA traffic would be that fun :)That other one when Stone and Gosling are dancing on hilltop is making such a great tribute to the classic and no doubt it will become a classic soon too.<br/><br/>Yes Damian Chazelle should be proud of his baby because we don't make that kind of movie anymore and it has nothing to envy from the classic oldies of the 1950s and 1960s.

","I saw this film a few weeks ago and I'm catching up on my reviews. THIS IS Best Picture NOT Moonlight, there I said it. Sue me! Okay the film is basically about an failed actress named Mia played by Oscar winner Emma Stone :) -Oh yeah she earned that award- Anyway she goes to all these auditions in Holllywood and she gets a whole world of no until one day she meets Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling who is a jazz musician and wants to own his own jazz club but Hollywood is full of what's in now and doesn't care about what's real. So Mia and Sebastian keep missing each other until one day she hears him playing at a party and they start to date. All this stuff happens in between which I can't say because you need to see it. It's really good. I loved it. Basically the film is don't give up on your dreams.<br/><br/>Oh yeah the film is a musical. Please don't dismiss this film because it's a musical it's really good. The songs are catchy and you'll be singing those tunes the moment you leave the theater or watch it on blu-ray. Some of the songs you'll have in your head I'm sure will be Someone in the Crowd, City of Stars, Star A Fire and Another Day of Sun.<br/><br/>Okay let's get this out of the open right now. I love La La Land and I thought Moonlight was crap. I wrote a review for that film as well. It's on my page you can read it if you wish. The Oscars flub that was heard around the world had it wrong. Moonlight is NOT the Best Picture La La Land was and is, in my book at least and I'm sure in many others.<br/><br/>Should you watch this film? That's up to you. You watch it because you want to watch it. Don't let some critic tell you what to watch. I'm no critic, I'm just saying what I like. You might not like it but that's life isn't it? If you are having doubts about a movie rent it from Redbox and view it first and make your choice. It's only a few bucks and if you don't like it, you're not out of a lot of money. Or wait for it to be on TV which is silly if you ask me. I mean why would you wait 2 or 3 years for cable to play a movie when you can rent it for 2 bucks?"

","Great movie overall. The story is simple, however the complex nature of the two main characters and their will to continue on their journey accompanied by great musical scenes makes this enjoyable to watch. If there is one thing this movie teaches us is that we are seeing a birth of a great Director (Damien Chazelle). At his young age he has already made a couple of great movies and established himself as one of exceptional young talent in Hollywood.<br/><br/>If you enjoy musicals you will like this i think. Its Damiens unfamiliar take on a typical musical. Yes its a love story from start to finish but it has its own character and style."
"pepegomez65","7","1","5","9 February 2017"," What is all the fuss about?
","I don't understand what all the fuss is about this film. Maybe it appeals to a generation that has never seen a decent musical before. It has one good song (the one that keeps playing on the radio here) and that's it. Emma Stone is not a particularly strong singer and Ryan Gosling is in the same league as Rex Harrison. Although they can both dance pretty well, every extra on the screen dances better. The choreography is mundane and the transitions into song and dance often feel completely forced. However, if this marks the start of a new golden age of musicals, with a new generation of stars who can actually sing and dance, then bring it on."
"CraigsCritique","8","1","5","23 January 2017"," Why I'm Not Gaga About La La
","Yes I know, the title of my review and the fact that I've given this film an eight rating seems to be sending contradictory thoughts on how good I thought this film was, but I can explain my reasoning and thoughts on this rating process.<br/><br/>I'm going to be brutally honest with my opinions on this, if I'm judging this purely on film credentials/qualities I've got some significant issues, primarily the pacing, it really does lag between sections of the film and this is going to sound bizarre so hear me out...but is the films predictable story structure of young love too comfortable? Or is that the intention of the film given in essence it's a love letter to classic Hollywood films of the studio era where audiences pretty much knew what they were going to get going in...I'll leave that one up for debate I suppose.<br/><br/>On a completely different note I must comment upon Ryan Gosling's singing, it's not particularly bad it's just kind of underwhelming given all that is surrounding it.<br/><br/>The most significant question I have to ask in regards to this film however is at what point does nostalgia for films past equal critical acclaim? Is the film self congratulatory? I kind of thought so in certain moments, there's a particular piece of dialogue that is so glaringly so I did an unintentional eye roll. The reason why I think this is a relevant question is that in recent years we've experienced films that go beyond a nod and a wink to films past and just outright try to recreate and remake extremely popular films of previous years that have been given from my point of view too good critical receptions as simply repackaging these qualities to give to a new modern age audience is not a sign of greatness, surely it's a sign of lack of creativity. The only thing I will say in this films defence to this point is that the films director/writer Damien Chazelle I truly do believe has made this film with immense love for the genre of film that has been and earnestly wanted to bring it to the new audience with none of the cynicism I clearly have, however where it in my opinion falls down is the predictable and flat storytelling in between the outstanding song and dance numbers that the films soul lives off, which is actually a shock as his previous film Whiplash is one of my favourite films in the last few years that I constantly tell people to watch as it has brilliant storytelling at the heart of it.<br/><br/>It really sounds like I didn't enjoy this film doesn't it, however let's go on to the positives, when it's on song it is truly exceptional as an event piece of cinema and certainly worth the price of admission alone, three segments in particular are of testament to this, the Gosling/Stone bench choreographed number, the Emma Stone final audition song (reminded be heavily of Anne Hatheway in Les Miserables) and the 'what if?' reversal of time jazz club finale that was an astonishing spectacle to behold.<br/><br/>I'd be amazed if the score doesn't sweep every awards gong going as it was truly magnificent, the songs were generally infectiously fun but what wins you over more then anything for me was the dance numbers and not because they were a nostalgic nod to Hollywood's yesteryear but because they were wonderfully entertaining and skilfully put together in their own right with two superb performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling at the centre of them putting their heart and soul into something that would have been an enormous challenge, in fact the story between the song and dance numbers almost does a disservice to these moments because the dance numbers themselves tell a much better story through that medium, Emma Stone is sublime and she most certainly can sing and her joyfully exuberance performance is the base for the joyful feel of the film.<br/><br/>This is event cinema, it has to be seen at the cinema there is no doubt about that as it's the sort of film that won't be seen very often on our screens, I can certainly see why is has garnered the industries critical acclaim and respect, however my own personal take on the film is that not of utter adulation but one of just great respect as a film of flawed brilliance."

I bet you will enjoy every moment of 128 minuets.<br/><br/>Even after two days of watching the movie, I am wondering what if the movie was in B/W? How would I feel? Watching a movie from 70's? Am I equally amazed, or not, or even more? I am not sure, I don't know! Would miss Emma in yellow? Maybe, yellow is the warmest color! <br/><br/>However, 'Damien Chazelle' was incredible with his direction and screenplay. Excellent, Extraordinary! Mr. Chazelle, forget about Whiplash, La La Land wont disappoint you, at least for the screenplay. All the best! <br/><br/>And what to say about the music? Soundtracks are good, but not up to my expectations. You disagree? Maybe, maybe not, I don't care.<br/><br/>Finally, I did not find Emma and Ryan overwhelming throughout the movie, especially Emma, you need to know the thin line between acting and over acting. Yes, I am fully aware of your awards, thank you.<br/><br/>Overall: 8, and Highly Recommended!"
"nickmdaly","7","1","5","20 January 2017"," Ingenious or cinematic sacrilege?
","It's clear to understand why countless five-star reviews extravagantly blazon the film poster for La La Land, as La La Land is essentially a film critic's dream. It's a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers, and after a career of dissecting and analyzing an innumerable amount of them; it must be a certain thrill for a critic to witness one being deconstructed before their very eyes.<br/><br/>La La Land first seizes a classic film genre and contorts it, re imagining the Old Hollywood musical by juxtaposing a contemporary Los Angeles setting with the heightened whimsical reality of those early 20th century productions, straddling the two contrasting eras in such an expert manner that they somehow miraculously harmonize. The musical sequences are delightfully executed, with exhilarating Baz Luhrmann-esque camera swoops capturing charming choreography amongst sumptuous set designs that are doubtlessly littered, Tarantino-like, with suitable film references. It's near impossible not to be enraptured by this, as La La Land's infectiously joyful tone combined with its sublime filmmaking aspects produce a positively captivating experience, reminding us in a modernized and relevant sense exactly why the musical genre is so beloved, and producing a refreshing antidote to the relentless cynicism that permeates our recent culture. <br/><br/>Suitably, its narrative is the traditional scenario of a love story between two struggling artists and dreamers, with Emma Stone's coffee shop barista Mia enduring multiple brutal auditions in the hope of movie stardom, while Ryan Gosling's Seb is on a one-man mission to change the modern perception of jazz and regain its glory. They're befitting casting, with Gosling's stoic charm and Stone's buoyant persona hearkening to that specific bygone era, while their wry conversational wit simultaneously grounds them in the present-day backdrop. Also appropriate is the simplistic nature of their developing romance, proving the strength of La La Land and all its components by producing such impactful scenes from these conventional and exhausted romantic comedy tropes. These scenes culminate in a transcendent moment as Seb and Mia spontaneously float and ballroom dance amongst the stars of an observatory, conceiving a surreal sequence that sincerely embodies the beauty and magic of cinema.<br/><br/>After reaching such soaring heights of razzle-dazzle-ness, it was perhaps inevitable that La La Land would ultimately fizzle out, and in an act of rather unexpected cruelty, the enchanting development the film has so effectively accomplished is dismantled before the viewer's eyes. The somewhat jarring introduction of Seb's old friend Keith (John Legend) is the catalyst that spurs this sudden shift of tone, as Seb accepts his soulless job offer despite a lasting desire to own a jazz bar. Thereafter Seb and Mia's aspirations for themselves and one another are continually dashed and dampened, their passions gradually engulfing their passions for each other while the film adopts an unforeseen gloomy essence of realism.<br/><br/>It's where motifs from director Damien Chazelle's last feature Whiplash (2014), a savage observation of artistic ambition, are introduced as Chazelle essentially hijacks this established genre with his personal beliefs and developing directorial trademarks. In retrospect the foreshadowing is evident: an earlier scene of Seb and Mia strolling through the Warner Brothers' studio back lot allows the viewer a peak behind the cinematic curtain before La La Land eventually takes them behind it's own. Nevertheless, without the sheen of Old Hollywood charm the simplistic nature of the plot is ultimately exposed as the unoriginal, clich√©-ridden Fame-esque narrative it actually is, with its discussions on hopes and dreams now obtaining a level of triteness. Additionally, the approach is neither authentic nor hard-hitting enough to be entirely effective, instead striking an unsatisfying middle ground that fails to fulfill the potential of its inspired and intriguing concept. Gratefully, the film somewhat salvages itself by its culmination, reintroducing it's much missed homages with a beautifully performed sequence that in it's own unusual bittersweet way depicts the power film is capable of and is an ode to cinema itself.<br/><br/>Indeed, La La Land is a film about film itself created specifically for film lovers, but its exact assessment of the subject is something for the viewer to ponder. While there's undoubtedly an ingenious aspect of deconstructing a departed genre for a modern age, there's simultaneously an element of cynicism and cinematic sacrilege. In a pessimistic society and a film and television landscape that frequently reflect that, and it's in this respect La La Land would ironically be more subversive if it retained its jubilant spirit, is it truly necessary or beneficial for the audience to glimpse beyond this cinematic curtain? For a few hours can ignorance be bliss and can the sanctity of film be sacred while the audience resides, temporarily at least, in the whimsical escapism of 'La La Land'?"
"gaiaaoimd","7","1","5","20 January 2017"," Bittersweet
","The film starts in a common musical introduction, proceeds with the leads then onto the clich√© of an actress and a musician trying to reach their dreams. Sound boring at first, but clearly this is a breath of fresh air for 2016. The script wasn't amazing (bland in comparison with ie. Casablanca of course) but the aspirations of both leads pulls through. The chemistry is there if you have watched their previous movies so it's quite biased. What I liked and mostly what saved the entire film (in my honest opinion) was the ending. It was a consensus of both parties to part in a bittersweet tone. The longing of what could have been was there but it is what it is, reality hits them hard. It takes the audience into a romantic fantasy only to brings us back to reality, a familiarity we can all relate to. <br/><br/>Stone was great. Gosling was lacking. Great film for 2016, but bland in comparison with classic musical movies."

","Wasn't quit sure what to make of it when I saw the trailer, but I have say it's a film that actually pleasantly surprised me. <br/><br/>Basically it's nice feel good film, which had the feel of a Hollywood musical from the 1950s didn't have the same impact but I guess they were trying to give it modern day look, which didn't quite work but for me is still a decent film, that has your foot tapping at times during the musical numbers. <br/><br/>Started off well with a grand opening but I felt a bit flat in the middle but ended on a high, although the ending felt a bit bittersweet<br/><br/>Normally not that keen on Ryan Gosling but he actually surprised me in this film, he does have some acting talent after all! Emma Stone as usual just seems to light up the screen with her presence and played off well against Gosling.<br/><br/>If you wanting a film that offers you an alternative to bloods, guts, guns and swearing this is for you. Will have you singing to yourself as you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for a musical :-)"

","I don't recommend bringing a date to this movie because of .... The story is decent, the last ten minutes made me cringe hoping they do not screw up the ending. It is not difficult to guess what the ending is going to be, but the journey to the conclusion is what makes this interesting. The singing and dancing was not really that good. OK for the shower at home, but not for Hollywood. They are good actors, but you need different skill sets for the other two. He was stronger than her! When they dance in an ensemble, the lack of grace and smoothness shows. This is about young lovers, dreaming big and hitting the reality barrier and making adult choices. Not date movie!"

","Lalaland is sad. I don't know what I was expecting from a film that gathered so much attention... Probably I was expecting a lot of music and everyone singing... I was expecting a nice love story and a happy end. And if it was all I got it would be a musical version of ""Notebook"", but things got just a little more complicated. If you want to achieve something you need to sacrifice a lot. I think the main idea behind this film is expressed when they meet after his first concert. I understand perfectly why she reacted the way she did for his first performance in a band and I understand perfectly why he enjoyed what he was not that much into, it was a first success in a path of grim failures... She started to see him as bit of a different person, who betrayed a bit of himself and she felt sort of cheated. But was that the problem really? From my point of view, he always loved her and probably waited for her, right until the end... But did she ? To sum up, don't go to this film with a date, it will leave a bitter feeling. The film is about sacrifices in a creative career and about the love of one man."

","I've been a musical movie fan since 12. I remember the first time when I saw a musical movie, I was amazed by how characters suddenly started singing and dancing while one second ago they were just talking like normal people! I didn't know such a wonderful world exist! It was just like a dream world for a 12 year old! For two or three years since then I would look for old musical movie discs and would play those I love over and over again. As if I stopped watching those wonderful musical movies, the dreamy musical world would disappear from me. Then for years I haven't have much new findings of good musical movies. And as a grown up, I almost forgot my teenage passion for musical movies. <br/><br/>But this movie brought it all back! This movie has made it to return to the musical movies' original nature! Yet it is not without modern observations and values. It is classical and new at the same time! What is more magical about this movie is that after going out of the movie theater, when you sit in your own couch at home listening to the original sound track, those happy and sad emotions in the theater all come back to you! I am sure in 10 or 20 years, on a random day, if I turn on the radio and if it plays a song from this movie, I will cry again.<br/><br/>Thank you Director, thank you the whole movie crew!"

","7/10. An Actress and a Jazz pianist fall in love, in this musical love story. Directed by Damien Chazelle who also did Whiplash in 2014, a movie I really loved. This time he pairs up Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and they're beautiful together, they show what two class actors can do when put together. I enjoyed their chemistry, and the heart they put into this. The music and the score are fantastic, and put you in the film with them. One draw back I found, however, is that either of them can sing well, and they both have quite weak and quiet voices. I would have enjoyed some stronger lead voices. Also, not to give anything away, but I liked the whole ride, I just didn't like the way the director decided to go with the ending, it left me a bit angry. All those troubles aside, if you are a fan of musicals, Ryan Gosling and or Emma Stone, then you must see this one. If not then I think you will actually hate it. La La Land #lalaland"
"Skruffbagg","8","1","5","15 January 2017"," Wonderful Movie-going Experience
","I went to see La La Land with my girlfriend last night in a packed-out screen, mostly filled with young couples. I was actually looking forward to this film, although admittedly with some trepidation as I don't really tend to trust the general movie going public's opinion on what is good or not.<br/><br/>Let me first of all say, this is a fantastic film. It's a wonderful modern take on the classic Hollywood musicals of the past. The acting, cinematography, choreography, and wardrobe are all on point and likely to be some of the best you will see this year and beyond. The songs are not particularly memorable however.<br/><br/>In brief, Emma Stone plays Mia, an aspiring actress currently working as a barista on the Warner Bros. lot, and Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian, a jazz aficionado who drives 5 miles out of the way for a coffee just to be near a jazz club. They each have their dreams and aspirations for the future, but are currently unhappy with their lot in life. After falling for each other, she helps him believe in staying true to his dreams whilst he helps reinforce her passion for acting, but the road is never as easy in real life as it is in the schmaltzy musicals of yesteryear and the dreams they carefully work to maintain threaten to tear them apart.<br/><br/>This in particular is what the movie does superbly. While the plot could be considered as formulaic (you will see things coming before they happen on screen), in classic musicals like Singin' In The Rain (1952) and Mary Poppins (1964), there is always a happy ending. La La Land subverts this, but not in the way you would expect, and I personally thought this was a very clever and sweet way to end the film.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly brilliant. Gosling does an excellent job but Emma Stone in particular, wow. She really blew me away in this film and I would not be in the least bit surprised if she picks up the Best Actress gong at the Academy Awards as it would be fully deserved. In the beginning, she goes to an audition which we see her practicing for in her car at the start of the film and is roundly ignored. Her soliloquy and performance in this audition and is one of the most powerful and realistic pieces of acting I have seen in many years, more clever in the fact that she is acting while acting (very meta). <br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone, and I would imagine that some will detest it as it is quite slow moving, the songs aren't catchy (and there's not really a lot of them) and as previously mentioned, the plot is formulaic. There was also quite a few confused looking faces in the audience at my screening in the end which genuinely made me laugh my ass off as they didn't ""get it"" (they were pretty young so it's forgivable), but I personally found it endearing, a joy to watch and I'm looking forward to seeing it again."

","In the interest of not exposing the spoilers, this review will only focus on the existentialism of what it means to be a musical. Hollywood loves Hollywood. And I never want you to talk to me again. I mean it, dude.<br/><br/>La La Land is not a whiplash, but we do get to see J.K. Simmons pushing his Oscar. This is a musical, albeit a minor one, because neither of the leads can really sing or dance. Then again, acting. Emma Stone is so cute and adorable she makes you want to shrink her up and swallow her up in a gelcap. Ryan Gosling, peace be with you, consistently struggles to appear absent of his psychopathic tendencies.<br/><br/>A musical should be . . . musical? I love jazz. And this movie is about hating jazz. If you want to learn jazz, explore jazz, appreciate jazz, try 'Round Midnight instead. Dexter Gordon will see you through.<br/><br/>My mom once said, ""Never, EVER, talk to me again!""<br/><br/>I wonder whether that should have had three exclamation points.<br/><br/>I hope that La La Land never, EVER, pretends again to be what it is not: a great movie. It's a fine film. Nothing more and nothing less. If you find solace in this melange and pastiche, I have a dictionary just waiting for you."
"graestella","8","1","5","13 January 2017"," Good, But Don't Believe The Hyperbole
","From the incandescent reviews that preceded this picture, I was expecting something like a cross between 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Moulin Rouge'. By the end of the opening sequence on the motorway overpass it was obvious we were going to get neither. It was all shot outdoors with naturalistic lighting. Despite this being LA, one of the sunniest places in the world, the light was poor. Shadows fell over faces, and in the night time scenes people almost disappeared, even the two leads. If they hadn't been wearing that yellow dress and a white shirt they would have disappeared altogether. Strangely, on the promo still, both characters are illuminated in a Gene Kelly like glow worthy of Cinemascope. This was disappointing to say the least. Then as the fantasy sequences began, I expected there to be a switch to full lighting, or a change of film stock to zap us into the eponymous 'La La Land' of the title. But no, these were dull and poorly lit as well. Wasted opportunities. How my wife and I yearned for Kelly or Baz Luhrman to jazz this up a bit. (Pun intended). What we got was a pretty prosaic story, with no real antagonist to thwart the couple. There was no evil boss, horrible parents, wicked sister, invading army or other McGuffin to keep them apart in the third act. All we got was a rather contrived row, which could have been sorted out with one phone call. Thousands of couples survive being on the road, or becoming a film star. Why was it so difficult for these two? I thought of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Who really did love each other forever, despite decades of troubles. Then a whole 'Sliding Doors' Alternate Universe happens, and our heroes' lives go off on an inexplicable tangent. Did neither of them pick up the phone in five years? Boy could these guys hold a grudge after one aborted dinner! So, despite being an alleged homage to Hollywood Musicals, we don't get a happy ending. I get it. To suffer for one's Art, pain is necessary, especially in Jazz or in Method Acting, but you sort of promised us one. At least in the promotional material. The acting itself however, was first rate. Both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were as good as ever, and did their best with the often underwritten material. For them alone the film still gets an Eight."

","La La Land is a romantic musical, filled with a nostalgic salute to Hollywood's golden age.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple: two young people trying to achieve their dreams, in the land of dreams. They are filled with passion, and find love in each other.<br/><br/>Do not expect a so called 'girly' movie tho. We follow their arising problems as well as their love. These problems are usually connected with abandoning their big dreams to get a decent life, or as many say it, growing up.<br/><br/>Life happens to drive their ways to different directions, which leads to fulfill their dreams, but also to lose each other.<br/><br/>A couple of times, I felt like I was watching Casablanca. Like in the masterpiece of Michael Curtiz, the two in love have a melody, which wakes the feeling of their dreaming days in them, their love.

","Opening scene: stalled traffic. A Los Angeles freeway at the dreaded standstill. Every car blasting a different aural vibe. What next? Road rage? Coughing fits? Valium-popping? Instead, you get the voice of one driver, smooth as honey, singing loud and clear. She climbs out of her car and starts to dance. Soon everyone is out of their cars‚Äîsinging, dancing, skateboarding on the Jersey barrier. In other words, once traffic starts again, you're in for a different kind of movie ride! That's a joyful suspension of disbelief moment there, true to the conventions of the movie musical. West Side Story is the only movie I've ever seen multiple times in the theater, each time wishing, hoping, praying that when Chino appears at the end with his gun, he'd bring along some different outcome. I recall a youthful knucklehead dismissing the film as unrealistic. Yeah, right. You either go with it you don't. In the case of La-La Land, I did and hope you will. Writer-director Damien Chazelle has put together a film, in which each musical number grows organically from the action on-screen. The music is more than just pleasant, with some memorable tunes. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are excellent in the leads roles and effective songsters for the style of their numbers. The dancing seems mostly theirs too. And they really sell it. Two strivers want to make it in tinseltown‚Äîhe as a jazz pianist, she as an actress. Will they reach their dreams? Will their relationship survive the journey? It may be a ride you've taken before, but it's a smooth one.

"jay-techie2007","7","1","5","3 January 2017"," Watchable, if you can sit through the first half
","This is only the third Hollywood musical I have seen after High School Musical and Les Miserables. While the former was crap, the latter was a masterpiece but the commonality between the two movies was that they were coherent within themselves. That's what was missing in La La Land, for the first half at least. It's a good movie overall, with beyond brilliant second half, but only if you are able to survive the first half. <br/><br/>Story (7/10): Two people keep bumping into each other on various occasions and eventually fall for each other only to realize that their professional success will come at the cost of their love life. Incidentally, none of them are dishonest but the circumstances bring them at a juncture where they have to pick one. The story is written on a very strong plot but as it gets into the details, it starts falling apart. LA was a near-perfect location to base this story with Ryan Gosling portraying a struggling musician (a Jazz enthusiast), and Emma Stone projecting an aspiring actress with a day job at a coffee shop. The build up of their love affair is totally unconvincing. As far as the first half goes, the scenes do not have much connect between them and the music pieces are abrupt. Just because you have a musical, doesn't mean you need to have a song every 2 minutes. This movie would have been much better without the musical piece. However, it is the second half where the movie gets far better. The scenes are well thought and the music pieces - especially ""City of Stars"" and ""The Fools Who Dream"" - are very profound and apt to the situation. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): Ryan Gosling might have squeezed every little drop of his charm into this movie but he came across as a far stronger actor than his counterpart Emma Stone. While the roles weren't so challenging, the two have been good enough individually. However, for me, the chemistry was somewhat missing between the two actors. I could totally see Jennifer Lawrence in Mia's role, instead. Apart from these two, none of the other actors have received much screen time to create any impact. <br/><br/>Music (8/10): The film rides on quite a strong music and lyrics. It looks a little unnecessary and too much in the first half, except for ""Another Day of Sun"" which was quite perfect to set the tone of the movie as well as get the audience into an LA mood. However, some of the songs like ""City of Stars"", ""Epilogue"" and ""The Fools Who Dream"" are so good that you can listen to them on repeat mode. <br/><br/>Direction (7/10): Damien Chazelle probably took a little too much into his plate with story writing, direction as well as lyrics. While I love the way he steered the movie in the second half, it is the first half where the movie is all over the place and very confusing. The build up of the story is pretty vague. The scenes are very much incoherent and an unconvincing. However, the later part of the movie is good. I loved the choice of climax, especially the last scene with a rewind sequence, which was very unconventional. Full marks to the director for that.<br/><br/>Overall (7/10): Overall, it's a watchable movie, if you can sit through the first half."

","After the ebullient opening scene of ""La La Land,"" a musical number staged in an L.A. traffic jam and featuring a cast that celebrates the diversity of that city, I thought I was going to adore ""La La Land."" But nothing else in the movie quite measures up to that opening scene.<br/><br/>I liked the film, some of it quite a lot, but it did not affect me the way it has so clearly affected others. I'm a bit surprised that people are talking about leaving the movie on a high, or referring to its ending as happy. ""La La Land"" doesn't exactly end unhappily, but the happiness it does deliver to our principal characters is qualified. The film, both an homage to and a contemporary re-calibration of the MGM musicals of Hollywood's golden age, suggests that human lives have more than one possible happy ending, and that by choosing one you necessarily have to pass over another. Better be sure, then, that the one you choose is the one that will leave you with the fewest regrets about the ones you let pass by.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have enough chemistry to light a fire. Indeed, they have so much that one is almost disappointed that they aren't a real-life couple. I don't know that the characters they play in this film take either actor that far out of his/her comfort zone, but both give terrifically charismatic performances. Stone especially steals the film right out from under the feet of everyone else, Gosling and kinetic director Damien Chazelle (of ""Whiplash"" fame) included.<br/><br/>I've seen others refer to ""La La Land"" as a love letter to Los Angeles. I don't know L.A. that well, and what I've seen of it I didn't care for, so I might be biased. But this film struck me as less a valentine to the City of Angels and more of an examination of the allure the world of fame exercises over dreamers, and the determination that world demands of those who are going to make it there.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

But it was built with a modern infrastructure. It was a fairy-tale film that was reinforced by the facts and technology of the era we lived on. Those who do not like the musical may not like the musical, but they will watch it. I know myself. I do not like Singin 'in the Rain that everyone fancies. I like to listen to the music but the dances are boring to me. But is that so? The dance scenes that resemble Indian movies are not much in the way I have already mentioned.

It has a pure, delicate beauty. It is a star of the year 2016 that you feel as if you were different from your first stage. I loved the soundtrack of Stars with City Of Stars. I can say that Oscar is unrivaled in original music. The City of Stars plays the song so many times that you get bored if you hear so many other songs so often, but you can say that you play a little more as you listen to it. Damien Chazelle, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. What kind of work did you do? I always call it an Oscar, but I need to say that each of these three will get at least a nomination. Emma Stone is fascinated by its beauty, beauty. Ryan is a romantic man. We remember from The Notebook movie with Rachel McAdams. It is a player who can be played without thinking in such roles. Chazelle made the right choice. Both players. What I'm going to tell you about Chazelle is that he's a musician. I do not know if he might worship music. Whiplash first, now this movie. Dude, please keep making movies. <br/><br/>In the film there is a message like capitalism and human being as a sub-text. Or I do not know if it came to me. Messages such as returning from ideals for money, being a slave of money, abandoning its goals because the community does not like it, living for others, waiting for others to like you constantly.

","La la Land may not be everyone's cup of tea but let's look at why there are so many reasons to see this inspired film. To name a few important ones: go see it if you believe in the power of music, dance, romance and dreams. This film beguiled me and I can see how it beguiles its viewers through its lighthearted approach to a serious topic: how do we chase and hold on to our dreams without losing them? Hats off to Damien Chazelle for reviving the musical genre in an engaging and thoroughly entertaining way. The acting, writing and direction are spot on. The movie takes some time to build momentum in the story line, but when it does, it really takes you on a journey. Emma Stone is perfectly cast as the vulnerable and quirky young actress, while Ryan Gosling's character is a complex layer of jazz tradition, dreams, stubbornness, clarity and magic all spun together. I loved that the director saluted the hey day and romance of the Hollywood musical and that perhaps it's not a genre that is dead but very much alive. If you're willing to let the film take you on a journey, and suspend your expectations, the magic of this film will find its way into your heart and mind. I also say hats off to the ending, which was both inspired and realistic and not a typical Hollywood ending but still retains a lingering touch of magic, like the final note of a piano piece that still resonates in the air after it ends.

At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Damien Chazelle, who last year came out of nowhere with is impressive debut film ""Whiplash"". For his sophomore release, Chazelle sticks to the music world, but this time in an all-around ol' fashioned Hollywood musical. When the movie's opening titles announce ""Presented in CinemaScope"", you know this is going to be ""just like the good ol' days"", and that certainly turns out to be the case. The musical numbers are simply outstanding, and just as important, move the film's story line forward. The movie benefits enormously from the obvious chemistry between the two leads, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. While the movie's overall story arc is quite familiar, you simply enjoy the scenes for what they bring. John Legend brings an important secondary performance as Keith, the leader of a jazz/R&B band called The Messengers. At one point Seb and Keith debate how 'authentic' the jazz sound of the Messengers should be. Keith observes: ""You're holding on to the past, but jazz is all about the future!"". Speaking of the musical score: if you are not into music, by all means do yourself a favor and find another movie to see, because in the end the music is the heart and soul of the film. As was the case for ""Whiplash"", the music is courtesy of relative newcomer Justin Hurwitz (Harvard classmate of Chazelle, I read the other day). Heavy on jazz, but with plenty of pure orchestral moments as well, the core is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" is one of the year's most anticipated releases for me (as I absolutely loved ""Whiplash""). Due to various year-end scheduling conflicts and commitments, I just now had a chance to see it. The matin√©e screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely. Much to my surprise I noticed a number of young (6-7-8 yr. old) kids in the audience. I would've loved to ask them afterwards what they thought of this movie. I loved the movie, period, and will end up high on my year-end list of best movies of 2016. ""La La Land"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"rsegal-86570","8","1","5","26 December 2016"," Fun, if that's what your looking for!
","This is my first review and after watching it is one the one I wanted to begin with. Firstly for the separate category, paying attention to the cinematography it was very well shot. The main theme is pretty catchy and stays with you the whole movie and direction is brilliant(the over all reason it did so well considering the script wasn't perfect)and keeps you entertained, stopping certain scenes in particularly from becoming dull.<br/><br/>The missing of better sub plot or sub storys was a let down and characters around had a small amount of characterisations which i'm sure wasn't completely necessary but it is something the audience would love to of seen. The main characters have little change and i hate to say it but for someone that judges acting it was quite brilliant. On the contrary the movie needed those actors full of joy, great energy and life in them.<br/><br/>Seeing this is Damien Chazelle's third movie I am completely impressed (Whiplash was better though) to see such an enthusiastic approach to film. You can see that deeper meaning to him and you just know that the love for music can make viewers love the music or drums in his other movie. <br/><br/>Finally yes it had missing links, yes the ending wasn't the best and the conflict was a bit messy but it was so fun to watch, enthralling, original and Oscar worthy for sure. The dancing and singing is a great idea for a modern film and what i love about it is most audiences can watch it. Older people and younger as well as in the middle because it is just like that and that is what i'm sure the non self indulgent Damien was aiming for. If i had to say one more thing it would be work on the script a little bit more but in general if you want an experience of the moment that you may not remember in time this is a great one to watch!!!!!"
"trevor-82944","7","1","5","21 December 2016"," Here's Looking at a Classic, Kid.
","It's shot in CinemaScope, it's big on pizazz, it's packed with bold color schemes, the stage lights appear straight out of a dream, it's big one minute and quiet the next, and every song and tune will replay in your head days after it's all over. No, you're not in the 1950s, and no, you're not in Kansas anymore. This is the present-day reality. So forget about those loud action movies with no respect for the stage, La La Land proves what can and should be done with the long lost art that is the moving picture.<br/><br/>The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now, but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story, which director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) achieves with expert choreography. While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge, he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch. It's always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese, but Damien Chazelle has done it!<br/><br/>Within Chazelle's cinematic recreation of Southern California, he fastens our seat belts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons, starting at the heat of Christmas. One is a ruby-red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition, and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet. The other is a Fred Astaire-Dooley Wilson mash-up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano, no matter what his boss wants him to play. After they first meet over road rage at rush hour, these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run-ins day after day. Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon.<br/><br/>Once we learn about what these two have in common, boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship! He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form, but she cannot stand listening to it, and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year. It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance, even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don't even matter.<br/><br/>Yet it's not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship, but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment. On their first formal meeting, she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight, as if she's glancing into his own little world. On second formal meeting, they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight. On the first date, they are swept off their feet‚Äîliterally, to a dance against the stars in a planetarium. On the tenth date, they sing an Oscar-worthy duet. As time goes by, the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes. Her tears swell up along with the audiences'; I'll even admit I choked up as well, and I'm a man.<br/><br/>This wide variety of tone in music is plentiful yet wisely spare, celebrating the history of cinema magic while wishing the best for its future. Yet also like the oldies it writes its love to, there are one too many white players in the production. There are two African Americans cast, but as dancers on the pier who say not a word, just as blacks were stereotyped in that golden age of Hollywood. If this production was less focused on making a musical spectacular and more focused on showing care and attention to today's media-frenzied audience, then there would have been a better likelihood for this to surpass those repetitive comic book movies at the box office.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope for the day when people return to their senses and offer their money to movies because of their cinematic quality other than their branding. Considering how much music is now taking over our culture, we could use that reminder of how much music raises our self-esteem when times are hard. After seeing what La La Land can do with both old and new styles of filmmaking, I can absolutely assess that I love musicals all over again! Therefore, I encourage everyone to go see this magical delight to raise the spirits for 2017. After all, tomorrow is another day!"

","It's so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn't animated. Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen. The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops. I think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots. Oh, so it's the worst film of the year! Really? This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim. The production numbers are sappy to be sure, but that's what this kind of offering puts to us. It tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters."
"jboothmillard","8","3","34","18 January 2017"," La La Land
","From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash), I heard a little about this film a couple of months before its release, the title relates to both the location city and the idiom for being out of touch with reality, I knew it was likely to be part of awards season. Basically in Los Angeles, California, on-studio barista and aspiring actress Mia (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Emma Stone) and jazz pianist Sebastian (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ryan Gosling) are caught in traffic on a crowded highway, they have a moment of road rage. Despite her best efforts, Mia has a poor audition, that night she is taken out by her roommates to a lavish Hollywood Hills party, after which she finds her car has been towed away and is forced to take the long walk back. Sebastian is playing piano for a gig in a restaurant, he slips into passionate jazz improvisation, despite being warned by the owner Bill (J.K. Simmons), Mia walks past and overhears, she enters to listen and sees Sebastian get fired, he storms out and coldly brushes off Mia trying to compliment him. Months later, Mia and Sebastian cross paths when he is playing with a band at a party, he is a part of a 1980s pop cover band, after the gig they walk together to find their cars, and expressing the waste of a good evening with each other, but there is clearly chemistry between them. Mia takes Sebastian on a walk around the movie lot, explaining her passion for acting, and Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his love for the music that may be dying out, and explaining his passion to open a club, they warm to each other. Mia has a commitment with her current boyfriend, she forgot this when accepting an invite from Sebastian to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause, but she leaves to join Sebastian, as the film begins, the two conclude their evening with a romantic dance at the Griffith Observatory. Mia has more failed auditions, following Sebastian's suggestion she decides to write a personal single-actress play, while Sebastian begins to perform regularly at the jazz club, the two also move in together. Sebastian's high school classmate Keith (John Legend) invites him to be the keyboardist in his jazz band, this is an offer for steady income, Sebastian is daunted by the pop- oriented style of the band, but overhearing a conversation by Mia to her mother about his career, he signs with them, and Mia knows his heart is not fully into the music being made. The band are on their first tour, Mia confronts Sebastian about his future and goals, he responds saying that she wanted him to have a steady career, then accuses her that she loved him when he was unsuccessful, Mia leaves insulted. Sebastian fails to show up for the opening night of Mia's solo play, due to a photo shoot he forgot about, only a few people attend, Mia is dejected overhearing dismissive comments from audience members, so she leaves Los Angeles and moves back to Boulder City, Nevada. One day, Sebastian receives a call from a casting agent who was watching Mia's play, Mia has been invited to a film audition, Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to return, she is simply asked to tell a story for the audition, she tells an emotional story about her aunt who inspired her to pursue acting. Sebastian is confident that the audition went well for Mia, he asserts that she must devote herself wholeheartedly to the opportunity she has been given, they profess they will always love each other, but they face an uncertain future. Five years later, Mia is a famous actress and married to David (Tom Everett Scott) and they have a daughter, one night they stumble into a jazz club, Mia notices the name ""Seb's"", she realises Sebastian has finally opened his own club, he is playing piano and spots her in the audience, looking unsettled and regretful. This prompts an extended dream sequence, the two imagine what might have been had their relationship worked out perfectly, while their love theme plays, when the dream ends Mia leaves with her husband, before walking out Sebastian and Mia look at each other with a knowing look and smile, they are happy they have achieved their dreams. Also starring Rosemarie DeWitt as Laura, Finn Wittrock as Greg, Callie Hernandez as Tracy, Sonoya Mizuno as Caitlin, Jessica Rothe as Alexis and Josh Pence as Josh. Stone is strong, charismatic and vulnerable as the jobbing actress, Gosling is a likable talented musician, they make a good couple, this works well as a look into going-on in Tinseltown, it has the feel of a classic film of the genre, in the modern day, and it has wonderful songs and dance sequences, a most enjoyable romantic musical comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score for Justin Hurwitz, Best Original Song for ""City of Stars"" (it also won the Golden Globe) and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year (it was mistakenly announced as the winner, dubbed ""envelopegate"", Moonlight was the actual winner), Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Original Song for ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"", it won the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Cinematography and Original Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score. Very good!"

","This is one of those films that consist of dialogue-scenes that the actors improvise to get into the mood for the real script. Actors love that cheezy 'ranting around' kind of dialogue because they love to swim in scenes, packed with drama and deep, emotional thoughts. They dont care about functionality and contribution to the real story.<br/><br/>And what about that 'real story'?
No idea.
I really have no idea what this story is about. Two artists are trying to make it in Hollywood while struggling in a relationship?
OK. That is not a story. Thats a mood-board<br/><br/>What did I like then? The production design. Color is very consistent and secluded locations etc add to the alienation as metafor for the inner of the.....pffff...<br/><br/>I love Lynch to do that brilliantly in Mullholland Drive (understatement)<br/><br/>The actors?
Gosling gives exactly what he 'just' has; a kind of vague notion of ""who am I?"" sort of expression. But Stone, she is the talent, she is under-casted in this one. She may not yet use 10% from her reserves.<br/><br/>Music?
A joke.
What idiot ever thought of using a jazz musician as a maincharacter for a musical without jazz music? Anyone?
What a dysfunctional cluster of styles, rithmes, paste's and colours....<br/><br/>No, I don't understand the high rankings.
It is just a mood-board without drama."

Gosling cannot sing and can barely dance. His first solo starts too low for him and to think they had the audacity to consider he was compared to Gene Kelly! As a dancer he's not fit to be mentioned in the same sentence as that extraordinary dancer! Female lead isn't much better.

"3Lina3","4","1","6","25 May 2019"," A story about two mentally ill people
","In short, this movie is another Hollywood echo-chamber. It's saturated with self-references and channeling itself. So out of touch with reality and narcissistic. Quite symptomatic, really. Thank God they gave us a clue in the name of their movie for us to have a grasp what this movie is about just by looking at its name.<br/><br/>The only reason these two (mentally ill, dissociated) characters fell in love with each other in the first place is because they realized this is what they had in common (mental illness and dissociation). So why the hell not be like this together? Better than to go through life alone with such misery anyway. Other than that, these two characters are stripped of any personality. To be fair, many classics of musicals this movie was trying hard to channel are guilty of that.<br/><br/>Just like in many musicals/romantic comedies/Hollywood tropes, these two people were thrown out at each other artificially. Let me get this straight, I don't know any woman who would memorize a guy like Sebastian and believe they're meant to be together despite the fact that all she knows about him is that once he showed her middle finger and was shaking his head at her in a car and later he shoved her aside while she was trying to compliment his piano play. It just doesn't work like that.<br/><br/>It was good at mechanistically channeling musicals and Hollywood, but it was doing so unenthusiastically. I know that musical movies tend to have lack of good singing because they usually take famous actors with little to no musical background to play. But in this case, maybe the film could benefit from better singing and dancing if the script and idea were so bad. And no, Sebastian, you're not playing jazz. You're just playing one mediocre pop song that is styled as vintage.<br/><br/>Big theme of this movie is ''follow your dreams'' which almost always happens to be a dream of making it in the entertainment industry for some reason. As if people who watch this can't dream of something other than that. It's interesting that many Hollywood and Disney movies have been having this clich√© theme throughout decades. Big question: why?<br/><br/>I kind of get it why many people received this movie well and believed all the hype and that it deserved Oscars. One of the reasons is, of course, because they just eat whatever is being fed to them by Hollywood and mainstream all the time. Another one is that large portion of society lives in this la la land. In our capitalist society people are alienated from reality and they live in a fantasy major corporations create for them to escape. They also dream about mythical love and having a dream-like career. Even their dreams are not something they created. I'm saying all that because I recommend you to read Zizek's review of La La Land."
"MartinHafer","7","1","6","11 November 2018"," A nice experiment...though I wasn't exactly captivated by it.
","""La La Land"" made quite a splash after it debuted. It's now on IMDB's Top 250 and received 6 Oscars! But, with all that publicity, it might just leave you feeling like me...that's it is a decent film, but hardly a great film.<br/><br/>The story is of two struggling artists...one an actress (Emma Stone) and another a jazz musician (Ryan Gosling). Each appears ready to give up their beloved craft after years of disappointments and bills....and that is when they both meet and fall in love. Ultimately, however, their careers DO take off and this leads you to wonder if they can make it TOGETHER. After all, being a famous actress or musician isn't exactly part-time work!<br/><br/>In many ways, this film reminds me of the ending in ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"". This sort of downbeat ending didn't really bother me...it was realistic. But somehow ""La La Land"" muddled it all up...and left you with a confusing ending that PROBABLY was like ""Umbrellas""...but maybe wasn't. I found this to be a huge problem. Aside from this, I also was not a huge fan of the characters...though I must admit it DID leave me misty-eyed more than a few times.

We got movies like 'Doctor Strange', 'Deadpool', and other better movies, but this? This is the very definition of 'Trying too hard to be another movie'. In this case, the movie tries to be 'Singin' in the Rain', 'The Sound of Music', 'West Side Story', and 'Brigadoon', but instead is those movies all rolled into one lousy crap pile. <br/><br/>This is the 21st Century, and they overhyped the movie with jazz music. I'm not a big fan of jazz music, and after meeting Sebastian, who for some reason thinks no one listens to jazz anymore, I probably never will be. What an idiot. I haven't felt hate towards a main protagonist in such a way since Ragnar Lothbrok of the dreaded 'Vikings(2013)' <br/><br/>-10 out of 10 stars from me, 'La La Land'. You smell. Bad."

","They say a great work of art makes you feel something. Still, I'm not convinced this is what they had in mind. Because this movie... this movie...<br/><br/>It's about Hollywood. And it's about music. And art. And dreams. And about chasing all of those. It's set in the modern times, oddly enough, yet its style and way of talking, way of experiencing, is straight from the olden times. It's Hollywood nostalgia at its finest. From the big showstopper musical numbers to its characters and stereotypes and stories.<br/><br/>And I love it. Both the main characters, with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling giving career-defining performances. Their romance, their differences, their passions, all of them exhilarating, and you could spend decades strolling down the streets and boulevards, singing songs in smoky clubs, basking in the sun that shines just for them.<br/><br/>And I hate it. For every musical piece of genius, there's a number that makes me feel manipulated. For every moment of such beauty that it makes me tremble and wish to be a better poet to express it properly, there's a moment when you want to take the movie by the throat and demand what's wrong with it, why is it they way it is. Why does it insist on dragging itself down with its melancholy and forced realism.<br/><br/>On and on it goes and by the end I was left exhausted by conflicting emotions. With such minor changes I could have had a movie that would have inspired me for years to come. Yet what I hate about the film also makes it stronger. Because what I hate are not flaws but differing ideals. Because while this film is all about Hollywood nostalgia and dreams, it's also about that which was always left outside when talking about those things. And that's not something I can argue against.<br/><br/>So here's to the dreamers. But also those that wake up in the morning. Those that fail. Those that don't achieve their dreams. And here's to those that keep on dreaming."

It didn't happen.<br/><br/>Basically a romance, the story was passable. Ryan Gosling's character being a jazz zealot ass-wipe made him difficult to like. It fell into a massive hole about two-thirds in where the audience drifted off. The ending? Well it was just awful.<br/><br/>The singing was very average. Neither Gosling or Stone have great singing voices.<br/><br/>The music, which, let's face it, is quite important in a musical, was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>I loved the dancing, the locations, the use of vivid colors and many other things but these weren't enough to offset the lackluster music and singing<br/><br/>The people watched this film may not have seen the classic musicals from decades ago.

It seems to be a musical calculated to attract millennials who have never heard of ""Singing in the Rain"" or any of the other great musical films that ostensibly inspired this one. I have read so much about what a wonderful musical this is but I thought the music was tepid. The songs did not do anything to elaborate on the story or move it forward at key pivot points, which I always thought was an essential hallmark of the musical. I found Emma Stone to be a truly awful singer. Ryan Gosling was only a little better. I also found their personal chemistry to be lacking--I never believed in the relationship that the two characters were having. <br/><br/>They made such a big deal about jazz in this film but I think all the music was original, no nod to even a single jazz classic, and it was jazz written by pop music composers. Like, ""Oh, let's have a trumpet solo here. That will make it sound like jazz."" Also, I feel like a musical should be a rom-com and not have a bittersweet ending that makes your wife cry. And that ending...it seems like anything that was important happened in that ""five years later"" period that they jumped over.

It told the story of the two main characters: Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), and Mia (Emma Stone).<br/><br/>The director took two actors who didn't sing or dance, and made them sing and dance, and they were fantastic. The story was incredible and unpredictable. I never knew what was going to happen. The director understands that film is show, not tell, and he did it so well. The movie was the perfect length. The scenes flowed. The music fit in and enhanced the story. The opening scene set the feeling of the movie so well. <br/><br/>For the most part, the issues that I had didn't take away from the movie, save one major problem that, for me, keeps it from being a 10.

Aside from the fact that the Gosling-Stone combo is golden, and individually they are brilliant, I had the recommendation from Stateside. I am biased, in that I very much admire Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, and I love all things Los Angeles and oldy-worldy Hollywood, but someone told me before I went that LLL isn't set in the Golden Age of Hollywood ‚Äì the 1940s ‚Äì its set in modern day Hollyweird. Shocker! What did this mean? From the opening scene, I had a stupid grin on my face, and it only left when I was crying. Such is the emotional roller-coaster of this film. It is the golden years of Hollywood because it transports you to another world, where singing and dancing are normal and love is forever and two people are star-crossed to be together, and it's sunny and people wear bright colours and pretty dresses, and proper suits still. It's a Hollywood where Gosling and Stone shine, and are playing characters that seem so natural to them, the fact that Ryan had to learn to play piano like that for the film defies belief. It's a beautiful film, a love song to Los Angeles, but also a stark portrait of Hollywood as well; the competition, the broken dreams, the fakery, the traffic jams, and the disappointment.<br/><br/>Two wannabes ‚Äì Stone, an aspiring actress, and Gosling, an aspiring jazz musician meet by chance and are wildly unsuitable for each other. But it works. Both are smitten, and motivated to chase the other, and each pushes the other with their dreams. It is beautiful, endearing, but also gut wrenchingly sad and challenging. These people knew exactly what they wanted from life and they bared all (figuratively) and went for it. What is in my life that is like that? What dreams do I have, did I have? I thought about it for days afterwards, that and the beautiful and haunting musical refrain.<br/><br/>The music is wonderful, John Legend¬Ö is a Legend and seeing him in the film was icing on the cake, and Gosling's piano playing is just beautiful. The sets and locations, whether the back lot at Universal or whichever Studio it was, The Griffith Observatory, or out on the road, were all perfect and costume, and Direction, all the ducks were lined up in a row to be brilliant. So many homages to past Hollywood films, little in jokes, which I didn't get but read about, so much depth, and twists¬Ö for once a Hollywood film without a Hollywood ending, but it was more Hollywood because of that. I loved it. I get why some people didn't, those without the childlike suspension of disbelief and inability to see fantasy and imagine another world, or see metaphor; seems you either adore it or say ""Meh!"" I'm not sure it is worthy of all the Oscar nods, if I'm being honest. Yes, it was dancing and singing and fantasy and real life and Hollywood and period and modern and all things to all Los Angeles, but it wasn't taxing or a stretch for these actors. But perhaps it was the nod to things past, the feelings it engendered, the emotional roller-coaster, what films are meant to be about, the story within the story within the film, the film as story and as narration, which makes it more than the sum of its parts, and the bareness and frankness of the characters. I think it is one of those films that will be studied, to peel back the onion layers of Director Damien Chazelle's vision. Go see for yourself."

","I have never liked musical movies, and I do not bother watching them. There are just not my type.When La La Land first came out, I did not have any intention in watching it. However, when I saw the rating of this movie which is quite high for this kind of movies as well as the long list of nominations and awards, I was motivated to watch it. I was never disappointed. I know this is not the best musical or romance movie out there, but I need to be fair. They did a great job combining romance, comedy and music in a wonderful simple story. It does not have to be complicated to be good. <br/><br/>I would say that La La Land was great move because not only the romance/drama, music and comedy was good, but the story itself was simple enough to feel how realistic it is. I never felt once that during the movie that Rayan and Emma were acting. It felt like I am watching a real life drama except for the musical parts. There is no overacting or overreacting to given situations. The story simply felt real and that is why I think people love it."
"jpatrick-68632","7","1","6","9 February 2017"," One for the Romantics
","We went and saw La La Land as a baby step on the long road to recovery following 'the Incident'. A journey starts with a single step. Unless you are driving. Although most folk walk to a car.... But what if that initial walk is away from your destination? I don't know. I don't care. Just put it in for the pedants.<br/><br/>The movie is about a struggling jazz musician. No surprises there. Is there any other kind? The only surprise is that he doesn't seem to be a smack freak. He plays Christmas music in a place where he has to give himself tips. He is unhappy. Fortunately the Gozza has a permanent preternaturally bleak look about him.<br/><br/>There is also a struggling actress, played by the Stoner who is good at crying and this is fortunate because her life as a struggling actress is as potholed as a Port Moresby road. Mebbe they've improved. Dunno.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a big production number that is reminiscent of a Pepsi max ad with bucket loads of young, wild (yet oddly responsible) young people dancing and singing and generally making the best of a bad situation. In my experience, both as an observer and an historical actual young person, this just doesn't happen without alcohol and drugs and almost always ends badly with one vomit-filled shoe, bruises, and no underwear. I hate Pepsi Max ads and their ilk.<br/><br/>Anyway they meet and there are production numbers and jazz concerts and auditions and successes and failures before they both became wildly successful. Most of the music was unfamiliar to me. I did recognise A-Ha and Flock of Seagulls but they were peripheral. I am not proud of this.<br/><br/>They fall in love. Those who wish to see MacGuffies will be disappointed.<br/><br/>There are lot of flash backs and these had me for one confused, presenting alternate endings and suchlike. If you nod off, you'll go insane with an absolute hydra of possibility.<br/><br/>But we did enjoy the music and had I been a toe-tapper, these mini digits would've been tapping out a machine-gun beat.<br/><br/>There is dancing too, but Fred'n Ginger expectations will be dashed against the rocks of despair. Still, they are better'n me although I have a hip flexor injury, and am off the turps.<br/><br/>We walked out thinking that it hadn't been a waste of a seniors discount. The in-laws were sitting next to us, and they liked it too, I think. Not the best movie we have seen. But far fromma worst. One for the romantics. You know who you are."

","La La Land. What can I say? Well, first off, let's make it abundantly clear to EVERYONE that I do NOT LIKE musicals. Hate them. There is one exception, Grease...and maybe The Rocky Horror Picture Show...cause I liked the songs. I only went to see La La Land cause it won a heap of awards and has been nominated for everything so I figured it cant be all that bad... The first 10 minutes for me was Painful, very Painful...did I mention I Don't LIKE MUSICALS? I hate that random song and dance, it just doesn't make sense to me... So I sat there in the theatre watching this painful singing and dancing by random strangers and then Emma Stone showed up. I like Emma Stone. She does that slightly quirky/confused thing really well and she's pretty. Then she started singing...umm Emma you are definitely an actor, but then she started dancing, OK, not too bad, this girl can move. Then Ryan Gosling showed up. I love you Ryan Gosling. I am sure there is nothing that you can do wrong. WRONG. Ryan Gosling is okay with the dancing but please Ryan, do NOT sing, ever again. E.V.E.R. After lots of gazing into each other's eyes Emma and Ryan formed a connection. I would like that connection with Ryan. He's good at that I-think-I'm-falling-in-love-with-you gazing thing. So slowly I started to relax and start enjoying the film. The singing got better (Emma, NOT Ryan...) and the dancing was great. The old time romance was lovely to watch. This film had a great story line. Two wanna-be's in Los Angeles, who meet, fall in love, but ultimately just want to ""make it"" in Hollywood. That is their goal. They just happen to have bumped into each other in the meantime. It was only in the last 15 minutes of the film that I decided that I LIKED the film. It is one film that I can confidently say actually doesn't leave anything ""hanging"". You don't walk out of the film thinking ""but what happened with....bla bla bla"". All lose ends get tied up and not that many films manage to do that these days. So that is why I liked the film - because it all made sense. Yes it was set up as an old fashioned musical with some mobile phone text messages thrown in (yes, those mobile phones reminded you that you weren't watching an OLD film) and the film I thought was very arty too with lighting and scenery. I'm glad that I saw it and you should probably see it too. You can probably wait for it on DVD or TV, as it's a musical folks and I Don't LIKE MUSICALS!!"
"fadoo14","7","1","6","7 February 2017"," It lacked authenticity despite the good ending **Spoilers**
","In the last couple of years there had been attempts to make movies that pay homage to cinema and film making, like ""The Artist"" and ""Hugo"". Both movies had what La La Land lacked which is an original script and story. Throughout watching La La Land I couldn't help but feeling that the film maker is forcing himself to make a classic like singin in the rain. Nevertheless there were glimpses in the movie that tried to show originality like when Mia tries to talk to Seb the second time they meet and he just rushes out of the bar but these were only glimpses until the very end of the movie where the last half an hour showed the movie's real potential. The whole notion of dreams vs reality and relationships vs passion and self fulfilling careers is very interesting despite the fact the in our current time for a lot of people choosing between passion and relationships is even a luxury not many people posses. Emma Stone performance was brilliant, the music and songs were beautiful in addition to excellent cinematography but this is not a film worthy of being labeled a masterpiece."
"chrstphrtully","8","1","6","6 February 2017"," Suit the Production Scale to the Script, the Script to the Production Scale
","""La La Land"" is Damien Chazelle's second major feature, following ""Whiplash"" two years ago. The earlier release helped define Chazelle's cinematic signature: a love of jazz; highly kinetic cinematography; a fondness for chiaroscuro shots; sharp editing; and tightly focused character relationships. ""La La Land"" expands this signature somewhat, adding a broader color palette, and accentuating the kinetic visuals with fine (and believable) choreography. In doing so, he's created a fine-looking and charming musical . . . so why does it feel like something is missing?<br/><br/>The story (written by Chazelle) deals with the relationship between a struggling actress (Emma Stone) and a talented but rigidly principled jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) as it develops over a year. Stone's character deals with rejection, while Gosling is tempted with compromised success with the band of a mainstream colleague (John Legend). The relationship between the two evolves believably for the most part, thanks to very good performances from Gosling and (especially) Stone, and largely believable dialogue between them. The songs by Justin Hurwitz, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul range from the serviceable to the very good (""City of Stars"" and ""Audition"" in particular). The dance numbers are also a lot of fun, especially the opener on a freeway and the duet between Stone and Gosling on Mulholland Drive. In fact, the latter dance number is particularly good, because we're not watching life-trained dancers performing a dazzling and intricate routine; instead, we're watching two people in character dancing because they simply have no other way of expressing how they feel at that moment. The steps may be simpler (though skillfully performed), but the latter type of number is for me much more personal and impactful than the former.<br/><br/>Chazelle's penchant for striking visuals is also on display here, utilizing more potent color contrasts than were utilized in ""Whiplash,"" but still effectively using the shadows, editing, and movement to keep the viewer engaged. Perhaps the most remarkable sequences comes near the end, in which most of the key scenes are flashed back with certain elements changed, in a way that plays like a character's fleeting fantasy. This scene is so well shot, directed and edited, that it could almost stand on its own as a short film.<br/><br/>So why does it feel like something is missing? I think the problem lies in the fact in the fact that Chazelle's view as a director is broader than the confines of his script. While the visuals and the size of the cast are expansive, seeming to take in large swaths of Los Angeles, the script more or less limits itself exclusively to the relationship between Gosling and Stone. Although others do occasionally drift in, they're given very little to do, save provide expository dialogue -- e.g., Gosling's sister (Rosemary DeWitt) has one scene to establish herself as the practical one of the family to balance out her dreamer brother, then effectively disappears. This approach worked on a more narrow dramatic scale in ""Whiplash"" -- which relied upon the triangulated relationship between Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, and Paul Reiser -- such a narrow character focus makes the canvas feel somewhat empty here. Whether that is by design is not really clear, but it does make one feel that Chazelle was so thrilled with the Gosling-Stone relationship, that he forgot that the people around them should have more than one dimension, lest they come off more as props than characters.<br/><br/>Is this problem fatal -- no. ""La La Land"" is still a fun, well-edited, choreographed and directed musical with two very good lead performances. Had Chazelle better scaled the production to the script, or vice-versa, however, it could have been something even more remarkable."

","Here's a confession: I am a somewhat nostalgic person. When I hear a tune by Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra, I think to myself: what happened to this kind of uplifting, well-made, wonderful music? The same goes for musicals. The pure, uncomplicated joy expressed by the classic Hollywood musicals seems to be a thing of the past. It was an expression of postwar optimism, when people yearned for escapist entertainment. In the cinema, all they wanted to see and hear were nice-sounding tunes, dazzling choreographies, colourful set designs, and happily smiling characters. Later on, as society changed, the social dramas, the war movies and the psychological thrillers made the musicals look a bit silly.<br/><br/>The musical didn't really die, but the happy-go-lucky feeling of those classic Hollywood musicals did. Recreating it seemed impossible. Until La La Land came along.<br/><br/>The film captures a spirit of carefree optimism that nobody expects in 2017. The title, the cinematography, the boy-meets-girl-story, the Tinseltown setting, the references to classic films: it all fits perfectly together. In this sense, La La Land is a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is just that: a modern-day recreation of the classic Hollywood musical. It's good, really enjoyable and fun to watch, but it's not monumental, thought-provoking or deeply emotional. I enjoyed watching it, but the hype in the media and the record number of award nominations are perhaps a bit overdone."

","I am not a lover of musicals. I have seen and studied the origins of film musicals, so perhaps it is more accurate for me to say that I do not enjoy the 'cheesy' utopian tone which many musicals tend to adopt. La La Land was spectacular, and fought off any potential 'cheesiness' with showing the reality behind the Hollywood dream. It did begin with a musical number which I thoroughly enjoyed, and I believed that the characters breaking into song was so cohesive because it was written into the narrative in such a naturalistic way. Emma Stone's performance was thrilling, she is an actress of amazing talent and I believe she far outshined Ryan Gosling's performance in this film (perhaps he acts better when he is in slower moving and more emotional films). The choreography and cinematography worked hand in hand and I thoroughly enjoyed this fresh breath of air in the film musical genre.

It indeed had a lot of performed songs, and it had the jazz; but that's not what a musical is supposed to be, not at all.<br/><br/>A musical is supposed to tell the story through the music itself, and in La La Land, the music itself didn't tell the story, which is what a musical does: it tells the story through the music.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that it's a great movie, but I felt cheated and it disappointed me because I wanted to watch a musical in the likes of Chicago, Dreamgirls and Hairspray.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch a movie that used the music as the means to tell the story."

Behold the story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who is a musician who dreams of reclaiming the soul of jazz and opening his own club, and Mia (Emma Stone) who is a diner clerk who dreams of becoming a successful actress, Historia may be simple and clich√©, it's the kind of things we're already tired of seeing in the movies, but we've never seen it that way, you can believe, it's been many years since we've seen something with such flawless direction when la land, It starts simple, it's usually simple, but at one point it completely flushes out of the clich√©, comes to life, drives, enchants and surprises, and not in the most dangerous of moments - the ending - it disappoints, its conclusion is perfect, beautiful and memorable. It is very clich√© to make a movie about love, novelty is always the way to treat this love, and here we see something completely different, we have a message that goes against all the standard of Hollywood, we have a moral where it says love Is not always above everything, we can give it up to pursue our dreams, but that does not mean that we will stop loving, for even renegade, impossible and depreciated, love never dies with time. Technically La Land is perfect, it would be a complete exaggeration to say that it is the best photograph of the cinema, but it was the best I saw on the cinema screen, its lighting is out of series, the way light is thrown from one side To symbolize loneliness, love, anger and fear, even to highlight the unique moment of a character or to reflect the green of hope in Emma Stone's face in the dining room, we can understand the whole movie only by Its lighting, all its counter-planes are brilliant, and all the scenes in sequences plans - they are not few - they are perfect and completely enthralling, worth a highlight for the first scene of the movie, after watching this scene, you will make a point of paying another Ticket, I'll leave here my thanks, to the cinematographer of this film, linus sandgren. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are completely out of character, given to roles and with an impressive chemistry the couple loves everyone, not only with their dances and kisses, but in their ways of looking, behaving, mania and malice, was very well deserved His nominations to Oscar, and Damien Chazelle, is already next to Denis Villeneuve, as the names of the new generation of directors, even try only 3 movies in his cinematography, Damien surprises and shocks everyone again, before with whiplash, now with La la land, his films are exciting, dark, cheerful and simply sensational.

","It was a dark Monday night in January and so I went to the movies. This is the film of the moment so I went to try it, without too much idea of what I might see. I saw it described as a musical. I wouldn't call it that - it's a romance with some music and dancing in it and a little touch of fantasy. The two leads were unknown to me, so I was coming to them fresh. I liked Ryan Gosling; he played his character cool and understated - just right, I thought. As for Emma Stone, what can I say about this young lady? She is not ""conventionally"" beautiful but she has what I would call an ""interesting"" face. Every emotion she feels registers on her face and in her lovely eyes. She comes across as elegant and stylish - she had me hooked on her from the start. She wants to be a movie actress and he wants to own his own jazz club. It is a struggle but they both make it in the end. What makes this film great is that five years later she comes back with her husband and little child. A conventional romance would have seen them finish with each other but this film has the courage to show that you don't necessarily end up with someone you love. That is true in real life. She and her husband see Sebastien in his jazz club and the memory is triggered. They both wonder how things would have gone if they had married each other. When I got home I was in bed quite a while before I slept. Even after I slept, I dreamt. In my dreams I saw scenes from the film and I also saw the face of the girl I loved 20 years ago. I don't know where she is now but she helped make my life better. There are people you never forget. So to everyone who made this film - the director, the screenwriter, the cinematographer, the composer and above all the two stars I say thank you. This is why I love music and dancing and films. This film touched my heart because it reminded me of the happiest time in my own life. This is why the arts are an essential part of human life. Will it do well at the Oscars?

","With a soundtrack composed of marvelous contemporary jazz tunes, along with traditional classics of the genre (as well as a few familiar 1980s songs, to boot), terrific acting, singing and dancing performances, ""La La Land"" is not only one of the best films of 2016, but is the leading contender for a sack full of Academy Awards and an experience that will no doubt leave one with a tear in their eye and a giddy, silly smile after it's all over.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Damien Chazelle (""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" ""Whiplash""), the movie hearkens back to the days of the big, bold, extravagant Hollywood musicals by Busby Berkeley, Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire and others, but adds enough of a modern touch with a sweet love story and extremely attractive leads (Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone) that even jaded 21st century audiences will stand and cheer at its conclusion. No stranger to the musical format, having directed both ""Whiplash"" and ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,"" and a jazz percussionist himself, Chazelle captures the mood perfectly as Sebastian (Gosling, ""The Big Short,"" ""The Nice Guys"") is a down-on-his-luck pianist who loves free jazz (even at the expense of a paying gig tinkling out Christmas tunes), and Mia (Stone, ""Birdman,"" ""Battle Of the Sexes""), a put-upon Starbuck's employee and aspiring actress who meet not-so-cute in stifling Los Angeles traffic. <br/><br/>Since they are immediately repelled and repulsed by one another, we know of course they will eventually fall in love. After going through growing pains in their relationship (she has to drop a decent, but boring beau, Finn Wittrock, ""The Big Short"") in the process, while his as awkward as a middle schooler on his first date.<br/><br/>Later, Sebastian, who dreams of owning his own nightclub, is invited to join a contemporary jazz combo, Messenger, fronted by pop musician John Legend, while Mia writes her own one-woman play based upon her childhood in Arizona (where Stone was actually born).<br/><br/>The stress of these divergent careers (he is always on the road, she pines for him, but has her own life to lead), however, takes its toll on the love affair and soon becomes the conflict that sets up the third act. Will Sebastian become a success and get his own establishment? Will Mia make it big as an actress? <br/><br/>Well, the viewer will just have to see for themselves, but for this scribbler, ""La La Land"" was a wonderfully exhilarating homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood, but one which does not gloss over the seedier side of the city as well a realistic look at what it takes to put everything on the line for a shot at a few minutes in the spotlight. Some of the more amazing sequences include the rousing opening number (""Another Day In the Sun""), in which dozens of singers and dancers stop LA traffic - literally; Mia puts her heart into her auditions, only to have them interrupted or cut short, losing their effectiveness; Sebastian and Mia dance through space at the Griffith Park Observatory; he plays to a sellout crowd as a member of Legend's bland, but successful band; and a beautiful concluding montage which shows how different things could have been (or does it show how things REALLY were? Hmmm ...).<br/><br/>Gosling, who earned an Oscar nomination for 2006's ""Half-Nelson,"" is sweet and engaging here as the passionate pianist who is obsessed with the traditional performers, so much so that he ignored the musical genre's future potential with a whole new generation of fans. He won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy and is a lock for a second Academy Award nomination. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, I dare say that Stone, whose turn as the self-destructive daughter in ""Birdman"" a few years ago earned her first Oscar nod, was never better and has a Golden Globe herself to prove it. With large blue eyes flashing with both inner joy and heart-aching pathos, it would be a major crime if she is also not recognized by the Academy. <br/><br/>Good supporting work is added by Legend, Tom Everett Scott (""That Thing You Do"") and J.K. Simmons (Oscar winner for ""Whiplash""), but this enterprise belongs to Gosling and Stone almost 100 percent, and their argument scene is one of the more emotional moments of any film this year.<br/><br/>With fun, thoughtful and clever tunes (including ""City Of Stars,"" ""Someone In the Crowd,"" ""A Lovely Night,"" ""Start a Fire,"" and ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" among others), terrific design detail (David Wasco, a Quentin Tarantino favorite) and stunning cinematography by Linus Sandgren (""Joy,"" ""American Hustle""), ""La La Land"" is a dazzling, dizzying, exhilarating experience and would seemingly be the picture to beat unless the Academy wants to send a diversity message and choose ""Moonlight"" or vote for the heavily dramatic ""Manchester By the Sea.""<br/><br/>If I had a ballot, though, I might just choose this film to become the first musical since ""Chicago"" in 2002 to claim the Best Picture statuette, but, then again, no one has yet extended that privilege to me, so I will just have to dream, won't I?

","I regard myself as a musical sceptic. I have never understood the old school Hollywood musicals. In the wonderful opening sequence on the jammed highway, I first thought that I am really going to hate this,no, no, no, please stay inside the cars like the normal people. And then, magic! The movie totally won me over. To be honest, there were slow moments and the quick changes between styles got me a bit confused in the beginning. I had time to think that maybe they should have hired Justin Timberlake because he can sing and dance and why Ryan Gosling's hair is greasy. But don't worry, Ryan Gosling is perfect for the role. In the end, you will agree. I loved the careful details such as the huge poster of Ingrid Bergman and the references to Casablanca, the greatest and saddest love story of all time. Music score was absolutely great. What makes this movie greater than a basic feel good movie, is that the love story and the main characters' development and ambitions are more important than their immediate feelings. Young people were happy and laughing when the movie ended whereas I cried melancholic but sweet tears. This was a beautiful and surprising movie that had one of the greatest endings since Casablanca. I warmly recommend the movie for all movie lovers, including notorious musical sceptics."

","Who didn't once had the dream of becoming a movie star or a famous musician, even if you only got the tree part in your school play or can't even play triangle, you have already at least thought about what your life would be like if you were famous? I bet you did. This movie's about this universal dream, played by two individuals who have enough talent and guts to persuade it, and they happen to follow in love with each other. The rest is art, the movie itself is a masterpiece, the colors, the tunes, the choreography, it's like watching a movie in Technicolor just amazing. It reminded a lot of the Wizard of Oz. The final scene, I think will be forever stuck in my mind as one of the best endings I have ever seen. Why did I give it a 9? Well, their connection isn't perfect... Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great actors but something is missing. Lacks chemistry, both play their parts masterfully nevertheless they don't get well together, they just seem a very unlikely couple. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, cinema, dreams and everything in between."

It seems it was not, according to other reviewers but it was not that important. What was important was to make a film about the La La Land so people understand how actually it is difficult to make it there. I think this film makes a good case about all of that. <br/><br/>Dancing and singing not in the rain but on the Californian sunshine is excellent and anyone who wants to see a musical should like this film. It was like watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers again in some futuristic remake. So for the sake of relaxation and good mood go and see this film."

","I am not a fan of musicals for two reasons 1 I don't find them realistic and 2 I don't like that the plot gets second and the songs first. So going to watch this movie i was psychologically prepared that i wouldn't like it, but I absolutely loved it. I liked the sense it left you that dreams do come true if you stick to them. I liked the sense of love, not as something possessive but to lead the other to get as high as he/she can get. I liked the songs that were there helping the plot to rise and not to hide it under the music. In the beginning of the film I was shocked, i almost started to grieve for the money I gave, because it brought to me bad memories of the bad musicals of 60's, though while it kept on it got me in a magical world which had sadness but still dreams could come true. On the actors, their chemistry was like amazing, and they could make you feel what thy felt. I never appreciated gosling so much but through his latest works he has proved me wrong and Emma stone, i think her to be one of the very best as she has the talent and the movement, the voice and the right choices. The director was as expected amazing I expected nothing less than magical from him, I particularly liked that he gave his musical a social aspect which is really impressive. He made his move something other than a passatempo, he made it actually matter. Also I must refer to the photography, the scenes and the costumes. usually we don't see so bright colours in the cinema and there is a reason for that but these guys really made it work. Amazing All in all I think that this is a movie everyone can and should watch, I recommend it."

","First of all I hate musicals. I really do. By my opinion movies should be just about acting. Singing just makes them look ridiculous. But that's my personal opinion and if you share my view than this review might be useful for you.<br/><br/>To be honest the only reason why I went to see this movie is the fact that I have a cinema season ticket. I didn't have any expectations and maybe that's main part of the reason why I really liked it. There is not that much singing and even when actors sing it blends nicely to the plot ‚Äì it just doesn't look silly. Also the soundtrack is amazing. Basically it's just one melody throughout the whole movie but its very catchy and you will end up humming the tune for the rest of the day.<br/><br/>But back to the movie. It's a love story. It's not original but still quite nice and it has the potential to raise emotions. I enjoyed it and I was really surprised how much entertaining it was. Also the acting is actually very good. Especially the parts where the actor is trying to be an actor. She is very convincing.<br/><br/>This is only third movie of the director but when you take in mind that it was directed by the same person who created Whiplash and 10 Cloverfield Lane than you must know that it will be good as I enjoyed both his previous movies a lot.<br/><br/>So in short. This movie is worth your time. Pure entertainment. But be aware that the ending might surprise you."

","Damien Chazelle is a fantastic writer and director. Chazelle has made two major movies that I know about, Whiplash and La La Land, both of these movies are absolutely fantastic, and I'll definitely be looking forward to what Damien Chazelle does next.<br/><br/>La La Land is a good film, but I won't be adding it to my favorite 2016 movies list. However, I would watch this thing again because I liked it. I enjoyed a lot of what this movie had to offer, but I just felt like some things fell short, and it didn't reach its full potential.<br/><br/>La La Land: Pros & Cons<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's performance was good. <br/><br/>Emma Stone's performance was good.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's & Emma Stone's on-screen chemistry was sensational.<br/><br/>The movie was charming. <br/><br/>The directing was masterfully crafted. <br/><br/>The color scheme was vibrant. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the old school film vibe and I thought it blended well with its modern setting. <br/><br/>The dance numbers were spectacularly choreographed. <br/><br/>A majority of the songs were pleasant, touching, and poignant (Audition: The Fools Who Dream & The ending were the most poignant moments in the film). <br/><br/>Another Day of Sun, Audition: The Fools Who Dream, and The Ending were my favorite dance numbers and scenes.<br/><br/>Life is difficult, it's not easy to accomplish your goals, and it's particularly difficult to accomplish things when the people around you are mostly intransigent.<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>There were one too many coincidences throughout the film. <br/><br/>I felt like some scenes were just set-up to bring certain circumstances into play. <br/><br/>Certain direction or execution of scene choices felt clich√©d. <br/><br/>There wasn't an exfoliating emphasis on the two main characters. <br/><br/>I knew what was to be expected before the film ended.<br/><br/>Particular moments during certain scenes felt obligatory.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed La La Land for what it was. It's a musical, but it's also about never giving up on yourself. We all have dreams and goals, sometimes are dreams can seem overwhelming, but it's important to never lose sight of what we truly want for ourselves, and it's good to have someone that believes in you.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B+"
"fionamatthewsemail","8","1","6","16 December 2016"," A simple love story, beautiful soundtrack and a nod to the 1950's musical
","La La Land is the perfect movie for contemporary society. After the Second World War happy, escapist films became popular, and now with all the current negativity of war in the middle east and terrorism along with our economic woes, La La Land similarly allows us a short respite from reality. The soundtrack is memorable and addictive particularly the music of Justin Hurwitz' City of Stars. It's a simple, familiar and relatable love story intertwined around career dreams. The photography is engaging, while the outdoor locations are familiar yet have a fantasy quality due to the incredible camera work. Colorful costumes add a nostalgic quality appropriated from the 1950's. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are no Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers but the dance sequences are well choreographed to catchy music. The jazz music may also convert naysayers of the music genre. Overall a movie, that will make you laugh, cry and swoon. I hope Damien Chazelle makes more of these types of films. Violent films are pass√©."

","When I was finished watching the first song of the movie, I know I am going to like it.<br/><br/>La La Land made me smile all the way till the end. It is well written, well scored, well directed or should I say choreographed. It was like that Damien Chazelle succeeded to do exactly what he had in mind. I laughed and I sighed like a 14-year-old schoolgirl. I am still hearing those songs as I am writing this 2 hours after I watched it.<br/><br/>The performers have done a great job. I like Emma Stone but was not a fan of Ryan Gosling. Now, I definitely am. Both of them gave a phenomenal performance Everything in this film, it just fits.<br/><br/>But what will sweep you off your feet are the songs, 2 songs in particular. ""City of Stars"" and ""Fools who dream"". For me, these two are going to be the top two songs in the playlist.<br/><br/>I will recommend it to all of them who liked Whiplash, those who love musicals and even those who would want to watch just a romantic flick."
"phd_travel","8","1","6","8 December 2016"," An enchanting step in the right direction
","In some ways this is a lovely movie with a wonderful homage to old Hollywood musicals and a romantic if slightly derivative and simplistic main musical theme. <br/><br/>The cinematography is nostalgic and the musical numbers are for the most part quite good. I liked them except for the Glee like freeway opening number. Generally they were not over done. Less is more. The romantic Observatory number is a standout.<br/><br/>The story of a the different careers of music and acting pulling them apart is a familiar one. The modern twist is the poignant ending and what if flashback. They could have made things work if she had just gone back to him after her movie. A happy ending would have been too old fashioned I guess. But the story is a bit of a downer.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling - kudos to him for singing and dancing. Not many successful screen actors of his generation are capable of it. He doesn't have a Broadway caliber voice by any means or snappiness in his dancing but it doesn't matter - it's his screen presence that brings in the crowds. Emma Stone is slim and dances satisfactorily - her voice is acceptable if not that lovely. There are too many closeups of her face. Her face isn't really beautiful. The two performances aren't as high a standard as those of the multi talented MGM stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood - those who could actually sing dance and act. They don't dance for very long.<br/><br/>It's just so good that movie makers of this generation are trying to do this type of musical on screen again - maybe it will pave the way for some successful Broadway actors and actresses to get big screen roles they deserve. The broader audience has missed out on a lot of fine talent the last couple of decades. If only the music was more sophisticated and better written."
"trublu215","2","1","6","3 December 2016"," An Exercise in Classical Hollywood Filmmaking
","La La Land, the wildly beloved Oscar frontrunner, is just as mystifying as critics and audiences said it was. The sweeping cinematography, the perfect, strategically placed lighting, the performances, the dance numbers...it all makes La La Land exactly what people were NOT expecting out of 21st century musical. This is a mystifying burst of classical Hollywood filmmaking. To that effect, there is nothing new rather just a new voice to an old dialog. <br/><br/>Directed by Damien Chazzelle, La La Land is an analytical odyssey of the price of fame as told through the eyes of two big dreamers, an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) and a struggling Jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) as they coast through life in Los Angeles. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are fantastic in this film. Emma Stone gives a career best performance and seems to be riding the same prestigious wave she caught with 2014's Birdman. Gosling is equally great but we've come to expect this type of performance from him. The charismatic dreamer with a golden tongue fits Gosling a little too well at this point even if he does it better than any other working actor in Hollywood. While the film is well acted and the choreography in the dance numbers are mesmerizing, La La Land is still a hard film to recommend to anyone not already gung ho for musicals<br/><br/>Despite being toted as the best film of the year, La La Land is exceptionally underwritten. Trading great storytelling for grand musical numbers that are expertly planned and executed, Damien Chazzelle knows the film's strengths and weaknesses. While he plays off of the film's strengths in an expert fashion, he does very little to cover up the film's number one weakness: its script. However, despite this being a weakness, Chazzelle does a wonderful job at making us forget the problems and sinks us into enjoying the film for what its worth.<br/><br/>Overall, La La Land is most certainly an ambitious yet flawed musical from Damien Chazzelle which proves that Whiplash was far from a fluke. Featuring a career best performance from Emma Stone and brilliant camera work along with excellent choreography in its musical numbers, La La Land is a film that will most certainly leave you feeling satisfied even if it doesn't hold the lasting power of Whiplash."
"mifsjolly","5","1","7","16 December 2019"," Boring, Cringy, NOPE
","My partner and I really tried to watch this movie even though we do not watch musicals really. 1 hour into the movie and we definitely had enough and switched to another movie as it just was way too boring - I just could not feel during this movie, whether joy, sadness nor love really. The musical parts were so cringy making us feel very uncomfy and we ended up skipping those parts.<br/><br/>I was honestly looking forward for this movie but this was a bloody disappointment."
"ejoyp","2","1","7","18 November 2019"," I guess I just don't get it...
","I finally broke down and watched this movie. I am a huge fan of the movie musical, and I understood what they were trying to get at with this thing, but it was just such a mess.<br/><br/>I don't ever think I've finished watching a musical and felt blah. As the end credits rolled, I had to think, ""that's it? What was the point of all that? To depress the hell out of me?""<br/><br/>Where did the love between these two characters go? To achieve their dreams, they were rendered completely incompatible. Who was the other dude? Why did she marry him? Did she really love him? Was it necessary for her to become a stuck up starlette? Was that what she really wanted in the end-to forget about everything and everyone who helped get her there? Are we supposed to glean that this nice girl from Nevada wanted to get famous and finally have the license to feel above it all?<br/><br/>If that was the upshot of the whole thing, I think they missed the point of the movie musical. I'll go back to ""Singing in the Rain,"" where sacrificing your scruples and personality after you ""make it big,"" was generally frowned upon.<br/><br/>It's weird that the image of her success was a look of abject horror when she realized she was entering the club of someone she purportedly cared and loved but apparently had done little to keep in touch with, or care what he was up to over the last five years...seeing as he was the one who basically enabled her success. Strange that her success is demonstrated in the film by showing her flake out on a friend's performance in a play because she didn't want to sit in LA traffic. Was I supposed to like her in the end? Feel happy for her stardom?<br/><br/>When we see Gosling in the end, he has everything he wanted, yet when he sees Stone's character he seems wracked with sadness and longing for a person who apparently didn't yearn or care as much as he did. At the end, the characters seem to say through their expressions, ""well hey, at least we're successful..."" but was that really enough?<br/><br/>So I guess what this movie taught me was that all Hollywood and its inhabitants can hope to aspire to, is a jovial facade to mask a yawning emptiness below the surface. And if that was the point all along, then I suppose the movie musicals that I love are a thing of the past, and that's a shame."

","This movie has some fantastic shots in it, and it manages to bring some of the amazement you can get from watching an actual musical live. The songs are mostly not that memorable, but they're always welcome when they come. They're also spaced out in an interesting way, fitting with the emotional flow of the movie. The actors do a terrific job playing their parts.<br/><br/>Even though I can easily get caught in nostalgia, I am also quite wary of it. This movie delves in it, but luckily it does in a way that feels thought through, and in the end it seems like it comes to terms with the fact that the present ain't so bad either. You can try to recreate the past, or you can bring the positive aspects of the past with you as you head into the future. To me, the latter is the most appealing, and it's how I felt this movie handled it.<br/><br/>All of that said, the movie never excels. It's a nice musical with great acting, impressive shots and a nice setting - and it deserves praise for all of those things. The complete package works nicely, but it it's no great loss to miss out on this movie."

","I loved the leads, but was sadly disappointed in the film. The songs were just okay - nothing to write home about. The dancing was just okay. The singing was awful. The whole time I kept thinking - this will pick up and get better in a little while. It never did. It was 2 hours and 8 minutes. That's way too long for a musical with such a weak script and mediocre songs. The film was about two people who want to be in the entertainment business who meet and have a connection (after about three tries). <br/><br/>I was looking so forward to seeing this and maybe I built it up too much in my mind and by ALL the hype at awards time. I just felt let down in the end and thought ""that's 2:08 hours of my life I'll never get back."" If you want to see it, rent it at Redbox.<br/><br/>I realize this was not supposed to be a musical done by professional singers and dancers, but I go to the movies to be WOWED, not put to sleep. I guess this movie really meant something to people in the industry and about their struggles in making it big, but I am not one of those people. I go to the movies to escape reality, not be a part of it. Hollywood should stop making movies about itself. It's only interesting to those IN the industry, not outside it."

","La La Land is pure entertainment. ""I am not a fan of musicals,"" is a mantra of mine, and while I did not exactly have a Damascene conversion here, I was drawn in by the sincerity of the mission, the scale of the production, and most of all, by Emma Stone's moving, complex performance. Her comedy is spot on in the auditions where she is given some wonderfully awful line readings. But the next moment she is brittle and vulnerable, and the switch and range is quite brilliant. Gosling struggles to match her, achieving pass marks rather than a gold-star performance. The ending is a masterclass in visual storytelling, an extended sequence that plays out without dialogue and will resonate with anyone who has wondered about two diverging paths in a forest, and what lay down the one we chose not to take. La La Land is escapism, Hollywood fairy-tale at its best. The clue is in the title, of course. Give yourself over to it, and you will not be disappointed."

But the movie was the important thing in that hall. After a while there was a scene from ""Rebel Without A Cause"" (1955).

","I was sceptical going into this film, however Damien Chazelle's La La Land earned a historic 14 Oscar nominations as well as winning all seven Golden Globes that it was nominated for. <br/><br/>The film opens with an array of Crayola-like colours in a busy Los Angeles traffic jam and already the cinematography is breathtaking. This opening sequence is a perfect example of what Hollywood can do on the big screen without the visual aid of superheroes, big car crashes and all the other CGI nonsense used to break box offices these days. The picture is a throwback to MGM musicals with a modern twist - after all, it has been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It is the perfect mixture of cheesy musical and a US take on French new wave, if you could even imagine of such a thing - but it works, excellently. Chazelle has become the master of making retro, feel new. <br/><br/>We've been here before with Hollywood, trying to resurrect the bygone genre of musicals on the big screen. Many failures have been and gone; Scorsese's New York New York in 1981 didn't quite reach the heights of the Manhattan skyline that it was set in with viewers, whilst Woody Allen's 1996 Everyone Says I Love You didn't really take off, described as a ""Allen's frightened worldview is finally given full exposure, and it is a grisly thing to behold"" by film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.<br/><br/>The film follows the tough relationship between Seb, a struggling musician who finds hope in all things Jazz, and Mia, an aspiring actress looking to get her career kick started. What I liked about La La Land was how ""rea""l it was - it wasn't ruined with CGI effects, unrealistic plot lines or an array of visual steroids. Yes, I know - it is a musical, but Chazelle has done a great job at making it feel oh so real. A close up of a cracked iphone screen, not exactly the textbook example of product placement, but something we can all (especially myself) can relate to at one point or another. Even the way in which Seb and Mia first meet - this is not your typical love story. Seb is playing the piano in a sophisticated restaurant in LA, only to go against his bosses demands as he plays some of the finest Jazz I've ever heard. As Mia goes to congratulate Seb, he simply barges right through her, as if she was not there.<br/><br/>As much as I can sit here and praise Damien Chazelle for days on end, a lot of the films charm lies with the two leads. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone possess the chemistry and charisma that can really make a film. La La Land is the pair's third film together, and they simply just work whilst sharing the screen. The two are not the greatest singers or dancers to have graced the screen, but they have so much fun in doing so - which makes it all the more fun to watch. Stone has never been better, she fits the role down to a T, so hats off to the casting, even if she was the second choice for the role behind Emma Watson. <br/><br/>The film is about personal drive as opposed to a love story - professional success is the aim, and if you need to break a few hearts in the process then so be it. Nonetheless, this film is made with charm, and although we're only in January, I'm not confident a film will beat for the remainder of the year."

","""La La Land"" is exactly what its whimsical and upbeat title would entail: a masterfully directed, wonderfully delightful, visually vibrant, and painstakingly realistic musical. The film's tremendous success and acclaim may leave some disappointed that are expecting the next great genre film. Although this film is not excellent, it certainly sings a catchy memorable tune.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films I have seen that made me wish people could just randomly break out into a synchronized song and dance. The music is perfect for the magical vibrancy of the dance sequences. The director, Damien Chazelle, was definitely Oscar worthy especially by mimicking Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's tracking shots in ""Birdman"" and ""The Revenant"" -- tracking shots done right are always deserving of an Oscar. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone together create a convincing romance full of humor, hope, charm, and blistering sadness. The most surprising thing about ""La La Land"" is its handling of themes such as dreams vs. reality, and how much it takes to chase those dreams. The filmmakers were not afraid to take risks with the story. Those risks paid off because the movie was bitterly realistic when it could have easily been clich√©. The only problem with the film is that it took awhile for any kind of conflict/drama to emerge resulting in a semi dragged out narrative.<br/><br/>For me, ""La La Land"" was as good as a musical could have been (musicals are my least favorite genre). I enjoyed it for what it was, and it was definitely deserving of those fourteen Oscar nominations, and six wins. It's really the only film that actually made me want to start singing and dancing at the end of it. Too bad it got Steve Harvey'd."

These scenes take you back to the great musicals of yesteryear.<br/><br/>However, the music wasn't memorable, and the singing was mediocre. I know the lack of great singing was intentional, but I have yet to hear a valid reason as to why it actually makes the movie better. Great singing can really elevate a musical. The story was pretty weak and the characterizations one dimensional, even for a musical.<br/><br/>And lastly, that bittersweet finale, just didn't make sense and was forced. <br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>It goes like this:<br/><br/>Mia: I love you Seb, you are the love of my life.<br/><br/>See: I love you too, Mia.<br/><br/>Mia: Seb, I have to go Paris for a few months for a job.<br/><br/>See: Really? Goodbye, have a nice life.<br/><br/>Then apparently, neither one gives a rat's ass about the other to keep in touch, and although living in the same city make no effort to get back in contact. So, after five years she sees him in a club, and we are supposed to get all misty eyed? Just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>Anyway, the movie has some great scenes, but not enough tying those scenes together to make it a great film."

"tlooknbill","7","1","7","16 February 2017"," Should be titled after the hit song ""City Of Stars"" since that's all they played.
","Don't get me wrong I really liked this movie but it's not as brilliant as it's been hyped. I'm not a big fan of musicals. Just wanted to see the results from Ryan Gosling teaching himself to play improvisational jazz piano and I wasn't disappointed. He was brilliant. So brilliant that they didn't give him enough material to do his skills justice. I mean how many times can you play ""City Of Stars""? Jeez Louise, give it a rest will ya'?! I was getting sick of hearing it and I love that song! <br/><br/>I didn't care to compare this to 60 year old musicals, but I do remember them having more than one hit song like ""Singing In The Rain"" and ""West Side Story"". Even ""Camelot"" has a treasure trove of memorable songs if not hits. Oh, and don't forget ""The Sound Of Music"". Did I say I wasn't a big fan of musicals? OK, I kinda' miss their innocent charm, set design, ambiance and poetic improvisational expressionism through dance and song.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" touches upon these attributes with gorgeous photography, but it becomes pretty obvious the filmmakers were paying homage to musicals of decades past that it seemed to overshadow the motivation of the actors in how they were telling a more modernized story about following one's dreams no matter the cost. Pretty clich√©d plot but that's what most musicals were built on anyway. Keep it simple.<br/><br/>I did like the naturally relaxed delivery of Ryan and Emma's dancing and singing. Frankly, Emma's facial emoting on screen was more believable and gut wrenching than Barbara Streisand's ""Funny Girl"" or any other actor in a musical for that matter. And Emma can really belt it out with the best of them.<br/><br/>And Ryan's singing style reminded me of the ""Velvet Fog"" Mel Torme. Just wanted to hear more of his jazz improvisational piano that shines in the Christmas holiday scene in the restaurant. It was amazing!"
"jacobhunt6","Null","1","7","6 February 2017"," Spellbinding, and totally unique
","Film buffs and critics always talk about a film ""bringing something new to its genre"". This is why we look down upon clich√© and repetitive plots - we want something NEW and INTERESTING. And this movie, ladies and gentlemen, was EXACTLY what we are always on about. La La Land is utterly incredible. At times it seems almost experimental - the unique and unusual angles, plot devices and shots that the director had the audacity to take had me leaning forward in my seat, in complete disbelief at what I was seeing. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's chemistry was just INCREDIBLE, and the ending was truly heartbreaking. It was moments such as the tap dance number in the middle of the street, the shared flashback at the film's conclusion and the amazing floating dance scene that made this film what it was - different, something never seen before, and something utterly incredible. In my mind, it deserves every single one of the 14 nominations it has received. My only minuscule criticism is that perhaps the songs were not quite memorable enough. A few of them have already slipped my mind - but the better songs were, on the contrary, fantastic and beautiful. This film is just incredible. A story told from a unique and imaginative perspective, and one told with such passion and creativity that it stands out in my mind as perhaps one of the most filmically creative pieces of all time."

","Good music, good cinematography, good choreography, good acting.. What can I say that hasn't been said already? I think this is one of the better modern musicals, and I'm not a big fan of the genre. The way this movie is done is what really makes it good. There are many excellent long scenes. Someone will start dancing and the entire lighting of the set will change and the camera will move into close-up, to medium, to panorama and to close-up again in the same take. That's pretty impressive.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the visuals. The blue and purple night skies are stunning and they did a good job with the timing so you could get those nice skies in the background. One of the best things about it is how the characters describe Jazz music. That was very well written. You understand perfectly why Jazz can mean so much to someone. There's a portion in the movie that drags a bit and loses some pace. And there were some moments I thought were repetitive. But, otherwise I had a good time with it. There's good comedy here too and I thought the mix of classic and modern cinema made this movie pretty great.<br/><br/>I get why this has gotten so many awards, and it will deserve some of them. But, I do think ""Silence"" could have gotten at least one more nomination."

","La La Land is a story of what goes everyday in people who wants to fulfill their dreams in show business, what is the core of Los Angeles. For the ones who works on the movies business, La La Land surely have a special meaning and most will identify them selves in at least one part of it. The movie is getting better and better thru it and it ends in a spectacular way. When it finishes you keep it in your memory for a long time. Making a musical nowadays is a huge risk but it works very well here. The music is great and some of the songs will be classics. The actors did a great job (even John Legend!!). Nothing spectacular, just clean performances given what it need it. It would be a classic for the future. Well done!"

It's none of that. It is a movie with a story and in the middle some people dance and sing.<br/><br/>It's a nostalgic look at our past, why we did it and whom we should say thanks for being there for us, but we don't because the present is our life..<br/><br/>Great jazz for people that like it (I'm no fan) and a great story of dreams being the pursued in LA Land.<br/><br/>If you don't go waiting for a classical you will like this movie."
"cool-as-ever-85","8","1","7","26 January 2017"," La La Land sums up lives of millennials
","Career and aspirations have higher priority than love, that is how most of the millennial think. Drive to achieve dreams takes over anything and everything in life. In the process of doing so important people helping you succeed are left behind. Only when you reflect back after achieving success, you feel the void left your life.<br/><br/>Something similar happens with Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). She wants to become an actress and He wants to revive Jazz by opening his own bar that plays Jazz. Sebastian to earn livelihood and to save enough money starts playing in a band. Mia doesn't like that as she thinks that he is living a false life. At the same time she is losing all hopes of making it as an actress. Sebastian for his empathetic nature and love for Mia makes sure that she takes her last chance at the making as an actress.<br/><br/>To make it big in their lives they move on separate paths and at the end of the movie their paths intersect, where both had achieved their dreams. Pain can be seen in eyes of both as both had made it big but without each other and it is evident that has left a big void in their hearts. The end of the movie brings you back to reality and makes you think twice whether there are ways to achieve your dreams by still being with the love of your life. For few who have experienced some thing similar, end of the movie is an emotional ride. I personally liked the movie for its music, all the love and bite of reality.<br/><br/>Emma Stone will surely get Oscar for her performance. Ryan Gosling better luck next time."
"leftbanker-1","8","1","7","16 January 2017"," Charming as can be, visually stunning, but falls flat musically
","This movie is so sweet that it's almost impossible to criticize. With that said I felt that the music fell well below the standards of the rest of the elements of the film. Even when simply lumped with other film scores La La Land doesn't rate very high and alongside musicals it fares rather poorly. There is nothing approaching a show-stopper and the background score is repetitive and facile yet these musical weaklings are meant to propel us through long swaths of the narrative. I would say the same thing about the dancing; it's cute but not compelling enough to fill a scene. Perhaps at 2 two hours and eight minutes they were being overly-ambitious.<br/><br/>At their best the song numbers were pastiches of Irving Berlin. The thing is, if you can't write a song half as good as Cheek to Cheek then just steal a song.<br/><br/>This reminded so much of El Otro Lado de la Cama (2002) by Emilio Mart√≠nez-L√°zaro and written by David Serrano, although the Spanish film lacked the productions values of La La Land. <br/><br/>The idea was cute enough and she seems like a nice enough kid but Emma Stone really doesn't have what it takes to pull off an old fashioned solo shot in close-up. Who does, really? And once again, the song just wasn't remarkable on any level. The idea was cute enough.<br/><br/>The seven note phase of the theme song‚Äîas well as the rest of it‚Äîjust didn't cut it for me and by the final scene I was completely sick of it. And no one would have clapped at the end of his lame piano recital‚Äîpeople who like jazz know good music. <br/><br/>There was some memorable dialogue that was fighting in a higher weight class than the music. ""Hollywood worships everything but respects nothing."" The story was as predictable as anyone would/could imagine: boy meets girl, the share their dreams and fall in love, dreams don't go according to plan, boy says nasty things to girl, et cetera. I didn't expect much more but I expected just a tiny bit more. Their break up scene was maudlin and derivative‚Äîat best‚Äîand on top of that he burned dinner.<br/><br/>The photography was wonderful at every step and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce must be positively thrilled. The city has never looked better in any film that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>So when I have so many problems big problems with a film why would I give it eight stars? I have at least as many reasons to love the movie as I have criticisms. First of all, as I stated above, it is super sweet. Any movie that doesn't give a starring role to a gun is OK in my book. The next important thing is that I love jazz."
"Padreviews","7","1","7","12 January 2017"," 7/10 Homage to Hollywood ...city of stars
","It's easy to see why this so popular with Hollywood it about The Hollywood dream . What better way to express that than in a musical. I'll be honest I love the genre , musicals dominate my top ten films of all time . They encompass pure escapism , romance , and put a smile on your face throughout and maybe the odd tear too . Best of all you can watch them over and over again :) <br/><br/>How did this this perform as a musical ? Poorly to be honest , yes there's romance , yes there's escapism , but the smiles were sadly missing . Undoubtedly you'll fall in love with Emma Stone , Ryan Gosling's performance however was substandard in comparison , you never really felt his character had true ' I would die for you ' passion for Mia . <br/><br/>I loved the homage to Hollywood however , particularly the mash up of Ricks bar in Casablanca throughout . The whole premise of a musical is mad people don't generally break into song and dance in the street but when they do in this movie they're able to do it tongue in cheek and with humour recognising how bizarre their actions are , I loved the use of spotlighting in musical sequences , just wish there were more musical numbers and maybe a few full cast dance numbers , the opening sequence gave you a feeling you were in for a traditional musical with a touch of Mamma Mia popularity but it never transpired . <br/><br/>On the negative side the movie did try and tick too many boxes and could have benefited from better script editing and adhering to a true romantic story line but perhaps that was its aim , like the breakaway from traditional jazz there's an attempt to break away from the traditional musical . <br/><br/>The overall theme was that fantasy is better than reality and this was enhanced by the closing scene . Life is so much better in La La Land :) <br/><br/>There were a couple of musical numbers you won't be able to get out of your head , I liked the film , just wish I could have loved it , I ought to want to see it again but I'm not bothered and that's where it failed on the whole . <br/><br/>Here's to those who dream <br/><br/>Pad.A"
"Pheeke","7","1","7","11 January 2017"," Very Good Movie, But Beware of the Hype
","First and foremost, don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, I just didn't love it as much as many other people. I went to a special event of this movie because I wanted to see it as soon as I could. I heard the most wonderful things about it. And it didn't really live up to the hype for me.<br/><br/>The movie is about two dreamers living in LA chasing their career dreams. Emma Stone's character Mia wants to become an actress and Ryan Goslings character Sebastian wants to open his own jazz bar. Soon they fall in love.<br/><br/>I have to say, the movie looks breathtaking. You can really feel that they live in LA, the spirit of the city of angels is tangible. Every part of this film is colorful and bright and sunny. Every shot is like a well composed painting. The costumes and make-up is wonderful, makes the movie feel a bit retro. At first I thought the movie was set in the 50's but it's present day. But I didn't really mind because the characters themselves are quite nostalgic.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing, I loved the characters. Their chemistry felt really natural. However I didn't really like their vocal talents actually. Apart from John Legend's of course. The music was fine, though not as great as I hoped it would be. Some of the songs bored me a little bit after a while. The opening song was fantastic.<br/><br/>The story was a bit up and down for me. I loved the first part, it also had the best songs and dance routines. The second halve of the movie lagged a bit for me. It was also somewhat predictable. The characters didn't seem to develop much further. I really relate to the theme of the movie. I myself am an aspiring artist (I'm a drawer) and I'm trying to find my way in visual development and storyboarding for movies. So I know what it's like to hope for your big break and getting the door slammed in your face. Therefore at some points I wished they focused more on that and less on the romantic plot. Not because I don't like romantic movies (I do) but because the romantic plot wasn't really something new, I have seen that movie many times. The other storyline, about young artist chasing their dreams in LA was much more refreshing. The ending didn't really do it for me, it was as if they were doubting themselves. As if they weren't sure how to end it.<br/><br/>So yes, like anyone will tell you, this movie is great. But don't expect too much, like I did. I thought this was going to be the best movie of the year for me, and it wasn't. If I hadn't heard about all the hype before I would have been pleasantly surprised, but as it is, it was just a good film. Go see it."
"meissotruey","5","1","8","22 December 2019"," Good shooting, acting, music and jokes, but where is the actual movie?
","It is too long, too simple, too boring. When i look at beautiful frame, i still want to see not a beautiful frame, but beautiful movie. You've had actors, idea, what's wrong with you? When music off, and we don't have stupid useless frames and walks movie becomes quite good, i'd rather watched movie about the story of these two charming characters without unsuitable music here and there. Moreover it is good written story, but it is destroyed by the musical idea, it is just not working, cause movie not made well. Like, you can compare this movie to Disney's High Scholl and La La Land can't match as musical, although it is better in a lot of details. It is so weird, like, how can't you understand that if you movie consists of brief narration and banal songs(good but banal), not working on narration, then the outcome gonna be bad? Before this movie i watched Coco, and i can declare that Oscars just prooved its trash value."
"TreyTrey418","9","1","8","12 April 2017"," I absolutely loved this movie!
","I could talk about this film all day. I saw it 3 times in the movie theatre and I can not wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD/BluRay. I connected with the characters and the story so much! I took one of my best friends to go see it, and he even said he teared up a bit and connected with it just as much as I did. We both saw ourselves in the characters. This movie is not a Love story. I like to think of it as a Passion story. Sebastian and Mia love each other, of course, but it is so much more than that! They have a real passion for each other. They have a passion for what they want to do, and they have passion for what the other one wants to do as well. They push each other and support each other. Sebastian truly believes in Mia and her talent, and Mia feels the same for him. That is why she is so confused when he has the money to start his club but continues to play music that he doesn't particularly like just because it makes him good money. He took that gig for her, but in the end she just wanted him to be happy pursuing his real dream, the jazz club. They had something even deeper than love. From experience, I have been in love, but I have also felt, and still feel, something even more than love for someone. It's a feeling that is so strong that there are literally no words for it. That is what I feel Sebastian and Mia had. In the end, Mia is married with a daughter. She is happy, and even in love. But, when she sees Sebastian again, that deeper feeling returns. They are happy for each other because they each made their dreams come true. They broke up, not selfishly for themselves, but for the other. They sacrificed their relationship so the other one could succeed and focus on what they needed to do. I could go on and on, and I would love to, but the overall theme that I feel this movie has is Passion. Life may seem like a dream sometimes, but there is a harsh reality to it as well. Sacrifices need to be made, but passion is what will keep you strong and moving forward. This film is great for anyone. It talks about love, dreams, fighting for your dreams, struggle, strength, and passion. The cinematography, the acting, the directing, all of it is just incredible to me. Even the title is perfect for so many reasons."
"nonfictionc","9","1","8","1 March 2017"," Through moving music and excellent acting, this movie tells a compelling story of real life that is sure to appeal to all audiences.
","When people think of movie musicals, they associate the genre with older people or musical theater lovers. To many kids and young teenagers, movie musicals are boring and do not compare with the modern high action thrillers or clich√© romantic comedies. On the other hand, some hardcore musical fanatics may criticize movie musicals because they are no match to the original Broadway musicals performed live in the flesh. However, LaLa Land directed and written by Damien Chazelle is an original, not based off of any existing musical performed live on a stage. Therefore, the movie can not be compared to any other version. With high appraise from movie critics, nominations for several awards, and attention from many music lovers, there is no surprise that majority expect the film to be adapted from the big screen to the stage. However, some people believe that this credit is not all that deserving and the film is rather over exaggerated. Although seen by many as overrated, Damien Chazelle's LaLa Land relates the audience to the hardships of love, careers, dreams, and friendships through award winning music and brilliant acting, making the movie musical one of the most deserving films of appraise.<br/><br/>One of the aspects that makes this film great, is its ability to relate to a wide audience of all ages who have experienced the ups and downs that life has to offer. Chazelle creates a story and characters that are just like us, who have dreams and aspirations to achieve. Sebastian, a passionate jazz musician, and Mia, a struggling actress hoping to make a break in the Hollywood industry, both chase their own dreams while struggling to tie in a relationship. Normally, in a clich√© typical Hollywood ending, the guy would get the girl, and each person will eventually fulfill their bucket list of dreams. However, this movie musical gives the hard truth of reality, that life does not always work out the Hollywood way. The story line is tragic yet phenomenal and both characters in the movie learn that even in Los Angeles, the heart and center of Hollywood, their happy ending would take sacrifices of love and dreams. Choices have to be made all the time in life, and like Sebastian and Mia, sometimes we just have to decide which roads to take. Where these roads take us is unknown but we have to be willing to take a chance on our dreams. This movie is all about taking chances and the great possibilities that come from risks and sacrifices.<br/><br/>People who love music, know how something as simple as a song or tune can transform the entire experience of watching a movie when the music is put together with a visual image. In LaLa Land the movie would be nothing without the music, considering it is in fact a musical. However, it is not that often people come across a movie musical soundtrack where each song is catchy, original, and meaningful with its lyrics. Justin Hurwitz, the music composer for the film, captures the mood of every scene with a song. Whether the scene was an upbeat dance, a slow waltz, an argument, a magical fantasy, or a walk in the park at night, there was a perfect song for it. Jazz also plays a major part in the music as well as in the plot. Sebastian has a true passion for real, pure jazz. Throughout the movie he thinks this style of music is dying and convinces Mia, as well as the audience, of the importance and beauty of the traditional genre. Even if you do not find the rhythm of jazz entertaining, hearing the soundtrack and Sebastian's take on the art form may just change your mind. Nevertheless, regardless of your preference on jazz, there is still something for everyone in the music soundtrack for LaLa Land. <br/><br/>With Ryan Gosling playing Sebastian as the lead male role, and Emma Stone as Mia for his scene partner, brilliant acting is inevitable. Both are very successful actors with already big names in the Hollywood industry. Many know Ryan Gosling for his lead role in ""The Notebook"" while Emma Stone has captured many lead roles in several popular movies such as ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" and ""The Help."" They also have evident on scene chemistry because they previously acted together in the movie ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" in 2011. Furthermore, these actors are both nominated for the Golden Globes under the best actor and actress category. They had to sing, dance, and act, as well as learn how to play the piano, which is not all easy tasks to perform. Nevertheless, they pulled it off and created the characters of Mia and Sebastian that the audience will love and connect to on an emotional level. <br/><br/>Before turning away from LaLa Land because movie musicals are not your preferred genre, I encourage you to give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed. Through moving music and excellent acting, this movie tells a compelling story of real life that is sure to appeal to all audiences. With numerous awards and nominations, as well as positive critiques, I doubt you will find LaLa Land to be ""overrated,"" but rather worthy of all its praise."

Mister Damien Chazelle you directed this with class and respect and it shows with every shot, ever line and every scene I was blessed to lay my eyes on. Mister Linus Sandgren, your work as cinematographer is jaw dropping to say the least, I should know, I spent half the time with my mouth wide open, the other 40% was spent shaking my head in disbelief and the last 10% had me with my head on the table trying to figure out how I will ever be able to even come close to the techniques you used in this film.

It is not merely reflecting on the classic musicals, but updating it for today's world. The musical numbers are also outstanding, City of Stars being a particularly heartwarming song. <br/><br/>The final act did stumble a but, for me. It spends so much time developing Sebastian and Mia's relationship in great detail for the majority of the movie, that in the end it is as if they felt under pressure to wrap things up fast. The ending itself is a well executed one, but I will admit I felt underwhelmed by it, I was expecting something a lot bigger that could compete with what we had seen with the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>The highlight has o be the undeniable chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. They have worked together numerous times before that it seems almost effortless for them to perform with one another at this stage. This is very effective for an audience, watching two people simply enjoying being in each other's company. They chronicle the numerous different phases of these characters relationship brilliantly, portraying the emotions they are undergoing in each moment. <br/><br/>It is original, but it does not try too hard to be, it simply wants to tell a story about two people trying to conquer their dreams.

","If you are looking for a classical well packaged musical, La La land is ready to satisfy your search, and even if you are not a great fan of musicals, La La land may appeal to you, too. The story is the classical story of a boy and a girl looking for artistic success and falling in love, with all the difficulties that the opposition between success and love bring about, and with a finale which is not that predictable. What is appealing indeed is not the story in itself, but the way it is shot and performed. Shooting is flawless, music is entertaining but never obtrusive or boring, dances and songs are enjoyable and charming, the overall atmosphere is full of charm and soul. And the two protagonists make a difference: Ryan Gosling does a truly excellent job, offering a thorough performance, playing the piano, singing and dancing very well, and showing a very good and convincing chemistry with Emma Stone, who offers a talented performance, too. The final result is that of a solid, charming and well made musical, a perfect execution by the young Chazelle, who proves to be a very promising director."

An ever-present current of warm piano gave the film a sense of unity that felt reminiscent of Chazelle's prior film, Whiplash. I did not care much for the bland characters and their clich√© plights, but Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were not the central characters of this film...the sets, the music, and Los Angeles were the focus. Over time, my affinity for the film has dwindled, but that does not discredit the pleasure I had in watching it for the first time.

I would recommend this movie to anyone especially if they were into Jazz or musical type of movies. It almost sorta of reminded me of growing back in the day and watching High Scholl Musical or even watching Grease. Last but certainly not least I didn't know that Emma and Ryan can hold a tone and also can Ryan play the piano did he have to learn for this part and John Legend being in this movie was the icing on the cake for me."

","I never thought I'd pay to watch a romantic musical, but as I began to listen to jazz I gave it a shot. Movie immediately starts with dancing and singing and so sets the tone for developing romantic narrative. If you're a jazz fan or like it, I'm sure you're going to enjoy La La Land even though plot is very simple and a bit girly. Emma and Ryan delivered good performances (their dancing and singing wasn't that good) but the main reason this movie is so enjoyable are amazingly chosen and arranged filming locations. La La Lands is split into four parts each representing one season (winter, spring, summer, fall); something like in Requiem for a Dream. Each part has its own ambient (coupled with appropriate music) which is made so well that sometimes I almost felt like I was there since those moments evoked some of my romantic experiences.<br/><br/>There's no violence, coursing, drugs, sex and other garbage Hollywood is permeated with nowadays. That's why La La Land can give you that nice feeling of being dragged into another world (into La La Land) like you'd feel when you were a child. It's almost like a fairy-tale. And all that beauty was made with a small budget! <br/><br/>My final recommendation is that you go to see this movie with your partner or date. Trust me, that will add even more to an already amazing movie."

","As a film, ""La La Land"" does a lot of things right, but as a musical, it does a lot of things not so right. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is undeniable, and the story that is told between the two is very well done. The jazz score of this movie is absolutely fantastic, and does the movie a great service. Ryan Gosling's piano playing bits are honestly amazing, and his character is fleshed out very well, as is Emma Stone's. However, Emma Stone's singing sometimes leaves something to be desired, and sometimes the direction of some of the dialogue leads to an occasional drop in the pace of the film. I really wish that some unknown, true musical theatre actors were chosen for this film, rather than famous pretty faces, but that's probably just me. I truly believe that if you stack this film up against other movie musicals, like ""West Side Story"" for instance, it would fall flat on its face. If this film came out, say 20 years ago, it would not be the critical success that it is now. The traditional film elements that ""La La Land"" undertakes are generally very well done, but as a musical, it often fails. 8.2/10"
"chelskimania","8","1","10","30 January 2017"," Fun filled Enjoyment
","I'll start off by saying that I am not the biggest musical fan and as such I went into this movie with a certain amount of trepidation, hoping that the Gosling-Stone combination that we've all enjoyed before would be enough to change my opinion on the genre. I'm happy to say that to a certain extent it did!<br/><br/>I have to admit, the all singing all dancing, over-the-top opening scene did little in the way of settling my initial concerns, but from that point on the film was a delight. Light hearted with two excellent protagonists; on one side you have Sebastian, an aspiring jazz musician looking to revive the romance of ""old style jazz"" while the rest of the music scene moves on. On the other there's Mia, a stereotypical wannabe actress who spends her days as a barista in a LA coffee shop between the hundreds of auditions that she hopes will one day see her ""discovered"".<br/><br/>It's the age-old story of two young, ambitious individuals who are surely bound by fate to end up together, each with their own happy endings? But aside from the basic premise, nothing about this film is typical. The chemistry seen between Gosling and Stone is one that has rarely been seen in recent Hollywood movies; both play off of each other perfectly and if you didn't know better you would truly believe that the two were in fact in a real life relationship. <br/><br/>But despite these two exceptional pieces of acting (which will surely land one of the two an Oscar), the real praise has to land firmly on the shoulders of director, Damien Chazelle, for the way he assembled this movie. For many the prospect of a two hour long musical is the stuff of nightmares, 120 minutes of singing, dancing and jazz hands. But this is a musical like no other that I've seen; each song serves as the perfect accompaniment to the exceptionally written script; each lyric bares significance and the style and the understated manner in which it is all combined works perfectly. It's for this reason that the excellent as they may be performances of Gosling and Stone are left in someways out shined by their director. <br/><br/>A true triumph of musical film that is sure to go down as one of the great pieces of work of our time. Not least because it actually got a musical cynic like me to truly appreciate the genre and even consider a second run-through in as many weeks!"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","10","27 January 2017"," This is going to be a classic
","I have very wide tastes in cinema, but I generally avoid two genres: musicals and horror. However, I was always going to make an exception for ""La La Land"" following the vibes from the festivals and indeed, by the time I caught up with the movie, it had already been nominated for no less than 14 Academy Awards, putting it up there with other record-holders ""All About Eve"" (1950) and ""Titantic"" (1997).<br/><br/>Among massive support, the film has had its critics. OK, the plot and characterisation are slight, but essentially this is a homage to the old-fashioned Hollywood musical and we don't need a complicated narrative or lots of back story. Instead we have gorgeous colours and wonderfully zooming and swirling cinematography with uplifting dance sequences and a memorable soundtrack composed by Justin Hurwitz. OK, I've heard better singing and I've seen better dancing, but Ryan Gosling as Seb and Emma Stone as Mia are playing a jazz pianist and an actress respectively and their singing and dancing is much more than adequate. These are two glorious performances.<br/><br/>Writer and director Damien Chazelle has given us a movie - such a contrast in tone and style from his previous ""Whiplash""- which is destined to be a classic and become a long-running stage show (it is structured into five acts based on the seasons). The vibrant sequence before the title - reminiscent of a scene from ""Fame""- is shown is worth the price of admission alone; musical numbers seemingly shot in a single take hold the attention and bring a smile to the face; a scene where the two leads first hold hands in a cinema is pure romance; the dance sequence in the Griffith Observatory is absolute magic; and the bitter-sweet ending not what I expected but a realistic conclusion to a work that urges us to strive for our dreams whatever the cost.<br/><br/>I just loved this movie and I'm sure I'll see it again and again. Meanwhile I went straight out of the cinema and bought the soundtrack."
"namashi_1","8","1","10","10 December 2016"," An Imperfect Gem!
","Damien Chazelle's 'La La Land' is made with pure ambition & genuine skill. A Romantic-Comedy Drama packaged as a Musical, this recent Oscar Frontrunner is a dazzling watch. <br/><br/>However, Despite its luscious beauty & an extraordinary performance by Emma Stone, the film is somehow fumbles in its later half, that takes away its glory to some part. But, a small glitch doesn't shun away its undeniable merits!<br/><br/>'La La Land' Synopsis: A jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) falls for an aspiring actress (Emma Stone, at her best) in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>'La La Land' is a love-story, that has some of the most beautifully choreographed musical numbers in years. Each & Every song is exquisite & a treat for the eyes. I was awed by the detailing & the overall presentation. Hats off to the team!<br/><br/>And Chazelle's world works, even when its not being a musical. Yes, the love-story between its leading characters is warm & believable. You watch & later explore these two people in love & how their dreams come their ways. 'La La Land' is a love-story for sure, but it also indulges in themes like life itself & how dreams cannot be compromised, even when they damage relationships, at times. Chazelle treats the narrative with realism all through the first-hour.<br/><br/>And that's exactly why the second-hour underwhelms. The addition of a sub-plot (featuring John Legend, who offers Gosling to play with him), is clich√©d & seems out of place for a film, that so beautifully mounts itself on such magic in the first-hour. Chazelle's Screenplay takes risks & adds extravagant musical numbers & drama, & makes them come together, but he seems to have given in to clich√©s & a lackluster middle-point. I wasn't impressed by the sub-plot nor by the difference of opinion the couple get into there after. Chazelle's Screenplay picks up again & the culmination is affecting. How I wish he dared to add something more, rather than adding a turn, we've experienced an umpteen number of times in such stories.<br/><br/>Chazelle's Direction is fantastic & there's no doubt on that. While his Writing lacks perfection, his Direction is superior at all times. 'La La Land' is a visual spectacle with soul & Chazelle's true skill as a storyteller, comes to the front. Surely some Oscar calling awaits him!<br/><br/>Linus Sandgren's Cinematography is top-class. Tom Cross's Editing is terrific. Justin Hurwitz's Score is enchanting. 'La La Land' is a true musical ride, as the songs here are chart-busters! Art & Costume Design are marvelous. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Emma Stone owns 'La La Land', with a career-best performance. Stone, fearless & relentless, emerges a big winner here, delivering a performance that comes straight from the heart. She beautifully conveys her dreams of being an actress, who sadly hasn't gotten a chance to shine & how truly she falls for a man. Stone is faultless & may I say, that she has never looked this gorgeous before. Ryan Gosling, on the other-hand, is nicely understated as the jazz musician, who'd never let his passion be bygone, even though its nearly dead. Gosling expresses with ease & his approach to love, is real. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Stone & Gosling, is infectious! A special mention for J. K. Simmons & Rosemarie DeWitt, who shine in brief roles.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'La La Land' doesn't utilize its potential entirely, but its still a solid effort that shouldn't be missed. Its definitely among the better films we've seen this year & this film deserves to be experienced in the cinemas (I saw it at IMAX & it only heightened the impact). NO where else.<br/><br/>And, I miss you Los Angeles! See you soon!"

"tashlast","2","0","4","29 April 2020"," I tried my best to love this movie.
","I am a huge fan of musicals. Whether they are movies or on Broadway, give me any musical and I'll listen or watch it and about 79% of the time, I will instantly fall in love. Now, this was one of the most anticipated movie musicals to be released since Les Mis, and just as a musical fan, I was jumping up and down for weeks to watch this because of all of the hype around it. I was watching what critics were saying all over, and some were calling this ""The Best Movie Musical of it's time."" I'm not the type of person that allows critics to form a general bias for me. I watch what they say, and go in with my expectations in middle ground. Depending if the film is good or not, my opinion on the movie either increases or drops to the floor.<br/><br/>So what did I think after leaving this movie?<br/><br/>Bored and uninterested to be honest. I really didn't like the first hour of the movie. I wanted to try, but at least with many movie musicals the songs are appropriately placed to progress the plot. The placement of the songs were so random. Like so random that you wouldn't believe. The whole first act it basically goes, mini conversation, then song, then montage. That's basically it.<br/><br/>My second gripe with this movie. The singing. Holy hell. Can I just say, award for highest amount of autotune in a motion picture musical's soundtrack goes to La La Land! The singing, especially at the start sounded so artificial. The ONLY two really well sung songs that are not completely washed with autotune are John Legend's 'Start of Fire' (The only real proper singer in this entire movie who doesn't need auto tune) and the 'City of Stars' duet between Gosling and Stone. Even though it's very clear that those two aren't singers in the slightest, their vocalization there was their best singing in the entire film and I can appreciate that. Also, City of Stars was probably the best song of this movie. Which is kinda ironic since that is the recurring love theme between Mia and Sebastian.<br/><br/>My third gripe with this movie? The plot. Hhhhhh. Basically, to put it short. Girl with big dreams meets guy who also has big dreams. They both hash it out with each other, plan to help each other out, go out on a date (Done through a musical montage), kiss, move in with each other, both are making their dreams come true, things don't go as they wanted it to, their dreams are interfering with their relationship, their careers don't work out, they breakup, girl moves back in with her parents, guy is depressed about blowing it but wants to make it up to her, finds her parents house, guy talks the girl into never giving up on her career, girl goes after her dream again, they say 'I love you,' and years later they are living their lives separately and finding success, and the movie ends with this bizzaro montage of the life they wanted together and movie ends. And that's it fellas! That's it! So another classic Hollywood A meets B story. If they were gonna do this classic reused trope seen thousands of times, they couldn't have twisted it to be something unique? It has all of the hallmarks that make it a musical, but the story was tediously stale. So predictable. It took me about 25 minutes into the movie to predict how the rest of the story went, and it all happened, and I was still bored.<br/><br/>This was considered the 'Greatest Movie Musical of it's time?' I'm sorry, but even as just a movie, this movie was horribly bland.<br/><br/>However, there are a few good things to this movie. That being the lighting in some of the set pieces and settings was beautiful. Some of the most vibrant lighting I've seen for a movie supposed to be homage to the 90's. The directing is amazing and hats off to Damien Chazelle<br/><br/>The acting from Emma Stone was great. Gosling kept that monotonous tone through most of the movie, so I just got bored of his character right away, but he stepped it up towards the end in terms of acting. But their performances were heavily undermined. The best acting moment from the both of them was the table argument by far. And that was the probably the best highlight of this film I could take away from this.<br/><br/>So all in all, this was probably the most over hyped thing I've seen, and it's the most overrated Movie Musical I've seen, when there are much better movie musicals out there. Didn't live up the expectations since it was technically the same generic forced love story.<br/><br/>I'm actually really glad it didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars, and sighed a breath of sweet relief when Moonlight actually won. Because this movie musical is doesn't hold water to the current holder of the Musical Best Picture winner, which is Chicago. It just couldn't be the musical best picture successor. It can't be in there with other leagues of musicals like West Side Story, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, An American in Paris, Oliver, and Chicago.<br/><br/>And as I continued writing this review, the star count went down. I started my rating at a 7 and now I'm settling for 4 stars. Because this is the most forgettable movie musical since BOTH Cats movies. 1998 and 2019. But to be fair, I don't want to compare it to those awful movies, it still way better than both Cats movies in general.<br/><br/>BUT... but, if Broadway ever decided to take this movie to the stage, I think that's worth watching, because I'm always open to Broadway, and I always try to give new shows a shot. And even though I don't like this movie in the slightest, maybe a stage version could make up for it. I don't know. Maybe. And I'll even buy tickets to see it.<br/><br/>My final score is a 4.
Thank you."

Their dreams brought them together and those dreams pushed them away, but what remained were the memories, the innocence, the what-ifs and the love.
Emma Stone is outstanding and direction of Damien Chazelle is praiseworthy, a worthy follow-up to the electric 'Whiplash"". Do watch this one."
"auburnn","6","0","2","24 December 2019"," the making of an american artist
","While presenting the audience with spectacular sceneries, La La Land instills American ideology in them. Enclosing a clich√© chick flick with the form of musical, La La Land, just like its predecessor Whiplash, is essentially about the director Chazelle's perception of the making of an artist.<br/><br/>According to what Chazelle has implies in La La Land, if you want to become an artist in modern America, you have to 1. be talented; 2. chase your dreams; 3. wait to be discovered by discerning art people; 4. enjoy your success as a bourgeois, now that you got everything you wanted. During this process you will be lonely much of the time. Few people in your life would you get along with. They all talk about parties, world politics and business, the things you do not quite care. Art is the only thing you are passionate about. In La La Land, neon lights always surround the leads. Their art, their dream and their love are elevated and glorified through the whole film. Even the whole universe serves as the background for this love. As their lives are filled with philistines, we witness two artist wannabes against the world.<br/><br/>What Chazelle has understood as the making of an artist is fundamentally a clumsy fusion of the myth of great artists and the age-long American dream. In the former talent always triumphs, though the artists are never properly appreciated by their contemporaries. Consider the cases of van Gogh, who cut his whole ear off, and Gauguin, who, according to Maugham, left home for an island to draw inspiration. In the latter hard work is always rewarded well. Chazelle uncritically absorbs the two ways of making an artist, ignoring all logistical loopholes. After all, life and arts are among the few things that could not be made successful simply through hard work.<br/><br/>Convinced by the concept of American dream, Chazelle is an American patriot at heart. He sets his film in Los Angeles, and he alludes to the distinct American classics -- jazz, musicals, and Rebel Without a Cause. As well as elevating the two young artists, Chazelle is also elevating these American cultural icons he loves. The problem is the film implies a problematic understanding of high art, pop culture and sociopolitical context. By making fun of vulgar people, Chazelle categorically dismisses any value of pop hits. But jazz was a treasure for suffering African American people. Musicals appealed to a wide range of audience for its hedonistic qualities. Rebel Without a Cause is a hymn of discontented youths who struggle to find larger significance for their mundane lives. None of these seem to qualify as the kind of high art Chazelle emulates in this film, and Chazelle, a Harvard graduate, fails to understand the campy nature of James Dean's performance that makes Rebel Without a Cause a cult classic of all time. In the end, La La Land is just another film about self-absorbed art people set in Los Angeles. The more it strives for a status of classic, the more it reveals its propagandist nature."

","This film gets off to a relative poor start with an extremely obnoxious dance number that goes on for what seems like an eternity, thus placing the audience in a poor mood to watch the film.<br/><br/>So let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film and would watch it again after fast forwarding the first scene, I think that it is a film that has a simple romance story that is very reminiscent of 500 Days of Summer however it fails to accomplish the themes that 500 Days of Summer exceeds in.<br/><br/>As a result of that I am only giving it a 7/10 also known as a C for average."

","I feel instinctively hostile to this movie. I think there's something rather smug about its attempt to be an homage to the vintage musicals. Now I love the vintage musicals and the idea of reviving them, I really do, but when it's done like this, what I am inclined to call ""oscar bait"", I become very closed to it emotionally.<br/><br/>Certainly it's all very professional. It even has the impressive feat of feeling at once cinematic and capturing that distinct sensation of viewing something live. The musical and dance numbers are radiantly envisioned and realized and I'm sure could be enjoyed again and again, even if the music is mostly just adequate.<br/><br/>The story did not grab me at first. There's something about the the idea of a musical about show biz that I find just redundant; it's a hat on a hat. It's already a MUSICAL so why did you base the plot on this? I know it's a throw back but the plot just feels like a template to jam in those impressive numbers.<br/><br/>I didn't feel vivid characters. I felt the same old meek female, jaded guy pairing we've seen a hundred times before without variation.<br/><br/>I liked the girls walking down the street to the party in their dresses (red, blue , green, yellow respectively; it really works) and I also felt the audition montage was impeccably pulled off. I found the lecture on improvized music more annoying than anything. It's like a joke: if you have to explain why it's so clever it's not funny. Similar principle for music.<br/><br/>I did however warm to the move and its characters about two thirds in when we start to see the more brutal reality behind the romantic front we want to see. The ending may well have you in tears, it's quite something."

My problem with Goslings character comes from him being the stereotypical and unoriginal Jazz Purist with a chip on his shoulder. <br/><br/>What really set me off about this film was the ending sequence. After 5 years going their seperate ways and both being successful, they see each other one night in his club as he's going to take the stage and play. At this point Stone's character has become a movie star and is married with a cute little girl. When Gosling starts playing he plays the song she first heard him play all those years ago starting a dream sequence of what their life would have been like if they stayed together. But not just if they stayed together but if they had the perfect life. Instead of rushing past her in that club and bumping into her as he leaves he instead grabs her and kisses her.

","18 December 2016. La La Land (2016). In a way, La La Land is its own movie genre, a fusion of musical and drama that in just a few places doesn't seem to completely fuse well together as a smooth jazz duet. The few discordant notes arise from its lack of a full range of musical variety as in Moulin Rouge (2001), Chicago (2002), Mama Mia!!! (2008), or even West Side Story (1961). In one place, the music almost becomes repetitively dull and monotonous. In most other places, however, the music is amazingly Broadway of the highest sparkly quality, dazzling in its choreographic display, captivating sound and creative photography in Birdman (2014) style. At a few other places in the movie, the serious prolonged drama comes forth that threatens to crack the musical fantasy mood but holds together. This bold and risky venture manages to reveal the refreshing potential of a newly minted theatrical approach to filmmaking. Even the ending scenes, even though unsettling, offer up a much more mature realistic and surprisingly satisfying musical wrap-up.<br/><br/>The dramatic romantic storyline is suggestive of the trials and tribulations from My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), If Only (2004), Days of Wine and Roses (1962), Roman Holiday (1952), Sliding Doors (1998), Bridges of Madison County (1995), A Man and A Woman (1966), and even Nanny Diaries (2007)."

","One of my favorite movies ever. Utterly enchanting and magical. The ending was perfect and gut-wrenching. Both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling delivered stellar performances, but the star of the show is the song-writing, choreography, and cinematography/camera-work. A story that will leave you pondering about the limits of dreams and the seams of reality, the breaking points in-between, and which sacrifices are worthwhile."

","This is a movie lover's delight. From the opening few frames, you know you're in for something special, and Damien Chazelle's valentine to romantic musicals never falls short of pure delight from beginning to end. It's an ode not so much to Hollywood as much as it's an homage to the fictional world that existed within Hollywood musicals: Where practical details are mostly irrelevant but cynicism is not welcome, reminding movie watchers why they love movies in the first place. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as perfectly matched, with charisma, affection and chemistry galore, perfectly able to give a willing audience the warm and fuzzies as we follow them along their trek to immortalized Hollywood romance. It's really something special to watch, capable of bringing genuine tears of joy over how beautiful and masterful everything is, from frame to frame, scene to scene, interaction to interaction, song to song, etc. Truly a remarkable accomplishment for all involved."

Ryan Gosling is still the one playing the sad note and she gets up to leave with her husband, both her and him look at eachother eyes filled with tears and then she leaves for good... THE END... i absolutely despise this movie right now... now i would never give it a 1 no that's not fair i give it a 3/10 for the sheer star power and colorful sets which was all ultimately ruined by the horrible horrible ending... people don't get that Romance is never about a brainless tragic ending there was also that other dumb movie called ""The Fault in our Stars"" the same issue, it gives you hope then ends it with a middle finger as a gesture La La Land's ending was such a depressing downbeat ending i'm so mad at it right now... writers, you had one job... and you blew it..."

Since I had no alcohol at the time I chose not to suffer and just leave mid way. <br/><br/>I rarely stop watching a movie in the middle, but then again most films, even the poorly written ones, tend to have even a bit of substantial context to them.
In this case I felt like I watched one of those ridiculous Bollywood movies only instead of the occasional ""burst into a dance without any reason"" that happens in Bollywood, here we have a movie that does it through at least the first hour (after which I decided I've seen enough). 
I won't go into detail but I felt like there was no plot to hold on to. I love musical movies but in this case it seemed to me like I was watching a generic pop song with a very shallow meaning. I didn't care about the characters so all these ""magical"" musical scenes seemed meaningless.<br/><br/>I'm happy for anyone who did enjoy it, and did feel immersed in the love of story of the protagonists, but I simply couldn't. 
I am writing this review because I felt it's shameful that this movie deserved an Oscar nomination , but while writing it I realized that if I could care more about the story I'd probably love the film.

No feelings no acting no singing and no dancing - nothing ! Look carefully at their dance - they simply can't and don't dance. Hear carefully their singing - they can't don't really sing. Do you remember any tune from the movie (other the one they keep playing on the radio) or any dance ? This was a clearly PR movie full of buzz and empty inside. I highly recommend avoiding this one.

","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not in the target demographic for 'La La Land (2017)', especially considering that I hold the musical as my least favourite and most cringe-inducing genre by quite a wide margin, but I've always maintained that I will watch almost anything within reason and it's been hard to find anyone - from critics and the academy to general audiences and even those who, much like me, are not typically enamoured by the genre - not singing this nostalgically musical romantic-comedy's praises at the top of their lungs. So, I gritted my teeth as I gave it a watch and I'm glad that, while I can safely say that I wasn't anywhere near as bowled over as most people purport to be, it's actually much better than I was expecting thanks mainly to some superb directing and a mature, layered screenplay. It's clearly at its best when not overtly a musical, the conceivably diegetic song-and-dance routines fit the material much better than the ones clearly abstracted from the predetermined reality (made all the more jarring when overly fantastical elements, such as flying, are tossed into the fray), as it tells a subversive story that slowly creeps away from its romanticised roots and ends on an aptly realistic note with a message that runs counter to most others in the genre. Plus, a couple of the songs are kind of catchy, too. 7/10"

the film doesn't know what tone it wants to go for. From the advertising and the trailers, you would think that this was going to be a happy musical but no it's a drama and not a good one. Despite of it being a drama most of the song in the movie is a very happy tone and once the songs are over the movie instantly goes back into a drama. Because of this the songs of the movie feel out of place. Not to say that the song is not good. They are actually very good, City of stars is the best song in the hole film it's well written and it's the only song in the hole film that fits in with the tone of the film.
So what about the drama if that is the main focus of the film. well, it's not only bad but it's stooped. The characters are always going back and forward of happy song and serious drama which just ruins the drama.
This film would just be alright if the ending was not terrible. does not make sense for the characters to do what they did at the end and nothing else makes sense about it.

In fact, it becomes one big gaping hole which for me was a put off. To my mind, this kind of 'gaps' that lead to a twist cannot be done at the very end in a supposedly romantic movie where the audience invests their feelings into the main protagonists.

Was this done on purpose for some reason? I had to watch my Rogers & Astaire box set after this to balance out the awful dancing of Stone & Gosling.<br/><br/>There were some things I liked - I loved the cinematography and the paintbox of colour throughout the film. It was bright and very American and Hollywood-y. Although this does bring me onto my next criticism - what exactly was the point of this film, other than for Hollywood to just write a massive love letter back to itself?

","We got used to happy endings in love stories. But what Damien Chazalle did in La La Land is breaking these rules.
With all its colours, musicals and actings this movie creats an unexpected world. At first I must say I can't imagine more eligible couple (Ryan Gosling-Emma Stone) for this movie. They suit perfectly for this story. The way Ryan Gosling plays piano is so good that no surprises for he played in a band at his young ages. Also Emma Stone's acting and her voice are lovely so I guess we are all happy for her to win Oscar prize.
The thing makes this story special is the election. Two dreamers in a tale. Is it really possible? Which one do you choose? Your love or your dream? The conflict between them is adapted perfectly into the screen.
There are two scenes make me so emotional (rest of them are peaceful and enjoyable I think). When Mia and her housband enter random place she realises its name is Seb's. Actually Sebastian didn't like this name which is suggested by Mia. Despite this he named it Seb's. It means something, right? The second one is when Sebastian sees Mia in Seb's he plays piano and sings ""City of Stars"". And after that they just smile at each other. That's all. No words, just a smile. And she leaves Seb's. It was an affective scene.
It has been two weeks since I have watched this movie but I still mutter ""City of Stars"". Good cover. I strongly suggest you the ones who haven't seen it yet. It will colour your lives."

","Having seen this a because of its raving critical reviews I found myself leaving the cinema VERY disheartened. <br/><br/>The story started well but got somewhat lost amidst its attempt to uphold its reputation as a musical, and its seemingly convoluted story line. Songs remained forgettable, as the viewer became distracted by one or another on-screen events, such as the starry-night waltz. To me the opening number was seemingly a bit too forced and became more of a light-heartened joke than a hook for the audience. Ryan Goslings singing in some areas was somewhat questionable, whilst Emma Stone's hidden talent was practiced and displayed in a agreeable manner. <br/><br/>However, in comparison with other nominated and critically reviewed films La La Land somewhat struggled to find its feet with me, let alone put on its dancing shoes. Although it was rather nostalgic and visually very beautiful it took several attempts for me to even begin to like the soundtrack let alone tolerate the film. <br/><br/>Although, I did not like the film I personally believe that elements within the film, such as its plot-twist ending, were very well constructed and arguably saved the film... just...<br/><br/>Overall, not a horrendous viewing but perhaps not a film to binge watch repeatedly on rainy days."

Otherwise, although the plot began to grip a little towards the end, it did not seem impressive. Six Oscars, seven Golden Globes ? On second viewing, it gathered pace.

The tagline ""Here¬¥s to the fools who dream"" can¬¥t get any clearer. L.A. might or might not be a city of dreams but it¬¥s most definitely a city of dreamers. La La Land makes sure all the landmarks shine bright. The Griggith Observatory, the Watts Towers, Long Beach, Hermosa Beach, Vine Street; all the cafes, the boulevards, the jazz clubs, the convertible cars, the movie sets; all of this places (and the highway!) are memorable even for someone like me, who has never set foot in any of them.<br/><br/>The city is more than just a setting but it obviously needs a couple of dreamers because, after all, it wouldn¬¥t be anything without its fools. We have a jazz revivalist and an aspiring actress working as a waitress, which has to be the oldest clich√© in the book. It makes sense, tough, revitalizing an old fashioned character is a statement on how the simple story isn¬¥t only enough, it¬¥s everything. Dreamers dream their dreams today as they did a hundred years ago and the world getting worryingly cynical give all the more reason for romantic spirits to speak up.<br/><br/>La La Land doesn¬¥t just speak up, it shouts at full lung its passion for the oldie golden days, it¬¥s a burst of unstoppable romantic emotion that leaves you shaken, stunned, flurried. It¬¥s loud, very loud, like 2001¬¥s Moulin Rouge on colorful steroids. It commands its audience to be taken higher and higher and, although it has the confidence and power to make such demands, I personally felt exhausted and kind of relieved it was finally over.<br/><br/>I¬¥m a fool for this kind of thing and I appreciate the nostalgic yearning for simpler times, for soulful music, dressed-up men and women in summer dresses. I can smile at two hands touching for the first time and I can admire the technical prowess of light, color, music, editing and costumes. I can also cringe at some musical numbers, over-staged apartments, preposterous coincidences, try-hard manipulations and worn-out clich√©s. I appreciate the light but without getting blinded by it."

","I am far from your typical RomCom Musical Movie sorta guy. This notwithstanding, there are exceptions to every rule. And the 2016 mega-hit from a genre generally gone by, ""La La Land"", would be a rare one indeed for me in this regard.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has fashioned a bit of beatific and, at once, bittersweet brilliance. And all the while he pays both subtle and blatant homage to the multitude of merry musicals circa the golden era of the 1950's and '60's. Ryan Gosling is very good, Emma Stone, better for my money, as star-crossed lovers who I found myself willingly suckered into rooting to see get together in the end. <br/><br/>For those who have yet to see the film, far be it for me to divulge if this cute and crazy couple actually do wind up living happily, and tunefully, ever after. I shall only share that the entire intricate production satisfied both fully and with flying colors after all was said, sung and done.<br/><br/>And, to quote the late, great John Lennon-a dude who knew a little something about music himself-it ""done me good""."

","Wow, this won Best Picture, whoops The Accountant's messed up the envelopes, and they did it without help. Not best picture, and it was filmed at Warner Brothers studios in California. The movie does have very good music (special thanks to John Legend). Jazz is great stuff and the music of strong emotions. That is what this movie plays to, the music. <br/><br/>Emma Stone (who was in the Best Picture Birdman last year) is Mia, a struggling actress unlike Stone, whose trying to make it so hard, she writes a 1 Woman play, and pays a theater so she can perform it one night. Meanwhile, Ryan Gosling is Sebastian, struggling jazz pianist who meets Mia and teaches her to love jazz. In the meantime, they love for a year, as the movie starts in spring, then the rest of the seasons, until Winter when Mia puts on her play, and then gets called to an audition because of the play, and gets a big star making role in Paris. <br/><br/>Sebastian wants to open a jazz piano bar. He needs money and is still looking for money to open the bar when Mia leaves. Then the film moves ahead to 5 years later when Mia is a star and comes back to California where her husband takes her to Sebastian's Jazz Bar. Then we get the road not taken routine (Mia has a daughter with her husband when she gets back), a dream sequence, and then Mia and her husband leave Sebastian at his piano in the bar.<br/><br/>The movie is in Panorama, the sets are expensive, and the acting is good, the dancing so-so, and the music great. I see people rating this a 10, yet with the exception of cell phones being used in the film, it pretty much could have been filmed 50 to 70 years ago.<br/><br/>Yes, it is well done, but like Alfred Hitchcock's TOPAZ, while the material is good, it is dated material. I like TOPAZ better, but it could have been made in the 1950's instead of the 1960's. This film even has an antique convertible car from the 1960's in the beginning of the film that confused me about what time period this film was in, briefly.<br/><br/>To me, unless you really like the music, which I do, this film is an old fashioned romance that could put you into La La Land. It is easier to follow than Birdman, but then the romance dream in my life always takes place on a flying carpet. It is one heck of a dream to find the perfect mate, and it only happens in the movies. <br/><br/>Real life is as big a let down, as the best picture dream being shattered by a letter that was supposed to be put in the shredder, not on the stage. Sweet Dreams, La La Land puts me to sleep."

Yes, you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your life¬Öif you're not a jerk about it. And have contrived, ego-laden dinner conversations that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of a 12 year old.

For those whom don't like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area. The story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it. La La Land is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before (at times the film reminds of a musical version of the Notebook). Was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable.

","I'm not generally one to criticize others' opinions or reviews, I definitely believe we're all entitled to our own opinions, but I honestly can't fathom how a number of reviewers are giving La La Land a ""1"" rating. Do they honestly believe this is worse than Leonard Part 6? Or (in the musical category) My Fair Zombie? OK, so it's not Singing In The Rain, or West Side Story. Or Chicago, or 42nd Street. That certainly doesn't mean it warrants a ""1"" rating. And to be fair, I don't believe the movie warrants the ""10"" ratings it received either.<br/><br/>One of the complaints I read was the ""jazz"" in the movie was not of the level Sebastian (Gosling's character) pontificates about. OK, so they couldn't get Miles Davis or Dizzy Gillespie (of course not, they've been dead for years), but what I heard was good enough (from my non-expert perspective) to set the stage for the movie. <br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed La La Land, and will most likely see it again. I found the characters engaging and the music entertaining. Is the score on par with Chicago? No, but that doesn't mean it's terrible. I especially enjoyed the opening number, recognizing it was done all in a single take, and marveling at the coordination that must have taken. I've never been a huge Emma Stone fan, but I liked her in this, more than I expected to. Ryan Gosling's character is a bit of a jerk at times, but not so much as to be a detriment to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was a pretty solid addition to the musical category."

","""Here's to the ones that dream"". If there were a line that most symbolizes the theme and feeling of this movie, it would be this one. Of course, this line is delivered during the most pivotal performance and heartfelt scene of the movie, when Mia (Emma Stone) regains her dream of becoming an actress/playwright. <br/><br/>La La Land is meant to be a love letter to classic Hollywood cinema, with a modern-day twist to it. So much fine detail is placed into making sure this musical marks off all the boxes on the checklist; from the grand musical numbers that block the infamous LA traffic, to the countless references to classic films (Singin' In the Rain, The Girl Can't Help It, to name a couple). <br/><br/>The story starts off with Mia, a young girl her 20s, starry eyed and ever the dreamer. As she strolls through downtown on a lonely winter night, she comes across a well-hidden lounge, and walks in right as Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) begins to play a melody that instantly stops her in her tracks. While their first encounters are ones of repugnance, they begin to cross paths quite often, as if fate is somehow pushing them towards one another. This mutual disgust for each other quickly fades one night, as they take an unexpected stroll through the Hollywood Hills and sing and dance their way through them, with the beautiful backdrop of Los Angeles beneath them. <br/><br/>Photography makes much of this movie. Shot in CinemaScope, a nod to classic 50s and 60s films, the elongation of the widescreen frame, while paired with today's technology and refinement in color, creates a vibrant world for the viewer to get lost in. Take Mia's shared apartment for example. Usually attention is not given to the color of apartment rooms in the background. But as Mia and her roommates begin to sing about finding someone in the crowd, they quickly run from a bright white room, through a deep blue hallway, past striped walls, sultry yellow lighting, sending the viewer into a tailspin of colors. One can't help but notice that Mia and her friends are each in vibrant solid colored dresses, none having the same color on as the other. The sudden change from medium and close-up shots, to the shot up to a bird's eye view of the four of them dancing in a circle on the lit-up street, creates a kaleidoscope effect of color and motion.<br/><br/>Color is not only used to grab attention, but also a way to foreshadow events forthcoming. Right before Mia encounters Sebastian face to face for the first time, we see her walking through a dimly lit street, dark hues of blue and black surrounding her. The moment that we hear Sebastian play the first note to his piano piece, she crosses into the first sighting of red light, and her face is flushed with the red light. Red, the color of love passion, is being used here, literally to prove that love is right in front of her face. <br/><br/>As beautiful as this movie is, there is much more emphasis placed on style than on substance. If it were not for the vibrant colors, the use of music and dance, and the rose-colored lens placed over Hollywood, this movie would be quite a bore. The characters fall flat in comparison, with minor character development and not enough character depth. Both Mia and Sebastian follow the same plot line of having a dream, but losing hope, only to be saved by the other person. While an encouraging and heartfelt message, had we had more time to really see all the complexities of these two characters, it would have struck a stronger chord."

","Love in the 21st century is fragile and reluctant. ""Am I sure I want to give in? What about my dreams? Am I getting exposed or dependent?"" Sebastian and Mia's romance was sweet but uncertain, both of them half- in half-out, without any loss of control even when the things went bad. A fine dialog between individuality and love, a subtle game of hiding or showing their feelings...That subtlety of emotion is what the sweetness and warmness of the movie derives from. And it's this outdoor light, this purple sky, always half-day, half-night that sheds its magic all over the film. They say, early morning and early evening are the best moments of the day and that's because half-light gives a soothing sense of safety and carefreeness. And indoors, the light is either the dim one of a jazz club or an early morning sun shining through the windows.That light protects and calms us, undermines our defenses and allows us to dream."

","La La Land is a 'dreamy' modern day musical dramedy. It is not your usual 'break into a dance' musical but a rather dramatic take on how sometimes it is important to fulfill your dreams to sustain a relationship. The way I see it, the relationship shared between Sebastian and Mia here is more about 'watching out for the other' while the other achieves what's truly theirs.The movie starts in a classy way with the words CinemaScope staring at you. The opening scene has one of the most energetic well-synchronized dance sequence seen in the recent times.

The sequence when they break into some good old dancing in¬†What A Lovely Day¬†or when every time Sebastian plays the tune that he had created or when Mia receives a lukewarm response at the theatre, every sequence has its unique charm. But my favorite remains what I call the ""What If"" sequence that is a real eye opener and remains one of the most well thought sequence.The song¬†City Of Stars¬†is such a well-written song. Its like one of those songs that just get more meaningful with time. What makes La La Land so special is the fact that it comes across as a really normal movie in a time when carrying your 3-D glasses to the theatre is mandatory."

The relevance here is good music and a smart script, and... let them dance and sing it! The movie brought to my mind not Ginger and Fred and Gene and Cyd (this was clearly not the director's intention) but a French movie called ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" (1967, director Jacques Demy) where an older Gene Kelly makes a small but glorious appearance, and everyone else in the cast dances no better than you and me, but what a crazy delight it is.

","I went all in to to film despite the Oscar buzz, not because of them. Director Damien Chazelle had wowed me with his story of a jazz drummer student striving for greatness in ""Whiplash"". It was both parts brutal and honest in its' projection of musicians in training. ""La La Lan"" is completely a fictional Hollywood tale made for the movies. Different movie but same love of Jazz character unable to commit to a girl. So, here we let the excursion begin.... into a TV commercial on a parking lot (that we only discover is L.A. at the end of the scene)..... Context missing and I was lost...<br/><br/>The genre demands instant suspense of disbelief once the music starts and that opening scene was as memorable as all of the other afternoon traffic jams we experience, albeit with folks certainly outside the ages range of 24 - 32 year old dancers preening for their 15 seconds of screen time. Ad agencies sell washing machines, yogurt, oranges and dish washers this way. <br/><br/>No matter what the stars, the plots, the choreography, the MUSIC has to be the star in a musical! Every top musical has numbers you leave the theater with some new love of song. I say the song, you say the movie, :""Maria"", ""Consider Yourself"", ""Cell Block Tango"", ""Aquarius"" off the top of my head. And these are not the classics that were being paid homage to.<br/><br/>That out of the way, I really fell for the Emma Stone character. I didn't need for ""Mia"" to be singing ""American Idol"" style, which you'd expect in a Hollywood Musical. Her face alone gave way to multiple emotion, like her audition called for. Emma was wonderful to watch. Ryan Goslings' ""Sebastian"" is a bit stiff and his ""Bogart"" doesn't inspire a lot of emotional suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the lark of the adventure. The Hollywood Actress wannabe story line maybe clich√©, but we like this story and even have come to expect the predictability of it. It is The American Dream and somewhat universal... just s=needs memorable tunes and for the male counterpart to figure out and buy into his character arc a bit more. I couldn't buy into his ""jazz isn't dead/I have a dream/ I'm supporting my girl"" miss mash.<br/><br/>So my experience wasn't all that I was hoping for, but much like Los Angeles itself, there's something to visit, but I wouldn't want to invest too much of my entertainment time there."

I love musicals can't get enough of them to the point I wish we could have a slew of musicals just like we have lots of Superhero movies. So after saying all that,why isn't this a five star review?<br/><br/>Because it had issues. For me Emma Stone has in the past put out some great performances and here she does a very good job here acting wise. But at times I found her singing to be a little sub par, then all of sudden it would be great before going back to being sub par. It just felt really uneven to me and had me thinking I wonder how Emma Watson would have played it if she had gotten the part? However, Ryan Gosling did a great job throughout this movie. Is there anything this guy can't do at this point? <br/><br/>Overall the story had me engaged and the music was great. I really enjoyed the ending. Because I thought it was going to go in one direction and went in another direction. Which I really appreciated. Although, I really don't think the 2.55 CinemaScope that Damien Chazelle and Linus Sandgren went with worked. But I get why they did. It was an artistic thing trying to recreate a '50 theme set in modern times. But it just doesn't translate well to a 65 inch 4K television. What I'm trying to say is this film is best suited for the cinema. It's watchable at home don't get me wrong, but you're not going to get the best experience from your home. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a nice addition to the genre and I will definitely watch it again."

","A great movie about love, music (jazz), chasing your dreams and sacrifices; Damien Chazelle's masterclass musical is one of the best musicals ever made and is the best musical in recent years. Damien Chazelle continues his work on the theme of jazz which just goes to show how passionate he is about the genre of music. Great performances all around; especially Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as they have great chemistry and it makes you feel as though you are watching these two characters fall in love. However, not as good as Chazelle's first masterpiece whiplash in my opinion, La la land is still a great movie that should've won best picture. The visuals of the scene and the frequent use of vibrant colours makes La la land beautiful to watch and admire. The musical numbers are fantastically placed in this movie as they aren't just shoved in whenever, they make you feel as though in that situation you would break out in a smooth song and dance number which is what it should make you feel.

"Icedooitle","8","0","4","16 April 2017"," Low Stakes Escapism
","In the years of the Great Depression, the average American went to damnable lengths just to pay bills or scare up food for their family. And yet, Hollywood was still able to pull off successful numbers at the box office. The reason, escapism. The late 1930's brought movies of pure joy and carefree lifestyles. Films like My Man Godfrey, Top Hat, Chaplin and Marx Brother comedies were a tonic to forget hardship. La La Land is a film in this vein. 2016 is coming to a close and has yet to pump its breaks as a freight-train of ugliness. La La Land will have one of two effects on viewers, the desired effect of escapism, or one of jaded cynicism. It was a telling experience that I fell firmly into the second category.<br/><br/>I will begin with how this movie succeeds, and it does so spectacularly. La La Land is a beautiful, engaging, and technical feat of production. Long choreographed takes and sparkling settings compliment music and dance that act as an ode to Hollywood classics that could sweep you away. The opening song and dance number sets the mood for how dutiful the production will be for the rest of the film. Hundreds of dancers jump and glide over car hoods on the interstate in perfect step, in a single take. The shot pulls back and the line of cars, and dancers, go on for miles. Here we meet our stars. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are Sebastian and Mia, classic dreamers. Mia is a part-time barista and even more part-time actress. Sebastian is a talented pianist that is willing to spin his wheels to the grave rather than sacrifice his integrity as an artist. They have a modern meet-cute, a middle finger on the interstate. <br/><br/>Like any classic musical, their relationship develops through a series of musical numbers rather than dialogue. They start as flirty enemies who dance at one another. When the romance picks up they dance with one another. We follow their romance as they court us through this new Hollywood that isn't so unlike the old. Sebastian lives and breathes Jazz, perfecting pieces off of garbled records that were pressed before he was born. Mia auditions for any tired clich√© that will have her, all while going to sleep with a 9-foot Ingrid Bergman banner on her wall. La La Land certainly follows a formula, but it does so while celebrating it. <br/><br/>Now for the cynics. When you have a year like 2016, cute cat videos and puff stories on the news just can't quell the acidity of what's going wrong. La La Land takes place in a world void of these struggles. Consequently, it's hard to see these beautiful people and think of their struggles as anything but trivial. I found my smile frequently turning to an eye-roll when prompted to care about the conflict. Based on the overwhelming praise coming from countless other sources, I count myself as unfortunate for falling victim to this dissonance.<br/><br/>If there is anything imperfect about the musical arc of the film it's that it plays more like a score than soundtrack. The songs are as grandiose as any great Broadway number, but not as memorability. They may not be meant to be, but the songs don't exactly stay with you. This is a true romance, featuring actors with perfect chemistry. You root for them to a point, but when things get hard, their worst case scenario is still a dreamy existence in La La Land."

Love for them was in fulfillment of each others dreams and if Sebastian would not have called Mia for that casting or if Mia could not have confronted Sebastian about his compromise of music over jazz, they would have been mediocre.<br/><br/>Than there is Emma Stone who easily steals the show with her eyes and expressions.This was acting for the ages and Ryan Gosling beautifully underplays himself making her more relevant to the plot , giving her context yet making his presence felt in a subtle manner.<br/><br/>The music was refreshing and the Jazz was infectious. Most importantly i like the way Director plays with the camera and the mood of the movie. He makes Mia as gorgeous as she can be by vibrant deep earthy colors. He makes Sebastian a sad soul without making him speak much and he had the most innovative sets you can see in a long long time.<br/><br/>so yes, La la land is a piece of Art. I wish Damien Chazelle does a musical with Leo someday. Would be refreshing to see."

","*** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>So yes. This movie is definitely worth the high rating. It will surely touch everyone.<br/><br/>Many elements and motives are included: Hollywood life atmosphere, dreams against reality, depth against superficiality, and love so strong for the ultimate sacrifice of not being together (reminds me of Man on Fire 2004 - Denzel Washington).<br/><br/>Acting is superb, especially by Emma Stone. The high quality of visual effects audio effects and directing are evident on every frame.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, some elements and symbols are difficult to follow on a 2 hour period. The musical parts that includes wording are too complex to understand unless watched more then once (reminds me of Patterson).<br/><br/>Also, for those who are not so much into music or acting, the musical parts may be boring. In addition, the ""intellectual"" difference between the story ""heroes"" (Mia and Sebastian) and the ""rest of the world"" is too much emphasized on plenty occasions. One might think that the ""heroes"" are both PhDs or something...<br/><br/>Worth watching of course, but not like the competitor ""Moonlight"", which eventually took the Oscar."
"Enchorde","7","0","3","10 April 2017"," Not enough musical in this
","La La Land is a musical set in, and mostly about, Hollywood and those who try to find their way in it. It starts out with a big musical number on the highway and promises much. It is also there we meet our two main characters, Mia and Sebastian. Mia, a struggling and aspiring actress, and Sebastian, an equally struggling jazz pianist. They keep running into each other and this musical evolves into a romance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even if it brings along a lot of music, it leaves the musical pretty much behind. Much of the ensemble and dance scenes as the introduction sets the tone for fail to materialize. it is a good, but rather classic romance about how two people meet (in this case meet and meet again) and ultimately fall for each other. Predictably trouble then ensues. Music and a songs are a central theme in this, but this is not as much a musical as I hoped.<br/><br/>I like Stone's and Gosling's performances, and I like the characters. I like the storytelling in the movie, it has some nice tricks with time and what if's. But I feel I don't really get what I expected.<br/><br/>And, in the end, was it a happy ending?<br/><br/>7/10"
"mayerhannahe","8","0","5","9 April 2017"," Up In La La Land
","The story all begins with an enchanting, amber blur of cars and voices on a highway stopped by traffic. The voices cease, and the once-strangers transition into the opening musical number, ""Another Day of Sun""-an upbeat tune accented by its catchy lyrics- about being a struggling Hollywood actor in Los Angeles. A bubbly girl in a bright yellow dress carols, ""When they let you down, morning rolls around, and it's another day of sun,"" a metaphor for the resilience needed to make a living as an actor. La La Land is a vintage fairy-tale about an aspiring actor and an aspiring jazz musician with a common desire to pursue what they love. Since this film was a romantic musical, I was expecting a happy, fairy-tale ending with them falling in love immediately. However, the song ""A Lovely Night"" dispelled those predictions when Sebastian and Mia lament about how there's no romance between them at all and how it's, ""such a waste of a lovely night."" Later, Mia sings in an audition about how, ""A bit of madness is key, to give us new colors to see,"" perhaps a hint on how she lost her stability in Sebastian and the colors he showed her. There is a common theme throughout the film, when the seasons change from Fall to Winter, to Spring and Summer. The changing of the seasons represents Mia and Sebastian's love changing and growing, and eventually ending in the Winter. Overall, the film was a captivating movie musical, however, some songs and the story line were more evocative of old movie musicals and the movie would have been more gripping."
"paulmcuomo","8","0","4","7 April 2017"," A great passion project that is also an epic movie on its own
","Regardless of what you feel over the Oscars mishap, I will say outright that I do like this film, a lot. The scope of it, visually as well as harmonically, is immense; this is especially apparent in both the opening 'Another Day of Sun' musical sequence that is 5 minute of uncut, intensely intricate dancing, and then on the Museum date which is almost dreamy with how the visuals and the sound design merges.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, this film does have some similarities with Damien Chazelle's last film, the musical-themed psychological thriller Whiplash, in that you have a jazz musician who is hell-bent on making it in the world, and by the end both him and his love interest do make it (more on this later). Ryan Gosling in this film acts way better than he sings, that I can say for certain, as a lot of times he is out of key and his voice doesn't suit a lot of the songs he does, but his acting is great; the scene where he begs for his job back is both serious and keeps the light-heartedness that the film does try and maintain. Emma Stone in her Oscar-winning role here is by far the better singer and dancer of the two, and her performance as Mia is very expressive and eager, and also fun. John Legend has a good supporting role too as a former friend of Sebastian (Gosling) who he recruits into his pop band, much to Seb's reluctance.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and the set design's are big and broad and totally awesome. Aside from Gosling, a lot of the vocals are strong, and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of JK Simmons as Seb's old boss - I mean, he was amazing in Whiplash, and is also a professional vocalist, use it! The ending is where the film does kind of fall down flat. Much like The Grand Budapest Hotel, which is amazing, this film contains an ending that gets way too emotional way too fast. We see Seb and Mia talk, then a caption ""5 years later"" comes on screen, and we see Mia is married with a young daughter to an older man, and they visit a jazz bar in the evening, owned by Seb. They lock eyes, and imagine how if everything had gone completely their way what would've happened. It's a great musical number that ends, very dourly, on Mia and her husband leaving, with Mia and Seb exchanging one last look. It's just such a big leap with so much different in 5 years that you have no time to process it, and it spits in the face of a lot of the film. And it is a shame because narratively, the film was good up to that point.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie with good songs and direction that will make you want to keep watching it on repeat viewings. The ending just keeps it from being perfect though."

And while I enjoyed the music (they are not singers really) most of it was forgotten before I got into the car. Not one song stuck with me! I liked the leads acting.

","From watching the trailer, it gives off a very enthusiastic and fun mood, however, that may be slightly deceiving as the movie goes through a range of emotions. Some will be unexpected, and that is what makes this film so great. A must watch till the end, even though the beginning half may be a bit slow, it is worth it. If they had cut out some details or made the beginning half a little shorter, then it would have been perfect. <br/><br/>The musical numbers are plenty, and all very well executed. I absolutely love the soundtrack. Here is a movie based entirely around the musical element, and it is phenomenal. As I write this now, I'm listening to the soundtrack. As all (or most I presume) of the songs are original, they are able to create the song to suit each character. Not only that, but choreography throughout is simply amazing. Those like the beginning scene is simply to initiate the audience as to what they are getting into. Others like the tap dancing scene with Gosling and Stone, are infused with feeling and flirtation. <br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Gosling and Stone complement each other so well - they were previously paired in Crazy Stupid Love. Gosling is such a versatile actor; just looking at his IMDb history is so impressive. He can encompass a range of personas, and is great at portraying characters with a lot of passion. Stone is also quite a versatile actress, and it is hard not to like her. <br/><br/>I heard from my friend that there area also quite a lot of distinguished dancers in the movie, and that doesn't surprise me. It is a musical after all, and that requires great dancers, not just great actors and actresses. So overall, everyone did their parts extremely well and was able to bring a lot of energy to the story. <br/><br/>What makes this such a classic, is that it pays homage to many eras in the Hollywood film industry. There is a bit of film noir, quite a few scenes depicting the silent era, there is of course the sound era, and the introduction of technicolor, and what makes it so classical is the fact that it mimics the style of Singin' in the Rain. What with the musical numbers, and also the self-reflective aspect of the story. While in Singin', the characters were actually making a movie, in La La Land, they show some behind the scenes of how Hollywood is like. There is also quite a few instances where characters break the fourth wall, and this is done so smoothly that it doesn't really affect the diegesis. The ending scene as well, is very much like the one in Singin', though produces a different effect. <br/><br/>Overall, this film is definitely a new classic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everyone I knew was saying how good it was, and I can't agree more."

","Anyone who finds the chemistry between Stone and Gosling wonderful will be divorced in a few years. Seriously a better male figure would have made this a classic. Stone is wonderful. The music is good. The story is pretty good. Still the story needs a more accessible male figure and that is not overcome by the rest of the story."
"kijii","7","0","5","7 February 2017"," Basic girl-meets-boy movie with a bittersweet ending
","This is up for 14 nominations and is bound to walk away with the lion's share of Oscars. It was a pleasant movie, but did not reach the level of greatness for me that it has for others here. It is a basic girl-meets- boy movie with a bittersweet ending. There is not a song from the movie that I came out humming or singing. If Emma Stone wins for Best Actress in this movie, it would only show me how weak this the category may be this year. (But, I haven't seen Arrival or Elle so I don't know about these movies.) <br/><br/>As I watched this movie, I did think about Les parapluies de Cherbourg (1964), but that movie was a modern opera and La La Land (2016) comes no where near that great Michel Legrand work of yesteryear."
"valadas","7","0","5","3 February 2017"," Good music, nice story
","From time to time we feel the need of watching a movie without too many special effects, explosions, people punching, kicking, shooting and killing people. This is the one. And it has no sex on the bed either. Jazz, pop music (but mainly jazz) and even old style tap dancing. Everything mixed up with a tender love story half real half dreamed between a jazz pianist and a girl who is trying to start a life as an actress. A technically excellent movie in terms of cut and image sequences, some of them very beautiful. For instance the opening sequence of a collective dance on a road filled with cars during a traffic jam is wonderful indeed. A movie to be loved, almost a masterpiece."

","Quintessencial 7/10 (not to be confused with 7/7, please)) Maybe, you'll be surprised but I think the best part of the movie is its ending which has the very meaning of the film. Sebastian realized his dream by creating his own jazz club, not continued a career in the band, whereas Mia, on the contrary, became an actress in poppy movies, not in solo plays as she wanted. Separately, I would like to mention the performances by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone ‚Äì great chemistry between them! Also good music, songs, dances, visuals. Nevertheless, we have probably a cute pastiche, no more no less (and only downers may not like this movie at all), but this is a second The Artist, not Singin' in the Rain. La La Land will hardly revive the fashion and love for musicals, like The Artist has not done so with silent movies. Yes, a nice movie indeed but sorry, hardcore Damien Chazelle's fans, for him personally (especially after Whiplash), it's rather a step down to more mainstream movies and entertainment. He wants to please everyone and this is his vulnerable feature. Incidentally, interesting how it rhymes with the film's ending: the director is on the Sebastian's side, but he himself is Mia! )"
"carminenovember","7","0","4","15 January 2017"," Eh.
","Since the overwhelming consensus is that this is the best thing since sliced bread, my opinion probably means very little here. Still, I'll try to sum up my feeling of the film:<br/><br/>5 seconds in, I had tears in my eyes.<br/><br/>The first musical number is absolutely incredible. It's big, it's wild, it's colourful and filled with power and joy. <br/><br/>The last scene in the movie is absolutely amazing as well; I won't spoil anything, but it somehow captures both the extreme highs and the lows of emotion in only a few minutes.<br/><br/>It's the bits in the middle that bother me.<br/><br/>See, a lot of it just... drawn out. At some point, it just becomes an infinite loop of the two lead actors staring wistfully into the distance to jazz music. There are a few of those big show-stopper numbers in between, but they jar with the long, quiet blandness of the rest of the film. These two parts of the film are never reconciled. There's something off about the flow of the whole thing, the way it all connects. The cinematography and colours are beautiful even in the ""normal"" scenes, but all of the big emotional creativity - the actual core of the movie - seems to have been reserved for the songs. <br/><br/>Now, this wouldn't be a problem if there was a song for each important beat, but there are only about 5 songs that are actually sung by the characters. Considering most Broadway musicals have about 15 songs, this movie exists in a weird state where the creators aren't sure as to whether they want a colourful larger-than-life Broadway musical or a realistic, toned-down non-musical drama. Which is a shame, really, because the scenes on their own are crafted masterfully; it's just that they fall apart as a whole.<br/><br/>The cinematography and directing is a delight; the actors are lovely, if limited by the script (as said, they spend a lot of time staring wistfully into the distance), and the music is wonderful. So, I dunno, go watch it if you have the time - you'll probably like it more than I did."

","These two are just super cute together, although to be honest I buy them more as best friends or brother & sister. I didn't think it was a wall-to-wall song-and-dance musical like I expected; it was more like a regular movie (and more drama than I expected) with a few neat musical numbers. Their first dance together, when they didn't really like each other that much, was terrific. I loved seeing J.K. Simmons in it (which reminded me of the excellent ""Whiplash"" that Damien Chazelle made before this) and I'm really proud of Chazelle for getting this done -- now he can live his dream and make exactly what he wants! This love letter to Hollywood is his story too! I wasn't crazy about the surprise twists at the end, but it's definitely the most charming picture of the year, something the whole family will enjoy. Like ""The Artist"", it's a unique experience that deserves all the praise it's gotten."
"gohurdler1","7","0","6","3 January 2017"," I liked the film better when when it was called ""(500) Days of Summer.""
","This review has SPOILERS!!!! This will be a short review of ""La La Land."" <br/><br/>To be blunt, ""La La Land"" is basically ""(500) Days of Summer"" (which came out in 2009) with more song and dance numbers. I read one review about ""La La Land"" along with hearing all the buzz about how great of a film it is. So, I saw a late showing of it on New Year's Eve. I was the first in the theater, and I thought that I would be the only one, but about ten random people walked in. I thought that the retro intro of the film such as the ""CinemaScope"" graphic was cool. But as the film started, I felt like, ""Why does this movie seem so familiar?"" Then it hit me, ""(500) Days of Summer!"" I then was able to predict what was going to happen in the film.<br/><br/>Here are SOME of the similarities of both films:<br/><br/>Both films have the theme of boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl.<br/><br/>Both films have the change in seasons.<br/><br/>""La La Land"" has Angels Flight,"" and ""(500) Days of Summer has Angels Knoll.""<br/><br/>In ""(500) Days of Summer"" Tom and Summer see an older film. In ""La La Land"" the same thing happens.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" has Expectations vs Reality and ""La La Land"" has a dream sequence scene at Sebastian's jazz club Seb's where the characters imagine what their lives would have been like if they had stayed together.<br/><br/>But, ""(500) Days of Summer"" wasn't the only film that ""La La Land"" will remind you of. As I watched some of the other scenes I kept thinking why does that look so familiar? The film is basically an homage to musicals such as ""Singin' in the Rain,"" and an ""American in Paris."" The scene that is so obvious is towards the end with the boy and the giant red balloon, which was a blatant homage to ""The Red Balloon,"" which teachers at my elementary school seemed to have enjoyed screening for us. I read a review after watching the film and it had still comparisons of dance numbers from the plethora of films it pays homage to including ""Sleeping Beauty."" One of the homages to ""(500) Days of Summer"" is when Sebastian and Mia are riding Angel's Flight in downtown Los Angeles. Although Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) didn't actually go on Angels Flight, they sat on one of the benches next door at Angels Knoll. <br/><br/>How many homages can a current film have in it from films decades old along with a super similar story line to a more current film from 2009 before it stops being an homage, and starts being something else like a best of compilation piece?<br/><br/>Do I think that ""La La Land"" is a GOOD film? Yes. Do I think that it is a great film? NO! Do I think that it is an overrated film? Yes! Do I think that it will receive countless awards and nominations? Yes! Hollywood loves films with song and dance numbers, especially if the actors aren't known for those talents. This would have been a much better film if Joseph Gordon-Levitt had portrayed the character of Sebastian instead of Ryan Gosling. Gordon-Levitt can show more emotions on screen than one look Gosling, and has a better singing voice, along with dancing talent.<br/><br/>""(500) Days of Summer"" was original, and felt more real because of the characters and the non-clich√© happy ending, and the real places in LA that the average person could visit that aren't normally scene in films that are made in LA. ""La La Land"" is definitely a fun date film, and likable, but when you realize as I did that this is a lesser version of ""(500) Days of Summer"" with more song and dance numbers, (along with a boatload of homages) it doesn't seem as creative as the current Hollywood buzz/hype portrays it to be."
