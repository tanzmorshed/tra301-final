"ericb336","Null","39","47","4 May 2003"," A flawed film that still flies.
","My two favorite Spike Lee movies are ""Clockers"" and ""He Got Game"" and they share similarities: both are about  guys trying to keep integrity amidst characters whose primary motives are to persuade him to leave the path.<br/><br/>""He Got Game"" gets the edge because I love basketball and because I'm a sucker for well done father-son conflicts. The basketball parts of this movie are absolutely brilliantly shot. Most sports movies share two commonalities: completely ridiculous storylines and actors who throw like sissies. He Got Game avoids both.<br/><br/>Okay, some parts of the story are hoky, but allowable. But what makes this movie work, similar to ""Clockers"" is that you get sucked into a main character whose nobility is tested at every turn. Will Jesus Shuttlesworth make it through the maze or fall prey to it? And will he be able to recognize that his father is not just one more flesh peddler? It makes for good drama. But above that, the basketball scenes just completely rock. They're examples of absolutely masterful cinematography and editing. In fact, the movie has some of the best montage sequences every put on film. Seriously.<br/><br/>Denzel is excellent in this movie. He plays a Jeckyll and Hyde and plays both sides well. This conflicted character was very easy to root for. (I can identify.) NBA perennial All-Star Ray Allen, while more than a little stiff at times, holds his own as a non-actor in a dramatic role.<br/><br/>He Got Game is a flawed piece of work: parts drag, it's not without its hokiness, and the subplot with Denzel and Jojovovich didn't quite fit. But the essential storylines work and play true: you believe in a conflict between father and son and you root for a high school basketball player who requires the wisdom of an adult to avoid the flesh peddlers. Kudos to Spike for not trying to hit us over the had with his message, but letting it unravel naturally."

","I recently watched this movie for the first time, and as a 19 year old black male it spoke to me. However, I can see this being a film that everyone can appreciate. Especially now, with Lebron James and other upcoming HS athletes, you really see the other side of life that only they know.<br/><br/>This movie detailed the life of the #1 basketball star in HS, and the issues he deals with before he announces his plans for the future, further complicated by his father's contingent release from jail.<br/><br/>A GREAT movie, don't let the votes fool you, it's not a 6.5/10, more like 8.5."
"Rigor","8","25","30","4 November 1998"," A fascinating performance by Denzel Washington in a solid film.
","Denzel Washington has one of his greatest charcaters in Jake Shuttlesworth in this compelling film by Spike Lee. Jake is a man serving a life sentence for the accidental murder of his wife during a domestic dispute. The dispute centered around Jake's aggressive coaching of his young son Jesus who he is obsessed with turning into a basketball star. As the film opens we learn that Jesus (effectively played by Ray Allen) has indeed become a high school basketball star and is being now aggressively pursued by University teams and commercial agents. In a somewhat fanciful, yet unfortunately believable plot device the Governor promises Jake early release from prison if he can convince his son to go to Big State.  Much of this film is amazingly well executed my only regret comes around some of the gender politics of the film (many of the female characters are underdeveloped and/or cartoonishly stereotyped). This is particularly unfortunate because the film has so much to say about the intersections of patriarchy/economic injustice/racism that I wish Spike Lee could have been a little more consistent with his development of the women characters (one notable exception is a brilliantly realized performance by Milla Javovich as a prostitute that rooms next to Jake). This said the film is still an important accomplishment and should be seen."
"nforgione08","9","23","30","13 December 2004"," Who's wiser, the player or the father?
","He got game is an exceptional story about a basketball player who quarrels with family issues and strives towards his dream. Directed by Spike Lee, this movie takes an in depth look at exactly how many variables are involved when being the MVP, and how a man can grow up and assess these circumstances.<br/><br/>Ray Allen plays a character who's name is Jesus Shuttlesworth. At a young age, his father pressed him dramatically to be the best he could be. However by mistake kills Jesus's mother and is sent to prison. The troubled child eventually grows up to become one for the best players in the nation. Now the drama builds up. When the decision to go pro or join a college team is just around the corner, Jesus's father (played by Denzel Washington) is let out of jail to convert his son to a specific school or else the father is returned to jail, it leaves Jesus with a daunting task. The reconcile between the father and son is what eventually allows Jesus to become a real man and face his problems.<br/><br/>The idea that a boy cannot live without his father plays a defined role in this movie. Jesus grows up with the responsibilities of taking care of his sister, who is several years younger than he is. While it appears that Jesus has all of the support in the world, Spike Lee does a terrific job of accentuating how they are really leeches. All the people want are money, fame, and fortune; which is all possible through Jesus. The reason the father plays such a key role is because although he needs Jesus's help, he isn't interested in that. He really loves his son.<br/><br/>Although Spike Lee did some amazing work with this movie especially with the inner city sequences, as well as the use of colors and poetry to his advantage for getting his ideas across to the audience, several scenes were unneeded which seemed overly explicit. Although these are truly issues that can ruin a famous person, they seemed almost too graphic to be seen by a general audience. What Spike does so well is keeping the real connections with the street, and enabling the audience to see exactly what the character is going through by using several techniques. <br/><br/>Colors in the movie such as red, green, and black symbolize power, pain, and respect between different characters. While Jesus hates his name, his father named him that through a basketball player that was how he put it, ""the truth."" This movie proves that in real life, you can benefit more by forgiving, and not forgetting.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a unique, intellectual film that will make you think about your present situation, as well as allowing you to know the difficulties that come with fame."
"jhendrickson08","Null","27","36","10 December 2004"," Well Played
","Spike Lee's He Got Game is a beautifully shot and well-executed exploration of the role that the sport of basketball plays in the relationship between a father and his estranged son. At the outset, having not seen very many other Spike Lee movies, I didn't really know what to expect or what to compare this film to. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of the plot and the cinematography that composed this film. Furthermore, I really liked the definitive sense of Spike's style that was quite apparent throughout.<br/><br/>Told through flashbacks that reveal the plot throughout the course of the movie, He Got Game is about Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) and his basketball-star son, Jesus (Ray Allen). Jake is in jail under mysterious circumstances, yet can get out of jail if he is able to convince Jesus to choose to play basketball at a specific school, namely the state governor's alma mater. Released for a week in order to complete the daunting task, he hounded by probation officers, and does a lot of things that he couldn't do in jail, such as have a light dalliance with Milla Jovovich's slightly-unnecessary prostitute character, Dakota Burns. Denzel, as usual, excellently handles his role as the intense father, and is utterly believable in both his emotion-laden and his violent, angry scenes.<br/><br/>Ray Allen's portrayal of Jesus is also an interesting and well-played usage of the strong dichotomy of masculinity in the sport of basketball. He very clearly shows the purer and more tender side of his character through his love for his younger sister, whom he lives with and takes care of. Yet he is torn between that and the glittering, vice-infested world that his ability at basketball brings him ever closer to. At times he does even succumb to the cloying ploys of others, and there is a particularly raunchy scene as evidence of this. Allen carefully and quietly allows the audience to see the conflicts between sensitivity and machoism that exist in his life, as a result of basketball.<br/><br/>Probably one of the more interesting ways in which this film is set up is through the use of comparative shots that allow the similarities of Jake and Jesus's actions to show. Jesus tries so hard to distance himself from his father, yet the shots and the camera framing show just how alike they both really are. I also particularly enjoyed the use of color and contrasts that appeared throughout. For instance when Jesus and his errant girlfriend LaLa (Rosario Dawson) are talking at the end of the film, both their faces vividly reflect a shade of jealous green from the amusement park lights.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a very good spin on the basketball sports movie, yet with no huge stadiums or big games to win the championship, like what usually constitutes a basketball movie. Instead, the two main characters go through much self-analysis and introspective maturing, something that is quite rare for sports-playing men in film to do. I liked the strong use of color and the well-framed shots, and especially enjoyed Denzel Washington's brooding performance. A classic, must-see movie for anyone interested in cinematography or film."
"Agent10","7","13","18","20 May 2002"," A dark and unsettling film about basketball
","It finally happened, and the movie we all thought Spike Lee would make became reality. With Lee's own little foray into the basketball world, I always wondered when he would create a story which reflected his unique views of the game. While sometimes over sensationalized, he depicted a seedy world comprised of two-faced individuals all the way down to the seedy high school coach to the professional agent. I also felt it depicted some very frank images of the cultural aspects of athletics, the sex, the money and the little freebies. While the film didn't need the story between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich, it was strong in most aspects. It was a bit of a change of pace for Spike Lee, considering the graininess of the film stock and the rather mundane colors. Also, Ray Allen had one of the best pro athletes-turned-actor performances in a long time."
"Dockelektro","8","24","38","26 September 2001"," The most beautiful sports movie of all time
","We could see just one more story about a man who loves his son, but which suffers from various handicaps, like being on parole and being watched all the time, like having no wife anymore due to killing her, and like his son being one of the most stellar basketball players of his time and this man being truck-loaded with the burden of convincing him to go to college. The film marches to the pace of the two leads, Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) and Jesus Shuttlesworth (real-life NBA player Ray Allen, which makes a startling debut), as they have continuous face-offs: Jesus won't accept that he has a father, and won't listen to him, being more interested in becoming an NBA star, as the managers, the limelights, the fame and the fortune keep calling him like the chant of the sirens. Jesus is a young boy with a foot on each side. And he is facing options, choices he will have to make, and traps he will have to avoid. As a friend of his says (in the movie's most memorable quote) ""How do you spell pussy? H. - I. - V."". This could be one more tale of choosing between college or fame and fortune, ths could be one more tale of a destroyed father-son relationship, but this is Spike Lee, and the treatment is totally different. It starts with an incredible hommage to basketball, shot like a picture poem, to the sounds of Aaron Copland, whose music flows through the whole movie and makes it look more beautiful and poetic. A characteristic Spike Lee movie, which introduces us to a new way of facing sport dramas. To be cherished."
"bob the moo","Null","14","21","13 July 2003"," Flawed but always interesting
","Jesus Shuttlesworth is the number one hope for college basketball and has offers from colleges and sports agents ringing non-stop.  His father is in jail for the manslaughter of his wife but is allowed out by the Governor for 4 days with a promise of further leniency if he can convince his son to go to Big State University.  However Jesus has never forgiven him and this pressure, on top of everything else, is the last thing he needs.<br/><br/>I'm never too sure what I'm going to take away from this film each time I watch it, as it does tend to try and cover a lot of ground.  Is the film about father/son relationship?  Is it about the commercialisation of school sports?  Or pressure on young athletes?  It's hard to be sure and I'm not sure that Lee is totally sure either.  As such it often leaves me searching for an adequate way to summarise what I just watched.  Regardless I do feel that the film manages to cover a lot of bases well.  The stuff about the sports system is well worked without ramming down your throat  the exaggeration (or is it?) of the characters and scenarios is good and makes for good satire of sorts.<br/><br/>The central relationship between Jake and Jesus is also worked well through several key scenes throughout the film.  It leaves questions open during the film and at the end, but I guess there aren't always answers for everything and that's the way it is.  The dynamic between the two is good though and it makes for an interesting plot  even though it does often feel like a subplot behind the basketball stuff.  Other bits of the film don't fare as well.  The two romantic strands are not as good as they should be  certainly Jake's scenes with Dakota are less than inspiring.<br/><br/>The cast are all pretty good.  Allen does OK but occasionally looks out of his depth with the talented cast.  The array of basketball players and associates all add colour whether as themselves or playing characters. Washington carries the majority of the film and shows his ability in a difficult role  he became the heart of the film for me even though I'm sure the intention was for that to be Jesus.  Dawson plays well despite being eye candy for the majority, she does have better scenes near the end of the film.  The support cast have a few Lee regulars including an amusing Turturro, a convincing Palagonia and a blink and you'll miss her Jennifer Esposito.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a perfect film as it overstretches itself a little and doesn't manage to deal with everything as well as it could have done. Ironically the overstretching is also a plus point as, every time I watch it, it gives me something else to concentrate on.  Not Lee's finest work but a good film about his other passion with plenty of other stuff thrown in behind it."
"fingerscut","8","11","16","11 August 2006"," A real victory for film making, but not without it's drawbacks.
","It's hard to write a review for a sports movie, there's just a different standard for them. Their plots are usually contrived to a level of laser precision. They seem almost designed to make you feel good, which while admirable in the scheme of life, just isn't good film making.<br/><br/>For us sports fans, a sports film that comes across as 'above average' instantly becomes classic. This hardly seems fair, just because the film had some scenes of athletic competion doesn't mean it shouldn't have to face the same standards as the rest of the silver screen.<br/><br/>But this is a movie that goes against that grain. It's sincerely good by anyone's standards. The acting, even that of NBA Star Ray Allen's, is on-par with anything else out there. Bonus points for any film where Denzel Washington isn't playing Denzel Washington(even though I enjoy many of those films).<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, the cinematography throws a pinpoint assist to the script and makes normally great scenes memorable and occasionally transcendent. The film hits with such power that it really exposes other sports movies for the fluff that they really are. Spike Lee manages to create a film that, while deep in the world of basketball, still can appeal to a non-sports fan. Unlike the 2006 USA Team, this movie is destined for gold! And, my apologies for the ""Assist"" thing, there's really no excuse. Same the the ""Gold"" thing. Still, watch the movie. 8 of 10."

","Shocked to see so many Haters of this movie. Like Jesus, this movie is the truth. People are saying the plot is incoherent.

Brilliant, brilliant picture, in all regards. Leaves me speechless."
"Hound-2","Null","9","15","22 October 1998"," Fantastic performance by Washington in film that doesn't quite support him
","I had to remind myself several times Denzel Washington was an actor and that he was playing a character named Jake Shuttlesworth--his performance is that good. I'd give him the Academy Award for Best Actor. I'm serious--he's amazing. In terms of the film, it isn't quite good enough to support his performance. (We are expected to believe there's no one looking out for Jesus [everyone in the film has an ulterior motive], and Jesus himself is too much of a saint.) Definitely worth watching, though--any Spike Lee film usually is. But I'm annoyed at Lee: he's too good a director to insert the MTV-style shots in this film. Unlike so many who have tried to cover basketball before, however, Lee knows the game. This gives (the all-white) Hoosiers a run for its money as the best basketball film of course, there isn't much competition."
"tfrizzell","Null","12","25","16 October 2003"," Fouled Out Pretty Quickly.
","Director Spike Lee's ode to basketball is one of those frustrating experiences that appears to be a possible slam dunk, but ultimately ends up fouling out mainly because of an uneven story and a nearly invisible tone. Denzel Washington is serving a prison sentence for killing his wife in a domestic dispute. While away, his son has grown to become high school basketball stand-out Ray Allen (a real-life NBA player). Governor Ned Beatty promises to shorten Washington's sentence if he can convince Allen to attend Beatty's alma mater. He has one week to accomplish his goal. Naturally Allen is outraged by seeing his father again and creates a shell to keep Washington out of his life. At first this seems like a good thing, but what if all of Allen's so-called friends (coaches, relatives, girls, agents and fans) are the true antagonists here and Washington is the flawed hero? Lee is never sure what he wants to do here. The movie plays out like a chaotic basketball game with lots of action and memorable action, but in the end you do not want either team to win. Washington and Allen's relationship takes up some airtime, but so do others that leave almost as fast as they appear. The corruption in collegiate athletics and within sports agencies is also given an interesting glimpse, but alas those topics are not explored completely. ""He Got Game"" looked like it would match the brilliance of William Friedkin's ""Blue Chips"" (a flawed, but important movie), but just does not seem to have the coaching necessary. Washington is impressive and handles the material as well as he can. Allen is a complete revelation. Anfernee Hardaway had stolen the show from Nick Nolte in ""Blue Chips"" and Allen pretty much does the same thing in this one. Ray Allen seems to have unlimited potential in front of the camera and his gift could be developed more fully after his playing career ends. I have said for years that Ray Allen should be the best player in the NBA, but he has ultimately disappointed me throughout his professional career. Allen is not the problem here though. Lee's sporadic direction and a meandering script end up sending ""He Got Game"" to the locker room way too soon. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"CAM-32","Null","4","6","1 April 2000"," Pretty lousy
","Overall this movie pretty much sucked, its kind of boring and contrary to what some people say, All-Star Ray Allen is a terrible actor and detracted a lot from the power of the movie, especially when he is paired with the awesome force of Denzel Washington.  On the plus side the boy who played young Jesus Shuttlesworth was very similar to Allen... also a terrible actor.  Denzel Washington is once again amazingly convincing in his role, this time as a mostly ignorant father with some intriguing wisdom who was sent to prison for accidentally killing his own wife (that scene is ridiculous, unless his wife had a completely separate unnoticed brain tumor that coincidentally hemorrhaged just as Denzel pushed her a whole two feet into the stove.)  Other pluses in the movie are an amazing scene involving an agent who talks a great game and Laker Rick Fox, a much more natural actor than Allen, who makes a cameo in an amusing scene as a black college baller who likes his chocolate white.  The scenes between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich are very nicely done (especially the work by Denzel) although it seems odd that a bum who killed his wife and a cheap tramp shacked up in a sleazy hotel would be two of the most attractive people on the planet.  Unfortunately the movie's handful of great scenes are buried by areas of ill-conceived situations and dialogue, blaring music that is poorly chosen and a vintage Spike-Lee-totally-wacked ending."

","Possible Spoilers Here<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight.  I like Spike Lee, but I must say this to him and all film directors and producers.  If I wanna see gratuitous sex in a film, I'll rent a porno... and won't be afraid to admit it.  I'll really do it.  It ain't that I mind sex and violence in major feature films.  It's just insulting to me when Hollywood gives us sex and violence in flicks and they have NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY.<br/><br/>This film could have been a LOT better without the insulting sexual situations.  Like I said, watching other people doin' it ain't the worst thing in the world.  The problem with this film is that there was a sexual situation that actually occurred in the story and was essential to the plot... BUT WASN'T EVEN SHOWN!!!  In fact, most of the sex that WAS shown featured people who weren't even characters in the story!  They were figures in a senseless montage of sex and violence narrated by an obscure acquaintance of the main character.<br/><br/>With that aside, the story was actually interesting (as it usually is up to the middle of Spike Lee's flicks).  As usual, however, Spike had to throw his little personal favorite artsy filming techniques in it and suture his patented ridiculous ending to the film.  To be fair, if you like sports flicks, this one is a necessary evil because of what occurs in the story. If you like sex in movies for no reason, you'll like this one too.  After all, the stupid sex scenes were as steamy as the MPAA will allow in an R-rated flick.  If you're a drama-lover or a serious film watcher, this ain't a necessary flick."

","Denzel Washington and Ray Allen were excellent but other than that I didn't really think this film worked. The plot was simple enough: convince your son to go to a certain college and you will get reduced time off your sentence. I expected Spike Lee to do a b job with bringing father and son closer together. It is typical Spike Lee style to make a film about basketball when the director himself is seen at Madison Square Garden watching the Knicks play, to have basketball players starring in his film. Another problem that this film has is the fact that it has more than enough graphic sexual content and language. It could have been a lot better if the sexual content some of the language were edited out of the script. In my opinion, the basketball players overshadowed the regular actors except for Denzel. Everybody from Rick Fox to Walter McCarty did a better job acting than the rest of the cast, and that would be the only reason I would recommend He Got Game. Game"

In fact, the only real function of women in this film is to (a) take off their shirts, (b) die, (c) take off their shirts, (d) take off their shirts. Oh, yeah, there's a hooker with a heart of gold (who takes off her shirt), and a great-looking teenage gold-digger (who takes off her shirt). And some entirely gratuitous white girls with huge breasts (who take off their shirts, duh).<br/><br/>And then ends with a completely out-of-character, inexplicable cliche so, I guess, we can feel a little better about some of the characters (because most of them are jerks).<br/><br/>This is the same guy who made the documentary about the little girls killed in Birmingham?

The story is plausible enough, and beautifully filmed, although I can't help but wonder if the temptations that face a rising basketball star are quite as vicious as pictured here. Three things subtracted from what would otherwise be a real work of art: (1) The large amount of graphic sexual content really wasn't necessary. (2) The point of character Jesus Shuttlesworth's first name was really not clear, yet it was ceaselessly trumpeted and highlighted; it was a distracting, muddy concept.

","As a massive sports fan and a movie lover, He Got Game has always been near the top of my watchlist, but for whatever reason, it took many years for me to finally pop it in and check it out. From someone who has only seen a small handful of Spike Lee films, He Got Game felt like a solid (if somewhat lacking) entry into his filmography. Spike made the choice of having Ray Allen play the local legend ""Jesus Shuttlesworth"" instead of choosing a real actor, which in my mind could be seen as a massive mistake or a brilliant decision, I go both ways. On one hand, it's often a distraction when big films try and pass a normal actor as an incredibly gifted athlete but you also run the risk of an athlete being exposed up against other talented actors in the film. That's exactly what happens here. Not only does Allen fail to give Jesus any sort of personality, but his skills (or lack thereof) are suspect when Denzel is on screen. It would be one thing if the film was more basketball than life focused, but it's not. Luckily, I think that's where the movie's strengths are, when the film delves deep into Jake's psyche and not worrying too much about the basketball side.

While basketball is a prominent theme and the film opens with majestic shots of various kids poetically playing the game, this is less a sports movie and more a study of estranged relationships with Denzel Washington and Ray Allen having close to equal screen time as father and son respectfully. Allen is nowhere near as polished an actor as Washington, but he has a nicely complex character, torn between offers from various universities, the wishes of his girlfriend, a desire to take responsibility for his sister and lots of resentment towards his father. Lee also admirably avoids spelling out Washington's criminal conviction until partway in, which gives us a chance to gradually warm to his character before discovering his heinous past actions. The film runs a little long with a subplot involving a hooker next door that could have been omitted completely; the ending is also a tad too maudlin for its own good. The vast majority of the film tugs on the right emotional strings though and together with some awesome music and excellent camera-work as per Lee par, this is a compelling watch regardless of one's interest in the sport of basketball."

But are Jake's intentions pure or is he, like everyone else in Lee's film, attempting to profit off his son's newfound fame? <br/><br/>""He Got Game"" is cartoonish, heavy-handed and awkwardly juggles satire and neorealism. It's also filled with countless powerful sequences, most of which are simple conversations involving Washington. Elsewhere Jake connects with a white prostitute (Milla Jovovich), his relationship with her recalling those who attempt to seduce his own son. Everyone's a sycophant, manoeuvring for a dollar, trading false smiles and falser platitudes. When the black man gets money, the leaches come out.<br/><br/>Like most of Lee's films, ""Game"" individualises problems. Integrity, temptation, loyalty etc are seen to be problems to be personally negotiated and not symptoms of a wider social failing; do the right thing, Lee believes, and everything will be alright. Broadening the film's themes are the film's signature song, Public Enemy's ""He Got Game"". ""Damn the game if it ain't saying nothing,"" their lyrics proclaim, before advising Lee's heroes to ""pay attention to the game behind the game"", in which ""the devil makes the rules"" and ""folk don't own themselves but pay mental rent to presidents"". Lee would immortalise Public Enemy in ""Do The Right Thing"" many years earlier, though again their lyrics (""Fight the Power"") were out of sync with Lee's reductive message of individual responsibility.<br/><br/>""Game"" stars NBA's Ray Allen as Jake's son, a bit of casting which lends the film's court sessions extra authenticity. As is typical of Lee, the film's women are poorly written, except for a character played by Rosario Dawson. She's your archetypal temptress, but only, Lee makes it clear, because nobody else is looking out for her financial future. Presumably this justifies all the product placement in the film, as well as Lee's infamous side-career, marketing overpriced Nikes to inner-city blacks.<br/><br/>It's Denzel who really elevates things, though. The man with the coolest walk in showbiz, ""Game"" soars whenever Washtingon is on screen. Unfortunately it's a performance which Lee constantly undermines with unnecessary pyrotechnics. Lee is a man of excess. Denzel is too, but he's cool. Lee wishes he were.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Veers from powerful to terrible. See ""Red Hook Summer"", a Spike joint which rectifies most of the problems encountered here. Worth one viewing."
"Newts","Null","0","0","11 November 1998"," Spike Lee's overcooked vanity project for his love of the game
","More evidence that basketball stars should remain basketball stars, and to stay out of acting. Denzel Washington, in an implosive performance, literally acts circles around his untrained co-star, Ray Allen. While Allen's inept acting skills drag the film into moments of unintentional comedy, there is much to praise here. Lee's fabulous use of colors, underlined with Aaron Copland's amazing score, combines to create some excellent scenes. A sub-plot with a hooker (Jovovich) fails, but there are some serious father-son relations explored here. Watch for two extremely powerful moments: where Jesus goes for reality check cruise with Big Time, and his final showdown with his girlfriend Lala."

","This movie tried to tell a story about one black basketball player's life by trying to put every possible conflict rolled in one. It didn't work. This movie was an eyesore. The music was very good. However, the plot wasn't. The movie was misogynist. The only good women were the immediate relatives. All other women were portrayed as just users and objects. The girl friend of the basketball star (Ray Allen) was not seen sympathetically at all. She was just there for him. The message was she had no hopes and dreams of her own, other than to be around the basketball star.<br/><br/>The part about the basketball star going to the white college and having white women fall all over and have orgasms is nonsense. Black basketball players have to be careful, because there are lots of women out to scream sexual assault, etc. And even the most self-disrespecting women wouldn't just automatically fall all over a black basketball player, even if he were Michael Jordan.<br/><br/>The most ridiculous thing was when Denzel Washington's character returns home and his son doesn't trust him. At first, one thinks ""okay, forgive the father"". Then, you find out that the father accidentally killed his wife in a fit of rage. Okay, I know lots of people who are mad at their father about things less than that. You can't tell me that a son wouldn't want to have nothing to do with the father after this incident.<br/><br/>Then there was the Hispanic drug dealer. Was he working with the City Of New York? He's driving around the basketball star telling him every sin that is out there. That doesn't sound like a street smart drug dealer, looking out for his interests. That sounds like someone hired to give a young man a lecture.<br/><br/>I am sorry that this film was destroyed by all this. There was a lot of good in the film that was marred by all this. For example, life is very hard. The song by Public Enemy at the end was probably the best way too summarize about the hardship of life in Brooklyn. I think that Spike Lee was trying to be like Scorsese, but not the Scorsese of Mean Streets. Mean Streets was Scorsese's debut masterpiece. He Got Game was more like the mediocre and overrated Taxi Driver. The movie wandered all over the place trying to make a moral point, but failing at every turn."

","This is bye far ONE of the Best Basketball Films out there.
The reason why I say this is because it has a GREAT MESSAGE IN THIS FILM ABOUT FATHER AND SON.
Denzel was AWESOME in this FILM. He Played a Father that game out of PRISON. For Killing his Wife BYE MISTAKE. They wanted him to get his son Jesus to play PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL FOR A CERTAIN TEAM. So if he gets his SON to do that his PRISON time will be lifted.
Everyone wants him to sign this and that. And take all kinds of MONEY. But he refuses everything. But nobody understands why.
In till the End of the FILM when he makes his final decision.
It wasn't about the MONEY it was about The University. That was more Important why Education. He was offered thousands of dollars. What I LOVED about this Film it Really Showed how Smart he was. EXAMPLE
He is rasing his little sister. So if Basketball gives out he needs Education.
It also shows how much he hates his Father. But the GREAT part is it should shows how his Father made him a Great Basketball Player. Because he was HARD on him as A kid. People always Said
""Oh Man your being so hard on him""
Then the Father just told people mind your own business. How else is he going to ""LEARN""
This FILM had A lot of Great MESSAGES in it.
But at the VERY VERY VERY END WHEN THE SON IS ON THE COURT ALONE SHOOTING BASKETS. HE JUST RELZED WITH THAT BASKETBALL THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. WAS HIS FATHER. LEAVING A MESSAGE.
I LOVE YOU SON.
This was a Very POWERFUL Basketball Film. One of my Favorites 10 out of 10."
"Special-K88","Null","1","2","27 February 2019"," some good moments that aren't as effective as they could be
","Ardent basketball fan Spike Lee wrote and directed this absorbing drama that explores the many challenges faced by talented young athletes, but more importantly the relationship between fathers and sons. Jake Shuttlesworth is an imprisoned convict in upstate New York who makes a deal with the governor: one week of freedom to persuade his son Jesus-the nation's top basketball prospect-to attend the governor's alma mater in exchange for a reduced sentence, but Jake's relationship with his son is strained (to say the least). The storyline is a bit of a stretch, but made worthwhile by strong acting from Washington, compelling as usual, and NBA star Allen, surprisingly credible in his screen debut, but there are some issues: film goes on too long by including unnecessary subplots that detract from the central story, and some genuinely poignant moments are undermined by a booming score that tends to overshadow the performances. A good film that's a bit overdone, with plenty of recognizable cameos for those who are a fan of the sport. **½"

"dee.reid","9","1","2","22 February 2008"," ""He Got Game"" - The Father, the Son, the Holy Game
","The Spike Lee joint ""He Got Game"" is one of the director's most passionate films because it's about his own personal passion for the love of basketball, one of the richest and most mythic of sports. But to Lee, it's also the most holy and with that said, ""He Got Game"" has no shortage of religious undertones, symbolism, and imagery.<br/><br/>Now, as a sometime fan of the game and occasional player of the game (though I was never really any good, and former Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan ranks as my greatest athlete), I can see why Lee feels the way he does about the game and his film. ""He Got Game"" looks at the sport, the behind-the-scenes corruption and capitalism, greed, temptations, the relationship between father and son, and the Holy Game.<br/><br/>But ""He Got Game"" is mostly about the relationship between the father and the son. Denzel Washington (in one of his best performances, and the third time he has worked with Lee) is Jake Shuttlesworth, a convict doing time for the manslaughter of his wife. Looking for a chance at redemption, he gets it when the governor, an adamant basketball fan, hears that Jake's son is the number-one basketball prospect in the country. In a once-in-a-lifetime chance, the governor, using the warden (Ned Beatty) as his go-to guy, agrees to reduce Jake's sentence if he can get his son to attend the governor's alma mater, Big State University.<br/><br/>In order to do this, Jake is given a one-week temporary release from prison, with two parole officers (Jim Brown and Joseph Lyle Taylor) watching his every move. The deal is easier said done. Jake's son, Jesus (Ray Allen, of the Milwaukee Bucks), has nothing but contempt for him and while his younger sister Mary (Zelda Harris) and cousin Booger (Hill Harper) have forgiven him for his sins, Jesus's heart is still filled with hatred and resentment for his father. It just becomes a question of whether or not the son will forgive the sins of the father, and whether or not the father and the son can come together as one.<br/><br/>""He Got Game"" is a powerful movie, rich in performances, imagery, and story. It is true that Lee has never made a ""bad"" film in his 20+ years as a filmmaker. Every film he makes is a new experience and will always keep you watching. While suffering from an overly long running time, a few under-developed characters (like Milla Jovovich's Dakota) and occasionally uneven storytelling, ""He Got Game,"" like all of Lee's work, keeps you watching.<br/><br/>It's mostly the father/son angle of the story that kept me watching. Washington is one of the strongest actors working in the industry today (some of his best moments are flashbacks to Jesus's childhood and why Jake pushed him so hard to be the best ballplayer that he could be, and the reasons behind Jake's incarceration, which are revealed to be far more complicated than first thought); while it is true that Allen is no great actor (he is an athlete, after all), he is at his best during his scenes with Washington. On his own, it's a bit of mixed effort. Lee's composer has frequently been Terence Blanchard, but replacing him this time is the emotive, driving score by Aaron Copland, blaring up during many of the film's strongest moments. Rap group Public Enemy also composed many of the songs appearing on the soundtrack; it marked their triumphant return to the rap game after a few disappointing albums.<br/><br/>While I don't consider myself much of a religious person (despite a Baptist Christian upbringing), there is a lot of religious allegory in ""He Got Game."" Like his biblical namesake, Jesus is seen as the savior, the second coming and the resurrection of the game, and there are a number of temptations, many of which are of the flesh, that he has to overcome - from the dangers of being a young black man on Coney Island (where so many other promising talents have become victims), to the cash hand-outs, promises of fame by bypassing college altogether and going straight to the NBA, and finally to the young women luring him to the big universities with questionable ""recruiting"" practices, and there is also the sultry, Delilah-like girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson), who states point-blank that she's out to get hers too because once Jesus goes pro, she'll be forgotten. The only person capable of steering the son clear of these dangers is the guidance of the father, who's seeking his own redemption as well as the forgiveness and love of the son.<br/><br/>""He Got Game"" remains one of Spike Lee's most passionate and cinematically mature efforts, despite a few missteps along the way. The ending is a great step from the usual ""reality"" of most traditional Hollywood endings, yet a further sign that Lee is maturing as a filmmaker. It's powerful, it's moving, and it has game. ""He Got Game"" proves once and for all, that the man behind the camera also has game.<br/><br/>9/10"
"michaelsibley416","Null","1","2","6 September 2004"," very disappointing
","Denzel Washington and Ray Allen were excellent but other than that I didn't really think this film worked. <br/><br/>The plot was simple enough: convince your son to go to a certain college and you will get reduced time off your sentence. I expected Spike Lee to do a b job with bringing father and son closer together. I fear Spike Lee ""He Got Game"" for several reasons and none of them include giving the audience a good product <br/><br/>Another problem that this film has is the fact that it has more than enough graphic sexual content and language. It could have been a lot better if the sexual content and some of the language were edited out of the script.<br/><br/>With the exception of the two leads, basketball stars such as Rick Fox and Walter McCarty overshadowed the rest of the cast. For this reason alone, I would recommend ""He Got Game."""

","Spike Lee makes a movie for Disney.It was only a matter of time before Spike tried his hand at a basketball film and this is a worthwhile if flawed effort. Denzel Washington is great as Jake and the film is directed brilliantly. However half way through it is easy to see how the whole thing is going to end and the whole finish disappoints. Still there is much to enjoy here such as the use of Aaron Copland's stirring music and the towering performance of Mr Washington."

","For a filmmaker that shows so much promise at times, Spike Lee has thrown up a real stinker with ""He Got Game.""  I will, however, begin by saying that the idea for the film and one of the performances given (Denzel Washington) are not bad at all.  Also, some of Lee's shot decisions and use of different filming techniques are adventurous and laudable. BUT... I am shocked to see so many good reviews of this movie, and for several reasons A., the dialogue and script, in general, are trite and poorly written. Perhaps Spike would be better off getting someone else to write his movies. Truly poor. B., the premise, notably the ""deal"" given to Washington by the governor, is absolutely far-fetched and ill-conceived.  This is a premise that could only be accepted if it were from an established director (which Lee is). C., as mentioned many times by other reviewers, Lee's use of sex and portrayal of women seems misogynistic and baseless.  Should the sexual temptations of a man in Jesus' position be addressed in this film?  Yes. But in this way?  Give me a break.  I think Lee is still smarting from getting turned down for the prom too many times. Quite frankly, this movie is poorly conceived and disjointed.  So much so that the ending, which could be inventive, leaves us scratching our heads. It's time for Spike to start living up to his potential instead of coasting off the merits of his first film attempts."

","Denzel Washington and writer-director Spike Lee team for the third time with this contemporary basketball drama focusing on a promising athlete, the son of a convict-father entitled,He Got Game.It is sports-drama film written and directed Lee. It stars Washington as Jake Shuttlesworth, a prison inmate convicted for killing his wife. The father of the top- ranked basketball prospect in the country, Jesus Shuttlesworth,played by NBA star Ray Allen, Jake is released on parole for a week by the state's governor in order to persuade his son to play for the governor's alma mater in exchange for a heavily-reduced prison sentence.The film also features Milla Jovovich,John Turturro,Rosario Dawson and Jim Brown with Ned Beatty and John Turturro.<br/><br/>Jake Shuttlesworth has been in prison for six years when tough prison- warden Wyatt tells him that he's getting a temporary parole with the promise of a commuted sentence. However, there's a trade-off -- Jake must talk his son, Jesus Shuttlesworth, the top-ranked high-school basketball player in the country, into signing with the governor's alma mater, Big State. A flashback makes it clear that Jesus' mother was accidentally killed by Jake during a violent family fight. After Jake went to prison, the resentful Jesus was left alone to raise his sister Mary. Now several colleges are offering Jesus scholarships, and montages satirize the manner in which young athletes are wooed by educators and coaches across the country. However, Jake will soon be back behind bars if he can't get Jesus to sign with Big State within the week. Meanwhile, the greed of other family members begins to surface.<br/><br/>The movie presents a realistic view on how athletes particularly basketball players are recruited by universities in their rosters.Aside from that,it also presents a vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama that would touch the viewers.Lee provides an artsy color film feature that was aided by great music from Aaron Copeland and Public Enemy.The story is moving especially when it becomes personal on both Jake and Jesus' part.The performances of Denzel Washington and Ray Allen,in his film debut,are also worthy to be mentioned. Overall,it may not be a great film but it is still worth your time especially for people who loves basketball."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","3","30 August 2008"," contrived but powerful and mostly well crafted religious (yes, religious) fable
","It's not only that He Got Game's young main character is named Jesus- though that is a very obvious point writer/director Spike Lee puts out there just to nail it (no pun intended) across- but just the entire scope of the picture, individual scenes, that paint this as a kind of modern religious fable. God isn't exactly present throughout the picture (surely the sex scenes and 'bad' language don't make it very holy for many audiences), but Lee's tale, however contrived to fit around the premise of a convict (Denzel Washington) being released for a week to try and lock-down his estranged son into a college the governor wants, strikes a chord almost in spite of its limitations. It's about forgiveness on a base level, about resisting temptations on all fronts, about reconciliation, and about not becoming holier than thou. In a strange way having the character named Jesus deflects the whole point: Jake, Jesus's father, named him for a *former* NBA player nicknamed Jesus, a sweet irony unto itself.<br/><br/>What's most surprising for me is that within the set boundaries of the contrivances, both in the grand piece of the premise and in little occurrences like Jake being situated right next door to a beat up prostitute, Spike Lee has created a work of fiery passion and care and detail. It's a good script first and foremost as just a morality tale played out as realistically as imaginable (or as realistically in a Joint of his) and then elevated through his steadfast direction and the performances. No accident then that basketball is both the main focus of the trials and tribulations of the characters of Jake and Jesus in the story AND Spike Lee's main joy aside from film-making. It goes without saying there are still pieces of social commentary throughout, not least of which from a character named 'Big Time' who rolls around Coney Island pontificating about ""life on the streets"" or more obviously by the traps of fame and fortune in pro-basketball in colleges. It's how Lee works in the real personal issues, of the more intimate scenes (and not the ones you think are intimate, not sex scenes save for a brief one between Jovovich and Washington), that makes it work.<br/><br/>So, amid the high-flying camera shots and subliminal editing and specific usage of colors and filters as metaphors and the slow-motion shots of the basketball flying through the air as if out in space and lost in time, with taking aside Lee's firm strengths here as a filmmaker, the acting shines out better than expected. In his one real performance (he's appeared in one other film that may or may not have been smaller), Ray Allen plays Jesus without pretension and without ever sounding much of a false note. It could come off as weak to some as he occasionally tries to rise up to the challenge of getting to that level of his fellow actors emotionally. Some may say that, which is fine. But with the scenes he had with the likes of Denzel Washington he held his own wonderfully, with his older quasi-counterpart delivering another great turn in a Lee picture. While it also goes without saying the two of them are stuck in a manipulative ""uplifting"" ending with the ball flying over one wall into the court, they're actors made for this kind of story and characters- they also play a mean game of ball to boot in a (pleasantly) uncharacteristic one-on-one climax game.<br/><br/>He Got Game has its clichés, its sentimental bits, and its characters brought over from other sports-related dramas. It's also wiser than other crude Hollywood product, it's got sharper and nearly quintessential Spike Lee dialog, and it even features a perfect semblance of rousing score from Aaron Copeland and very cool songs from Public Enemy. And if it delivers a message that isn't too hackneyed under the circumstances, that's fine too, and with everything against it via its premise Lee's made one of his better pictures- good even if you're not big into the sport. 8.5/10"
"webnutt","8","1","3","11 August 2007"," Quietlly its probably Spike's best movie!!!
","He Got Game is basically a story of redemption for a conflicted family of father and son played over the setting of basketball. The movie alludes to so many possible and actual struggles a man may face but its particularly speaking whether intentionally or subliminally of the African American experience. Though one may not see the plot being focused as it tends to go in several different directions, at times its a perfectly frustrating example of how out of control a life may become if the right choices aren't made.<br/><br/>Denzel's portrayal of Jake Shuttlesworth is a prime example of a flawed but strong willed individual who angrily imposes himself onto his son to succeed at where he most likely failed. In the process he pushes his son away and in a sense sends him on a path to be that same angry man he became. Ray Allen as Jesus Shuttlesworth has so many options but no answers as he takes the weight of the world on his shoulders. His character is that of kid presented with choices forcing him to become a man. But without guidance since he essentially raised himself and his sister in the absence of his father and death of his mother, Jesus is vulnerable to all the temptation around him.<br/><br/>Spike Lee forces points down your throat unnecessarily with explicit sex scenes which he does way too often in just about all of his films but though uncomfortable, it works in the aspect of this film. Seeing Jesus and Jake grind it out in a game of one on one is a great climax brought to a head after Jesus's several rejections of his father acceptance and Jake's realization of his time running out. The lesson taught is a great lesson learned and in the end redemption is found through the strength of understanding between father and son."

The daughter is missing her father but her brother is isolating her. The uncle and aunt only see the money the son represents. He is a high school star in basketball and he can get directly into making a lot of money if he joins the NBA or he can go to some university and have a scholarship. One more tricky element: the governor wants the kid for the team of his university, the one he sponsors and likes. So why not use the father, give him a week of semi freedom and force him thus to negotiate his son's signing the right papers. What's more the basketball star is invited by some schools to come and visit and there he is provided with everything he may desire, including the girls and the useless other entertainments. The NBA is offering a car to the uncle, though in fact it is for the son to run it. And the high school coach is able to put ten thousand dollars on the table for him to join, guess what, the NBA of course. Immoral. The film is saved from this muddy marshlandish country by the son choosing the only moral solution, the one that will help his father to get out faster, the one that is going to cure him from his hatred, even if that is slightly idealistic, frankly Utopian.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
"rmax304823","6","1","3","12 July 2007"," All over the court but sometimes compelling.
","The director, Spike Lee, has got talent. No question about it. He stylizes the film with momentary flashbacks and slow motion -- but just enough. Not so much as to interfere with the narrative or attract attention to the director. And the photography, as is usual in his films, is truly splendid. Coney Island never looked quite so inviting, at least not for the last fifty years or so.<br/><br/>The story -- the best high school basketball player being tempted with all sorts of material benefits to sign up for prestigious schools -- gives Lee a chance to indulge his fascination with basketball. I must admit that basketball never fascinated me. When I was a kid there was nothing but baseball. But, now, it seems that instant gratification trumps patience. Who wants to wait for the pitcher to dig his cleated shoe into the mound, remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow, acknowledge signals from the catcher, glance at first base, the wind up, the pitch, the call -- yawn. Basketball is all motion by regulation.<br/><br/>Still, ""White Men Can't Jump"" was a pretty good movie about basketball. And ""He Got Game"" doesn't have that much basketball in it, and nothing at all that's technical. It's chiefly a story of Ray Allen, who must choose a lesser school or see his father (Denzel Washington) go back to Attica. And it's the story of the relationship between Washington, who accidentally offed his wife, and Allen, who despises his father. There isn't really a boring moment in it, although, to be sure, it wanders all over the place and explores, however briefly and unsatisfactorily, a number of issues and the conflicts they generate.<br/><br/>Lee has chosen to use Aaron Copeland's music to provide a symphonic score that is curiously at odds with the lives we're watching. The visuals get down on their knees and sob for hip hop. Yet the score is appropriate because it helps to universalize a story that otherwise might seem locked into too narrow a cultural setting.<br/><br/>Ray Allen, sports figure, can't act very well. He's an object of envy anyway. Full of principle, for one thing. Old Denzel's future would have been lost the moment that Italian salesman offered me the two-million dollar platinum watch. Also, is there a greater imaginable thrill on Planet Earth than getting it on with Rosario Dawson while in the cage of one of those giant swings in the amusement park? Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances and the others are easily up to par, especially Bill Nunn as Allen's new Dad who is unable to see any future that doesn't include diamond pinkie rings and a new Lexus. He's hilarious.<br/><br/>I've always been chary of Spike Lee since ""Do the Right Thing,"" which closes with admonishments from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcom X -- in that climactic order. The last words were ""by any means necessary."" When the goal to be achieved is something as vague and general as ""freedom"" or ""democracy"", using any means you consider necessary can get you into trouble. Instead of achieving freedom you're liable to achieve jail, and instead of achieving democracy you're liable to achieve a somebody else's civil war. There are sentiments that belong on bumper stickers and nowhere else.<br/><br/>However, Lee's films generally have been far from rabble rousers, and ""He Got Game"" is no exception. It's a well-done drama with a couple of clunkers in it. (A magic basketball sails all the way from Attica's exercise yard to the court at Big State University.) The whole thing, weaknesses notwithstanding, is odd but gripping. We really DO want to see how it turns out."

","Director Spike Lee loves basketball. You can see him court side at Knicks games. A basketball movie fits right in with his love and this one starring Denzel Washington as a father let out of prison to convince his son to sign for the Governor's alma mater is not a bad movie. Of course Denzel's mission is complicated by the fact that he is in prison for killing his son's mother, and he named him ""Jesus."" Try to overcome that! But, we do get a good father-son movie in the attempt.<br/><br/>Really, anytime we get to see Denzel is a good thing, and this also has Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) and Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Grindhouse), and birthday girl, Jennifer Esposito. Of course, crash is a better vehicle for seeing Jennifer, but this one was available for a birthday tribute.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like about Lee's movies is, that with few exceptions, he portrays all his female characters (in the current vernacular) as ""nappy headed ho's."" This one is no exception."

Washington doesn't really have great lines with which to work; the magic in his portrayal is more subtle and elemental. Ray Allen is almost as good as Denzel.<br/><br/>Stylistically, even almost a decade later this is a remarkably edited film, with a great score. Despite dealing with many disturbing themes, this is ultimately a very enjoyable story. I think I enjoyed it more recently than when it was released."

","I brought this film from ebay a couple of months ago as you can never find it anywhere in England. Iwatch it and i thought it was an abslute perfection from the amazing Spike Lee and far superior to a lot of his other movies at the time. I like this Lee film in particular though because it is more character driven and has more emotion to most of Lee's films. Denzel Washington has again proved he is one of the all time greatest living actors with his strong performance as Jake Shuttlesworth who makes friends in the film with a prostitute (beautifully played by Milla Jovovich). But what also surprises me about this film is the fact that the main character Jesus Shuttlesworth played by Ray Allen is not even an actor! Yet his performance is extraordinary in this is one of the best i've seen in any Spike Lee film just after Denzel's in Malcolm x and Edward Norton's in 25th Hour. All in all the stylish story, acting,cinematography and the mastery of Lee's directing this is one of my instant Spike LEE classics. Ten out of ten."

There is absolutely nothing pathetic about this film, in fact as huge fan of both Spike Lee and Denzel Washington, this was my favorite film with the two of them working together.  The cinematography is just beautiful - I remember sitting in the theater and saying ""who the hell shot this?"" and as far as Denzel not being totally on point, that's a crock of sh*t.  He is so in the right as is Rosario Dawson, who's obviously just a born natural.  If there was any stiffness in the film, it was in the acting skills of Denzel's son, but what do you want from someone that's really a basketball player and not a trained actor?  As for the scenes between Milla and Denzel, yeah, that sub plot doesn't totally work, but it certainly doesn't hurt the film.  If anything, I think Spike Lee grew up a lot with this movie.

Public Enemy's music was terrific - especially the title song 'He got Game'. I think this movie did a lot for Denzel - it enabled him to make the jump from a terrific actor to a real star.

The cumulative impact is powerful even if you're not sure about some of the details. But the main plotline with Washington is pretty familiar and doesn't amount to much whichever character you concentrate on - we've all seen such familial pressures/strife played out at the intersection of sports and tough love before. The subplot of Washington finding genuine tenderness with hooker Jovovich is pretty useless too. Lee's montages are wonderful but the Aaron Copland music may actually be TOO stirring and much of the film resembles nothing as much as image ads for the NBA. Generally engrossing but overall too long."

It lacked the usual edge of a Spike Lee film and I found nothing compelling about the characters or story. I kept watching in hopes of seeing some good ball footage. The cameo appearances were the only fun parts. A sappy movie that would be weak; even if made for TV. It's NBA playoff season and I DO love the game.

","First of all, I'd just like to make clear that I haven't seen any other Spike Lee films, and I mainly saw it because of Milla Jovovich. Maybe that's why I found it to be decent at best... maybe I should have seen some other Spike Lee films first, to get used to his style. Or maybe I shouldn't have expected Milla to have a big or important role(because she certainly didn't seem to have that here). Actually, I believe one could edit out all of her scenes without actually taking anything important away from the plot... without having an impact on any aspect of the movie, apart from its length. Of course, I'm not unhappy Milla had a role in the movie(if she hadn't had one, I probably wouldn't have seen the movie at all)... I'm just a little disappointed that her role was so empty and seemingly pointless. The plot is OK, but nothing too impressive... maybe it's my lack of understanding of black culture, but I really don't get the whole hysteria surrounding basketball. And this, lets not beat around the bush, is a movie about basketball. Concordantly, I don't see what the big deal is. The pacing is bad... but then again, maybe it's just that I'm not used to Lee as a director. But I was bored most of the time. Some of the dialog is OK, a little of it is even halfway good... but most of it isn't. The characters are well-written but not always credible. The acting is OK... Denzel turns in a great performance, as usual. Apart from him, though, the only impressive actor in the lot was Milla Jovovich. She portrayed her character really well. The lead playing opposite Denzel was a poor actor... I know that he's a basketball player in real life, but couldn't they at the very least have done about his acting skills, or replaced him with an actual actor? He did a terrible job of carrying half of the movie on his shoulders... had it not been for Denzel, I wouldn't have been able to watch any of it, I think(apart from Milla's scenes). You want to see a good something-other-than-actor-turned-actor giving a great first-time performance? See 8 Mile. Check out Eminem. Now that's acting. The film as a whole just isn't interesting enough, I think, and has far too few worthwhile moments to make it worth sitting through. The only redeeming factor of the movie is, you guessed it, Milla Jovovich. I bought the film(low-price, don't worry... I'm not a complete idiot) because she's in it, I saw it(well... some of it... didn't manage to pay attention for the whole thing) because she's in it, and what I liked of it(which was very little) was because she's in it. I don't know... maybe Spike Lee is just one of those directors/writers that you have to get used to before you can really enjoy their work. I recommend this to fans of Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich. Fans of Spike Lee might want to see this too(I assume, but I have no idea how this is in comparison to his other films). 5/10"

"xaleber","8","0","1","18 November 2017"," A simple story of a father, a son, atonement, and of course, Basketball....
","After directing Malcolm X, Spike Lee, along with John Singleton ('Boyz N the Hood'), became arguably the most popular and respected African American filmmaker of his time. Lee's wife, however, didn't like the fact that her husband's last original screenplay was nearly a decade ago and was vocal about it. Lee, then, decided to go back to do what originally launched him into the filmmaking world: writing and directing his own material. And although 'Malcolm X', an adaptation, was the biggest success of Lee's career, his rekindled desire to bring his own, fully original, story to the screen was the spark that led to 'He Got Game'.<br/><br/>The film opens with an almost five-minute montage of people playing basketball, shooting, dunking, pivoting, blocking and what have you. Spike Lee, a huge Knicks fan, believes it's worth to spend five minutes of screen time with nothing but the basketball and the music, composed of several orchestral pieces by Aaron Coplan ('Raging Bull'). The montage ends with Jesus Shuttlesworth ('Ray Allen'), in the basketball court, shooting the ball, followed by Jake Shuttleworth ('Denzel Washington'), his father, in Attica's Correctional Facility, shooting the ball as well, and one can already feel that the only connection, if any, between that father and his son is basketball. Following that intro, Spike Lee begins to utilize the old fashioned three-act structure to begin his story.<br/><br/>The warden calls Jake to his office, and we get to know about Jake's past and who he is through the warden's interview with him. The warden finally lays it out on the table and tells Jake what's what. The governor wants Jake to convince his son, Jesus, who is the number 1 basketball prospect in the country, to play for Big State University in exchange for a reduced sentence. Jake agrees and becomes wired by the two parole officers who will keep in touch with him. He got three days before he's sent back to Attica.<br/><br/>Jake starts by meeting Mary, his little daughter, first, as that, in his mind, would make it easier for him to contact his son. When his son enters the house, he doesn't look his father in the eyes and scolds his sister for allowing a ""stranger"" in. Throughout the film, the father, during his numerous and brief encounters with his son, tries to convince Jesus to go to Big State, but with no success. Their past is so dark that no light could break through.<br/><br/>In the best sequence of the film, during the last night of Jake's parole, he plays a defining basketball game in his final hours as a free man. If he wins, Jesus goes to Big State. If Jesus wins, Jake goes back to Attica. The stakes are high and as Jake plays and scores some points he begins to let go and shifts from wanting a reduced sentence to wanting forgiveness from Jesus (pun intended) and his murdered wife. He accepts his fate. He chooses the worse in hope of gaining the better later on. Only when they were separated again did he and his son connect more than they ever did.<br/><br/>To call 'He Got Game' bad would be an understatement and to call it good would be euphemistic. The film pushes some buttons in the human nature and emotions but you never feel a solid film. Overlong at parts and extremely short at others, the film tries to find its rhythm during its two-hour running time and doesn't quite get it right, but with all its flaws, it came out watchable, if intriguing, at parts."

He sells everything, and can even make bad movies seem good. And, overall, I think the story is rather strong.

The difference between Ray Allen and Denzel Washington does mean that the father gets the lead. The best scene is Big Time Willie laying down some knowledge. I also love uncle Bubba. The NBA agent does need a better actor. I don't really care about Dakota but again, the father's story gets elevated simply for Denzel. In fact, a lot of Jake's story don't completely add up. It's a side character that would serve well staying as a side character. Ray Allen turns out to be a functional actor although he's no star and he's no Denzel."

","He Got Game (1998): Dir: Spike Lee / Cast: Denzel Washington, Milla Jovovich, Hill Harper, Ned Beatty, Ray Allen: Thought provoking yet disappointing film about regret and reestablishment. Denzel Washington stars as a prison inmate given opportunity to reduce his sentence after an incident that killed his wife in front of his two children. His oldest son Jesus became a pro basketball player to support his family. Great concept driven to formula and a useless subplot regarding a prostitute whom Washington assists. Another problem is the name Jesus regarded with inappropriate humour. Spike Lee continues his portrayals of the black community. He previously made such films as Malcolm X, Crooklyn and Jungle Fever. Here he must rely on his lead to carry it. Washington deserves credit as he attempts to mend his past and reach his son. Aside from that this film is all downhill. Milla Jovovich as the prostitute could have been left out. It does nothing for the film other this cast an attractive female in the film. Also appearing are Hill Harper and Ned Beatty in cardboard roles. Ray Allen is given the name Jesus, which comes across as a distasteful distraction pending on one's beliefs. He is Washington's star playing son. Fine theme regarding talents and redemption that unfortunately doesn't match Lee's usual work. So, whatever game Lee previously had, he certainly didn't have it here. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

","Normally in films, a father bonding with his son is a peaceful scene; tossing a baseball back and forth, fishing with each other, and talking about life. However in the 1998 film, He Got Game, father and son bonding is pushed to the extreme when Denzel Washington and youthful NBA player, Ray Allen take to the big screen to portray a different side of the cliché relationship. Directed, written, and produced by the legendary Spike Lee, who I have always been a fan of and I can't name too many blemishes on Denzel Washington's filmography either. I first went into the film with great expectations and still was amazed by the content of the movie! The only spark of skepticism I had was the fact that Ray Allen had a lead role. Spike Lee didn't have to cast an NBA player for Jesus' character. Any young actor could have took the role but he gave it to someone who never acted before. Having a basketball player as the main character was a risk but Ray Allen came through and delivered a great performance. Usually, athletes who try their hand at acting make their fans lose a bit of respect for them — see Michael Jordan in Space Jam and Shaq in anything. He Got Game is a great film for many reasons but mainly because of the acting displays, intense plot, and the transformation of the main characters. The movie follows number one high school basketball prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth (Allen) struggling with the decision on where he will continue his basketball career after graduating and the media that a decision like that attracts along with the strains placed on family and romantic ties. Meanwhile, in the Attica Correctional Facility, Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington) is spending time in prison for murdering his wife; Jesus' mother. With everyone wanting to get Jesus to come to their respective college or professional team, the governor offers Jake Shuttlesworth less time on his sentencing if he can convince his son to play basketball for his alma mater. Jake is let go on house arrest and given a week to make this happen which really doesn't seem like enough time since his son hates the sight of him. Throughout the film, the time period switches from the present day where Jesus is making his decision to the past where he used to get physically challenged by his father on the basketball court before his mother's passing. This addition really lifts the movie and gives it more emotion. What I really love is that the film really digs into the controversies of collegiate recruiting all while maintaining its main plot points and theme. During the recruiting process, lots of students are persuaded by cars, money, and other gifts and Spike Lee wasn't hesitant to bring light to those discrepancies throughout the movie. Jesus and his younger sister live in their own apartment where Jesus pays the rent but nothing is ever mentioned of him having a job. Also, in the beginning, Jesus' girlfriend tries to get him to meet a friend of her family who is an agent but Jesus aggressively declines and tells her ""you know that sh!t is illegal."" Including this in the film was genius because it makes the movie more real by showing something ugly about basketball and not just the glamorous lifestyle and flashy dunks. Being a basketball fan, my opinion of the film may be a little bias but I loved every minute of it. It's a rather long film, clocking in at 136 minutes but it goes by so fast, it will leave viewers wanting more! With great acting from Washington and Allen, a well-polished story line, and a vintage soundtrack, this movie is one of my favorites. I don't only suggest this movie for fans who would be able to point out former NBA players' cameos and classic '90's sneakers worn throughout the film. I think anyone who loves a great, dramatic movie with intense scenes and amazing acting would enjoy He Got Game."

","He Got Game is a very enjoyable film. The cinematography is top drawer and the dialog crisply written. The movie explores the moral conflicts surrounding a prospective college basketball player. As soon as various interests decided that he is worth something to them, they pull all the stops on recruiting him to their school. Ray Allen plays the college prospect, Jesus, and Denzel Washington plays his convict father Jay. Ray and Jake are estranged after Jake accidentally kills his wife and Jesus's mother in a moment of passion. Now Jake must balance a release from prison against doing what is best for his Jay. Milla Jovavich and Rosario Dawson add to the fine cast.<br/><br/>Many may shy away because it is a Spike Lee film, but the movie isn't a sermon about race relations.

","My two favorite Spike Lee movies are ""Clockers"" and ""He Got Game"" and they share similarities: both are about guys trying to keep integrity amidst characters whose primary motives are to persuade him to leave the path.<br/><br/>""He Got Game"" gets the edge because I love basketball and because I'm a sucker for well done father-son conflicts. The basketball parts of this movie are absolutely brilliantly shot. Most sports movies share two commonalities: completely ridiculous story lines and actors who throw like sissies. He Got Game avoids both.<br/><br/>Okay, some parts of the story are hoky, but allowable. But what makes this movie work, similar to ""Clockers"" is that you get sucked into a main character whose nobility is tested at every turn. Will Jesus Shuttlesworth make it through the maze or fall prey to it? And will he be able to recognize that his father is not just one more flesh peddler? It makes for good drama. But above that, the basketball scenes just completely rock. They're examples of absolutely masterful cinematography and editing. In fact, the movie has some of the best montage sequences every put on film. Seriously.<br/><br/>Denzel is excellent in this movie. He plays a Jeckyll and Hyde and plays both sides well. This conflicted character was very easy to root for. (I can identify.) NBA perennial All-Star Ray Allen, while more than a little stiff at times, holds his own as a non-actor in a dramatic role.<br/><br/>He Got Game is a flawed piece of work: parts drag, it's not without its hokiness, and the subplot with Denzel and Jojovovich didn't quite fit. But the essential story lines work and play true: you believe in a conflict between father and son and you root for a high school basketball player who requires the wisdom of an adult to avoid the flesh peddlers. Kudos to Spike for not trying to hit us over the had with his message, but letting it unravel naturally."

","This is one of Spike Lee's best films. And the use of Copland's music only punctuated what absolute tenderness was already there. One of the last scenes when Washington's character throws the basketball over the prison wall and impossibly into Jesus's court while playing (one of the obvious interpretations of this scene being ""the ball is now in his court"") is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen--pure magic. That last scene is so full of meaning and symbolism that it overpowers the mind with all the instinctual emotions that goes with that scene: namely the often difficult and mythic relationship between fathers and sons, forgiveness, acceptance, and of course transcendence."

","I thought Spike was very careful, maybe too careful in trying not to duplicate the movie 'Blue Chips'. The big risk he took in this movie was fictionalizing something that is not all that fictional in the recruitment of inner-city youths - that is, the family issues, the pressure of sudden notoriety, and the pressure from recruiters that these kids face. Personally, I thought he displayed this pretty accurately, while others I know who have seen this movie thought that much of it was far fetched, especially that a governor would be involved. Still, everyone I have talked to about this movie was impressed with Ray Allen's performance. If you're not a Spike Lee fan to begin with, nor have ever been through the college recruiting process, this movie won't make you a Spike Lee fan.

The last scene of the movie has symbolism, in that while Washington is playing basketball in Attica, his son is playing in Big State university (Part of a deal by the governor to recruit the boy into his alma mater in exchange for lessening the father's remaining sentence), their actions are mirrored, and when Jake sends his ball skyward, it drops right in the lap of Jesus, where he takes the ball and finally smiles and accepts his father. I also see it as the ball being the North Star which led Jesus to Bethlehem, and guided his road to wisdom from then on. See it by all means."

","Denzel is a great actor and shows his versatility in this role. I appreciate Spike's use of Ray Allen. Though he does not act well his average acting skills bring a bit of realness to his role and I knew he drew upon personal experience in playing this role. I liked how Spike used the backdrop of the hood. The supporting cast was great as well and Spike Lee usually makes full use of them. As a person who is from Brooklyn I love how Spike made use of the rides and the love making scenes were particularly good.

Its only competition: Hoosiers, White Man Can't Jump, and, maybe, Blue Chips (really, though, Ray Allen and Rick Fox, do a hell of a better job than Shaq and Penny Hordaway). This movie seemed a bit questionable acting- wise, with Ray Allen having the supporting role and Rosaria Dawson playing Jesus's girlfriend, but honestly, it's pretty hard to tell (Milla Jovavich is even in the movie); of course, it all centers around Denzel's performance, and he does an excellent job. Spike Lee put together another great movie. Personally, I liked how he did the subplot cut scenes, as they quickly come while people are talking about them; all of them easy to understand and not drawn out as in most movies. Of course Spike's most artistic touch came at the very end; an excellent abstract scene to close the film. My only problem with the movie was the over-usage of the dramatic, classical music; it felt as if it didn't fit right with what was going on in the scene. This is only a minor problem, though. Overall: 9/10."

There are many aspects to this film that make it a great one, from the plot in general, to the characters and their development, and the sound track as well. <br/><br/>It did, however, seem as though Spike Lee was almost getting too sidetracked in some areas of the plot. The films primarily seemed to focus around the relationship between the father (Jake) and his son (Jesus), but it seemed as though Spike Lee added to many unnecessary smaller stories happening throughout the movie. One of the side plots that happened was the relationship with Jesus and their next-door neighbor, who happened to be a prostitute. Another event going on was the fathers whole issues with his two parole officers, and it also seemed that this movie did not even necessarily have to be so much about the sport of basketball.<br/><br/>Something else that was bothering about this film was how unrealistic the situation was that took place in it, with the compromise or trade that had been agreed upon. It just simply would never happen that some one would agree to let an accused murderer out of jail early in order to have a very talented high school basket ball player agree to play for certain school. Another unrealistic aspect to this film was how much Spike Lee blew up the seriousness of being recruited, although it could have just been the town they lived in, much like the film ""Friday Night Lights"" and the seriousness that occurred there. <br/><br/>Although in the latter, many negative aspects were pointed out, all in all it was a great film; it had an extremely interesting plot that kept ones attention throughout the whole film."

As the two confront the past and struggle to accept each other's lives, basketball is all they have in common. Jesus and his girlfriend Lala (Rosario Dawson) are both faced with the harsh reality of greed, sex, drugs, bribery, and the gritty life of professional basketball. Meanwhile, Jake copes with life as a lonely felon while mending his relationships with his children. The film allows the audience to get to know each character on a deeply personal level and in an entertaining way. <br/><br/>Lee uses very creative filming techniques to make potentially boring sequences intriguing and engaging. From introducing Jesus' basketball team to reading letters, the shots and angles are continually changing on-screen. The most effective technique would have to be the editing of parallel scenes between father and son, showing their athletic similarities and identical mannerisms unbeknownst to them to the audience. As always, Denzel Washington gives a brilliant performance. Ray Allen, a professional basketball player, portrays the character of Jesus. He makes a fairly weak actor, but his role is strengthened by his costars Washington and the under-rated, Dawson.<br/><br/>He Got Game was a surprisingly enjoyable film. It was able to balance the contrast between attention grabbing basketball scenes and emotional father-son moments. The film portrays the bitter truth of professional sports, as awful and selfish as it can seem, making it darker and more graphic than many people prefer. I would recommend this film to anyone, especially to sports or Denzel fans. Overall, He Got Game was an exciting, beautiful, and well-made film showing what it takes to ""have game"" whether it's on the court, or behind the camera."

This movie is about a basketball star who is trying to figure out who really cares about him at a time when he needs guidance the most. I thought that the performance given by Denzel Washington as Jesus' father was excellent, and I was surprised by the performance given by Ray Allen as Jesus Shuttlesworth, considering he is not really known as an actor. I thought that he did a very good job, and created a very believable character. The one thing that I did not like about this movie was that I thought that it was a little too long, and I thought that it could have been shortened.

His father Jake Shuttlesworth (Washington), is serving time in prison for killing Jesus's mother (Lonette McKee) The warden tells Jake that the governor wants his son (Jesus) to go to college at his alma mater, Big State. If Jesus does go, Jake's time in prison will be cut shorter. So Jake gets parole and goes to Coney Island to convince his son to go to Big State. At the same time, he wants to heal his estranged relationship with his son. ""He Got Game"" is a powerful film. The performance by Washington is great, not Oscar worthy, but great. ""He Got Game"" also marked the ""mainstream"" film debut of Rosario Dawson. The film's score consists of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy giving the film a huge plus.

"namos333","9","0","2","22 April 2004"," what is the problem...?
","I'd just like to present my views on some talking points regarding 'He Got Game' - The whole thing about the sex - people are completely misunderstanding Spike Lee as a filmmaker. His movies are not supposed to be completely realistic, they are stylized, lyrical, and poetic. This film was misinterpreted as being a literal account of a young bball player's journey towards the NBA and the pressures he faces. In actuality, it is a fictional vehicle for Lee to present his ideas. I mean, look at his other movies - Do the Right Thing, Clockers, Summer of Sam - these movies are all believed to be serious, realistic pictures, when in fact they are not at all. They deal with serious issues that Lee wants to discuss and get out there, but they are presented in ways for him to do so, not for him to tell a real life story with real characters. The only movie of his that I feel is not at least somewhat sylized is Malcolm X, for obvious reasons. Lee has his own cinematic language, and it is not meant to be taken literally; the sex scenes that everyone loves to get red in the face and rave about were just a representation of the temptations the Jesus character faces. About the name, it's obviouslly supposed to be somewhat absurd, and the conversation between father and son simply reveals that Jesus was in fact named after Earl Monroe, who really was nicknamed Jesus. I'm not sure why this is so hard to understand. It's kind of a joke, you see, and the scene where Jake tells Jesus this is an example of Lee's amazing propensity for honest and funny dialogue. He is not supposed to be Jesus Christ or anything of the sort. Who says that Jesus is a perfect character? He is drawn into the temptations and excess laid before him, and he treats his girlfriend like crap at the end. He's pretty much a typical kid, clearly something Lee tried to convey. That argument is ludicrous, that he is too a perfect character, I mean. As for the ending, it simply is yet another example as to how Spike's films are not literal, they are artistic. It wouldn't be so hard to figure out the ending if you realize that the whole movie had not been completely literal up to that point, and this was just an exaggeration of that tone. Jake is reaching out to his son from prison, which is a beautiful representation of the two men connecting after a tumultuous relationship. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I'm often baffled as to why it is so lowly regarded. I really wish Lee could get some of the credit he deserves for his incredible body of work; the dude can't even get his Joe Louis project off the ground, which is an absolute disgrace that the Hollywood community should be ashamed about. How can Spike Lee not be allowed to make a movie about Joe Louis, while utter crap pollutes the cineplex every single week? Racism, politics, or whatever is causing this absurdity needs to subside so people can see Lee as possibly the most distinctive filmmaker in American history."

","Far more than a movie about basketball, Spike Lee's ""He Got Game"" is a masterpiece ripe with Biblical imagery, valuable lessons about truth, and a compelling, grasping story about a father's struggle to regain his son's love.  It is a must-see for any fan of Spike Lee or basketball, the holy game that this film revolves around.  I fell in love with this film immediately after seeing it, and with every subsequent viewing I have discovered something new about it.  Whether it is Spike Lee choosing to fill a scene with green light (symbolizing greed and money) or by having Jesus and his father touch their nose the exact same way at the exact same time to show how truly alike they are, ""He Got Game"" dazzles the viewer with its subtlety.  Denzel Washington's performance is amazing, portraying a sincerity rarely seen in any role by any actor. The Biblical untertones found in this film set it apart from other sports-themed movies.  Whether it is Jesus being tempted time and time again with wealth and fame, or Lala's candid remark, ""Jesus, your life is set.""(Hinting at the Biblical Jesus's pre-determined fate to be a savior) Furthermore, in the end, Jesus does his father's bidding, placing him in the role of a savior.  Simply put, this film is a masterpiece, a stroke of genius.  It is without a doubt my personal favorite film and the most beautiful look at the holy game to date."

","Well known for his style and method of story telling, Spike Lee directed another great movie, He Got Game, a creative and different way to tell a story.  The story is about the pressures and influences placed on Jesus, a high school basketball player, by agents, coaches, family, and friends due to his impressive on- court abilities that lead him on a path of self-evaluation relative to others.  His father, Denzel Washington, has been allowed a week from prison to convince his son, played by Ray Allen, to attend `Big State,' in order for his sentence to be reduced.  Despite controversy and many worldly temptations, Jesus, a character of good virtue, stays true to his sister, his family, and most importantly, his father.  The choppy editing creates a disturbing feeling throughout, and the two hours and fifteen minutes seems to drag at times.  Overall, though, the film is original, well done, and remarkable; it does not leave you with any new aspects on life or with any visions of changing the world, but it is worth seeing because you could learn a little something about forgiveness."

","I'm not sure what to think about He Got Game. I went in expecting something, and when I left the theater I didn't feel like those expectations had been met. Can't explain why exactly, but the movie didn't seem to have the power I expected from a Spike Lee joint. He Got Game stars Denzel Washington as Jake Shuttlesworth. Jake was sent to prison a few years back for murdering his wife. While he was gone, his son Jesus (Ray Allen, former Big East player of the year from the University of Connecticut) has become the best high school basketball player in the country. The governor of the state wants Jake to persuade Jesus to go to the governors' alma mater, and if Jake can do it, he'll get out of prison earlier than expected. Jesus has never forgiven his father for what he did, so when Jake returns into Jesus' life, things don't go well. The ending was not much of a surprise, and the movie itself wasn't done as well as I had hoped.<br/><br/>I didn't know if the movie was about the relationship between Jesus and Jake, or if it was about the pressures the top high school basketball players have to go through when deciding whether to go to college or go pro. The relationship between father and son seemed strange, and I think a lot of that had to do with the inexperience of Allen as an actor, and the writing of the film. Sometimes their relationship seemed horrible, sometimes it seemed like they got along OK. I don't think Allen had a lot of range of emotions. He could speak the lines with emotion, but couldn't act the emotion at the same time, if that makes sense. As far as the pressures high school players feel, sometimes it came through, sometimes it didn't. The scene with the agent at his house, was very powerful. But the scene where Jesus argues with his uncle in his uncle's apartment just dragged on and on. I didn't get a feel for the pressure because the movie didn't show it. The writing suggested it, but it was never really portrayed on screen.<br/><br/>
And what the hell was up with the happy hooker? What was her point? She just shows up at times, has sex with Jake, they talk, she's gone. Any scene with her in it was completely pointless and took away from the rest of the movie. I just wish that there was more to the film. You know how sometimes you see a movie and you know what the filmmaker is trying to get across, but something is missing, you just can't put your finger on it? That's how I felt about He Got Game. What could have been a great film, turned out to be a so-so film."

He manages to transform from a timid docile man into the beast which he really was before he went to jail in a very subtle and intelligent way. The orchestra music, which accompanies the film, is a nice touch, because otherwise one would expect rap music in a film about a poor black neighborhood. The film is intense, and doesn't leave much space for thinking (but, of course, you have the whole night afterwards, so who's complaining?).<br/><br/>One of the funny hiccups is that the father doesn't tell his son about why he had named him Jesus until their reunion (and he had many opportunities to say that earlier). The aggressive sex scenes are too many and too violent for my taste. If they were meant to show us how difficult it is to become a succesful basketball player, then Lee should have put other equally dangerous ""habits"", such as drugs, alcohol, etc. in equal amounts.<br/><br/>Anyway, the ending is fantastic, and it DOES tell a message.

","This movie is a powerful allegory about following the Truth.  The name of Jesus Shuttlesworth is fully explained in the scene devoted to it in the movie, and is integral to getting the meaning of the film.  Jesus is a Christ like figure who is tempted to follow paths constructed for him by others to satisfy there interests instead of his.  He is looking for guidance, but cannot find it as his skeevy Uncle wants Jesus to be his cash cow, as does his coach, as does the neighborhood hood crime boss, as does even his girlfriend.  With his mother dead and his father the one who killed the only person who actually cared about her (as at that time his father pushed him miserably hard to be a good basketball player), the only person who cares about him is his sister, who is younger and whom he must take care of.  He has to overcome the pressures of being born into a poor, black ghetto while simultaneously thinking straight about what choices to make in the future with no guidance. (Possible spoilers start here.) The guidance comes from the explanation of his name by his father to him on the boardwalk.  He has to let go of the hate in his heart and make decisions with love as his guiding light.  His father didn't name him after Jesus Christ but after a basketball player nicknamed Jesus because ""he was the truth.""  When he played he was true to the game and not to the money, or to the women he would get, or the fame.  He had game, not in the way that he had good business sense or that he was a mack, but that he had the ability to make basketball a thing of beauty and purity. Jake did not approach Jesus with the hatred and domination he had when Jesus was young- the hate that killed his wife- he timidly asked his son to do him a favor out of love even though the audience can tell that Jake does knows he does not deserve forgiveness. This movie is a message to all people but explained in the setting of basketball (which has been set as all American with a montage at the beginning of the movie with people in various location of various skin colors and social backgrounds) and the Afro-American subculture. The ending is the final statement pointing the direction of the impact of the whole film straight at males in the black community, when Jake walks ""out of bounds,"" of the self hatred and destruction of black men, exemplified by being in prison and in the sights of a jet black guard's rifle, so that he can put the ball into his sons court, which at the same time visually shows no people that Jesus can turn to in the huge stadium, but also emphasizes the possibilities open to him. Even though Jake did not get free physically, he did his job as a father; not forcing his son to play basketball, but showing his how to love."

The actor plays the jailed father of basketball genius, Jesus Shuttleworth, who is ruthless in his attempt to ensure that his son escapes the ghetto through the sport.  However, what also becomes clear is that his motives are not entirely unselfish in that he also puts the hopes of the entire family upon the boy's shoulders.<br/><br/>The son understandably resents his father; in fact it's a wonder he has any contact with him at all considering the crime he was put away for!  Whilst the resentment towards his father may be justifiable, we also see that he feels that he is unable to succeed without turning his back on the neighbourhood which reared him.  An example of this is when he breaks off from his relationship with his childhood sweetheart after we see him cheating on her with some white college bimbos.<br/><br/>However, Lee doesn't seem critical of the youth's ruthless desire, on the contrary the narrative seems quite sympathetic towards him as we watch him being pulled from all angles as to where his future should lie by people who have only their own vested interests in mind.  Lee tries to focus on the fact that a young black man such as Jesus has very little choice even when it would appear from the outside that he has the world at his feet. <br/><br/>
The situation of Jesus' character reminded me much of Morris Chestnut's Ricky in John Singleton's 'Boyz N The Hood', who was tragically destroyed by his society before he could escape.  Unlike the football hopeful in Singleton's earlier film, Lee's basketball hopeful is prepared to trample on those closest to him to reach the lure of riches.  Like the character of Flipper in Lee's 'Jungle Fever' he succumbs, all be it in a less literal way, to the white temptation and thus damages his own black roots.  By placing his father as the film's central protagonist we gain a first hand perspective of the potential harm.<br/><br/>Basketball, a sport traditionally dominated by Afro-Americans, offers the ideal symbol for Lee's thought provoking critique of the flawed Afro-American Dream."
"dave fitz","8","0","2","1 August 2000"," compelling basketball movie from Spike Lee
","Spike Lee presents us with another compelling and well-made film. This time, the subject is college basketball. Jesus Shuttlesworth, played by NBA star Ray Allen, is a top high school prospect. He is being pursued by alot of top colleges. The governor is an graduate of Big State and offers Jesus's father Jake (Denzel Washington) an early parole if he can get his son to commit to Big State. Jake is in jail for killing Jesus's mom and their relationship is understandably strained and tense. The scenes with Allen and Washington are convincing and intense. The basketball scenes played by Allen are great. He really does have game! Adding to the realism, many top college coaches and NBA stars like Dean Smith and Scottie Pippen appear as themselves in an ESPN report about Jesus. <br/><br/>Everyone wants a piece of Jesus, whether it's his father, the colleges recruiting him, his uncle who helped raise him or even his girlfriend (the sexy Rosario Dawson). They all want something from him, either his presence on their team or a part of the wealth he'll get one day in the NBA. Jake wants not only an early release, but to rebuild his relationship with his son.<br/><br/>Lee's script is well-written and his direction strong, as usual. The tension between father and son and Jake's relationship with the hooker he meets (Milla Jovovich) are the high points of the film. The song in the closing credits even manages to bring together Public Enemy and Stephen Stills! 8 out of 10"
"jmarcel","8","0","2","6 June 2000"," Style and strong performances
","Lee's He Got Game displays similar gritty street imagery as his earlier Clockers. While not as captivating as the earlier movie, He Got Game, does elicit a raw sense of power and visual style which should please movie-goers. Those looking for a combination of fast breaking basketball sequences and slam dunk music video highlights will not find what they want in this film. While the movie does include a few basketball scenes, it focuses more on the human story of choice, responsibility, societal pressures, and heroism. He Got Game is a tough, human drama, flawed in some of the dialog, but with an outstanding performance from Denzel. Lee's in your face film-making once again shines through in this urban father-son relationship film."

","I don't know why some people wont just go ahead and admit they enjoyed this film. It was chock full of great filmmaking splendor. The use of an Aaron Copland alone was genius. Great characters and definitely great cinematography. Okay the dialog wasn't great and Ray Allen's performance wasn't oscar caliber(it's his first time acting!). This film still goes into my favorite films list along with other Spike Lee Joints such as Mo Better Blues, Malcolm X, and Do The Right Thing. There is no doubt in my mind that Spike Lee is one of the greatest filmmakers in history. Malcolm X, and Do The Right thing deserved to be on the AFI 100 films list. But great masterpieces like Fargo needed to be on there. Blah Blah Bladdy Blah Blah."

","No-holds-barred story-telling directed by Spike Lee vividly shows us the actual pressures felt by a young, future professional basketball star - probably the most accurate account so far on film.  Jesus Shuttlesworth is faced with many temptations along the way, but in the end he pushes all the leeches aside and does what's in the best interest for his family as a whole."
"matt77","10","0","2","29 January 2000"," A Spike Lee joint that doesn't disappoint
","Sports movies are hard to make, if just because the filmmaker has to stay within the traditional structures of a picture while incorporating exciting sports sequences that do not appear contrived or rehearsed. In that sense, hiring Ray Allen to play Jesus Shuttlesworth, the movie's central figure ( even if Denzel Washington is unbelievable and tends to overshine in every scene he is in), because we know he can really play ball, but also that he has been through a lot of the stress his character is going through (that is choosing his future college, all the while being hyped ""the greatest thing to happen to bball since the tennis shoe was invented""). Granted Allen is no method actor, but he is more than OK. I probably am biased since basketball is such an important part of my life, but at least I can say that this is the greatest ball movie ever to have hit the screen. Some of the themes may be unfamiliar to some, but all in all the movie is moving and thought-inducing without being sanctimonious, which is all too rare in today's media-rule-all world. The intro alone, with the great idea of having put Aaron Copland music, illustrates how important basketball is in America and to the lives of millions. If you're a bball fan watch it immediately, if you're not give it a try anyway !"

","Spike Lee explores the difficulty of making life defining decisions. Denzel Washington, as usual is brilliant. Ray Allen is a real find. The best part of this film is the great score by Public Enemy. A good look at the pressures on a young athlete."
"Primtime","8","0","2","3 September 1999"," Lee's best since Malcolm X
","He Got Game is without a doubt one of the best films of 1998. Spike Lee's story and direction are very near flawless and the use of a symphonic score to go with a few songs by Public Enemy make the visuals all the more appealing.<br/><br/>If Spike Lee has the vision to make this film what it is, then Denzel Washington must be credited for making it believable. His performance is flawless as a imperfect man who has a chance to redeem himself by convincing his alienated son to play for a certain college basketball team. The story of redemption between the father and son is at times lacking, but still holds true. The scope of emotion isn't always shown by Ray Allen who plays Jesus Shuttlesworth, an amazing basketball prodigy who will one day by the next Jordan of the NBA. He shows more emotion when arguing with his girlfriend rather than in the scenes when it is really needed, like when his father returns. Allen though isn't an actor, he is a real NBA basketball player and must be credited for his performance. Rosario Dawson must also be credited for a great performance as Lala, Jesus' girlfriend. She steals all of her scenes, even those with Washington, as the girlfriend who realizes that once Jesus leaves, she will be left with nothing.<br/><br/>Aaron Copland's score (chosen by Lee?) also plays a huge role. The beginning basketball montage is amazing, showing the diversity of those who play and love the game. Rather than using an all-rap  soundtrack like most other basketball films, the symphonic sounds make the film a lot less aggressive and a lot more heartwarming. Not to take anything away from Public Enemy's He Got Game which is used well at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Some have said that the sexual content in this film is too much and unnecessary. I have to disagree, since it is used to show the realism of college basketball. Those who think it is all books and study and a weekly game are right off the mark. It is a lot more drugs, sex and cars than most would realize. If anything is overplayed, it is the fact that the main characters name is Jesus. So much of the film is unnecessarily spent on determining why his name his Jesus, the pain he feels because of how he was always being bugged about his name and the whole deal about his new basketball stardom being called ""the second coming of Jesus"". This was too much to take and was distracting from what Lee was really trying to say.<br/><br/>
A full recommendation for this film, even worth a DVD purchase.<br/><br/>8/10 stars."

","He Got Game is a very good piece of work by Spike Lee.  This movie kept my attention from beginning to end.  The performances by Denzel Washington, Ray Allen, and Bill Nunn(leech uncle) were very good.  I felt that the sex was an integral part of the movie because I believe that this is TRULY one of the lures that a college would use to hook a star player to attend their school.<br/><br/>Jesus was the anchor of sanity in his world of leeches and hanger-ons.  I didn't find the script weak like some of the other reviewers.  However the one quibble that I do have with the film is the ending-which did leave me scratching my head trying to understand the symbolism behind it.  Overall it rates a 9.8 on my review scale."

","This is Spike Lee's finest work in a long time.  Personal, moving, well-told.  It touched me more deeply than any other movie last year. (Well, ""Babe: Pig in the City"" came close.)  Fine work all around from the cast and crew.  The single shot cemetery scene will devastate you.  A truly spiritual, emotional, wonderful film.  (The only flaw is the superfluous and badly-delivered monologue about mid-way through the film.  The writing is pretty good, the visuals are terrific, but the actor is not up to the task.)"

","I loved Denzel's performance. It's the most believable I've seen in years---perhaps since Glory. The sex didn't bug me as much as it seems to bother the other comment writers. It's depressing to me that high school kids have sex, for some reason. I was impressed by what felt like an unusual level of honesty in the movie, from the character Lala and Denzel, between Jesus and his mother and with his sister, especially. It felt real and raw, protective and warped. The creepiness of the cops felt truly icky. And the uncle was terrifically scummy as well. One felt the despair of Jesus as he seemed to be the only one in a sea of so-called grownups who seemed to have a grasp on the ethical aspects of this ""options."" And I got into the intensity of self-revelation. Spike shows how we incarcerate ourselves with our self-centered aspirations that reverberate through the generations. It was great to see Zelda as Jesus's sister. She's so talented: girl power"
"Hoss-20","8","0","1","6 June 1999"," Ray Allen has an amazing breakthrough performance
","Another masterpiece from Spike Lee.  He uses his knowledge of the inner city and the HoopDreams of young inner city kids to make this movie amazing. Ray Allen not only has great action scences on the court but provides a believable performance as Jesus Schuttlesworth who can trust noone and must forgive his father.  Denzel Washington seems at home with his inner city accent and has one of his best performances.  Spike Lee uses camera work in slow motion to show the beauty of the game and the struggle of hard off kids. Spike Lee writes a masterpiece and it is beautifully performed by Ray Allen and Denzel Washington."

","This is a great movie. It was entertaining throughout, and any weakness in the movie's narrative flow is more than made up for by the powerful and spiritual message of forgiveness. I don't want to give the plot away, so all I'll say is that a scene near the end between Denzel's character and his son blew me away.  I could hardly get up to leave the theater.  As often happens with Spike's films, I don't think most people got what he was trying to do and say here. Vastly under-rated and overlooked, this movie has real value to the right viewers. It wasn't just about the temptations of a highschool basketball star. Rent it!"

","I'd first like to start out by saying that I am not a big Spike Lee fan, but HE GOT GAME is by far Spike Lee's best film to date. Words cannot express the visual brilliance that the film possessed. It was like watching an urban street drama done by Stanley Kubrick, it was excellent! The acting was also great, with real & heartfelt performances by Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast as well. The story is at times decisive & intense but then switches to philisophical & ponderous. Also unlike his previous films: MALCOM X, CLOCKERS, etc., there is no racial or political agenda being force-fed on the viewer. Rather it gives a gritty, emotional story about a father & son in the backdrop of college basketball recruiting. Its a must see in my opinion!"

","I thought this movies hits in places films have a hard time hitting. There was a strong family (father & son) message that I  was extremely impressed with. The cinematography was amazing with a strong use of color and several stunning shots. But there are too many negative aspects. This movie clearly portrays white women as loose and whores. Black women aren't particularly celebrated either. And I also think the sound track was out of place several times during the movie. Overall, it is worth seeing but, I wouldn't show my kids, if I had any."

","Lee's story of soon-to-be basket ball superstar, Jesus Shuttlesworth, as he is wooed by colleges, a conniving girlfriend, and his imprisoned father, is solid, funny, and entertaining. While his directing choices do not always work, Lee's script is amazing. The cast is excellent. Milla Jovovich gives a great performance in an utterly superfluous role which could have (and often does) popped up in any movie. Aaron Copland's self-conscious score jars against Lee's self-conscious directing. Public Enemy's excellent song would be more effective if it was limited to being played, say, less than ten times during the film."

","Lee is one of the few directors working who is actually looking for a new approach to the entire cinematic process.  While everybody is awaiting the return of Stanley Kubrick, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Kevin Smith, wondering what happened to Robert Altman's comeback that seemed so hopeful in 1993, Spike Lee has continually marched to the beat of a different drummer.  ""He Got Game"" has one of the most memorable ferris wheel rides since ""The Third Man"", breathtaking cinematography, outrageous satire worthy of Luis Bunuel and Lindsay Anderson (truly, more than a few connections can be drawn between ""...Game"" and ""O Lucky Man!""), and irreproachable soundtrack selection.<br/><br/>The movie, as I expected, disappointed a great many people, and confused a great deal more, but it hooked me.  I overlooked the misfired ending, and landed the film on my 10 best of '98.  Please see the film, and with an open mind--there's a lot to admire here."
"SKG-2","10","0","1","5 February 1999"," Spike Lee does it again
","Lee continues to show why he's one of the best filmmakers of the 90's with this film.  It's also one of the best basketball films ever made, along with HOOP DREAMS and WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.  While Lee's passion for the game is evident, he also shows the pressures put on athletes from all sides; school, family, people who want to live through the athletes, people who think being an athlete automatically requires you to be a role model, groupies and other temptations, and, of course, money.  Along with the basketball story, Lee also adds a nicely drawn and realistic father-son relationship.  Washington is of course in excellent form, but the surprise here is NBA player (for Milwaukee?) Ray Allen, who not only handles the basketball scenes well, but is a convincing actor.  The soundtrack was really good as well."
"pooch-8","Null","0","1","2 February 1999"," Powerful filmmaking from the always worthwhile Spike Lee
","Spike Lee's love letter to the game of basketball goes above and beyond the modest expectations one might have about a film with a popular sport at its core.  An exegesis on a painful, nearly unbearable father/son relationship, He Got Game is one of Lee's best features since his masterful Do the Right Thing.  Critics seemed to endlessly harp on the ham-handed, borderline obnoxious religious symbolism, but I admire and love Spike Lee for daring to attempt something so risky and bold.  The juxtaposition of Aaron Copland and Public Enemy played brilliantly as sweeping accompaniment to the thrilling, skillful interplay on the court and as commentary on America itself.  Denzel Washington provides another incredible performance, and newcomer (and real-life NBA player) Ray Allen holds his own."
