","""In the hundred years since the Victoria Cross was created for valour and extreme courage beyond that normally expected of a British soldier in the face of the enemy, only 1,344 have been awarded, 11 of these were won by the defenders of the mission station at Rorke's Drift, Natal, January 22nd to the 23rd 1879""<br/><br/>Just typing out that spoken narration from Richard Burton brings me out into goose pimples, and the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention, Zulu quite simply is my favourite film of all time, and my love for cinema to this day owes its credit to this 1964 masterpiece.<br/><br/>Zulu is a perfectly staged, perfectly acted account of the British defence of Rorke's Drift, where 139 British soldiers held off 4000 Zulu Warriors at the height of the Anglo-Zulu War. Its strength is not in romanticism or over sentimentality in the name of glossy hard sell, the crux lies with just being a tale of pure courage, a tale of pure stoic heroism, it sticks vigorously to the actual events, and thus the film plays out with genuine honesty that few other War pictures can ever lay claim to.<br/><br/>Where does one start when outlaying the brilliance this picture has to offer? The Natal location is stunning, beautiful lush rolling hills dwarf this tiny outpost, the sky a never ending eye witness to the courage unfolding, Stephen Dade's photography perfectly capturing this colourful extravaganza. The direction from the criminally undervalued Cy Enfield is excellent, along with his star and producer (Stanley Baker in a role of a lifetime) he manages to direct some of the most amazing battle sequences put onto the screen, the discipline of man to man combat perfectly orchestrated by Enfield. The Zulu extras, who once had no idea what they was supposed to do at first, finally grasped the concept of movie making and added weight to the drama. It's now down in legend that Baker showed the chiefs a Gene Autry Western and that got them into the swing of things!<br/><br/>The acting right through the cast is astonishing, Baker, Michael Caine, Jack Hawkins, James Booth, Nigel Green, Ivor Emmanuel and Patrick Magee are just some of the cast that shine bright and bold. John Barry's score is blood pumping to the maximum, swirling strings collide with thumping base drums to give one the feeling of invincibility. Ernest Archer's art decoration, Arthur Newman's costumes and of course the John Prebble screenplay that is Zulu's heart. I could go on and name everyone involved in this picture, such is the admiration I have for the work involved. But really the story sells itself, not a glossy British victory in sight (the British defenders were allowed to withdraw from the engagement gracefully), this is not just another British fable of imperialistic fervour, it's just a tale of bayonets with guts behind them, and ultimately a story of when men really were men, all in the line of duty.<br/><br/>Men of Harlech onto glory...10/10 and then some."
"Scaramouche2004","Null","210","240","14 August 2004"," An edge of your seat spectacular.
","22nd January 1879, Rorke's Drift. Natal Province. On that day an epic battle was fought between 4000 Zulu warriors and approx. 100 British soldiers.<br/><br/>Now I have noticed many of our American cousins have made remarks in their reviews of Zulu, to the effect that the soldiers were nasty-pasty British Empire builders and that they all deserved to choke on their own vomit, however the film does not try to justify the Zulu War or it's origins so I will not either, suffice it to say that you shouldn't be expressing assumptions and opinions on nineteenth century political attitudes with such an obvious twenty-first century viewpoint. They are two very different worlds which cannot be compared.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully shot and scripted, and the the John Barry musical score keeps the battle scenes moving well. It seems to makes the sometimes long periods of heavy fighting pass by quicker. Barry took authentic Zulu songs and chants and added the dramatic score around them to make an original and haunting theme which still ranks as one of his greatest film score offerings.<br/><br/>Stanley Baker is fantastic as Lt. Chard, the Royal Engineer who is able to use his skill in successfully fortifying the little hospital outpost against the onslaught of the foe.<br/><br/>Micheal Caine plays Lt. Bromhead the professional line soldier and upper class officer who after a little whining and grumbling accepts his position of second in command and fights valiantly in the battle. It was this film that propelled Caine to international stardom, so powerful was his performance. <br/><br/>Other noted cast members include James Booth as an excellent but inaccurate Hook, and Nigel Green as Colour-Sergeant Frank Bourne the typical Victorian Sergeant-major complete with side whiskers and moustache.<br/><br/>The Great Jack Hawkins who did not like the character he played or his work on the film, portrayed Otto Witt, the pacifist missionary with a drink problem and again it is another performance worthy of an award. It was upsetting however to hear in his voice, his wonderfully clipped speaking voice, the early effects of the throat cancer which had by this time plagued him for three years and which was eventually to lead to his death.<br/><br/>Also special mention to Richard Burton, who narrated the whole show. He truly had one of the best dramatic voices in the world and speaks his lines beautifully. <br/><br/>It was also good to see the Zulu's portrayed with dignity and honour rather than just mere savages with bones through their noses. They were a brave and strong opponent that day and they are deserving of tribute as much as the British.<br/><br/>The basis of this film is taken from historical fact, although certain characters and events have either been altered, erased or just plain fabricated for dramatic purposes. I hope that should any producers in the future be foolish enough to attempt a remake of this classic epic, they will put historical accuracy first and Hollywood sensationalism second if at all.<br/><br/>
Enough has been said by others regarding the blatant slander of Private Henry Hook, so I will not elaborate on it, save that it was a gross slur on the bravest of men. I hope should the film ever be remade his honour will be restored and his gallant deeds on that day be portrayed accurately.<br/><br/>To quash further popular myths none of the film is shot on the exact spot at which the battle took place, (the real Rorke's Drift was in fact about 60 miles from the location shoot.)<br/><br/>The regiment in question did not become the South Wales Borderers until two years after the battle and was at the time a Warwickshire Regiment. They were however based in Brecon which is where the Welsh connection was born and would explain why there was a higher amount of Welsh nationals attached to it.<br/><br/>Despite this the regiment consisted mainly of Englishmen and only about 12 percent were in fact from Wales. With these demographics being how they are I can assure you, ""Men of Harlech"" would not have been sung at Rorke's Drift, (at least not without the culprit being bayoneted by an Englishman with ear-ache.)<br/><br/>Lt. Chard himself was an Englishman having been born in Plymouth into an established and respected Somerset family. This being the case, I find it funny that although Stanley Baker never refers to Chard as a Welshman, he none the less seems to revel in promoting Welsh pride at ever opportunity. Of the eleven V.C's won in the battle, only three of them were awarded to Welshman so why the big Welsh message Boyo?<br/><br/>Also the final salute made by the Zulu's did not occur. When they re-appeared on the hill they returned with the sole intention of finishing off the gallant soldiers at the outpost, but decided against it when they noticed a sizable relief column approaching Rorke's Drift from the south.<br/><br/>Finally, a few people have made references to Colour-Sergeant Frank Bourne, wondering whether or not he really existed and if so why he was never awarded the V.C. for his conduct on the day. Yes, he really existed and yes, he did fight at Rorke's Drift. He was in fact recommended for a Victoria Cross, but told the powers that be that he would rather have a promotion instead. This he was given along with a D.C.M and an O.B.E. He was the last surviving veteran of Rorke's Drift when he died on V.E. Day 8th May 1945 aged 91 and with a rank of Lt. Col.  <br/><br/>For more historic information about The Battle of Rorke's Drift and it's combatants, I recommend you visit www.rorkesdriftvc.com."
"Bogmeister","10","153","175","6 August 2005"," How the British Ruled the World
","A magnificent recreation of one of the most incredible battles in history, Zulu depicts how less than 100 British soldiers held off an army of 4000 Zulu warriors. The battle follows a previous one, less than a day before, in which about 1200 British soldiers lost. This film really gives new meaning to the saying 'keep a stiff upper lip' - or 'never say die.' The British soldiers here, led by Lieutenants played by Baker & Caine, know full well the force coming against them; they know what has already occurred. By rights, they should beat a hasty retreat before the approaching army arrives. The film never delves into the reasons, psychological or other, of why the commanding officer is determined to remain, beyond just the statement that he holds the ""queen's commission."" It's a question that baffles the missionary (Hawkins, usually the stiff English officer in other films) who begs them all to leave. The film seems to say, when the moment comes, no man really knows what he will do until it is upon him. Here, the soldiers find out very quickly what they're made of. <br/><br/>Cy Endfield, the director, manages to build some heady suspense before even the awesome battle scenes. The soldiers hear a strange sound in the distance, ""like a train"" notes Caine. Now we no longer need wonder what 8000 feet on soil sound like. And it's not just the suspense; the drama here is very effective. There are numerous sequences where Endfield manages to drive home a point that sticks in your mind for days - maybe years. Who can forget that simple act of turning over a wagon? The photography is superb, capturing the vastness of the area, and should be seen in widescreen glory. I've seen this film many times as a kid and, of course, these were standard TV showings; I didn't know better, it was one of my favorite films of all time, regardless, but it's twice as glorious in proper aspect ratio. I even had the privilege of seeing this on a theater screen once about 20 years ago and I was suitably blown away, even knowing the story beforehand (nowadays, a DVD on a big screen TV is your best bet). The musical score is perfect, as well. I can't imagine the film with anything different.<br/><br/>When the fighting begins, it's really breathless; by that I mean, there is one central action set piece when many of the Zulu warriors break through the ranks and threaten the inner compound, including the officer in command. I always have to hold my breath during this sequence, even though I've seen it 20 times, it's that good. Every time a Brit soldier falls, I think, my God, that's a good portion of the entire defending force! They can never make it! Yet, they do, several times. It's a relentless depiction of war battles, never equaled (as in ""The Alamo"",1960, another historical depiction of a small group against a much larger force - it's good, but not even close). Somehow, Endfield and whomever helped choreograph the action scenes managed to weld together the perfect combination of huge crowd battles and singular confrontations where it becomes a little personal.<br/><br/>All the actors are first rate. Caine is terrific in his first major role. Baker is very solid - has to be - as the one in command. Booth - I know his character may not be historically accurate - but he's the most colorful, and when he explodes into full-fledged heroism, it's something to see. And Nigel Green as the sergeant - THAT's why the British ruled the world for a time! In fact, all the supporting and minor roles are filled out excellently; this was when script writing had to be extra professional. The much later prequel had no hope of comparing to this masterpiece, but even that film was well done. Yes, I'll say it one more time - this is a masterpiece."
"acamera","10","108","125","9 August 1999"," Superlative acting, cinematography & direction: what impact!
","I cannot find words to fully express how perfectly formed this film is, though I will- of course- make a good stab at it!<br/><br/>I've seen Zulu so many times since it was first released that I have lost count. In the days when you could sit in the cinema and watch a film come round for a second (or even a third) time, I always did this with Zulu. I bought the soundtrack when it came out (on vinyl, of course).<br/><br/>From Stanley Baker & Michael Caine on through the cast list the acting is, quite simply, superb. This is an ensemble piece, and the ensemble gives its all! Photographically, it is beautifully conceived and executed. There is a tendency in 'war' movies to find a couple of favourite types of shot, and then endlessly repeat them, rather like a budgerigar that has learnt how to make his bell ring: no danger of that here; a whole lexicon of camera movements & angles is deployed with consummate skill so that you cannot watch this film without being fully engaged with it.<br/><br/>But, to cut to the chase, what is so striking is that here is a movie that could so easily have been yet another 'duffing up the natives' actioner, and instead becomes a vehicle for all sorts of interesting questions. Questions such as 'what is it to be a man?', and 'what is courage?' are posed and turned into interesting questions with complex and surprising answers.<br/><br/>The way that Zulu culture/social psychology is compared with that of the British soldiers is also deft and insightful. The cry of the drunken pastor- ""you're all going to die""- echoes through the rest of the film, as we see how the protagonists face death.<br/><br/>Any review of this would be incomplete without mention of the music, which is so well-suited to the action. It forms a restless, swirling, and sometimes majestic backdrop to what is happening on-screen.<br/><br/>The voice-overs which 'bookend' the film also underline that which is, in any case, clear from the narrative: this film is no apologia for imperialism. Neither does it represent battle as other than bloody and painful murder. What is, perhaps, the most remarkable feature of the film is the way in which it damns war while neither grossing out nor alienating its audience. It is, on the contrary, an enthralling and passionate entertainment.<br/><br/>One memorable visual moment occurs toward the end, when the Zulus appear simultaneously on the skyline all round Rorke's Drift. Compare this with the appearance of the tanks on the skyline in 'The Battle of the Bulge'...<br/><br/>P.S., beware (as you always should) TV showings or videos that are 'scanned' rather than in the original letterbox format: cinematography this good does not deserve to be butchered!"
"Koncorde","Null","14","14","16 February 2003"," A tribute to both sides of an uneven war.
","ZULU steers away from making one side good and one side bad.  Okay, we identify with the British troops in the face of insurmountable odds and all that - but you have to admire the ZULU warriors all the more for going up against them unfalteringly and the 'pan' across their fallen bodies isn't so much a moment of joy for the Brits saying ""Ha, look how many we've killed of you lot"" as opposed to clearly showing what an awful waste of life it all actually was.<br/><br/>The film clearly marks out why the British Army was as good as it was. Organisation.  Okay, we got butchered a couple of times, but when placed in a position with time to ready ourselves the British forces where pretty unbeatable.  One of the huge advantages being the fact that often we were going up against quite primitive 'warriors' with even more primitive weapons.  The whole staying smart, obeying orders and keeping in line, firing in order helped to saved all those mens lives and is a neatly condensed show of arms to everybody out there.  Each setpiece of British organisation re-inforces just how good they were, just how well they were drilled and just how murderous they could be with their efforts.<br/><br/>The film clearly marks out why the ZULU forces wasn't quite so good.  It wasn't a lack of courage or absence of valour, it was simply down to the fact that they were outclassed weapon and organisation wise.  Okay, they made pretty well organised charges and all that, but against rifles that's just cannon fodder.  But as is pointed out by the Dutch guy, they're merely counting your guns.  The ZULU's in the film aren't daft guys in furry underpants, they're the bravest warriors ever seen (or ever likely to be seen).  Well organised forces wilted in the face of British troops during that period, they didn't.  The fact they salute the British and walk away merely adds to their nobility and patheticises the British efforts - eventually they would have crumbled, the British would have lost against such odds if the Zulus had pressed all at once.  They didn't.  They walked away saluting the British effort.  That moment alone, with Caine blazing about how they're being taunted and the Dutch guy chuckling to himself struggling to believe what is actually taking place is the icing on the cake of the gradually increasing tension.<br/><br/>For a moment of absolute spine tingling tension you can't beat the ZULU singing being countered by the Welsh Choir of voices.  It's an equaliser as such, a moment of contrast and compare between the rigid red suited Brits and the tribal shield clapping chanting.<br/><br/>John Barry's music is a constant presence and always perfectly suited to the moment, I'd be interested to know the content of the ZULU chants though, whether they are authentic (which I figure they are) or simply picked out by the director for looking the most intimidating.<br/><br/>Top film, no insult to anybody."

","It`s shameful no-one makes films like ZULU anymore. In these PC dominated times there are those who may view this film as being racist  dealing with a heroic battle between white foreign troops against native black Africans during Victorian times. Nothing could be further from the truth. The zulus are rightly presented as being fearless and disciplined warriors ready to willingly die  than show cowardice.<br/><br/> The only other criticism a modern day audience can level at the film is the fact that the battle scenes are slightly ungory compared to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and PLATOON. But so what ? How many other films compete with the excitement and tension of scenes like  the soldiers fighting off the hordes of zulus in the hospital building ? Would graphic disembowelment and decapitation improve these scenes ?  of course not.<br/><br/>
I could go on all day as to what`s brilliant about ZULU , but I wont. But I will say that for me the greatest aspect of the film is John Barry`s score. The fact that he never won an oscar for it just goes to show there`s no justice in the world.<br/><br/>Without doubt the greatest British film of the 1960`s , probably the greatest British picture ever , and possibly the greatest film ever. Let`s hope Hollywood never decides to remake it"

","If you watch only the first two minutes of 'Zulu', it will be worth your while. The superbly dramatic theme music, followed immediately by Richard Burton's striking Welsh narration, are utterly entrancing. The rest of the film is not bad, either!<br/><br/>In January 1879, during the Boer War, at Isandhlwana in South Africa, over one thousand British troops are annihilated by King Cetshwayo's Zulu army. Standing between the four thousand Zulus and victory is the mission station at Rorke's Drift and about one hundred and forty British soldiers, some of whom are wounded. Commanding the military operation is the young Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker, also co-producer of the film) with Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, in his first major film role). Against the unimaginable odds, the British troops - the B Company of the 24th Regiment of Foot, South Wales Borderers - manage, with exceptional courage and stoicism, to hold off the Zulu attacks until morning. The valour of the men defending Rourke's Drift resulted in the awarding of eleven Victoria Crosses. The roll of honour is recited by Richard Burton at the film's end.<br/><br/>Baker and Caine are very convincing in the two lead roles as Chard and Bromhead, the rival lieutenants from different social classes who come to respect and even like each other. Their first meeting emphasises the psychological as well as the physical distance between them. Chard, the Engineer Officer, in his shirt-sleeves, is up to his waist in water; Bromhead, the upper-class blue-blood, in his helmet and fine cloak, is on horseback, having just returned from hunting. However, as the battle progresses, this rivalry is forgotten as their prime concern is the job in hand. Their exchange when Chard is injured and Bromhead goes to his aid is telling. By the end of the film, as they stand together in the burnt-out ruins of the hospital, they are equals.<br/><br/>The incredibly virile Stanley Baker (one wants to say, ""Fwhoar!"" every time he appears on screen) co-produced the film because, like most Welshmen, he was extremely patriotic and wanted to publicise the bravery of the Welsh soldiers at Rorke's Drift. Michael Caine auditioned originally for the part of Hook but was offered instead the part of Bromhead as his looks were considered more suited to those of an upper-class officer than a Cockney private.<br/><br/>Good support is given by the other actors in the supporting roles. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is probably the most memorable character, portrayed (historically inaccurately) as the company ne'er-do-well, yet who wakes up to his duty at the moment of crisis and fights almost to the death. Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen are effective as the well-meaning but naive father-and-daughter missionaries, the Witts. The outstanding bravery and selflessness of the other (mainly) Welsh soldiers is brought out by all the actors in the subordinate roles. <br/><br/>What I think is very admirable about 'Zulu' is its lack of jingoism. Far from it crowing about British supremacy over the natives, it portrays the bravery of the Zulus as equal to or even greater than that of the British. At the end of the battle, there is no great rejoicing; it was just a job which had to be done because they were there. In the ruins of the hospital, when Chard asks Bromhead how he feels, Bromhead replies, ""Sick."" Their dialogue continues: <br/><br/>Bromhead: There's something else. I feel ashamed. Was that how it was for you? The first time?<br/><br/>Chard: First time? Do you think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?<br/><br/>Bromhead: I didn't know. <br/><br/>Chard: I told you. I came up here to build a bridge.<br/><br/>No more needs to be said.<br/><br/>Although the character names and events are factual, the film does sometimes sacrifice historical accuracy for dramatic effect. How much real rivalry there was between Chard and Bromhead is unclear - although it is true that Bromhead ceded command to Chard. Private Hook was not the thief and ne'er-do-well as played by James Booth. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a short man and quite unlike Nigel Green in appearance. Most of the Victoria Cross winners were English, not Welsh. And the film itself was shot not at Rorke's Drift but at a location some miles away.<br/><br/>Interestingly, neither Chard nor Bromhead lived to a great age. Both died in their forties, Chard of mouth cancer in 1897 and Bromhead of fever on active service a few years before. Neither ever married. Nevertheless, their names are immortalised in 'Zulu' - as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men, Welsh, English and Zulu, at Rorke's Drift on 22nd/23rd January 1879."

","When ""Zulu"" opened in Sydney in 1964 it had one of those big premieres that military epics received back then: searchlights, red carpet, a band and guests wearing medals. <br/><br/>Shortly after, I took my brother to see it. ""Zulu"" ticked all the boxes for us.<br/><br/>From Richard Burton's opening narration to his listing of the names of the Victoria Cross winners at the end, we were rapt.<br/><br/>As well as the battle, those bare-breasted Zulu girls did not go unappreciated by a couple of young lads. You didn't see a lot of that sort of thing on the screen in those days. The filmmakers obviously got away with it under the old National Geographic Magazine rule of it's OK if it's the natural attire of the culture, it didn't stop them being hot though.<br/><br/>The film still stands up even if the censorship of the day kept it relatively bloodless. Demonstrations show what a round from a Martini Henry rifle can do to a watermelon, no doubt it would have had the same spectacular effect on a human head. An assegai in the belly would not be as clinical as depicted in the movie either. <br/><br/>But the best bits of the film were often the tense scenes waiting for things to happen and the one where the men drown out the Zulu chant with ""Men of Harlech"". I haven't a drop of Welsh blood, but that scene always puts a lump in my throat.<br/><br/>The film is classy. Breathtaking photography, terrific performances from top to bottom and an awesome score by John Barry; music to perform heroics by.<br/><br/>The film was a hit in Australia, but something unexpected happened not long after. In 1966, D Company, 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment found itself surrounded by up to 2000 Viet Cong in a rubber plantation at Long Tan in South Vietnam. There were 108 of them, about the same number as the 24th Regiment at Rorke's Drift. They held off attack after attack. Instead of mealie bags they brought down artillery fire, but the fighting was at close quarters as they held their perimeter. <br/><br/>By the time help arrived, 18 of them were dead (17 at Rorke's Drift) while the enemy lay dead in the hundreds. Controversially, there were no Victoria Crosses although more than one was earned. Years later, the company commander likened the battle to Rorke's Drift. But I wonder if while the battle was on, did it flash through the minds of the blokes who had seen the movie that what they saw depicted on the screen they were now experiencing for real?<br/><br/>Would anyone make a film like ""Zulu"" today? Possibly it would be just too un-PC. Most battles on the screen these days are fought vicariously through intergalactic stormtroopers or by the denizens of ""Game of Thrones"".<br/><br/>However, historical rights and wrongs aside, I still think ""Zulu"" rocks; it's simply an exceptional piece of filmmaking."

","Zulu is the true story of the battle of Rourke's Drift between the British and Zulu nations in 1879. Both nations were aggressive, expansionist peoples. The British had pursued trade throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and suddenly found themselves in possession of an empire encompassing one quarter of the world. The Zulus, under the warrior-king Shaka Zulu, had become a society totally devoted to warfare and, with the possible exception of the Spartans over two thousand years before them, the most fearless soldiers the world had ever seen. It is important not to succumb to political correctness here, the Zulus had ruthlessly oppressed other nations in black Africa and caused mass migrations of people, the effects of which are felt to this day. The British meanwhile, had provoked a confrontation with them and suffered a defeat at Isandlwana where modern weapons has proved insufficient against overwhelming numbers of incredibly brave and disciplined warriors. The day after the battle the small British garrison at Rourke's Drift seemed doomed. Just over 100 men plus sick men in the hospital faced thousands of Zulus eager for their share of the glory which their brothers had won at Isandlwana.<br/><br/>The nature of the British Army at this time was not promising. Before Waterloo in 1815 the Duke of Wellington had described them as ""the scum of the earth"" - rogues, ne'er-do-wells, criminals, drunkards, ladanum fiends, debtors fresh from prison, even lunatics. In 1879 they were not much different. They were incredibly badly paid, their conditions of service were atrocious, they were despised by the civilians, led by officers who often owed their position to aristocratic privilege and money. Sometimes they were booed in the street and refused access to pubs and music halls such was their lowly status. And yet, and yet... they had faced and defeated some of the most fearsome warriors on Earth. The Pathans, Burmese, Afghans, Sudanese ""Fuzzy-Wuzzies"" as well as Napoleon's invincible Imperial Guard. If they survived the bloody colonial wars they could expect an early death in the work-house, unappreciated by the people whose incomes they had guarded. If you are interested in the Victorian soldiers see Kipling's poems (especially ""Tommy Atkins"") or read George Orwell's long essay on Kipling or ""The Lion And The Unicorn"".<br/><br/>This film salutes human beings in extremis. Though told from the British viewpoint it pays handsome tribute to the magnificent courage and honour of the Zulu warriors as well as the British soldiers wondering ""what are we doing here?"". The best perfomances in the film, in my opinion, are from James Booth as Private Hook, the cynical drunkard turned reluctant hero and Nigel Green as the awesome Colour-Sergeant Bourne. It portrays courage and stoicism which modern people seem to lack; heroism when all seems lost, faith in the regiment and your mates and old-fashioned manliness."

But urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station, deploy their men tactically, and prepare for the attack... <br/><br/>Then thousands of Zulus, armed with short spears and captured rifles, arrive on the grassy hilltops... Their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting...<br/><br/>And then they come into sight... <br/><br/>Long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills, promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack... <br/><br/>Their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force... They begin to test the British firing power with the life of their warriors... <br/><br/>The British rifles cut them down and they retreat... But they come again-and again and again-each time getting closer to the station, cutting down the distance... <br/><br/>Every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence... It seems obviously that any of them will survive... In every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition... <br/><br/>After a long night, and at the rise of the sun, the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge... <br/><br/>Most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help... Few are malingerers, like Private Hook (James Booth), who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand-to-hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building...<br/><br/>Outside, the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge, but instead they hear a massed yell from the Zulusa salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene...<br/><br/>The battle at Rorke's Drift was a decisive one in the British campaign to pacify South Africa for European settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives... As a page in British history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the Victoria Crosses in few hours - to eleven defenders for their extreme courage - an all-time record for one military engagement...<br/><br/>Stanley Baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer; Michael Caine splendid (in his first major role) as the pompous aristocrat; James Booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital; Patrick Magee excellent as the calm surgeon; and Nigel Green, a sergeant of the old order, sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate, as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count... He looks at them and quietly advises: 'Keep your voices down!' <br/><br/>The film is a superb account of that bloody engagement, and the fighting is shown in realistic detail...

","Having visited the battlefields myself, (including Isandlwana), I can say that 'Zulu' tries hard to be accurate. It is difficult because of technological constraints and the audience of the time but the film does try. Importantly, it gives credibility to the Zulu warriors. In fact, as many Zulus volunteered to make the film, this adds credibility. Bromhead, played by Caine, plays a very good part, and is very entertaining. Artistic licence is again used, as he was fairly deaf, but his relationship with Chard carries the film very well. Stanley Baker is excellent as Chard, and he clearly was moved by the entire experience, getting involved in the history after the film. If you want to see a classic British imperial film, this is it. It was made to celebrate the heroism of the British soldiers who unfortunately were stationed there. A particular quote from one of the Boer characters is particularly poignant incidentally. A visit to the battlefields is highly recommended, especially to hear about the preceding Battle of Isandlwana."

","In January 1879, about 100 British soldiers are forced to hold the small outpost of Rorke's Drift in South Africa's Natal province against about four thousand attacking Zulu warriors.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this is one of the greatest war movies ever made. The film quickly sketches the personalities of the main characters, and when the action starts it quickly moves into high gear. It successfully mixes tension and action in a way that few war movies have yet matched.<br/><br/>The performances are great, particularly co-producer Stanley Baker as the hard-as-nails Lieutenant Chard who assumes command on the strength of his seniority, and Michael Caine, in his first major starring role, as the aristocratic Lieutenant Bromhead, who comes into conflict with Chard.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, the film is respectful in it's portrayal of the Zulus as honourable and dignified warriors.<br/><br/>The script features plenty of memorable dialogue and a decent amount of humour. It also features some stirring music from John Barry."
"waynec50","10","28","32","16 February 2006"," Possibly the greatest single battle film ever
","This is an incredible film. While there a few inaccuracies and some dramatic licenses, on the whole the movie follows accounts of the battle accurately. It doesn't vilify the Zulu, in fact it treats them with great respect for their bravery and devotion to their homeland. The bare facts are well known, that Rorke's Drift was the jumping off point for the British invasion of Zululand, and was a hospital and supply depot. It was defended by roughly one hundred men against some 4,000 Zulu. Stanley Baker is outstanding as Lt Chard, the senior officer at the fort, who takes command despite being an engineer officer. Michael Caine is, of course fantastic in his first big role as Lt. Bromhead. Nigel Green is superb as Colour Sergeant Bourne, who received a promotion instead of a Victoria Cross and outlived all the other defenders. The cast of mostly Welsh actors really convey the desperation and bravery of the garrison. The biggest fault with the film is the total misrepresentation of Pvt Henery Hook as a malingerer, in fact he was a good soldier and bravely risked his life to empty the hospital. The scenes of the post before the attack show soldiers at their worst in some ways, especially the treatment of Margaretta Witt. The atmosphere and attitude change when the imminent threat of Zulu attack becomes a fact. Unlike the overconfident officers at Isandlhwana, the inexperienced lieutenants build their defenses and set up ammunition supply to counter the assault. They respect their opponents and understand that they may be the last line of defense against a counter-invasion into Natal. The fighting is spectacularly filmed, highlighting the bravery and resolve of the Zulu and the determination of the redcoats to survive and hold the fort. I was embarrassed to read the comments of certain Americans who have had their brains filled with revisionist political correctness and rooted for the British soldiers to ""choke on their own vomit"" and die because they were imperialist tools. Just to see this as a record of great bravery (on both sides) and an exciting entertainment apparently isn't enough, they have to spout P C drivel."

","Zulu is the filmed account of the Battle of Rorke's Drift during the war against the Zulu nation in the part of South Africa known as Natal. It's not an explanation of policy as to why the British were in Africa, just an account of 139 brave soldiers successfully holding off 4000 to 5000 Zulu warriors, the fiercest fighters in that part of Africa.<br/><br/>To put in American terms for the rest of us Yanks, the British army was facing the same kind of odds the Texans did at the Alamo. They also were not certain any kind of relief was coming because the day before, on January 21, 1879 the army had sustained a cataclysmic defeat against those same Zulus at Isandlwana. Out of 850 soldiers about 50 of them survived, in no shape to give aid to anybody. It was the British equivalent of The Little Big Horn which had taken place on the American frontier three years earlier.<br/><br/>But on January 22,23 of 1879 the best of that generation in the United Kingdom performed to the max for Queen and country. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine play the two lieutenants, the engineer and the shave-tail from Sandhurst who commanded the troops at Rorke's Drift. <br/><br/>Just a brief bit of research on the internet indicated to me that I saw a fairly accurate account of just what went on for those two days. Zulu combines what is sometimes impossible, good history with good entertainment.<br/><br/>If it's broadcast it's not to be missed."

","Zulu tells the tale of a battle that takes place at Rorke's Drift during the Anglo/Zulu war of 1879. A small British garrison is informed that the larger part of their regiment of 1,500 hundred men have been killed by a Zulu army of 40,000 warriors. Word quickly spreads that a large force of Zulus is heading toward the small hospital/trading post/garrison. <br/><br/>The two officers at the outpost Lt. Col Bromhead (Caine) a fancy lad from a family of officers and Lt. Col Chard (Baker) an engineer squabble over the best course of action for the garrison. With a brief amount of seniority in his favor Chard is in command and decides the best course of action is to defend the outpost. Retreat is viewed as impossible due to the wounded at the hospital and wide open area that would be the escape route. The personality clash and eventual mutual admiration between the two officers is some of Caine and Baker's best work.<br/><br/>Preparations are quickly made to prepare for the inevitable assault. Bags of grain, boxes of biscuits and boxes of tinned meat are stacked up as barricades. Every available man including many of the wounded from the hospital are placed at the defenses. When the attack begins it is clear the small force is vastly outnumbered. 160 British soldiers and local militia defend the outpost against 4000 Zulu warriors.<br/><br/>The 11 hour assault comes in wave after wave at the heavily outnumbered troops. The film has some great scenes of courage and bravery on both sides of the action. The scenes of battle are epic in scale despite the fact that the battle does not begin till about half way into the film and take place in a small area. The viewer will really feel the sense of being hopelessly out numbered and fear of being overrun and killed in a foreign land<br/><br/>The defense of hospital and the sub plot of the drunkard Pvt. Hook (Booth) soldiering when it matters most provide some of the best action scenes in the film. If you enjoy action packed war films this is a can't miss. At the conclusion of the film narrator Richard Burton describes how 11 Victoria's Crosses out of 1,344 all time were earned during this battle<br/><br/>Some critics bash this film a bit due to its lack of historical context and how the film takes some liberties with historical accuracy. Similarly, some will view this film through racist glasses. While the film does change some of the characters a bit, especially the character of Pvt. Hook who was actually a bit of teetotaler and not a drunk as portrayed in the film, overall it is a fairly accurate portrayal. It's important to remember that this is a film and not a documentary about the battle. While the Zulu's are the eventual losers in this battle the film portrays them fighting valiantly and they are presented as a fearsome and brave force to be reckoned with. Moreover, the film does question the rationale behind British colonialism and just what these soldiers were dying for.<br/><br/>In summation if you like war films this is a classic that should not be missed. Strong acting performances by many of the cast admirably demonstrate the heroism and loyalty of the soldiers to each other in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This film is currently available for streaming on Netflix."

","Ok! The historians can pick holes and tell us the zulu rifles where not taken from the dead at Isandlwana, and that Hook was not an idle barrack room lawyer, that the impi at rorkes drift had not fought at the former battle, and Chard would have worn a blue uniform not red. Who cares these and other so called gaffes do not detract from the fact that Zulu is a great action movie. I first saw the film at the age of seven and have loved it ever since. By todays standards the special effects can seem a bit weak and bayonets and asagis do not cause instant death, but the tension and feeling of impending doom make Zulu a great British movie. Over the years the film has inspired me to look into the history of the Zulu people and this is where the film really works. It tries to show, in limited time that the Zulus where a great people and almost invites the viewer to learn more; surely this should be one of the main inspirations in making films of war."

","simply my favourite film. A true story well told.<br/><br/>I wanted to clarify some points from recent reviwers which I hope help exlain some questions. Mainly from Geofbob.<br/><br/>The two Lts. Chard and Bromhead - were new to battle. The reason Chard performed so well may be largely due to the fact that he was an engineer who knew about building defences. The mealie bag wall they build in the film was vital in order to slow up the thousands of zulus.<br/><br/>The victory was not a sure thing because they had guns. The zulus had hundreds of guns capture that morning from the other 1700 British troops that had been killed by the zulus armed with spears.<br/><br/>As to where the Hawkins character went to ? In reality he legged it away from his mission before the battle - later submitting a bill for damages to the British government.<br/><br/>No explanation into the reasons for the battle. No bad thing as the true story of men against men is a worthy tail on its own and any explanation would be open to interpretation - read the history yourself!<br/><br/>One last point everyone enjoys the Men of Harlech scene. Whilst this is poetic license - a very similar incident happened in the Afghan war at the same time. A Btirish regiment cut off and fighting to the end, sang God Save The Queen just before the final Afghan attack - they survived - remember these were very different men from today, no political correctness here and possibly a lot more courage. 10/10<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way Colour Sgt Bourne - very much existed in real life.

"mark-2558","9","13","14","20 February 2006"," A flawed masterpiece
","Zulu is my favourite all time film and has been since I watched it first as an entranced 7 year old. I'm assuming it had a UK 'U' certificate despite the violence because my grandfather took me to see it at least 3 times the first week it was on general release in our local flea pit cinema in Wales. I've watched it so many times since my family groan whenever they hear it on the Christmas schedule as it usually is. I must buy the DVD. So fascinated was I by the story that in 1979 on a visit to South Africa I made a huge detour to go to Rorkes Drift. As others have stated the film was not made at the battlesite, the site itself is on a low plateau in a plain and not so obviously surrounded by those fantastic hills as in the film. When I was there RD was a hamlet 10 miles up a dirt track, but with a post office from which I sent my grandfather a postcard. No doubt Zulu was hijacked somewhat by the Welsh and given an overly strong nationalistic core. However it remains a superbly atmospheric, exciting and yet moralistic and respectful story, PC before its time and true in so many core facts. I cannot think of any other 'battle' based film which has remained so basically true to its historical base and non-jingoistic. Even as a child my admiration and respect for the opposing Zulus was entrenched - how many war films where a child is so blatantly rooting for one side could have done that?"
"SimonJack","10","8","8","8 March 2017"," Great film of a spectacular historical event
","When I first saw ""Zulu,"" I knew nothing about the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. If we had studied it in school, I didn't remember anything about it. And, I think that's the best place to be for the first time watching this film. It affords the maximum appreciation and enjoyment of the movie. By that, I don't mean enjoyment in the sense of fun, but in having something like a bird's eye view of the events taking place and being there at the time. By not knowing the outcome of an historical event, I think one can better sense being a part of the event taking place on screen.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, by any standards. It is a film of an historical event that shows the drama, the tension, the intensity, the fear and courage, the determination, the pathos and the tragedy of the Battle of Rorke's Drift, January 22-23, 1879. It's about the 3,000 to 4,000 Zulus who were fighting to keep a foreign nation from invading their land. Armed mostly with primitive weapons – spears and shields, they dared to go against the British troops and garrisons in South Africa who were moving to invade their kingdom. It's about a small garrison of British soldiers and South African troops who gallantly withstood massive waves of native warriors who outnumbered them better than 20 to 1. It's a film about the thinking and psychology of the leaders of both sides. <br/><br/>This is a movie of monumental scale – in its outdoor setting, in the numbers of natives used for extras as Zulu warriors, and in the camera work, filming, action and direction. And, yes, the acting is superb by all of the cast. At the time ""Zulu"" was made, only one of the cast was generally recognized around the globe – Jack Hawkins. And his role is a minor one in the film. That may be why ""Zulu"" received no major awards, or even nominations. Indeed, 1964 was one of those years of many great films (""Becket,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Mary Poppins,"" ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Zorba the Greek,"" ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" ""The Night of the Iguana,"" ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte,"" ""Cheyenne Autumn,"" and more). <br/><br/>But this production, and some of the acting were equal to the award winning films of that year. And, ""Zulu"" was a breakout film for Michael Caine. He had been around for several years and had small parts and uncredited appearances in TV and silver screen films. After this, Caine would star or co-star in more than 100 films. <br/><br/>Stanley Baker plays Lt. John Chard, Caine plays Lt. Gonville Bromhead, Hawkins plays missionary Otto Witt, and Ulla Jacobsson plays his daughter Margareta. A number of top performances were turned in by actors playing the roles of other soldiers. James Booth is Private Henry Hook, Nigel Green is Sgt. Bourne, Ivor Emmanuel is Pvt. Owen, Paul Daneman is Sgt. Maxfield, and Glynn Edwards is Cpl. Allen. There are more who contributed immensely to this film.<br/><br/>In the years since I first saw this film, I have read and studied much more history. This is an excellent movie for any serious film library. The Battle of Rorke's Drift was the second direct engagement between British forces in South Africa and the Zulus. The day before this event took place, a much larger force of British troops, with South African and native troops and several hundred civilians, was attacked by 20,000 Zulus and soundly defeated in the Battle of Isandlwana. Of the 1,800 men in the British force, some 1,300 were killed. That included most of the Europeans, 400 of a Natal Native contingent and some 240 African auxiliaries. Historians estimate that the Zulus lost 1,000 to 2,000 men. <br/><br/>The outcome of the Battle of Rorke's Drift would be quite different – with the British garrison of about 155 men holding off the much larger number of Zulus for more than 10 hours of fighting. The Zulus now had some firearms that had been captured from the British the day before, but none were trained in shooting rifles. When the fighting ended and the Zulus withdrew the morning of Jan. 23, the garrison had lost only 16 men killed or mortally wounded, with another 13 wounded. They counted 351 Zulu bodies, and it's estimated that another 500 Zulus were wounded. Many of them were likely captured and killed by the British main force of Lord Chelmsford (Frederic Thesiger). Chelmsford went on to defeat the Zulus on July 4, 1879, in the Battle of Ulundi. As the film notes at the end, 11 men from the Battle of Rorke's Drift were awarded the Victoria Cross, England's highest military honor since the mid-19th century. <br/><br/>For the quality of this great film, and the sheer spectacle of the event, ""Zulu"" should be an excellent historical reference for decades to come."

The Rourkes Drift attack was spearheaded by one of his headstrong sons, eager to prove his courage and leadership skills to his respected warrior father.<br/><br/>With narration from none other than Richard Burton, stirring music, the pre-battle singing at dawn, and the three level firing lines on a ""mealy-bag"" redoubt, you can't do better than ""ZULU""."

A report was received and Chelmsford moved out with half his strength, leaving the camp occupied by six companies of the 24th Regiment, two guns, some colonial volunteers and some native contingents: about 1800 troops in all. Late in the morning , an advance post warred of the approach of a Zulu army.

The camp commander spread his troops around the perimeter of the camp, but the Zulus broke through, the native contingents fled but were chased and killed. The 21 officers and 534 soldiers of the 24Th Regiment were killed where they fought , there were no wounded , no prisoners and no missing. Only about 50 Europeans and 300 Africans escaped. The battle of Isandhalwana was recorded in history as the worst defeat ever inflicted on a modern army by native troops . The invasion of Zululand was temporarily halted until reinforcements were received from Britain. Despite the defeat, the Zulus were humiliated and crushed at Roark's Drift battle..

Jack Hawkins, who plays the vicar and Nigel Green are my favorites. But there are many scenes with other characters that lead up to the main event, the Zulu attack.

Put simply, everything came together in this movie, from the intelligent, sensitively written script, through the fine acting and camera work, to the outstanding score. It is a classic of the 60s, a miracle as the colour sergeant says at the end. With hindsight it's impossible to see quite how Endfield and Prebble came up with the project and then managed it so successfully, especially taking into account the difficulties of filming on location in apartheid SA. And filming in a burning building too was extremely risky. The film is fifty years old now and while it has obviously aged to some degree, its qualities remain extraordinary, as does its appearance - what colour! The only aspect that doesn't quite convince is the extent of the close combat. I would have thought that in close combat Zulu agility and dexterity with the assegai, plus their numbers, would have won through. I would expect the British to have held them at bay almost entirely with rifle fire. But the historical research was solid so I could be wrong."

","Ahhh, Zulu! The all-time favourite Sunday afternoon lounge-room general's movie! There's nothing quite like the sense of occasion of gathering some friends around the TV with rations and beers on hand, cranking up the video (or DVD) and settling in for an afternoon of pith helmets, cordite smoke and troop dispositions. After almost 40 years, Zulu still has the power to send chills up the spine with its windswept silences before the inevitable attacks, its chilling bursts of hand-to-hand combat, and its grim depiction of English stubbornness (or 'duty') in an alien environment. While Caine's Lieutenant Bromhead comes across as perhaps a touch too effete, every other performance is noteworthy for its individual qualities; Baker provides a wonderfully stolid, jut-jawed leading role, Nigel Green is unforgettable as everyone's favourite colour sergeant-cum-surrogate dad, and Jack Hawkins is also memorable as the well-intentioned (i.e. meddling pain-in-the-neck) cleric. Also noteworthy is the presence of future Inkatha party (and Zulu) leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, rehearsing no doubt for the imagined future revolution in South Africa!<br/><br/>While Zulu can perhaps be viewed as a homage to warriors of both sides, it is obvious now where the filmmakers expected their viewers' sympathies to lie. At the end of the film, ""a bayonet, with a bit of guts behind it"" has saved the British soldiers for another day, while piles of the depersonalised Zulu fighters lie at their feet. Sure, they put up a good show, as would the gallant players of a vanquished rugby side, but as the credits roll, Men of Harlech swells the collective breast, and Britannia waives the rules once again. Still, if one can set aside the political correctoscope for an hour and a half, Zulu can be thoroughly enjoyed as a tense, detailed and well-characterised classic that transcends the costume battle genre and makes for a great ensemble piece of 60s English star-power."
"Joxerlives","10","5","5","31 December 2012"," A film to stir the blood!
","Almost beyond parody although Monty Python has a good go at it in 'The Meaning of Life' not to mention Blackadder the Forth. Such an awesome film when you see a small force of 140 British soldiers taking on the overwhelming might of 4000 Zulus who have just massacred a British column of some 1200 men. A very, very male film with dancing Zulu brides aside only one woman with very few lines. The action scenes are thrilling with some terrific performances from Caine in particular (arguably it was this film which made him a star). You could be the most ardent pacifist in the world but still be cheering along at the cry of 'Front rank FIRE!'. It pulls no punches in terms of the violence although lacks the realistic gore of modern war films such as 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>Some say it's politically incorrect, we have an imperialist war with a mechanised European country taking on an African tribe. That said the Zulus have just defeated an understrength British brigade with little more than spears and shields and cunning, a feat unheard off in the history of colonialism ('You're a better man than I am because you broke a British square'-Kipling) and are well armed with the rifles they have captured. Much as 'Black Hawk Down' is a favourite film in Somalia the Zulus are actually very fond of this film as it shows their undoubted courage, toughness and intelligence (although I'm sure 'Zulu Dawn' where they win is their preferred sequel). In terms of historical accuracy it's pretty good, the more you learn about the real thing the more impressed you are with how it's depicted here. <br/><br/>All told it is the PERFECT way to spend a rainy bank holiday and Richard Burton's narration just the icing on the cake."

","This epic adventure is one of the yardsticks of the action-cum-war film genre, offering intense excitement, bloody action, and furious violence and all within a PG certificate too. A perennial favourite of the British television stations, it tells the true story of a British detachment stranded at the outpost of Rorke's Drift in hostile enemy territory, facing an angry army of 4,000 Zulu warriors intent on killing all and sundry.<br/><br/>The main army has already been slaughtered (an event chronicled in 1979's fine prequel, ZULU DAWN), so it's down to our stiff-upper-lip British and Welsh heroes - including Michael Caine in his standout, star-making performance as a young, cocky officer, and Stanley Baker as the heroic older rank - to battle against the dreaded foe. The film builds slowly in the first hour, displaying some glorious African locations, before letting rip with full-scale battle and destruction come the second half.

","Outstanding movie, though this is not a historically accurate depiction (very few films are) but a gripping evocation of a fiercely-fought battle between a beleaguered British garrison and a large force of Zulus. The overwhelming superiority in numbers of the Zulus was offset by the firepower of the British soldiers and the long reach of their bayonets.<br/><br/>Rorke's Drift was fought on the same day, and within a few miles, of the dramatic defeat of the British at Isandlwana in a war that, in all honesty, did the invading colonial forces little credit. Rorke's Drift was portrayed by some as such a glorious victory in an attempt to take away attention from Isandlwana.<br/><br/>But enough of the history. There is some great acting, fantastic score, amazing camera work and superb landscapes. Little point in making comments about the rights or wrongs of colonialism - everyone in Europe was at it at the time (and don't forget that it was only three years after the defeat of Custer at the Little Big Horn which was in its own way part of another colonial adventure). Judge it for what it is - a great movie."

","Across the ages of man's endless conflicts between himself and contemporary cultures, arises this incredible tale of honor and battlefield courage. The year is 1889, the place Isandhlwana Africa and the enemies are the Zulu nation and the occupying British army. Jubliiant over the English with an unexpected but major victory, the Zulu nation, under their Chiefton Cetshwayo move on to endanger and destroy the small contingent force at Rorke's Drift. The tiny station with a force of 100 British regulars and some fifty native contingents, are commanded by young and inexperienced Lt. Gonville Bromhead. It is his command the Zulus seek to decimate. Before Cetshwayo's warriors arrive, Bromhead is visited by an English engineer, Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) who's been ordered to build a bridge near the fort. Needless to say when the Zulus arrive, both men jockey for command to decide how to handle the oncoming threat. In the end, a joint co-operative effort and Chard's leadership face the daunting task of holding out against four thousand Zulu warriors. With the superior acting talents of Jack Hawkins, James Booth and Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Frank Bourne, the film is a rousing battlefield confrontation. The acting is superior, the location scenery and the magnificence Zulu nation make for a dramatic classic. Being this is Michael Caine's first major movie, it notably establishes him as a legitimate Thespian. Sealing this classic is the timeless narrative voice of Sir. Richard Burton. *****"

It evenly illustrates the courage and resolution of the men on both sides of the battlefield.<br/><br/>The initial cultural clash between Chard and Bromhead is reminiscent of the friction found in television series such as ""Upstairs Downstairs"" which the British dramatize so well. Yet as history has shown, when the people of Britain are united against a common foe, they are extremely courageous.<br/><br/>Most compelling of all is the portrayal of the Zulu as honorable, brave warriors fighting for their homeland.

"ajs-10","Null","7","8","21 August 2011"," A great old fashioned epic war film Classic!...
","I have seen this film many times before; it was a particular favourite of mine as a youth. It's a story of immense bravery against seemingly insurmountable odds, and I guess that's what attracted me to it. Add to that, it's based on real events and you've got me sold! The British army has fought in many battles over the years and many medals have been won. The highest award for bravery is the Victoria Cross and no fewer than eleven were won by the defenders of a small outpost called Rorke's Drift in Natal, Africa on January 22, 1879.<br/><br/>Having already won a great victory, slaughtering 1,200 British soldiers, Zulu warriors are on the march. Four thousand are headed for Rorke's Drift, a small missionary hospital in Natal. A detachment of troops from a Welsh regiment are stationed there under the command of Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. An officer of the Royal Engineers, Lieutenant John Chard, is also in the vicinity when word comes of the defeat. Having seniority, Chard takes command and begins to make preparations for the coming attack. A missionary, Otto Witt and his daughter, Margareta are also there, but are proving more of a hindrance than a help. After the first Zulu attack the Witts' are sent away as Otto is distracting the men with his talk of death. Wave after wave of attacks ensue with great losses on both sides, but the garrison remains undefeated. Can they hold out? Will help come in time? Of course I can't tell you here or the Spoiler Police will have me clapped in irons and put on Company punishment again.<br/><br/>Mostly filmed on location in Natal, you really get a feeling for the place. Of course the filmmakers couldn't get 4,000 extras to play the Zulu army, but they did a pretty good job with what they had Remember, no CGI back in 1964. This film is famous for being the first major film role for Michael Caine, who did a great job as the young aristocratic Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. Equally good was Stanley Baker as Lieutenant John Chard R.E. Other performances of note came from; Jack Hawkins as Otto Witt, Ulla Jacobsson as Margareta Witt, James Booth as private Henry Hook and Nigel Green as Colour-Sergeant Bourne.<br/><br/>The story is told entirely from the point of view of the garrison and this does make matters seem very one sided. Of course the battle scenes are all very well choreographed, but nothing like as brutal as they would be if it was made today. I loved this film when I was growing up and, believe it or not, I still love it today. It is most probably because of the story it tells, rather than it being an outstanding piece of filmmaking. I must admit, though, that Michael Caine does stand out in this one, his star potential is there for all to see. Over all, a film I have no problem recommending, even though it may not be politically correct to do so these days.<br/><br/>My Score: 8.4/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 13,839 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."
"Corfman","Null","7","8","2 January 2004"," A very much in a true sense 'un-racist' film
","'Zulu' is an under-rated superb film on so many levels. I have studied and enjoyed this film closely many times (DVD wide screen version) and am impressed with the whole work, as well as the respect given both 'sides', what an extraordinary well done story about a clash of two great cultures. In a way very much in a true sense, an 'un-racist' film. Is it perhaps unspoken ....like the film 'The Sand Pebbles' but of a different time and situation saying...are we beginning to get in over our heads?<br/><br/>Michael Caine's introductory performance balances so well Actor/Producer Stanley Baker's with their contrasting characters as 'officers and gentlemen'. Baker the Royal Engineer working middle class (officer commanding by a seniority of only several months) and Michael Caine's 'Bromhead', the product of an upper crust distinguished military family. The film tells convincingly about fear, discipline, and courage....and how they seem to find it within themselves. How discipline and training can replace fear, paying off at the critical moment. It is often brutally plain and simple.<br/><br/>Without cliché, this film asks all the good questions. ""Why us?"" asks the thoughtful private to his 'Color Sergeant', ""Because we're here...and no one else."" he replies. The Welsh ex-dairy farmer who if hard fighting, would perhaps sensibly 'escape' emotionally to tending to a sick calf. This is played as counter point humorously in Zulu, yet it also shows too perhaps it is not well to think too hard about what is happening to survive the battle. Actor Jack Hawkins almost dominates the early scenes...and reminds us what is faith vs. 'religion'...and perhaps whom is better 'spiritually equipped', the preacher or the 'Color Sargeant'?<br/><br/>Actor Michael Caine is introduced here to the film public as 'Bromhead'. In one of his best played scenes of this actor's budding illustrious career...... remarks to pacing Stanley Baker ""Did you know my grandfather was at Waterloo?"", and follows reflecting his vulnerability...""I wish now...right now, I was a damned 'ranker' like Hook...."", realizing his social trap, the terribly high expectations beyond his physical predicament - duty to his military family as well as to his country. Sadly battle and expectation of death can be a great social equalizer too. <br/><br/>So very pleased to read here that genuine Zulu and the Zulu Chief are featured in the production. Chief Buthelezi as Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande. <br/><br/>Actor James Booth's 'Hook' character we soon find is a complex one, well acted. One moment malingering humor, next a test of will , then the Victoria Cross. In the end, Hook quite unchanged - but unquestionably broadened. <br/><br/>Actor Gert Van der Berg as Boar Lt. Adendorff is a key character in the first half and the end of the films story. Adendorff as Lt. Chard's Boar military adviser, we gain insight into the Zulu's disciplined ways.....and values. ""He's counting your guns! Referring to the Zulu chief of the far ridge, explaining to Baker (and the audience), ""the ole boy is counting your guns....testing your firepower with the lives of his warriors!"" I so regret with astonishment that we have not seen more of Actor Gert Van der Berg, appearing in only two very fine films, 'Zulu' and 'The Naked Prey'. <br/><br/>The sweep of the wide screen cinema photography is breathtaking. The hills, sky, and clouds incorporated in many scenes with low upward camera angles, much like in 'Patton'.<br/><br/>The only small criticism of Zulu might be technically, were in a few of the early scenes, some not so smooth sound editing as they jump to a new scene. The sound mixing quite extraordinary later in the film overall.<br/><br/>The final scenes a remarkable salute to both sides. The exhausted Europeans for their hard fought defense, the Zulu's whom withdraw after the battle salute - both sides knowing very well the Europeans could have been wiped out if the Zulu King merely wished it.<br/><br/>When they charge in those great numbers at those out numbered English (Welsh garrison), it is the war chant ""Usuto! Usuto!"" (Kill! Kill!) the fierce Zulu are yelling.<br/><br/>As for political correctness or not, it is only for the high price of college tuition we ever at all believed in those tiresome narrow political professors. ""My God.....your from the sixtys!"", but again....that is a line from another good movie. LOL.<br/><br/>Caine has another extraordinary line near the films end....""does everyone feel like this afterward..... Sick?"" Feeling something else too...""ashamed?"" Stanley Baker reflects...""you have to be alive to be sick"". ""You asked me and I told you"" Caine softly retorts.<br/><br/>Corfman"

","I have read others comments with interest, particularly those complaining about small bullet holes. Well it was 1964, and to be truthfull, do you need gore to explain a true event?<br/><br/>Anyway - a couple of facts about the story which were not depicted correctly. Cetewayo did not order the attack. In fact he ordered his men NOT to attack, but a head strong son ignored him.<br/><br/>The tribute song at the end of the film, did not take place, the Zulu just disappeared into the night.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, and having read the books and seen the film (x number of times since I was 15 (in 1968). I had the opportunity in 1998 to travel to Rorkes Drift and stand where the soldiers stood to face the Zulu.<br/><br/>The foundations of the hospital building has a museum built over it full of interesting stuff, the small grave yard to the fallen soldiers, and the grave stone remembering all the dead zulu are thought provoking.<br/><br/>
But what strikes you most is how small the area was in which the soldiers held their ground, with Zulu firing on them from the hills behind and charging them from 3 sides. As you stand inside foundation stones marking the site of the walls etc, the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, and you wonder just how you would have reacted facing up to such a huge army, charging down on you.<br/><br/>If you are a Zulu film fanatic, and should you get the chance - go there. And take time to visit the site of the film Zulu Dawn, where the Zulu attacked the garrison camped at the foot of a hill BEFORE moving on to the small unit at the Drift. White stones mark where men fell, kept bright by dedicated Zulu staff."
"trpdean","Null","11","14","25 September 2002"," Best Action Movie I've Ever Seen
","Simply thrilling. <br/><br/>What a movie! This story of a battle is breath-taking. The sheer action, the music generate so much suspense. The humanity of the characters is so brought home (their fear and bravery, their wonder, their homesickness, their pride, their laziness, their social snobbery). <br/><br/>As wonderful as anyone would find this movie, I do have some criticisms: a) the cleric's role - one assumes he's introduced to put additional pressure on the soldiers attempting to do their duty - yet no one seems to pay attention, so what was the point of his scenes? I can understand Jack Hawkins' irritation at the way the character is portrayed - a scared drunken weak buffoon instead of a serious pacifist, b) I think Caine overplays the aristocratic officer - it needn't mean utterly effeminate, c) the soldiers' frequent crediting of the Zulus as if they were simply a contending rugby team is not very believable - it's hard to imagine a war in which one doesn't really hate and despise the enemy for killing one's friends, and d) the character of Hook seemed a bit of a clicheed cockney.<br/><br/>That aside, wow! This is what John Wayne's The Alamo should have been like - instead much was frittered away in subplots.  <br/><br/>The courage of the moviemaker to show one battle - without silly subplots about the characters' interaction, a fictitious romantic story, or long expository scenes about the genesis of the Zulu Wars - is remarkable. I've seen this perhaps a half dozen times. Everyone I know who has seen it, tells his friends."
"BM4372","Null","14","19","18 August 2001"," Puts most American movies to shame
","1964's Zulu is one of my favorite movies of all time. Its an almost flawless film full of drama and action, and the musical score sends chills down my spine. It also makes me ashamed of being an American, not because of any nostalgia for the hero's of the movie, but because I know Americans could never make(or appreciate)a film this good. American film-makers would feel unexplainable urges to butcher this story in some of the following ways: Because Americans are offended by the color red, the film-makers would have to alter history enough to change the army tunics from red to khaki. As we all know, the hero HAS to be your standard macho American, it wouldn't matter how they get him into the plot(take U-571, revisionist history is NOT a problem). Also, all of the British characters would HAVE to be portrayed as complete buffoons. The original makers of Zulu did insert a pretty girl into the plot, but thats not enough for American audiences, she would need to find herself unable to resist the animal magnetism of our gratuitously placed American good ol' boy. To give the film a post-1993 feel, we might need more girls and include some lesbianism for no apparent reason. A hip alternative sound track by Moby would also help. Ah, I make myself laugh. Oh, one more thing, while I don't think there's any active or malicious racism present in the 1964 version, to easily offendable Americans the inherent racism of the subject matter(Americans are incapable of grasping concepts like British vs. Zulu, they can only grasp white vs. black) would require constant apologizing throughout the film. The native levies would have to stick around, and at least one of them would need to be more heroic than anyone else. There would also need to be a PC discussion on the negative impacts of colonialism. Oh, sure these changes would rob the film of any historical accuracy or artistic merit it ever had, but that never stopped Hollywood before, and the sad part is that a butchered remake like this would end up being a hit in the US, compared to the original anyway. In short, 1964's ""Zulu"" is a great film, and nothing that is created in the bowels of American pop culture will ever be able to truly compare with great movies like that. I probably should have spent more time in praise of the real ""Zulu"" rather than condemn the hypothetical one, but from reading the other reviews I see no reason to preach to the converted."

I have watched this movie at least five times. The portrayal of the Zulu nation was very empathetic, IMO, showing them to be an honorable nation fighting against the British whom they viewed as intruders. The one scene where there was a stand-off between a young Zulu warrior and a British soldier about to kill him was very dramatic and moving. The direction was flawless. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it both for the entertainment value and the historical account of this battle."

On the Blu- Ray release, the cinematography is peerless and high quality. Audio was recorded mono (not stereo). The FX is 60's... fake 60's blood, and largely unrealistic hand-to-hand combat. But it doesn't detract at all, because the warriors and characters are very real. <br/><br/>After reading the real history of the battle of Rourke's Drift, I was surprised at the lesser British and Zulu casualties vs. what's depicted in the film (17 British killed, 300 Zulu killed). <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is a true classic."

What impressed me upon first viewing (as a boy of 10 or so) was the respect with which the Zulus were portrayed. What could have been just a hackneyed actioner about heroes battling impossible odds is instead a sober and intelligent drama of the wastefulness of armed conflict. Although told from the British point of view, the Zulus are depicted as valorous, clever and wholly dedicated to the rightness of their cause. Director Cy Endfield and his assistants stage the siege with both clarity and eye-filling spectacle. The cast is excellent, with Stanley Baker a standout as the reluctant engineer-soldier, Jack Hawkins an all-too-human man of the cloth, and Nigel Green as a sergeant with the stiffest upper lip in the Empire. Stephen Dade's deep-focus photography and a rousing score by John Barry help make this one of the manliest of all manly movies."
"historyman61","Null","4","4","14 December 2000"," They got most of it right.
","Several posted comments point out facutal errors in this film.  While it is true that some liberties were taken, ZULU still manages to condense a great deal of history and culture into what is essentially an action film.<br/><br/>The Zulus were not a mob of ignorant savages.  They were among the most successful and feared warriors in Africa, due in large part to their superb military organization and weaponry.  The cowhide shields and short stabbing spears, called assegeis, emphasized close combat, something the Romans perfected centuries before.  Against other non-industrial aboriginal peoples, and even against Europeans with firearms, they were a formidable foe.  Their tactical formation of the bull buffalo, with elements that engaged and encircled an enemy before delivering the main blow, is a classic example of double-envelopment.<br/><br/>The British incursion into Zululand was calculated to precipitate a war that the Zulus very much wanted to avoid.  Only when their lands were invaded did the Zulus take the field against the British.  Their major victory as Isandlwana was the British equivalent of Custer's Last Stand, while Roarke's Drift proved that disciplined troops in a defensive position could hold off the massed attacks.  Unfortunately for the Zulus, going to war meant abandoning their crops and cattle, resulting in the threat of starvation. This, and the eventual deployment of a substantial British army, doomed the Zulus to ultimate defeat.<br/><br/>One other, rather strange note.  In the movie GLADIATOR, listen closely to the chanting of the army of Gauls in the opening battle scene.  It is the chant of the attacking Zulu warriors from the movie ZULU.  Even the beating of shields and cries of ""Usuthu!"" (the Zulu's invocation of their leader} are clearly audible.  Did Ridley Scott think no one would notice?"

His thrusts and parries were by the book.  It illustrates one reason the British defended their position with success.  You pit a soldier trained in bayonet drill against an untrained fighter with a spear, and the man with the empty rifle with a knife stuck on the front will always win.<br/><br/>The same theme applies to the other reason those British soldiers were able to stand their ground.  They were trained and disciplined in the efficient use of their rifles.  Even with those old single-shot rifles, their aiming, firing and reloading drills worked to bring overwhelming massed fire to bear.  (And the movie's depiction of this is spectacularly clear.)  Twice the number of armed civilians would have been wiped out by the Zulus in the first stages of that battle."

","This is one of the great British war movies depicting one of the most famous actions in British military history, albeit with more than a little poetic licence. In 1879 a force of 1200 British soldiers were slaughtered by the Zulu army at Isandlwana, soon after a force of 4000 Zulus headed to the mission at Rorkes Drift which was defended by a mere 100 men. It is this latter engagement which is depicted in this film.<br/><br/>This is not a film about heroic white men defeating 'savage natives'; through out the Zulus are depicted as a brave and highly disciplined fighting force and whenever one of the soldiers makes a derogatory comment about the Zulus he is quickly corrected and by the end of the film the soldiers on both sides have a deep respect of the other. The first hour shows the defenders at the mission preparing for the inevitable attack; setting up barricades, making firing holes in the walls of the buildings and putting out the cooking fires. Once the battle begins the action is fairly relentless with Zulu warriors continuing to pour towards the mission despite continuous fire from the defenders.<br/><br/>While the action may be tame by the standards of modern war films it still gives a feel of the battle this is helped by the excellent cast which includes Stanley Baker, Michael Caine and Jack Hawkins, it isn't just the stars who do well, the hundreds of Zulu extras made the opposing side totally believable. As well as the fine acting the great score by John Barry must be mentioned; it is impossible to hear it without it making ones hairs stand on end. Filmed on location in Natal the mountains prove in impressive back drop even if it wasn't filmed at the site of the actual battle."

","Wow. As a History undergraduate it is indescribably refreshing to see a historical film that adheres so faithfully to the facts, and yet loses none of its drama and suspense by doing so. There are however a couple of historical inaccuracies that may be of interest to fans of the film. Firstly is the fact that although the film states how many VCs were awarded and to whom, it does not record that Rorke's Drift received more awards of the Victoria Cross than any prior, or subsequent, single action by the British armed forces. Secondly, as noted in the Trivia section, Private Hook was neither a troublemaker, nor a malingerer. He was in fact an incredibly brave individual who saved many lives by his courageous conduct in the hospital, which he had been posted to guard. Other characters are portrayed inaccurately, i.e. James Dalton (Highly experienced soldier, indispensable to Chard and Bromhead in the battle),Gonville (Gonny) Bromhead (Extremely deaf. This handicap was the reason that B company were posted to Rorke's Drift rather than Isandahlwana!) Overall however, the film is astonishingly accurate, and although it shies away from showing how truly brutal and savage this battle was, it is no less effective for it. To conclude, a beautiful and well balanced film that ranks amongst the finest examples of popular history that I have ever witnessed."

I also suspect that he doesn't get the amusement British audiences still get today when they're reading the register at the end and he reads out the names of 10 different men called Williams-a very Welsh name! However, he is absolutely right. The film is a brilliant portrayal of a battle in which none of the men expecting to live, fighting in a foreign land none of them wanted to be in. It's no coincidence that Hook (Peter Booth) is so resentful-in the 19th century it was not uncommon for common criminals to escape the hangman's noose (or prison) by enlisting in the army and serving the empire abroad. 4000 native soldiers fighting for their land and right, against 100 or so British (and swiss!) soldiers fighting for their lives. It is a fitting tribute that they received so many VC's (Victoria Cross-Britain's highest military medal for those who have shown a ridiculous amount of bravery when the odds of death are 90%), including to the reluctant Hook, who rescued so many injured troops from the hospital when it caught fire and was over run with Zulus.<br/><br/>It is a film that any fan of the period, or of Britain's imperial history and every schoolboy in Britain should watch.

","I felt like I was hit by an Iwisa. This periodic war-film from the 1960's, really did make an impact on me. Directed by Cy Endfield, the movie tells the epic account of the true story of an under-strength British forces defending an isolated African mission at Rorke's Drift against large packs of Zulu warriors, during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the depiction of the Battle of Rorke's Drift was amazing to watch. It's like the British's version of the Western genre. The beautiful landscape of South Africa was used very well. You really get the scale of how large, the Zulu army is and how small, the British forces, by the way, the camera frame, its endless hills and mountains. Yet, the movie doesn't really show or explain, why the Zulus and British were fighting. There was no mention of the British wanting greater control over non-renewable natural resources like Diamonds or how the Zulus felt unjustly treated by the colonial regime. Still, I like how the film doesn't do many cheap tricks to demonize, either one side. The film could had easily, portray the Zulus as killer hordes of savages; seeing how this movie was made, during the height of apartheid, where the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. However, the film doesn't do that. You see the Zulus be willing to allow the missionaries families to escape the battle, as well, punish its own members, for trying to stop them from fleeing. Yet, I wish the movie didn't make it seem like the Zulus were the invaders, when in truth, the British were. In real events, King Cetewayo (Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi) was hoping for negotiated peace with the British after the Battle of Isandlwana. After all, King Cetewayo didn't want to attack Rorke's Drift as it would make him, seem like an aggressor to the British public, as the Drift was nowhere near the borders of Zululand and there was no military value to it. Yet a party of some 4,000 Zulu reserves mounted, such of an attack. However, after King Cetwayo heard about it, the Zulus were forced to retreat after one day of battle, not because of show of respect to British for their bravery. The unauthorized of the attack is one of the true reasons, why the Zulus retreat, along with lack of supplies. It's one of the bigger historic inaccurate that the movie got wrong along with the British death count, which was 17. Another is the battlefield singing contest. While, I dig it, as a powerful scene in the movie, it's not really historical accurate as there were no much event, recorded. Another thing, the song ""Men of Harlech"" features prominently as the Wales's regimental tune; did not become the official march song until much, much later in the First World War (1914-1918). In the time of the battle, the regimental song was ""The Warwickshire Lad"". Another thing, while both Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers & Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine), an infantry officer were heroic. In truth, the real hero of Rorke's Drift was Commissary James Dalton (Dennis Folbigge). It was Dalton who persuaded Chard and Bromhead to remain at Rorke's Drift when their first instinct was to abandon the post, and it was Dalton who organized and inspired the defense. Despite that, I think, both actor, Stanley Baker and Michael Caine did great in their roles in the action scenes, even if the real-life Bromhead is supposedly deaf and Chard was a heavy smoker. I also love the down to earth complex relationship between common-man, Chard with that, Brownhead's pompous aristocrat. I like how the film, makes them, likable, even with their questionable decisions. I just wish the writers did the same with Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins). All of his scenes were a little bit, too annoying. Despite that, I think, Jack Hawkins did great in his acting. The same goes with the rest of the supporting cast like Glynn Edwards and James Booth, even with their somewhat hard to hear, English accents. They did great in showing the anti-war sentiment, while unnecessary fighting in the action scenes. Even the Zulus extras were great in most of the action scenes. I love that majority of them, were largely descendants of the actual warriors who took part in the battle, among them the then chief of the Zulu Nation, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Seeing, none of the Zulus had ever seen a movie, it was difficult for them to understand what they were doing playing to a camera, but somewhat they pull it off. I just wish, some of the hand to hand combat were better. It really didn't look like some of the spears and swords were making skin connect. It's obvious with the fake-looking rubber bayonets that many of the close-combat scenes are done with more regard to safety than realism. The gun fight instead was very intense, not only by sight, but also by sound. I love the rattling of shields; and the thunder of marching feet. It really made the Zulus army, seem so much more powerful than they really were. The stirring music score is by John Barry was also amazing. Yet, the narration by Richard Burton could had done before. I felt like it wasn't really needed, even in the end. It's also just funny, that this movie was originally rated PG, seeing how much blood, and high death toll, it has. Plus, the fact that it has topless tribal dancers. I just glad, the producers didn't censored any of this. It adds to the realistic tone of the film. Overall: Filmed on a grand scale, Zulu is a rousing recreation of real-life events. A must watch for any film fan."
"Corky1984","Null","7","9","6 May 2005"," Patriotic brilliance
","The central theme of Zulu is of plucky British resistance against a vastly larger enemy force of highly skilled warriors at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. The battle scenes are first rate and entertainingly capture the spirit of Victorian colonial warfare. Baker and Caine excel as the British officers, ably backed up by an excellent cast. The historical background to the film is equally interesting, Britain's troubles with the local population in Africa leading to bloody fighting and destruction. The great bravery and comradeship of the British Army is captured nicely, whilst the supreme talents of the Zulu warriors are also recreated spectacularly for the audience. The real history behind the film differs somewhat according to what you read and Zulu certainly played up certain themes to produce a more gung-ho picture, but overall it cannot be faulted. The whole film exudes professionalism and is well worth seeing."

It is set in 1879 and depicts 4000 Zulu warriors heading for Rorkes Drift in Natal where a small supply post is defended by about 100 British soldiers.<br/><br/>The first half of the film consists of showing the various characters from the British side.

"mcguin71","9","3","3","3 January 2015"," A true to life story of strength and courage - on both sides, and without a 'Hollywood romance'
","Zulu is a fine example of what a war movie should be. There's no attempt at tying in unnecessary back story's, oddly misplaced romances, or blood & guts and cgi action and explosions for the sole sake of transitory visual impact as opposed story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately few modern films of the genre can match the classics of the 50s and 60s when the story was #1 and the money makers of marketing departments were there to sell the film on merit as opposed to mere profitability - Saving Private Ryan is one good example of a recent film that makes the grade, Pearl Harbour tells the 'Hollywood war story' where truth falls behind a sloppy badly after romance (Those who worked on Tora! Tora! Tora! - a vastly superior movie of the same events - must be turning in their graves!)<br/><br/>The mention of Tora! Tora! Tora! is deliberate. Its from the era of film where both story and events were displayed from a realistic human point of view as opposed to what can be rewritten and shown through CGI. Here just as in Tora! both sides in the Battle of Rourkes drift are accurately displayed as brave, valiant warriors but not without human flaws. There's no attempt to portray the natives as a 'lesser savage animal' but merely as an alternative representation of the warrior spirit. <br/><br/>It may be noted just how little gore is shown in any scene compared to modern equivelents, probably as this is about the battle not how much blood is on show in an attempt to crave notoriety amongst potential audiences. Death, and killing, is not treated as a game and whilst each army treats individual losses differently they both respect the sacrifices made by their own as well as the others sides warriors. What you certainly do not see is gloating over kills.<br/><br/>The acting is good, and despite the inevitable screen treatment is based upon solid characters following scripts and scenes that closely match records of the original battle - being a true life battle its nice to see it not sugar coated with incredible feats of heroism written to suit, or trying to demonstrate the absurd notion that this was somehow a naive uneducated native contingent up against obviously superior regular colonial army<br/><br/>As noted by others this wasn't a battle where either side came out as definitive winner or loser. The film follows as there is no victory celebrations simply a mutual respect as the two sides part ways. There's nothing patriotic in the movie about how the British slaughtered the miscreant natives and the viewer is left in no doubt that had the battle continued losses would have been very great on the Zulu side, but absolute on the British - anyone winning this battle would no longer have been an effective unit and thus worthy of bragging rights. ... Just for once its nice to sit back and watch a realistic war movie, based on real event, without mass cgi, consulted and unnecessary subplots - or worse still rewriting history to ensure specific characters are standup hero's, both real and worst still people who are inventions of the writers minds!<br/><br/>This is how it should be done - and it was all done by the British about the British in a battle they didn't win in a war they aren't proud of."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","3","3","31 July 2014"," Stunning cinematography and surprisingly profound.
","Zulu is one of those classics I'd never thought I'd get around to. It never seems to appear on critic lists or award shortlists but its devoted fans push it to modest positions on reader polls. It's easy to see why now. I thought it was going to be a very cold and procedural war film, and it is, but it's balanced out by being surprisingly intellectually stimulating. British films like this are rarely symbolic of myths, unless they're directed by certain auteurs. It's a depiction of a clash of cultures and although they fight, they long for aspects of each other. It's a film on such a grand scale that its minor events and characters feel too trivial to invest in. Granted, it's only on the British side where faces become familiar, but the zulus themselves have their own dignity. The cinematography is up with Lawrence of Arabia and Barry Lyndon in the best of all-time with its wide expanses and vivid reds and blues. It constantly bubbles with tension despite the inevitabilities. If only it was as emotionally grabbing as it is aesthetically and intellectually pleasing, but perhaps it's a film that demands the scale of an IMAX screen for that to be conveyed. Pantomime deaths aside, Zulu is a film that thoroughly deserves its acclaim and perhaps a little bit more.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Member","Null","3","3","13 December 2000"," A good film but needed more background.
","This is a film about a military outpost guarded by soldiers who are mainly from Britain and are attacked by a Zulu army. While the battle scenes are well done and the atmosphere stays tense the film is somewhat devoid of any real message. I could not completely enjoy the film because of the dated attitude it seems to have about the incident. The film has a Peckinpah-esque feel about it but it isn't able to show the whole story behind the events. Apparently the prequel sheds some light on the situation but there should have been more background in Zulu as well, granted that the film is as long as it is. If the viewer of this film knows about history, then this film can be looked at from other perspectives then just as a heroic tale of courage of the British forces."

The pre battle rituals of the Zulu's really gets the adrenalin going and is the most powerful war scene I have ever seen.

The scenery is indeed striking, and the music underscores all the developments ably.  I gave this movie a nine.  Otherwise, I doubt I could add to others' praise.<br/><br/>I only add this one criticism.<br/><br/>OF COURSE there is one major religious figure, the missionary Reverend Witt, and OF COURSE he turns into a raving loon, a coward, a drunk, and therefore a hypocrite.  The only problem with that being that evidently the actual Rev. Witt was nothing of the sort, and in fact was one of two clergy who served nobly in this fight (see http://rorkesdriftvc.com/zulu.htm).  And now, forty years later, one notes that STILL it seems most comfortable for screenwriters to depict all Christians (particularly clergy) as dangerous lunatic hypocrites.  One wishes, repeatedly, that they would deal with their personal problems with God, or at least get out a bit more in a wider circle of acquaintances.<br/><br/>That rant aside, I recommend the film highly."

There is only one other war movie that has as great of individual character development as this and it is ""The Caine Mutiny"".  Nigel Green will always be, in my mind, the epitome of the English ""stiff upper lip at all costs"" with his portrayal of Sgt. Bourne. The entire cast portrayed each individual with outstanding clarity. Special kudos to Stanley Baker. The music was a chilling prelude through out and by itself could stand alone."
"mentalcritic","8","9","13","29 June 2005"," As dated as a box of corn flakes, but still brilliant
","The ending of Zulu gives an excellent summation not only of the film's content, but also of its character. At the time the film premiered, it had been a century since the British army created the Victoria Cross, an award for extreme valor in the face of the enemy. Sort of the British answer to the Congressional Medal Of Honour, if you will. In that century, the Victoria Cross had been awarded less than fourteen hundred times. Eleven of them were awarded to participants in the battle depicted in this film. Unlike many films that revolve around massive battle sequences that have come since (Return Of The King, anyone?), Zulu makes the fear, tension, and bravery of the battle very palpable. Simply using some clever photography, a boatload of extras, and some awesome music, Zulu hooks the viewer from the time the battle starts to the time the battle finishes. The bragging Peter Jackson has done about the length of his battle sequences in his last two films rings hollow indeed when you consider the entire second half of this 140-minute film is almost entirely devoted to battle.<br/><br/>Another plus for this film is that the Zulu warriors depicted throughout are played by real Zulu tribesmen. I do not doubt that the land has grown more civilised, but then, the Apartheid laws in South Africa at the time prevented these men from attending the premiere of their own film. So maybe we are not so much more civilised as we would like to believe. Nonetheless, they give as good as they get in pure acting terms, and while they do not have any actual lines of dialogue, they are one of the best parts of the film. The rules against revealing too much of the film prevent me from discussing their finest hour (actually, it's more a few minutes), but it comes as such a pleasant surprise toward the end of the film that it earns Zulu five stars on its own. The other three are for either an attention to nineteenth century battle tactics that borders on the amazing and a powerful string of performances.<br/><br/>Zulu's influence on other films can be seen over forty years later. Paul Verhoeven obviously liked Zulu a lot. StarShip Troopers, which was made thirty-three years later, features a very similar sequence of shots and camera angles during the battles. Some of the dialogue is identical and even some of the musical cues sound eerily similar. Whereas Verhoeven was able to build on this influence and create a battle sequence or three that were legendary in their own right, this feat seems to have been lost on many other filmmakers. While factual errors, anachronisms, and even some very revealing mistakes are abound, such is the manner in which the characters are built that one would never notice them unless they knew in advance. The battle sequences, on the other hand, are impeccably staged, with soldiers firing in rank or strategically laying in the line of fire to test the strength of the defenders. The tension this adds to the later battles cannot possibly be overstated.<br/><br/>I will confess to being somewhat ignorant of 1960s-era British cinema, and admit right now that of all the names involved in this production, Michael Caine's is the only one familiar to me. Those who are only familiar with him through more recent productions such as the flat remake of Get Carter, indie British films such as Shiner, or the steaming pile that was Jaws: The Revenge will see here why Caine is one of the best-regarded film stars of the twentieth century. The dispute over command he portrays with Stanley Baker, and his manner of acting out a soldier stretched past breaking point (just wait for the ending), leave me feeling that the makers of Zulu had every right to feel robbed when they were only nominated for a singular BAFTA for best Art Direction or some crap like that. Even if you ignore the acting, especially from the extras, or John Barry's awesome score music, the cinematography alone deserves a pair of Oscars at the very least.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave Zulu an eight out of ten rather than a ten out of ten is because it is dated. Not as badly as Goldfinger or the two Bonds that came out in the two years previous, but the colour and presentation of the film (at least as it exists on Region 4 DVD) stamp the year of 1964 on every frame of Zulu. Not that this is anything to be ashamed of, but it does make the film less accessible to modern audiences. In spite of that, if you give the drama enough of a chance and want to see a battle sequence done correctly, you cannot go wrong with Zulu. Everyone should see it at least once."

","I first saw Zulu when I was 8-Im now 45, and even today the scene when the troops start singing Men of Harlech before the final Zulu charge still gets to me. A wonderful all action movie with an excellent top-notch cast, and the intelligence to show the Zulu's as the proud warrior nation they are, and their soldiers every bit as disciplined as the British Red Coats. Even if some of the most famous scenes in the movie never happened like the above, the way Zulu was made made it look like it really happened as the film portrayed.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot with a breathtaking landscape, and not an American in site.<br/><br/>The courage and fortitude of the ordinary British soldier of the day of that period shows why the Empire was able to last as long as it did, in short, John Bull in uniform.<br/><br/>My favourite character after the favourite Hookie must be Colour Sergeant Bourne, if any one looks like a Victorian British Army Sergeant in a movie, it has to be him."

"elvircorhodzic","8","4","5","7 August 2017"," ""Fire at will!""
","ZULU is a war drama, which brings a bloody clash between a small company of British troops and an overwhelming force of Zulu warriors. A insensitive story and an archaic tone may not be true. However, this is a fairly accurate report on a historical incident, which fosters a kind of traditional values. I think that an artificial melodrama and an occasional theatricality did some damage in the story. <br/><br/>Zulu is a kind of recreation of the January 22, 1879, siege of Rorke's Drift in Natal, Africa. The army of 4 000 Zulu warriors destroyed a huge British garrison at the Battle of Isandlwana. Thereafter, they move to a small Rorke's Drift. A Royal Engineers officer is determined to stand his ground, despite having only a skeleton garrison at his command. He is in a quiet conflict, in terms of tactics, defense and eventual withdrawal, with an inexperienced lieutenant. An idealistic missionary and his beautiful daughter, can also pose a problem. Zulu warriors are getting closer...<br/><br/>In this case, in addition to standard courage and unconvincing discipline, British troops exhibit a fear and disbelief. That is a very interesting contrast. I do not believe that the colonial expansion of some of the world's great powers, can bring a strong message. However, I've reviewed the film from some of my corners, which are related to that topic.<br/><br/>An authentic scenery is perhaps the biggest advantage of this film. The battle is, regardless of theatricality, realistic. The costume design is top notch. The visual and sound effects are not bad. A constant tension is riddled with cunning interruptions, such as ritual dances or black comedy situations.<br/><br/>Stanley Baker as Lieutenant John Chard has got into something big. However, he has responded well to the task, but his courage and willingness are highly questionable. Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead is inexperienced, but still calm and brave in the most difficult situations. Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne is a traditional, solid and equal arm of one commander. Mr. Green has offered a very good performance. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is a thief and coward, and perhaps the man who has seen enough of war and killing. Jack Hawkins as Reverend Otto Witt is intoxicated by religion. His anxious daughter (Ulla Jacobsson) is torn in all directions.<br/><br/>The Zulus instead sing a song to honour the bravery of the ""defenders"" before departing. Reason has prevailed, at least on one side. Others will enjoy the delusion of victory."
"MattyGibbs","10","4","5","29 August 2014"," Outstanding
","Zulu is in my opinion the best war film ever. A small contingent of British soldiers hold out against a massive Zulu army in 1879. It's a true story and pretty accurate though understandably some liberties were almost certainly taken by the film makers. <br/><br/>I have rarely seen another film that doesn't waste a single scene. The pacing is perfect, the battle scenes although not as bloody as modern day epics are well done and it entertains from start to perfect finish. There are so many memorable scenes and characters that this is one film that really does repay repeated viewings. <br/><br/>For me though what really elevates this film above most others is the acting. Rarely can any film have encouraged such strong performances from every member of the cast even down to the smallest part. Stanley Baldwin is great, Michael Caine puts in a career best performance, William Booth is charismatic as the wayward Hook but for me the highlight is Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Bourne the embodiment of an British soldier. <br/><br/>Zulu is a triumph of film making from start to finish and I am amazed that such a good film doesn't earn a higher rating than 7.8 on here. My children both under 10 have just watched it and loved it, for a film that is 50 years old that it great testament to it's class and staying power. <br/><br/>Simply one of the best films of all time."

While the movie does take a while to pick up, once the action does start, it remains constant up until the very end of the film. The arguments between the reverend and the British commanders regarding whether the sick are to stay and fight or be evacuated. The sheer hopelessness of the situation is built upon when the reverend gets himself drunk upon realizing that there is nothing he can do to convince the soldiers to abandon the upcoming battle.

","Great Britain has done many things for which it should be ashamed, throughout history we have colonised and butchered at the whim of our leaders, but in the hearts of our population there is a resounding beat of moral courage and resolve that echoes throughout our history.<br/><br/>Never before or since has this been illustrated more perfectly than in the events of 22nd January 1879 in the Natal Province of Rorke's Drift, when approximately one-hundred British Soldiers defended an almost derelict outpost against the onslaught of over four and a half thousand Zulu warriors.<br/><br/>I am under no illusion, I have no doubts that our soldiers had no business being in the province, nor in the country - our politicians thirst for colonization and rule of the planet in those harsh times sickens me still, but the soldiers played no part in the decisions of their leaders. They followed their orders, in the name of the Queen, and for the sake of their homeland.<br/><br/>The soldiers had several chances to flee, they could have walked away from the outpost and held their heads high, but with no orders to retreat, the 100 brave men stood their ground.<br/><br/>To fight such a battle against so many Zulu warriors is courage enough, but to winÂ… to stand victorious in the face of such a bloody and relentless onslaught is nothing short of heroic.<br/><br/>The film makes no excuses for the behaviour of our country, nor the jingoistic attitude of it's officers (in fact unlike the majority of factual based movies, the true characters of many of the protagonists were altered to show them in a less flattering light than would have been seen had the truth been told in its entirety). It is not a depiction of our countries finest hour, but of the great and undeniable courage of the men who chose to fight in its name.<br/><br/>The two lead characters are played superbly by Michael Caine and Stanley Baker, but it is the common soldier that steals the heart of the audience. With dry wit and a stiff upper lip, the resolve of England's finest is portrayed to perfection. With unrivalled cinematography and scripting, the events of the day are relived in such a way as to stand each member of the audience shoulder to shoulder with the courageous few that lived and died on that fateful day.<br/><br/>Although the special effects are now sorely dated, the true horrors of warfare are still experienced throughout the film, to the point where the viewer can almost feel the hot sun beating down on their shoulders, and smell the sickening aroma of death and fear as the certainty of defeat drives the defending soldiers to take their stand against inevitability.<br/><br/>No movie has ever so perfectly captured the true nature of courage, and I believe that no movie ever will again.<br/><br/>I dread the day that studio executives decide that a remake is in order (as I am sure one day they will), for this movie deserves its place in cinematic history just as much as the soldiers at Rorke's Drift deserve their place in the history of world conflict.<br/><br/>This movie changed my life, and made me long to be a better man."
"silverscreen888","9","4","5","29 June 2005"," Classic Battle Between British Imperial Redcoats and Zulus; a Great Film
","Zulu is not extremely long, but to me it has the feel of an epic film. The realism of the presentation under Cy Enfield's direction is so intense that one seems to be experiencing the film rather than merely watching it. This is a rare achievement in film-making; and while not every film that achieves this added dimension is a great one, I submit that this one is. Directed by Cy Endfield who also wrote the screenplay with John Prebble, this movie tries to tell the story of a famous 19th Century encounter between outnumbered British troops occupying a forward position after another battle has been fought with the mighty Zulu nation of warriors, and what happens when they must withstand their opponents' attack at Roark's Drift in the Natal Province. The film's unrelenting narrative tells the prelude to battle, the battle itself in stages and its climax and ending in a storied British victory. Solid narration is provided by Richard Burton. The cast includes Stanley Baker (Enfield's partner and co-producer) as the Lt.in charge of the defense, Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen who try to stop the battle, Michael Caine, James Booth, Nigel Green, Patrick Magee, and many others as the soldiers of the beleaguered command. Fortunately for the group, they have one man who knows how the Zulu attack; but the battle is in doubt at every moment, owing to the numbers and courage of the Zulu attackers; only the rifles the British have and their expert use of their limited fortifications save them in the end. The stirring music for the film is provided by John Barry of James Bond fame; the cinematography by Stephen Dade, editing by John Jympson and art direction by Ernest Archer are all superb. Throughout the battle, after they have finished singing, holding group marriage and disposing their troops, the Zulus emit a peculiar battle cry that can be recalled years after one has seen the film. The spectacular on-site scenery of South Africa, the details of army preparations, the characters and reaction of the men in the battle from the foppish neophyte Caine in his first major role to the stolid and professional Baker are memorable and very-well acted. It is to be regretted that Baker and Enfield were able to produce so few films before Baker's untimely death; this one is a classic by any standard and one of the best-loved of all war films, concerning this century or any other. Mention should also be made of the acting by Hawkins, Booth and Green as well as by the leads. This is a great film and not the easiest to keep moving or to present clearly by any means."

So you'd THINK we'd be rooting for the Zulus in ""Zulu"" thought this film, too, seems to portray the natives as somewhat savage (though well organized and tough in this case) and the Brits as good--though not quite as heroic and good as they'd appear in the 30s-40s. As this was made in the 60s, some folks like Hook (the malingerer) and the missionaries are less than noble--a bit of a change from the old pattern at least.<br/><br/>The story is based on the defense of a tiny fort in South Africa during 1879--in the Natal region (in the Northeastern part of the country). This makes for a VERY tense and intense film. At times, you sit there anticipating the inevitable and at others it's non-stop frenetic slaughter. It's exceptionally well made throughout and gives you a real feel for what it must have been like.<br/><br/>By the way, according to IMDb this film is historically inaccurate in that in this fight with the Zulus, only 17 British soldiers were killed. I lost track at 157239238 killed (give or take) during the course of the film!! Although it's NOT the ideal film for this, I watched this movie because I am headed to South Africa in the next few weeks. In addition, I've gotten a hold of a few other films about the country and am watching them to get me in the mood--though, aside from ""Invictus"", I can't think of any films about modern post-apartheid South Africa. If you can think of any appropriate films, drop me a line."
"aviator-5","10","5","7","14 December 2004"," Excellent Film
","Probably the first film in history to give the ""opposition"" (ie the Zulu nation) a fair and impartial portrayal. What is generally not known about this film, is that not all the British actors in the film actually went to South Africa! It was down with clever cutting room techniques coupled with excellent directing. For anyone who wishes to know more about this film I thoroughly recommend that they purchase the latest DVD, which in the United Kingdom at least, includes footage of interviews with various stars of the film. I personally had never realized that a film regarded as one of the great British films had been made on such a limited budget. This accounts for why some of the actors did not go to South Africa, the production could not afford to pay the first class air tickets required by Equity."

The battle raged for over 12 hours before the Zulu's, who lost well over 500 killed, were forced to withdraw. The defenders lost 19 dead & many more wounded & were awarded eleven Victoria Crosses, still a record for a single action. The movie has a few minor inaccuracies, but, on the whole sticks faithfully to the historical story. A great film."

However every once in a while you do meet the politically correct 'something to prove' guy who tries to slander the movie as 'racist'.<br/><br/>There is only one racial slur in the film which comes from the British officer 'Bromhead'. He is immediately shouted down by a white south African boar and a message is sent to the audience to remember those who where not white British but still died in the service of our country. Bromhead is a character that the British audience would never have liked. An upper class snob who looks down his nose at the lower classes and who refuses to get his hands dirty. So his racial slur would have been immediately frowned upon.<br/><br/>By the end of all the bloody fighting both sides take their hats off to the other and salute their bravery. The Zulus sing a native song and through out the film the Welsh soldiers comment on the outstanding bravery the Zulu's showed. The Zulu discipline and military tactics are also admired through out the movie.<br/><br/>The film doesn't portray the British soldiers as invincible he-men and the Zulus as incompetent mad barbarians. It's simply an account of what is still to this day a military miracle (equal to Agincourt) on the side of the British soldiers who where fighting for their lives rather than the British empire."

","Zulu is a film that has been referred to countless times of a classic story of a group of defenders at a fortress being outnumbered by an attacking force, and defending themselves. Such a story applies to not just Rorke's drift, but to other films such as Helm's Deep in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, but we can see why Zulu set the standard.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, with Michael Caine shining as the young Lieutenant, and the story is exciting, but also at the end, strangely touching, gaining a lot of respect and sympathy from me towards both sides of the battle, a balance rarely achieved by Hollywood with the Indians in the 1960s, and pretty much anyone else nowadays.<br/><br/>The story of Rorke's drift is one of the few British Empire films that is not anglophobic and anti-British, all too common in the age of the politically correct), but curiously manages to be very pro-welsh at the same time (a nice change from the usual Mel Gibson approach).

","So many commentators have written praise of ZULU.  It is one of my favorite ten or so films, so the negative comments in this review aren't meant to characterize my attitude toward the movie.<br/><br/>That said, ZULU really does suffer from Cy Endfield's uneven direction. Wanting to strike a balance between showing violence onscreen and not showing it, what we get is scene after scene after scene where someone is supposedly shot and clutches a place where there is visibly no wound, or where a spear or bayonet is evidently just passing between someone's arm and body instead of stabbing them.  It seems, as well, that the slightest prick from a weapon is enough to fell any soldier--except the few lead characters.<br/><br/>I was skeptical when the Zulus' standing around and absorbing gunfire was explained as ""testing our strenth"" and so on.  But I said, fine.  Why on earth are there so many scenes, though, where the Zulu hordes just stand still to allow the British as much time as they need to advance, retreat, or what have you?  Why do the Zulus--I would imagine them to be ferocious hand-to-hand combatants--walk up to their prey and wave their spears in the air until someone else has the chance to shoot or bayonet them?<br/><br/>Since at least half of ZULU consists of combat scenes, it is a shame that the direction of these scenes suffers.  Maybe it wasn't so noticeable in 1964, but in today's world the flaws I have pointed out are almost painfully obvious.<br/><br/>Let me reiterate how much I like ZULU!

Concentrated firepower within a fortified position can stop far superior numbers of less well armed assailants.

I love both films, but I'd rate Zulu Dawn as slightly better."

","One of the reasons that this film looks so good is that the Zulus themselves were recruited to play their forebears, while the rank and file of the British troops were played by South African soldiers, which explains the military precision of both sides. This raises the intriguing thought as to just how such a film could have been made in apartheid South Africa. Apart from being a wonderful 'action film' it is satisfying to see the Zulus portrayed as equally brave warriors. There are few moments in cinematography history to equal the scene where the Redcoats singing Men of Harlech is intercut with the Zulus war chant/battle song. The way that this leads into the most ferocious and final battle is spine tingling"

It's impressive how historically correct the film is and the set was well reproduced. I disagree with the reviewer that thought Jack Hawkins's acting was bad. I thought he was thoroughly obnoxious which is what I would expect a drunken preacher to be. I put together a little screening party at my house once for several friends that I wanted to introduce ""Zulu"" to. I began the evening with ""Zulu Dawn"" and then ""Zulu"".

","Aba(a spoiler here) means soldier in Zulu. When I first saw Zulu it was 1976 (On ""The Great Entertainment,"" a long past but wonderful Boston program hosted by Frank Avruch) during a rainstorm. There is a sort of understatement to this film that makes it all appealing. Underneath all of the seeming banality leading up to the Zulu approach to Rorke's Drift, the impending danger is palatable. Blood and guts in film has a diminishing effect when it is perpetual: Zulu captivates for the opposite reason of no gore. In the real battle the Welsh/Brits must have fought as utter savages. What else I enjoyed about Zulu is how vignettes are stressed versus the surrounding battle. The Zulus are depicted honorable and brave warriors no doubt."

The defenders of Rourkes Drift were not the South Wales Borderers but were in fact a Warwickshire regiment, they became the SWB about two years after the battle. They were not predominantly Welsh, only about 15% were. Hook was a career soldier, I could go on and on.<br/><br/> That aside I rate this as one of the best 'anti-war' films ever, senseless slaughter first of the British at Isandlwhana (sp) then the Zulu's at the Drift. This is not to distract from the courage of all concerned. I do not see that Stanley Baker showed any bias towards anyone apart from over epmhasising the Welsh contribution. I also do not see this site as a forum for any political ranting from whatever side.<br/><br/> The movie was and is a masterpeice, yes there are errors, and continuity mistakes galore (see the bloke who Chard gets the rifle from as the Zulu's attack him) this does not spoil it in any way for me, brilliant acting, good direction and fantastic scenery all make an enjoyable and gripping film."

The film itself contains essentially a huge battle scene lasting for two days.  I found the bayonet charge led by Lieutenant Bromhead (Michael Caine) and Color Sergeant Bourne (Nigel Green) one of the best close combat scenes ever filmed.  Naturally the film score peaked during this charge.  To me, the most fascinating character to emerge during the fight was Color Sergeant Bourne.  He had some very memorable lines including, ""AAAAAllright, nobody told you to stop working!"" after the 24th Regiment troops had repulsed yet another Zulu rush and were exhausted, but needed to finish the final redoubt.

Badly outnumbered, the British troops are ably led by Stanley Baker (who also produced) and Michael Caine, in one of his first starring roles.  It is a matter of firepower against stabbing spears as the British, fighting in red coats for one of the final times, struggle to survive.<br/><br/>An interesting facet of this movie is the depiction of bravery and discipline on both sides.

"sirdar","Null","3","4","9 November 1998"," FUN BUT FLAWED
","Stanley Baker is supposed to have wanted to make this movie so badly that he used his own money for the production.This is not surprising since the the story of the defense of Rorke's Drift was a staple of British schoolboy lore (in pre-""Cool Brittania"" days) . The 1879 battle pitting some 100 or so soldiers of the South Wales Borderers against some 4,000 Zulu is the stuff of Victorian legend and resulted in the award of 11 Victoria Cross' to the defenders. Given these facts it's a wonder that Baker chose to distort the historical record to the extent he did. The film is a rousing good story and many of its major distractions, qua film, arise from the historical departures. The clearest example is the ridiculous inclusion of Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobson as the Rev. Otto Witt and his daughter. Neither of the persons were present at the battle and their portrayal in the film is a gross distraction fom the building tension of the approach of the Zulu impi. The characterization of Private Henry Hook as a malingerer and tippler goes beyond goes beyond historical license into the realm of slander. Hook was nothing like the film portrayal and was one of the heroes of the battle. The gratuitous inclusion of some trendy anti-war allusions by Surgeon Reynolds and by Bromhead and Charde only adds to the feeling that that historical record is being tortured. ""Zulu"" is a decent depiction of the battle proper but the cautious viewer should not be fooled into believing that this is good history."

","Going by the erudite historical nature of all the reviews of this justly famous film I hesitate to bring up the subject of my comment. I saw the film on its first release here in the UK in 1964. I was 14 at the time and I went with my parents and my siblings.<br/><br/>The two scenes which had the biggest impact on me were the final battle scene where the Zulus are shot down in droves as they try in one last desperate attempt to storm the fort. There is a final stunning slow pan across heaps of dead and dying Zulus - I remember being shocked as I have never seen such a graphic scene of the casualties of war before in any other movie. I well remember my sister sitting next to me in the cinema and gasping at it. The other scene - and the focus of this comment - is the mass wedding at the Zulu kraal at the beginning of the film with the missionary and his spinster daughter watching as guests of the chief. I am sorry to say that my tender age of 14 I found this scene hot! I think it was the combination of bare breasted black maidens and muscly warriors. And the fact that we see it reflected in the shocked eyes of the uptight Swedish girl. In a typical piece of double standards of the time bare breasts on black women were perfectly respectable to view by a family audience but white bare breasts-------- well that was a criminal matter!! Can you believe it?! But thats how things were back then in the early 60s. Anyway at the risk of being unPC did anybody else find this scene arousing.

"tieman64","Null","10","22","10 July 2010"," The Original Black Hawk Down
","Killing the ""savage"" in order to rescue him from his own savagery (and then playing the inconvenienced victim), is a tactic which ""great nations"" have exhibited throughout history. From India, to China, to Africa, to Germany, to Vietnam and now to Iraq, national victimhood has always provided the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation.<br/><br/>Observe the sob stories that followed 9/11 (and the subsequent roll out of enormous amounts of hardware), or the way the British Empire turned the Sepoy Rebellion and the Siege of Khartoum into extreme symbols of the White Man's Burden. Time and time again, the slaughter of thousands is rationalized as, not only an act of kindness, but a noble burden which Empires virtuously carry on their shoulders.<br/><br/>Think also Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"", in which a group of outnumbered Americans fend off a horde of Africans. The film is a mighty misrepresentation of what happened in Somalia, turning the white man, once again, into a noble everyman, violently betrayed by the very savages he pretends to civilise and defend.<br/><br/>In 1992, George Bush senior announced that America had come to do ""God's work"" in Somalia, a nation devastated by clan warfare and famine. Unfortunately, in Pentagon speak, ""God's Work"" means bombing nations to hell, the US government arming clan chiefs and warlords in a deliberate attempt to destabilise the region. The US has been doing this for a long time, backing the Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1978 and pitting him against the Ethiopians, all as a means of reclaiming the south east portion of Somalia and its vast reserves of natural gas. Between 1978 and 1988 the Americans lent (or caused the International Moneratary Fund to lend) around 3 billion dollars to Barre, most of which went to arms and led to untold amounts of bloodshed.<br/><br/>As is typical, when their puppet dictators get too powerful, the West then backs their dictator's enemies. Cue Washington's backing of the Ethiopians, coaxing them into taking Somalia from the very Somalians they once pitted against Ethiopia (the same scenario played out, as it has done in countless other countries, in Iraq, the US arming Hussein against Iran and then supporting Kuwait against Saddam before finally blitzing Saddam themselves). This little 2 year long war eventually failed, and the Ethiopians backed out. With no conflicts to justify their presence in the area, the US then seized upon the buzzwords ""Somalian pirates"" and ""war on terror"" as an excuse to beef up their military presence in the region.<br/><br/>Through these buzzwords, the US justified their support of yet more Somali warlords, pitting them against a group called the Islamic Courts Union, despite the fact that the ICU is not an Al-Qaeda affiliate or a terrorist organisation. In fact, the ICU was a relatively honest administration which not only brought a level of peace and stability to Somalia that hadn't been seen for nearly two decades, but was also succeeding in unifying the country and creating some semblance of nationhood.<br/><br/>But of course the US doesn't want this. 30 per cent of America's oil will come from Africa over the next ten years. It's therefore no surprise that the CIA engages in a covert war which recruits warlords (the very same warlords who pass oil laws in America's favour) and urges them to hunt and kidnap Islamic militants, secretly imprisoning them on offshore warships which illegally double as floating prisons.<br/><br/>At the same time, many European, US and Asian shipping firms signed dumping deals with Somalia's puppet leaders, allowing them to use the Somali coast as a cheap toxic dumping ground. This practise became widespread as the country descended into civil war, and still continues. This toxic waste has been responsible for all manners of deaths and illnesses, such that a formal complaint was sent to the United Nations. Of course the UN did nothing. In 2006 Somali fishermen then complained to the UN that armed foreign fishing fleets were using the breakdown of the state to plunder their fish stocks and intimidate fishermen. Despite repeated requests, the UN refused to act. Meanwhile the warships of global powers that patrol the strategically important Gulf of Aden did not sink or seize any vessels dumping toxic chemicals off the coast.<br/><br/>So angry Somalis, whose waters were being poisoned and whose livelihoods were threatened, took matters into their own hands. Fishermen began to arm themselves and attempted to act as unofficial coastguards, some of which became the ""Somali pirates"", the new terrorist bogeyman of the seas.<br/><br/>The origins of piracy in Somalia are therefore linked to the lack of a functioning central government and is considerably different to the media's portrayal. It is the pirates who are the victims of attacks on their territorial waters by corporate polluters and fleets.<br/><br/>What does this have to do with ""Zulu""? ""Black Hawk"" is simply the ""Zulu"" of our times, both films ignoring everything in favour for romantic battles in which outnumbered white men bravely gun down hordes of savage blacks. The Somalis in ""Black Hawk Down"" speak only to condemn themselves. They display no emotions other than greed and the lust for blood. Their appearances are accompanied by sinister Arab techno, while the US forces are trailed by violins, oboes and vocals inspired by Enya. The white troops display horrific wounds and clutch family photos while all around them, Somalis drop like flies, dispensable and unmourned. Put helicopters in ""Zulu"", and it's the same film. The white man's ""peacekeeping burdens"" updated for the digital age.<br/><br/>7/10 - In all these films (Zulu, Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers, Black Hawk Down etc), truth is revoked in favour for pride, heroism, courage and a glorification of warfare. They promote both a racist perspectives and a dangerous public tolerance for militarism. Note - Ridley Scott loves this film so much he used its Zulu war chant during the opening battle of ""Gladiator""."

The rest of the film is devoted to poorly executed battle scenes featuring fake combat and theatrical deaths. Although they outnumber the British 40 to one, the Zulu attack in small waves using spears and predictably get slaughtered by the gun-wielding British. Why would the Zulu utilize such an idiotic tactic after having demonstrated their military prowess in slaughtering 1200 British soldiers days before? Baker and Caine (in his film debut) are OK, but Hawkins chews the scenery as a preacher."
"Enchorde","7","5","9","5 December 2009"," Historical War Epic
","Recap: The grave and ominous news reach the small detachment at Rorke's Drift that the main column of the British army has been annihilated by a vastly greater but technically inferior Zulu army. Now they learn that a small contingent of the Zulu army is heading for the missionary and temporary hospital at Rorke's Drift. But there is only about a hundred British soldiers stationed at the missionary and they desperately prepare for the coming attack.<br/><br/>Comments: Something very much looking like a historical account of the events of the real battle, even if some things surely has been dramatized and changed. However, what is most remarkably notable, and gives it away as a historical dramatization, is it that there is no real bad guys. There is none among the British soldiers that fall out or has their own intention. Not even between the junior but evenly ranked commanding officers at the station, where the outsider Chard takes over because of only having a few months superiority (one of the things that has been changed, as the difference were much greater). And most remarkably, not even the Zulu are portrayed as evil, bloodthirsty or even ignorant. Instead they are depicted as brave, intelligent, well organized and above all noble foes.<br/><br/>Instead it is a epic movie of bravery and doing one's duty. Of standing one's ground against overwhelming odds. And it does it very well. It is rather long at slightly over two hours long, but there is never a problem of feeling that the time doesn't pass. What it doesn't have, and what it lacks compared to the really great movies, is the real conflict between two evenly matched enemies. Sometimes this feels like two teams meeting for a sporting event, a soccer game, despite people dying in droves. But there is no real intensity.<br/><br/>Fun to see Michael Caine in his first starring role, and I have to admit that it took a few scenes before I recognized him, but it is always good to see how the stars once started out. However, the character that did the greatest impression is Color-Sergeant Bourne. His calm and way to express himself elevated the movie (even if this was also not entirely historically correct).<br/><br/>7/10"
"Sheriff_Of_Nottingham","10","5","9","19 September 2009"," Thundering British Empire Epic
","In an age when many historical epics are riddled with political correctness or blame everything that went wrong in the world on western civilization themes, it is refreshing to check out films from an earlier period with a very different perspective. Zulu, starring Sir Michael Caine and Stanley Baker, released in 1964, before the rise of the counterculture and long before pc, gives us a window into a time of unity and confidence in the West. We journey back to Rhorkes Drift Southern Africa, in 1879, when the British Empire was at its height. <br/><br/>One of the more striking differences between this film and something like the 2003 version of the Four Feathers is its depiction of Britain's army. The British commanding officers were depicted as essentially honorable men who although brave soldiers saw the devastation of war as ""appauling"". As Stanley Baker's character stated he came to Africa ""to build a bridge."" (The building of infrastructure in developing lands is often ignored in more recent films.) And Common British soldiers such as Henry Hook defended their post with great courage against continuous ongoing assault. <br/><br/>Another aspect of Zulu that makes the film timeless is the manner in which the action unfolds. The tension gradually builds. In the beginning, the soldiers can heard the Zulu hoards approaching ""like a train in the distance."" Throughout the battle, there are many twists in the plot as the Queen's army matches its skill against the African warriors overwhelming numbers. Never a dull moment.<br/><br/>Overall, this a very good epic although probably not for the pc brigade. Strongly recommend for those who prefer a more fair and balanced view of history."

","This film is pretty much a very well executed battle scene. The film shows, in a rather ironic way, how the ""gallant"" British, the ones who ""gave civilization to the African barbarian tribes, in small numbers defended the honor of the civilized world against a massive African barbarian horde that seeks to destroy the British forces and hence the light brought by the British Empire into this forsaken land. But thanks to our gallant soldiers, who killed dozens of barbarians for every man lost, the victory was ours and, hence, it was a victory in the name of civilization and progress.""<br/><br/>Yes, it is a very propaganda like film and the fun one has when watching this film is how cartoonish the British soldiers and their African enemies look and act. With their heavy accent and their discipline and their ludicrous red uniforms that don't make any military sense at all, this film is one huge barrel of fun."

","Zulu could be held up as pure British propaganda or as a great recruitment film to show how invincible a well led (British) army can be.<br/><br/>It is also an example of great movie making, showing what happens when you get all the right ingredients - a thrilling story, breathtaking scenery, sensational music, great directing, and professional, well chosen character actors all together on one project.<br/><br/>Send most of them off to Africa, don't mention apartheid, round up some friendly Zulu dancers, build a fake village and mission, keep it pretty simple, then finish it off by having Richard Burton read the intro, and voilà, a stirring war movie that not only entertains, but also reinforces the supposed invincibility of the British empire.<br/><br/>Having played with toy soldiers in my younger days (and being British), watching Zulu, with the ranks of British soldiers in their red tunics fixing bayonets and repelling hordes of ""savages"" was a dream come true. <br/><br/>Being based on a true story only makes it better, although the movie doesn't show that the Zulus attacking Rorke's Drift were the remnants from one of the ""horns"" that had crossed the river, not the entire Zulu force. <br/><br/>It was also more one sided than shown, because the Zulus hadn't eaten for days, had run many miles to get to the Mission (after fighting at Isandlwana), and although some had guns, they weren't proficient in their use. <br/><br/>Hey, but let's not let the details get in the way of a good story :) <br/><br/>I've watched this film many times, and I can fully recommend buying the latest Bluray version which provides quite a few special features, including interviews by some of the minor characters, and the assistant director. I've had many different versions, and only the Bluray does justice to the scenery, colour and sound (no, it's not surround) - especially viewed on a projector - which is what this movie deserves. <br/><br/>If you would like further information on Rorke's Drift, I can highly recommend the book ""Washing of the Spears (The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation"" by Donald R Morris. (Once you've read this book, you will never have the same opinion of Shaka Zulu again....)"
"KnightsofNi11","8","3","5","12 September 2010"," It's all in the build up
","It's always interesting to watch a war film about a battle you don't see in excess, such as any battle in Vietnam or World War II. Zulu focuses on the battle of Isandlhwana, where 139 Welsh soldiers defended against a massive attack of 4000 Zulu soldiers. It doesn't have the most robust cast, yet I couldn't help but smile when I saw the words ""introducing Michael Caine"" in the opening credits. Caine seems to be given all the credit in this film when ironically he plays one of the smaller roles. Nevertheless, Caine and the rest of the cast and crew do a great job at making this an intense and exciting film.<br/><br/>This film's main strategy is employing build up to the greatest effect. It begins with the introduction of all the key characters and their relationships with one another. The setting and characters are established amidst the preparation for the defense against the massive Zulu army marching towards them. There is a pleasant little vignette of characters present, all playing different roles in this prologue to the actual battle, which consumes about the last hour and a half of the movie. Most (but not all) of the main characters are military men. Others include the lovable and somewhat naive cook, as well as a priest who only seeks to settle this land conflict through peaceful measures. But if that were the case, how could we include such a riveting battle? Like I said before, this film is all about the build-up to the battle, and the tension is greatest right before the first confrontation. The pacing is excellent, and it helps to build up the anticipation for the massive battle we all know is on its way. Then, much to my surprise, the first confrontation with the Zulu begins and they don't even fight back. It is revealed that they are just testing the strength and aim of the British soldiers. After this brief hail of gunfire, we see that it was only a clever tease at whats to come. Shortly after, the Zulu warriors return and the real battle begins. From here, the film is what could best be described only as a cavalcade of gunfire. The fighting lasts twelve hours, so there isn't much time to let up when it is condensed into an hour and a half. Yet amidst the glorious battle, the film finds room for the characters we met in the setup to grow and change, even in a nonstop battle setting like this.<br/><br/>And then we come to the end of this epic war film which I interpreted in two possible ways. What happens could either be interpreted as a statement on the honor and glory of battle, or possibly a statement on the sheer absurdity and insanity of war. It would be more fitting with the rest of the film to be interpreted as the former, due to the fact that this film almost seems to glorify war to some extent. It is a very epic scale movie that beams with sweeping grandeur in its direction and cinematography. To interpret it as the latter would almost be a contradiction to what I at least think this movie exemplified, which would be the honor, courage, and valor of doing battle. Either way the ending is unexpected and very interestingly done. I can't help but give kudos.<br/><br/>Zulu is a film that focuses on nationalist pride in fighting for your country, so I can, for the most part, forgive it for somewhat glorifying war, rather than condemning it. I also usually don't prefer this kind of epic scale movie, but there was definitely something about Zulu I really enjoyed. Perhaps it was its more controlled setting, or the fact that parts of it unfold in real time. Whatever it was, it made me fully enjoy this exciting film."
"Doylenf","8","3","5","13 August 2008"," Awesome tribute to human courage and sacrifice against great odds...
","ZULU is a masterpiece of its kind. It's a stirring tribute to the British army and how they held down the fort during a raid wherein the Zulus (outnumbering them in an army of 4,000 spear-carrying Zulu warriors) are defeated by a handful of British soldiers under the command of officers STANLEY BAKER (who, by the way, is a commanding figure throughout) and MICHAEL CAINE (in his first big screen role).<br/><br/>Both of these men, and JACK HAWKINS, stand out in a cast of incredibly fine performances. The sunlit photography is stunning to behold, especially if you view the film in its Widescreen format (as shown on TCM) and the fierce battle scenes are unforgettable and authentic.<br/><br/>One of the most chilling moments has Michael Caine saying, while viewing the vast horizon: ""It sounds like a train."" It's a train alright--a train of human feet approaching the fort but hiding behind foliage and getting ready to attack.<br/><br/>The final moments are beautifully handled--just when you think (as the British soldiers do) that it's all over.<br/><br/>Summing up: An amazing film, well staged and admirably performed by a huge cast of players."

Anyway, I stumbled across Zulu whilst I was there alone, and began watching it.<br/><br/>At first, I assumed that it would be an older, plot deprived, horribly acted movie. I suppose this is when I should go ahead and discuss the valuable, almost priceless artifact that this movie is.<br/><br/>In today's world, movies are only played by the most popular, and written by the one who dares to script sex within the lines.

It is truly a classic and strong contender for best British film of all time.<br/><br/>It's difficult to find a fault. Superb cinematography, strong direction, uniformly good performances with some real standouts (the aforementioned Green), and perhaps most importantly equally respectful to both the British and the Zulus, it's influence can be seen in films from that day to this, from Gladiator to The Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>And a Richard Burton narration too.

","This without a doubt is one of the finest historical combat films ever made by the film industries of the world. It's attention to detail is better than most, and just enough legend is put in to round out the story and not take it over. <br/><br/>I unfortunately never had the opportunity to see it first run on the big screen, only TV, first as black and white and then in color, but those images of outnumbered men in battle have stuck with me for the last 35 years. <br/><br/>In reading more about the actual battle over the years, I have always likened it to Custer's Last Stand, it's roughly the same time in history, except that it's set in Africa and the story turns out a bit different, and the reason it does is solely on the shoulder's of Lt. John Chard who lets the hordes come to him on his terms, rather than riding hell bent for leather into annihilation. There isn't a bad performance in this movie, not one poorly delivered line, though Jack Hawkins' drunk preacher gets on your nerves after a while, and all the good stuff associated with this film is there thanks to it's star and producer, Stanley Baker. <br/><br/>Though the violence doesn't seem as real as it did so long ago, and a little legend gets in the way of the truth, nowadays I watch this movie to see how very different ordinary men can join together under extreme pressure, rely upon each other, and accomplish seemingly impossible things. It's great history and a great movie! <br/><br/>Also, at my age, I have some regrets for roads not taken, things not done. One of the biggest regrets I have came from something that happened in the mid '70s. A shipment of almost 100 year old Martini Henry rifles came to the U.S., all were rifles the British government claimed were used specifically at Roark's Drift. $125 for each one. That was 30 years ago. I had gotten married the year before, and that seemed like an awful lot of money back then. It was the British equivalent of a Springfield or Sharps used at the Little Big Horn and would have made a wonderful wall hanger worth many times more today. Married, I couldn't come up with the money. Never got my Roark's Drift rifle or old Thunderbird convertible, and I never regretted divorcing her later! <br/><br/>Simply said, Stanley Baker's Zulu is probably the best thing he ever did, and it's been one of my personal favorites for the last 35 years."

","A truly great film! The heroism on both sides is heightened by the stirring music and the singing of both armies; the specially written ""Men Of Harlech"" and the Zulu chants make the hair on the back of your neck stand at both the awesome courage and tragic waste of life given in attack and defence!<br/><br/>The cinematography goes a long way to portray the defending garrison as an inconsequentially small blip on a massive landscape; a pathetically small band of men in the wrong place at the wrong time, being set upon by a well-organised, determined and gallant foe, who out-numbered them hundreds to one!<br/><br/>As said, the film does take some license. Although it contained a high proportion of Welsh soldiers the battalion was actually English but subsequently became Welsh after the war! As to singing any version of ""Men Of Harlech"", well there is no historical evidence of this. Like me you can see Hook's VC at the South Wales Borderers Museum at Brecon. Incidentally he was a long serving soldier!<br/><br/>On the other side, the Zulu kings' descendant plays the part of the Zulu King! You can't get much more authentic than that!<br/><br/>If the rifles had worked (where have we heard that before?) or there had not been a huge tactical mistake, the action at Rorke's Drift would never have taken place! But then we would never have had this spectacular film and Rorke's Drift would never have entered the consciousness synonymous with bravery beyond the call of duty!<br/><br/>Ignore the license and the gaudy strap lines, this is a film that you can sit back and watch over and over again and it never looses the impact of its first viewing!"

In one of the battle scenes, one of the charges of the Zulu Warriors has them running in a field towards the compound of the English Garrison. When running, the warriors pass by a stone obelisk, which is a memorial to the Zulu Warriors that was put in place many years later to honor their fallen.

","*Might be a few spoilers.* According to most military history websites, the real-life British garrison had plenty of time to safely evacuate Rorke's Drift, before those two-to-three thousand Zulus reached the ex-mission. Why didn't they? Most likely the real-life Chard and Bromhead's ""bloody egos"" (as Heindorf the Afrikaaner refers to them). Stanley Baker--as producer--was probably well aware of this. And, so, this movie is an ageless classic in the sense that its anti-war message will never grow old. At least, not from the p.o.v. of anyone in their right mind! Don't get me wrong. The action scenes never fail to provide me a great adrenaline rush, every time I watch them! But, then follows the come-down. And, if vicarious viewers, like me, feel a slight sense of shame, at viewing all those who didn't survive the battle, imagine how a real-life soldier must feel! What Stanley Baker--in the role of Lt. Chard--calls a ""butcher's yard."" In short, this movie is both exciting and thought-provoking. Definitely ten stars!"

Second, it is beautifully shot, directed, acted and edited.  Third, it is unashamed of its bias towards courage and heroism, especially refreshing in our current age of cynicism and complacency.  Within the context of its historical setting, ZULU presents a small regiment of British soldiers (mostly Welsh) who, following a disastrous defeat of their main body of men the day before, withstand an horrific onslaught from 4,000 equally brave Zulu warriors for a day and a half.  As testimony to the Brits courage, eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to survivors of this famous battle at Rorke's Drift.<br/><br/>The film also features the starring debut of Michael Caine, here sporting a posh upper-class accent.

"Geofbob","Null","3","5","26 December 2001"," Action-packed but one-sided
","Despite fine performances, exciting action and authentic setting, I feel this is an over-rated movie, and it makes somewhat embarrassing viewing these days. The true story of how 100 British - mostly Welsh - troops resisted 4000 Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift in Natal in 1879 deserved a better screenplay than this gungho, Western-style one-dimensional treatment. There is little character development - indeed, less than in most Hollywood Westerns - and what development there is often makes little sense. In particular, Michael Caine's Lieut Gonville Bromhead is depicted as a cool, professional officer one minute, and a rather helpless incompetent booby the next. We learn nothing about the background of Lieut John Chard (Stanley Baker) and are left baffled as to why an engineer, there to build a bridge, should prove to be such an effective commander in his first engagement. Though early on it looks as though some love-interest might be provided by Ulla Jacobsson as the daughter of the local missionary (Jack Hawkins), she and her father soon fade from the scene. <br/><br/>But the main fault is that there is simply no explanation of how and why this stand against overwhelming odds was accomplished. We just see wave after wave of Zulus killing or wounding only a few defenders, while their own dead pile up. I suspect that, despite the Zulus being shown with rifles in one scene, the answer is simply that spears could not prevail against guns. It is true that the Zulus are portrayed as powerful and courageous; but as with the Native Americans in Westerns, this is less to increase our respect for the natives themselves, as for the white men withstanding their onslaught. There is certainly no real attempt to provide the Zulu point of view of the episode; and only the most oblique references to the historical context. <br/><br/>On the positive side, almost all the performances are convincing - especially, in addition to the principals, those of Nigel Greene as an imperious Colour Sergeant, James Booth as a malingering Private turned hero, and Patrick Magee as a blood-covered Surgeon; there are some great shots of the warriors drawn up on the brow of the hill; and the train-like sound they make with their spears against their shields, and their chanting, are unforgettable."

My favorite is when Lt. Chard asks Owen what he thinks of the chanting Zulus, about to charge. Owen replies: ""They've got a good bass section, mind, but they don't have a top tenor!"" Owen then leads the South Wales Borderers into the famous scene where they sing ""Men of Harlech"" as the Zulus charge.<br/><br/>Also, particularly stirring, is the final scenes when Richard Burton narrates. He lists the men who won the Victoria Cross. There is a wonderful pregnant pause, the music swells, and he names the final recipient, the hero of Rorke's Drift, John Ross Michael Chard.

",".. which, nominally, they were. At least, they wore red coats and could quote the psalms. There were about 100 of them, plus a contingent of sick and lame in the infirmary at the supply camp at Rourke's Drift, Natal, South Africa, in 1879 when the Zulus rose, 4,000 strong, to wipe out the real army of 1,000 that protected them. They themselves were, on paper, anything but warriors. Cooks, supply masters, singers in the choir, malingerers, only a few of them stiff-upper-lipped soldiers, they were a ragtag bunch. Their foppish, racist commander, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, making his first screen appearance) is there only because he's the son of an officer who was the son of an one who died at Waterloo. Another officer just happens to be on the scene, Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker), but he's an engineer sent to extend the fruits of Her Majesty's largesse by building a bridge. When the whole Zulu nation converges on their skimpy redoubt, can these mostly green noncombatants hope to survive?<br/><br/>By the time of the first Zulu onslaught, the patrician Bromhead has shown just enough intelligence to let the smarter Chard deploy the troops and organize the resistance. Meanwhile, the plebeian Chard has had to dig deep within himself to summon courage to match the cool Bromhead's native fortitude. Strange bedfellows, they make a good team. The men respond to them. But, despite their successfully repulsing the Zulus in early stages of the battle, how can they ever last, given their enemy's overwhelming numbers?<br/><br/>Their cause is not bolstered by the presence of the Swedish missionary, Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins), and his prim daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson). Neither see war as consistent with God's will. He, positively unnerved by it, takes to the bottle when he isn't exhorting soldiers to lay down their arms. Chard eventually has to expel them from the camp. The Zulus display their own nobility when they decline to massacre them.<br/><br/>The battle at Rourke's Drift rages on. Whatever the outcome, it is clear from the start that this taut, exciting, well-made movie from 1964 celebrates honor, bravery, and male brotherhood above all else ... including God."

I am no film freak and I only joined to vote but in my opinion Zulu is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>It represents the British film industry in one of its best films.Zulu is both historically accurate and entertaining (watching hordes of Zulus been shot to pieces by 100 British Soldiers has to be entertaining!)The film quality is excellent along with some lines. Finally its battle scenes are some of the best that I have ever seen."
"marko","10","3","5","2 June 2000"," A wonderful film!
","Despite the historical inaccuracies chronicled elsewhere on this page, this film is a near-complete success by the most important yardstick--it has been on many people's ""favorite film"" list for almost 40 years.<br/><br/>Stanley Baker obsession with making this film pays off in a dramatic account of a truly dramatic historical event.  Like ""Full Metal Jacket"", which is based on Michael Herr's accounts of real events;  like ""The Longest Day"" and ""A Bridge Too Far, which are based on Cornelius Ryan's accounts of actual campaigns during World War II;  and like ""Gettysburg"" which is based on Michael Shaara's account of the Civil War battle, one can overlook the liberties John Prebble takes with the historical record if one focuses on this movies virtues.<br/><br/>The film is full of fine performances by a cast which was virtually unknown to American audiences of 1964.  Baker and Michael Caine are letter-perfect as an irascible engineer and a pompous young lieutenant forced to cooperate against overwhelming odds.  James Booth gives a fine, if historically inaccurate, performance as the scoundrel Private Henry Hook.  Patrick Magee is properly outraged as Surgeon Reynolds, whose job it is to patch up the men whose bodies are ravaged by the battle.  And as is pointed out in several other reviews, the best performance of the film is by Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Bourne.  If Green wasn't a noncommissioned officer in another life, his portrayal is even better than it seems.  From his erect carriage to his stern-but-sympathetic demeanor, to his flawless action sequences with a bayonet, Green IS the archetypal Sergeant Major.<br/><br/>Although the Zulu characters have virtually no dialogue, Baker somehow manages to invest them with tremendous dignity, courage, and dedication. The Zulus were, in fact, the finest infantry on the continent of Africa during their heyday.  Although the film can be criticized for some flaws, it cannot be faulted for its portrayal of this terrific warrior tribe.<br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderful;  the stirring music will stay with you long after the film is over;  the battle sequences themselves (especially the film's final 15 minutes) may be the finest ever committed to film.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films EVERYONE should see once.  Most of us will enjoy watching it again and again."

"rooprect","7","5","11","20 February 2010"," Almost a masterpiece
","""Introducing Michael Caine"" alone is worth the price of admission. The stunning landscape and cinematography is worth another ticket. The powerful musical score is your 3rd ticket. Suspense+tension+drama... oh yeah you'll get your money's worth.<br/><br/>In short, this is a powerful film that will entertain, excite and affect you. But it stops just shy of being an artistic masterpiece for one reason. Although it flirts with some deep philosophies, I didn't get the feeling that it wanted to go in that direction. So despite the stage being set for a profound epic like ""Aguirre the Wrath of God"", this film may leave your soul unfulfilled.<br/><br/>In particular, there were some intriguing themes introduced right at the beginning but not explored fully. Unlike the cartoonish cowboy & Indian films that Hollywood was cranking out in the 60s where whiteman=good & natives=evil, this film begins with a more objective angle showing the Zulu tribe to be human, intelligent, admirable and more honourable than any other warrior race while the British are (at first) shown to be arrogant, disrespectful and parasitic. The film lingers on this paradigm, but perhaps it would have been too progressive in 1964 to openly suggest that the native people deserved the land more (just as with cowboys & indians), so we never get fulfillment of this thought.<br/><br/>A second interesting theme is that war is glorified butchery and nothing good comes of it. Again, this film flirts with that progressive message; however by midway, the principal character who advocates that stance is reduced to insane, irritating rants. So again, a powerful philosophy is buried. We do return to it later, but it is somewhat watered down.<br/><br/>Instead of philosophy, we get some very suspenseful battle scenes, first class acting, and great cinematography showing a gorgeous landscape (with a magnificent soundtrack to go with it). So even though I'm a bit disappointed that the film dropped the ball on philosophy, I'm very impressed with the rest of the package.<br/><br/>Michael Caine is riveting in a role unlike any other I've seen. His character is cold, cocky, pretentious & a real arse. But dang it, you end up loving him by the end of the film.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that anyone would ever regret watching ""Zulu"", so if you have a chance to see it (or buy it used at Blockbuster for $4 like I did), go for it."

","It's 1879. A column of troops consisting of 1800 British and 400 natives are wiped out by the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana. Swedish missionaries Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta are sitting with Zulu King Cetewayo when he's informed of the victory. They set off to the mission station at Rorke's Drift to warn them and take away the wounded from the hospital. Lieutenants Chard (Stanley Baker) and Bromhead (Michael Caine) don't agree on much. Engineer Chard assumes the command based on a few extra months of enlistment. Soon they have to face an overwhelming Zulu force.<br/><br/>This is a rip-roaring old fashion war movie notable for Michael Caine before his international fame. People die slowly in overly-dramatic ways. The British overcome waves of Zulu attacks. Surprisingly, it's not one-sided and plenty of British get killed. There are lots of action. For me, the main problem is the character Otto Witt. The movie makes him to be a drunken pacifist. I get that they want to build drama with the wounded. They don't need to make him a drunkard so as to demean his position. It's a last hooray for the empire but it's got a few false moments."

The filming is spectacular in its location and precise in its details. Even after watching it probably twenty times, I have never found either discrepancies of continuity, which I find particularly annoying, or any other weaknesses. Whether one is sympathetic to the British empire-building ethic, or deplores the carnage which they considered to be a necessary part of the process, one is left admiring the determination of this small band of men and the bravery of the Zulu warriors defending their land.

They have a web site, and maybe you can order some of the shirts form them! http://nt.citysearch.com.au/E/V/NORTH/0056/70/64/1.html I have also noticed that on the most recent showing of Zulu on TBS or some other such cable network, for the first time, they have started censoring out the Zulu women's breasts. They zoomed in on Dancing feet during the line dance shots. I guess it was only a matter of time before the National Geographic exception to above the waist nudity was rejected. Is this something we can blame on Janet Jackson? My brother was a lifelong Zulu fan and when he died of MS, we included the singing of ""Men of Harlech"" at his funeral. Very moving and a great tribute.<br/><br/>Hope these personal touches have been useful."

A great film. Good story well told, you get to know the men, and feel for them. Great tension and build up."
"DRIAINCLARK","Null","2","3","16 April 2002"," A portrayal of bravery. Almost an historic document
","The opening village scene set in the Zulu capital engages one immediately, and Zulu is one of the first major commercial films to portray an African tribe as a magnificent and powerful society in its own right. As a portrayal of a sophisticated disciplined and warlike nation, it sets the scene for the very rapid build up of tension at Rorke's Drift; the Zulus had wiped out a huge British contingent at Islandwala, and were heading for the small outpost where the unsuspecting company of Welsh engineers and hospital in-mates are later to defend themselves against what appear to be overwhelming odds as 3000 Zulus attack them. The subsequent battle is now a set piece study of defensive strategy in many a military academy.<br/><br/>The swift crescendo of tension and fear anticipates the fast moving action films of later years, but one of the films virtues is that it was well advised. It was made when many people who had lived at the height of the British Empire were still alive, and so the portrayal of the army and its officers is free of our modern prejudice and bias; the officers in charge at Rorke's drift were probably even more unready for such a battle than those portrayed by  Stanley Baker and Michael Caine, but the British Empire could never have been built and run by a bunch of pratts, and the current fashion for portraying the  Victorian upper class as a set of wets and fops is very wide of the mark. My only slight criticism of the film is the casting of Michael Caine as one of these officers. Michael Caine is an outstanding actor, but can never quite conceal his Cockney roots, and just misses the arrogant and disdainful self confidence of the aristocratic officer class of the time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a real contribution to this film. The score contributes to the tension; the wonderful tribal  music and dance would have been some of the first to be heard in the Western world, and the defenders of Rorke's Drift being Welsh, there are restrained hints of their vocal skills throughout the film until they are released in the full rendition of 'Men of Harlech' before the final assault, singing it to raise their spirits against the increasingly bellicose war song of the Zulus; it is one of Cinema's most memorable moments.<br/><br/>Such was the slaughter in the battle that one is reminded of  Sellar and Yateman's comments under 'Attempts to amuse Queen Victoria' in their history spoof ""1066 And All That"" which reads:  'The Zulu War. Cause: The Zulus. The Zulus exterminated. Peace with the Zulus"" But while the British won this battle and the war, the film is a testament to the discipline and fearlessness of the Zulus as well as the Welsh engineers, and as the Zulus retreat in the evening sun, one is left with a real admiration for the bravery and courage shown by both sides. And it does give a strong flavour of the Empire over which the sun never set. This is a timeless film and rewards repeated viewing."

The script  very carefully avoids any racist cliché. Of course, the battle scenes are all in the favour of the British, and they are truly spectacular.

","Zulu is one of those films that sound great on paper, a small troop of British regulars trapped in a land they should never have been in facing unsurmountable odds of 4000 to 100. I was able to see a new Blu-ray transfer of this good looking film and the color and costumes are wonderful, it seems like it was shot yesterday. Other then that it is over two hours of a lot of talking about how it is to be bored in the army, more talking about how they are going to stand up to 4000 Zulu warriors and some annoying talk from a minister trying to stop them. When the battle finally comes it seems like it should have been over in 5 minutes if the Zulu had just attacked with a thousand men but for some reason they send small groups into direct fire even though they killed 1200 British just the same day but now can't seem to be able to kill 100. The British side seems to keep getting more men somewhere even though you can count many dead. The blood has to be the reddest in movie history and resembles pizza sauce. We must see at least 50 guys get killed by invisible wounds, gunshots with no damage and rubber bayonets that don't even touch the enemy and a lot of bad dying acting from the Zulu extras.<br/><br/>A dull dated film sadly."
"BA_Harrison","8","1","1","9 March 2020"," Rorke's Drift... now I know.
","I was brought up in an English village that borders army land and is home to army barracks; one of the roads in the village is named Rorkes Drift, which I knew had a connection with the armed forces, but I was never sure quite what that was (military history is not my forte). Zulu, a tale of heroism and bravery in the face of great adversity, has cleared up the matter for me - it was named after the mission station defended by 150 or so British soldiers when several thousand Zulu warriors launched a series of attacks.<br/><br/>As directed by Cy Endfield, working from a screenplay by John Prebble, this is a fairly faithful and hugely entertaining recreation of the events that unfolded in 1879, when Lt. John Chard R. E. (Stanley Baker) successfully commanded his brave men against seemingly insurmountable odds. Endfield expertly builds the tension, as the men of Welsh 24th Regiment of Foot wait for the enemy to attack; the sound of 4000 Zulus marching, singing and bashing their shields in unison is truly frightening, and would have had me heading over the hills as quick as my legs could carry me, but these men hold fast, even though they are vastly outnumbered.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that so few men could repel such relentless savage assaults, but history tells us otherwise, making this film a powerful piece of cinema that illustrates the indomitable spirit of man. When the chips are down, the British rise to the occasion with a rousing rendition of Men of Harlech that more than equals the Zulus chanting, before picking up their rifles for yet more bloody action. By the time that the remaining Zulu warriors gather on the hill crest to honour the bravery of the opposition, you'll feel emotionally drained yet ebullient, astounded by the courage and tenacity that you have witnessed.<br/><br/>The battles are spectacular and violent, Endfield making great use of his widescreen format and massive cast of extras; the bodies literally pile up as the Zulus swarm over the barricades to be met with a hail of bullets and the pointy bit on the end of the gun (one of my favourite directors, Paul Verhoeven would draw inspiration from this film's onslaught for the Klandathu bug attacks in Starship Troopers). Baker puts in a suitably strong performance as Chard, but it is Michael Caine, in one of his earliest big screen roles as plummy Lt. Gonville Bromhead, who steals the show, becoming an A-list star in the process. Also impressing are James Booth as unlikely hero Pvt. Henry Hook, Nigel Green as Colour-Sergeant Bourne, and Patrick Magee as Surgeon Reynolds, who patches up the men as the fighting rages outside.<br/><br/>I admit that I've never been a massive fan of the war genre, but there are certain movies that demand one's attention; Zulu is definitely one such film. 8/10."

The chants or singing of the zulus, the courage of both sides, the incredible scenery and, as for many, the wonderful scene of the competing voices, Men of Harlech vs the Zulus chanting, is the standout for me. So many reviews have already highlighted what is good about this film so I can only add my encouragement to see it, if possible on a large movie theatre screen. My one gripe is the anti-Christian and highly inaccurate portrayal of the Witts, a shame the directors used this method to contrast the bravery of the soldiers and Zulus. Otherwise I'd give this a resounding 10."

","Many find it incongruous that Bromhead, an infantry officer in charge of a company of trained infantrymen, should hand over command of the position to Chard, an engineer.<br/><br/>The reason for this was simple: Officer training at the time meant that engineer officers were given more extensive training in infantry tactics than were the well-healed sons who bought their commissions in the infantry. While the former spent much of their officer training honing their skills at infantry tactics (essential for one who would be required to build defences, roads, breastworks etc.), officers like Bromhead were sitting around their club, out hunting, or riding at the head of a parade or display on Hyde Park. <br/><br/>Aside from being severely deaf and likely to be more of a danger to his own troops than to the enemy, Bromhead wisely sought and took the counsel of the more experienced (Chard was a veteran of several conflicts) and competent colleague. The absolutely correct decision in retrospect."
"HotToastyRag","4","3","6","23 November 2017"," Michael Caine looks very dreamy
","While Zulu is one of the most famous war movies to come out of the 1960s, and there are many reasons to watch it, if you don't usually like that genre, you probably won't like it. Similar to the plot of 55 Days at Peking, one of my all-time favorite war films, this movie follows a small group of British soldiers, grossly outnumbered by the enemy, who try to hold out as long as possible.<br/><br/>Among the soldiers are Lieutenants Stanley Baker and Michael Caine, as well as Nigel Green, James Booth, Neil McCarthy, Ivor Emmanuel, Paul Daneman, and Glynn Edwards. While sometimes Stanley and Michael differ in their views of how to command the troops, Jack Hawkins rants and raves of the virtues of peace because he's a missionary. Jack's daughter Ulla Jacobsson tries to help among the wounded men, but since she's the only woman in the movie, sometimes she doesn't get treated very fairly.<br/><br/>It wasn't Michael Caine's first movie—I saw him in a movie from 1957—it was his first major role, so the studio gave him a large ""introducing"" credit. If you're a Michael Caine fan, and you can tolerate a long, tedious war film, you might want to see him two years before his overnight stardom from Alfie. Even if you're not particularly a fan, but you want to see him in an extremely handsome role, he looks particularly dreamy in Zulu.<br/><br/>All in all, I was pretty bored—when I wasn't drooling over Michael Caine, that is. The film wasn't nearly as interesting as other war flicks I've seen, and even Richard Burton's official sounding narration wasn't able to save it."

On the one hand, you want to root for the underdog, right? A couple hundred soldiers against thousands... you want to see them win. But this is now 1964 (or 2017 if you're me) and we have different ideas about colonialism. This land belongs to the locals -- why should we encourage the British?

","Not a good film, especially if you're a military strategy buff. The board seems to be populated by nationalists, militarists and neo-colonialists. The slow pacing, minimal character development, and the fact that I was rooting for the Zulus the whole time, proved to me that this film doesn't hold up. At least not compared to such similar epics that advance the ""British cause"" like Lawrence of Arabia. And despite the fact that it was made 2 years after the release of Bonnie and Clyde, the first film to show violence in a realistic manner, everyone who dies in Zulu dies the old fashioned way... A hand grasps at a bloodless wound, and the face turns with a crinkled expression of pain as the body collapses into a peaceful slumber (aka the big sleep.) A dumb movie for it's time, it doesn't even hold much impact today unless you have a pea brain.<br/><br/>This is not a good one at all. First of all, although supposedly based on a real battle, it was completely stupid. A couple hundred men waiting to be slaughtered by 4000 Zulu's who they know had already wiped out 1000 of their fellow countrymen just the day before. The whole thing was so incredibly stupid! If they had a lick of sense, they'd have run out of there ASAP! The problem was this had no STORY. ALL it was, was a bunch of soldiers waiting to fight an un-winnable battle, then getting mowed down. So then you just sit through, watching people spear and shoot each other for an hour and a half, with short breaks in between while the Zulus re-group. And the battles are not even exciting, they're just boring, people sticking each other with spears and shooting, one after another.... After 30 min. I started watching the clock. After an hour I felt like I should take it out and put in another movie. After an hour and 20 min., I was wondering if this would EVER end... Then I began to feel mad at myself for getting sucked into watching the whole thing, when I knew it was going to suck after 30 minutes. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Director Endfield's efforts to juxtapose the nobility of only the British are derailed by the unnecessary presence  and uncharacteristically poor performance  of many of the British actors. The battle scenes also leave something to be desired  some sequences are done on average and others are simply laughable. Sadly, Zulu fails to live up to its historical source material and only amounts to an overacted letdown. Michael Caine made his screen debut in ""Zulu"" as an effete lieutenant who cedes command of his troops to a slightly senior officer.<br/><br/>I can understand why this historic event involving less than 100 British soldiers holding off over 4,000 Zulu warriors is beloved by some, especially tea loving Brits who don't like the fact that a bunch of spear throwers knocked off their pompously inept army. Who doesn't like routing for the underdog and coming out on top? Die hard colonialists, is who this tripe is made for. However, this film does less for this 'epic episode' in its two hours than the shining reviews found here. The opening scene is by far the most interesting as the Zulus prepare for a mass wedding. Dancing and singing is the only thing of interest. From there the story unwinds painfully slow as the Red Coats demonstrate their pomp and lack of sincerity. The stilted dialogue and lousy fight scenes (when the Zulu's finally arrive) do prove entertaining, for a 12 year old retard that is, but not how they were intended to, I'm sure. I can appreciate what movies in the 1960's were trying to do with such moments in history (make white people cry about losing oversea empires) but this film was a big disappointment for diserning intelligent viewers.<br/><br/>If anything, the scenes point out the failure of the Zulu commander who sends in waves of 50 guys who just get mowed down by the British defenders. Attacking Zulus getting slaughtered in wave after wave, with no discernible purpose. Not such a great combat method when your total force outnumbers the enemy 40:1 and they have rifles but the script was written as pro-British. Whomever is comparing this movie to gold needs to have their head examined. Can't believe this was based on an actual event in history. The Zulus looked like a bunch of wimps, thanks to the pro-British bias. Did they not learn how to THROW a spear! There looked to be almost as many British soldiers at the end of the movie as when it started. And Michael Caine became a star based on this mess? Reminds me of dumb John Wayne westerns.<br/><br/>This film is naive, idiotic and moralistic in its characterization of the ""brave"" English colonizers protecting their fort from the ""savages"". The characterizations of the British range from stupid to boorish, which is quite truthful in reality. The cinematography, however, is decent. Recommended only if your idea of a good time includes watching ""The Birth of a Nation"" or NASCAR or waxing up your rifle collection."

","*Spoiler/plot- ZULU, 1964, A small British unit is trapped in a small farmhouse when war breaks out between the Zulu nation and the British forces in Southeastern Africa. The Zulu army is sent to wipe out the unit, but British courage, training and leadership saves it from another Zulu massacre/victory.<br/><br/>*Special Stars- Michael Caine, Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, James Booth <br/><br/>*Theme- Military unit teamwork and training will defeat overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>*Trivia/location/goofs- Several obvious camera shadows, microphone boom in frame, and continuity errors in the action and battle sequences. Historical errors dealing with the farm house British unit and the real lives of the Victorian Cross (gallant valor) winners are differing from what was presented, but those matters are trivial to the screen action and dramatic story. Richard Burton (Welshman) was the narrator in this film about a Welsh regiment. This was Michael Caine's first film appearance. Micheal Caine wanted to play the Cockney character, 'Private Hook' in this film but an actor Cockney friend, James Booth, got the role. Stanley Baker saw that Mr. Caine's casting was more upper-class, so Mr.Baker(producer/star) and Cyd Enfield had Mr. Caine change his dialect and play the 'Bromhead' officer role. Jack Hawkins was fighting off oncoming throat cancer (from cigarette smoking) and so his dialog were later re dubbed. Real present day Zulus were used in this film and were paid with wristwatches for their work. Some wristwatches are seen on camera in battle and dance scenes. A film sequel(Zulu Dawn) was made many years later, while more historically accurate starring Burt Lancaster; it flopped.<br/><br/>*Emotion- One of the last great 60's 'Sagas' on film. This film's iconic scenes and action have never been duplicated successfully and with such heroic fervor. This story was magnificently shown on film and this film has become a 'place-holder' in the minds of it's viewers. Other Victorian British army subject matter films like Four Feathers, Khartoum, and 55 Days in Peking are good but only shadowy knock-offs of the iconic work in the original, ZULU."

","Perhaps the definitive ""front rank - FIRE - second rank - FIRE"" film from the age of high empire. The film does not go much into the background to the battle, i.e. why were the soldiers in Zululand anyway, but manages to be both dramatic and reasonably true to life without being either apologist for imperial sins or exalting the good old days of the empire. Which is more than can be said for the various versions of ""The four feathers"", for example.<br/><br/>The film does make the two officers more dramatic and imposing than they actually were. One of them was a Royal Engineer, not regarded as highly as a combat officer, and both of them were on the slow track for promotion until this battle.<br/><br/>Good acting, superb battle scenes, not too many goofs.

","It seems incredible that one hundred or so British soldiers could hold off a Zulu army of about 4,000 in Natal in 1878, yet it apparently happened. The story fits comfortably in the template established during the American colonial wars against the Indians. ""Our side"" is better armed and more disciplined and one of our boys can tackle ten of theirs.<br/><br/>Yet, it's more than just another Western set in Africa, with soldiers in red tunics instead of blue. The Zulu warriors, though faceless, are given their due as human beings. When a soldier with a bayonet faces off against a Zulu with an lklwa, a short stabbing spear, both are seen as clearly scared.<br/><br/>And the Zulus in this movie are really scary too. They don't ride around the circled wagons waiting to be picked off one by one. They attack in droves. And the sounds they make, the long low moans, the awesome thumps of a thousand spears against a thousand shields, is enough to turn your hair gray. At the end of the battle, the ground in and around the mission post at Roarke's Drift is littered with hundreds of African dead and wounded. One of the officers, Michael Caine, asks himself how he feels and his answer is ""ashamed."" The film explores the differences in attitude between and within social classes. The enlisted men are a rough lot, given to tearing at the bodices of young missionary women. Some are inveterate goof offs who malinger and hide in the hospital to avoid work. There are class differences between the officers as well. Stanley Baker is an engineer who gets his hands dirty. Michael Caine is from a military family and plays his character as an effete snob. When he runs, he holds his hands still at his sides so he seems to be mincing in double time. He must have had fun turning this aristocrat into a fastidious androgyne with a high voice, because Caine himself was a Cockney with a Gypsy background.<br/><br/>The movie has another feature that's a little unusual in these kinds of action tales. It gives us a genuine sense of the fatigue the men felt. The battle itself didn't last all that long -- a day and a night -- but the men were worked half to death building the defenses and manning them during the fight. Even the color sergeant, the stereotypical savvy and rough can-do enlisted leader, falls asleep at his post. Mostly, physical exhaustion isn't dealt with in war movies because, I suppose, it's not nearly as dramatic to see men slogging along with their faces drooping as it is to see them singing and firing rifles. I should mention the score. Evoking the Zulu threat, it sounds like a huge locomotive picking up speed while still in low gear -- and absolutely unstoppable.<br/><br/>For some reason I remember distinctly seeing this in a theater in Butte, Montana, during its release. The only other theater in town was showing ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown."" I'm thinking of leaving my long-term memory to the Smithsonian Institute.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is colorful and exciting, and reasonably fair to both sides, given that it represents a more or less common incident in colonial wars that pitted white soldiers against people with darker skin."

","This movie is ridiculous. They tell us that it is made after real events, but it contains not much reality except the really nice cinematography. For Example the Mass Wedding Scene at the beginning, there are no children, no old people either. There is no explanation why at the same day 1200 British soldiers could have been overrun by an Army of Zulu Warriors and later a group of 100 Riflemen could defend against 4000 Zulus. My explanation: it did not happen as it was shown in the movie. The 1200 where overrun, because they where moving by foot in the plain. The 100 Riflemen could defend because the where also in a plain, but inside a fort. They could shoot down the Zulus just like an animal herd. But that is not heroic. There is a simple political reason why the soldiers were given 11 Victoria crosses : for the press, to make forget the disaster that happened on the same day. That is why the acting in the movie is so ridiculous, the Zulus break into the first barrier then withdraw only to get shot down in the next attack. The Zulu commander is making insane and absurd decisions only to make them look strange. He is sending his first wave of warriors to stand up in front of the British riflemen only to get shot down and ""test their firepower"". The unheroic advance of firepower on the British side transmutes here into mysterious Strategies on the Zulu side. In Fact, the Zulus had a Kingdom for at least 100 Years. You cannot rule and conquer a Kingdom by ridiculous Strategies. But you can destroy it by far advanced firepower. As one of the Commanders says in the End: ""I feel ashamed"". Propaganda should always be a reason for shame."

"nelliebell-1","7","2","6","6 February 2006"," Above and Beyond the Call of Duty
","A motion picture is indeed a very strange phenomena,with more tricks and slights of every sort that it is unworthy as a character witness.The difficulty with this particular motion picture is that it provides for the appearance of the Zulu tribe in its natural ability allowing a western culture to learn how this horde of warriors once annihilated a British column of some 1200 plus British soldiers.In the opening moments to this film we are greeted with a ritualistic dance whereby,Zulu Men and Women celebrate there coming mass marriage however this is done in a very natural fashion and though I was but a 15 year old I even wonder now if indeed this was fit for children to watch.It is one of the dramatic moments when there is news as to the annihilation and Jack Hawkins who plays a Missionary with his Daughter played by Ula Jacobsson are participating as respectable guests might, this celebration of the coming marriage of all these Zulu Warriors.They leave the Zulu camp when a messenger brings news of the outcome and these servants of the will of God doubt the resolve of there efforts to convert the Zulu king to a Christian belief along with his entire tribe.The English historically were in actuality spoiling for a fight with the Zulu's and when the annihilation occurred it was poor judgment and terrible overconfidence that were real ingredients in the disaster.This all seems to play into the build up of this very brave even heroic stand taken by some 100 plus British soldiers and the mission at Rorke's Drift.The Zulu's with more than 4,000 warriors were now en-route to wipe-out whatever English soldiers were at Rorke's Drift.This is the story of that stand which provides for the eloquent statement that since the Advent of the Victoria's Cross for Bravery beyond the call of Duty some 10 were awarded here in this particular action which occurred in January 1879.If there is a mention as to performance it would seem that if there was anything not serious enough prior to the arrival of the Zulu's it was dashed pretty well as the entire post fought for its very life.The characterization by Nigel Green I personally thought was exemplary as the officer portrayed was as skilled with a bayonet as he was in his knowledge of what it meant to be an English officer in 1879.I watched this character actor in Khartoum as well and though much less a role he was still terribly skilled as a subject of Her Majesty the Queen of England.It was this performance in general that caught my attention,however this was not about individual performances this was about the survival of the mission at Rorke's Drift and the 100 plus British soldiers who defended it.The Zulu's attacked however the English quickly learned how many of there comrades had perished and it was in watching how some of there own had as well, by not taking the enemy seriously and in so doing exposing themselves to peril and of course dying as a result.They closed ranks with greater and greater precision and with valor fought off a most certain death.The battles scenes are engrossing and much of the picture provides for such compelling information that indeed you have here a very interesting film.It is interesting enough that it will hold your attention perhaps even from start to finish.One final note as to this film.It was the music of John Barry that had for many years stayed with me long after I had all but forgotten the film.It was the reason why I today possess a copy by way of a DVD of Zulu but as well possess a dedicated soundtrack of the music of John Barry."

","""Zulu"" is a superior action film much like the American Indians vs. the Cavalry films covering the same period. It takes place in 1879 South Africa mostly on an isolated post called Rork's Drift.<br/><br/>The opening narration (spoken by Richard Burton) tells of the massacre of 1200 British Troops by Zulu warriors. Cut to a Zulu wedding ceremony where Swedish missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobson) are enjoying the proceedings. Suddenly a warrior arrives with news of the massacre of the British garrison. The Witts flee to their home base at the British post of Rork's Drift with news of an impending Zulu attack.<br/><br/>The post of about 100 men is under the command of snobbish Lieutenant Bromhead (Michael Caine). A Royal Engineer Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) is on sight building a bridge. When news of the coming attack by some 4,000 Zulu warriors is known, preparations have to be made to defend the post. Competition arises between the two officers with Chard imposing his seniority over Bromhead and assuming command.<br/><br/>Much of the first hour of the film deals with the post's preparations for the attack. The post is kept in suspense awaiting the attack. When the attack comes it is vicious and brutal. The British with their superior battle tactics survive the onslaught with few casualties. Now exhausted and spent they await the final attack when..................................................................................<br/><br/>This film is a true story and several members of the force were awarded the Victoria Cross , Britain's highest honour for their bravery. The battle scenes directed by Cy Endfield, are realistically depicted in spite of rubber bayonets and spears.<br/><br/>Baker and Caine (in his first major role) are excellent as the beleaguered officers facing their first battle and trying to mount a viable defence against a much superior force. Jack Hawkins as the fanatical preacher has little to do before he and his daughter are sent away prior to the battle. We never do find out their fates. Others in the excellent cast include Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Bourne, James Booth as Hook the rebellious prisoner in sick bay, and Patrick Magee as the surgeon among others.<br/><br/>We are never told the reasons behind the Zulu attacks or why the British are camped in an isolated post in the first place. I assume it all had to do with the British colonization of South Africa and the Zulu not wanting to be colonized.<br/><br/>A good movie."

"RatedVforVinny","8","1","2","4 November 2018"," British Empire epic.
","Remarkable epic, staring a brilliant debut by Michael Caine (as a posh sounding officer) and with the established command, Stanley Baxter (of who he has come to replace). The film is largely accurate to events leading up to and during the 'Battle of Rorke's Drift', where just 150 British Soldiers (many who were sick or injured in field hospital), held off a Zulu force of 4,000. The 24th Regiment of Foot won 11 V.C's (the most in a single battle) for their efforts, which in turn averted a certain massacre. Rorke's Drift was an actual supply depot for a British invasion force (into zululand) that went terribly wrong. Hours before 1,300 british soldiers were killed by the Zulu's, which was the biggest defeat of any British army (up to that date). the Zulu war was instigated by an aggressive British, expansion policy in the region (of Natal) but the high command hugely underestimated the fighting spirit of the Zulu warriors. Armed mostly with traditional weapons, some were also skilled with the musket (a nice detail depicted in the movie). Overall a satisfying and educational picture, though some of the battle action now looks a bit tame. Michael Caine stated that after 'Zulu', he would never again try to act with any type of an accent but despite criticism of his (put-on) upper class voice, the movie made him into an international star. For every film after he spoke with his natural voice."
"clanciai","10","1","2","14 July 2018"," Great show.
","No praise is enough for this film. It is realistic cinema at its best concerning every single detail, from each individual soldier, the epic environment settings, the drama about the priest and his daughter, John Barry's terrific music, the constantly sustained almost unbearable suspense - many scenes are absolutely quiet and the most exciting ones as they always introduce something, - and above all, the overwhelmingness of the Zulu warriors. This all happened for real, and here cinema fulfills its highest mission in recreating and transmitting it all correctly. They are all ordinary men, Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are just ordinary soldiers, the priest is like any scared priest, his daughter (the only woman in the film) perfectly natural in her hysterics, and even in the baracks the soldiers and patients couldn't be more down to earth. This is cinema and cinematography at its most perfectly best - and a film difficult to transcend in excellence."

I'm thinking of the support staff who kept the British uniforms clean and crisp amidst the daily battle of war, the chefs who keep up the soldiers' appetites after a hard day defending the fort, the doctors, so many people who play a role behind the scenes.

In the opening scene in Gladiator as the Roman army faces off against germanic barbarians, the director choose to use a chant from Zulu as one from the barbarians. Loosely put, it sounds like ""Bhoots Watsi, Bhoots Whatsidi"", which is chanted a number of times, followed by a loud ""Zuluuuuuuu!!!!"" really intimidating and moving in its original form, its no surprise that someone remembered it and recycled it. not very historically true-to-form, but it worked in gladiator.

","I remember my 6th grade friends and I getting 50 cents from our mothers to go see this movie at the Nostrund Theatre in Brooklyn, New York back in 1965. In those days you could sit through a movie a couple of times because no one came to kick you out. It was a great action movie. I love the type of movie a true story about a small group of men fighting against overwhelming odds. This is one of my favorites of this type, the others being ""The Alalmo"", and ""Major Dundee"". I believe this was Michael Caine's first movie and he along with the other cast members did a wonderful job. I would get to meet Michael Caine later on in life in the Philippines when he and Cliff Robertson made the movie ""Too Late The Hero"" on our base at Subic Bay, Philippines. I was in high school and got to be an extra for that movie playing a British Army solider in the camp. I agree with the gentleman from Scotland's comment about there not being enough of this kind of movie. In my historical readings I have come upon another story of this caliber. In fact I am confused that a movie hasn't been made about this battle already. I am referring to the Battle of Camerone in Mexico back in 1863, where a group of 60 French Foreign Legionaires fought against 2000 Mexican troops. After much fighting the Legionaires had been backed into a farmhouse and were down to just a few men left. The Mexican Army was going to let them surrender and go, but true to the Legion's code they were ready to fight to the last man. Captain Danjou, their leader went around and talked with each man and had them promise to fight to the last man. Captain Danjou had a wooden hand due to loosing his hand in battle in the Crimean War. Soon afterwards Danjou was killed and only 5 or 6 Legionaires were left. With no ammunition left, instead of surrendering, they fixed bayonets and charged the Mexican Army. The Mexican Army fought and wrestled the men to the ground. The Mexican leader was so impressed with the courage of the Legionaires he let them leave and gave into their demands to allow them to take their weapons with them. The Mexicans built a monument at the site of the battle honoring the French Legionaires. Captain Danjou's hand was found and returned to the Legion Headquarters. To this day it is considered a honor to be the Legionaire who is allowed to carry their most historic relic in parade, that being the wooden hand of Captain Jean Danjou."

One feels very moved after watching the film, and it one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Essentially a little over a hundred British soldiers, plus a few others, hold off 4000 Zulu.  These Zulu have just massacred a force of 1,200 British soldier, plus others, at Isandelwana.<br/><br/>The film does not, rightly, discuss the reasons for the British being there (circumstance really), or why they lost Isandelwana (error of judgement), or what happens next (British revenge at Ulundi).  Instead it focuses on the British soldiers themselves, and just hints, quite nicely, at the outside world.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, the scenery is breath-taking, and the viewer is not shown too much, but gradually drawn in, as someone there would have been. Like Star Wars, emphasis is placed on the sound, and it pays off, from Burton's excellent narration, to the Zulu chants and the 'steam train'.<br/><br/>Yes, there are major flaws in the film.  Chard and Bromhead were older than in the film, Hook was teatotal, there was only one major Zulu attack, and Ardendorff was probably a coward not a hero.  Yet.....despite all this, the film gave me a flavour of life then, and induced me to read more about Rorke's Drift.  If I am ever in need of inspiration, then this film has by the bucket-load."
"robred69","Null","1","2","1 February 2001"," A great film
","Zulu is definately one of the best war films made in the 1960's. A brave film that shows courage , adventure and humanity. The acting is superb , from all quarters. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are brilliant as officers from two very different social backgrounds. Also commentators have noted that Pte Hook in reality was a teetotaler not the malingering barrack-room lawyer that James Booth portrayed. What is lost on the historical purists , is that the writer John Prebble was an ex-communist and was brave enough to point out, not only the class divisions of 19th century Britain , but the point would not be lost on an audience in 1960's Britain. Everyone I know who has seen the film , recalls a memorable line. My own favourite is at the end , when Lt Chard points out to Colour Sergeant Bourne that it was not a miracle that saved them  and proceeds to point out the effectiveness of a box chamber rifle , but Bourne then replys , ""and a bayonet sir , with some guts behind it"". Lt Chard walks away with a knowing smile. Naturally enough , Zulu will always be classed as a War film , but the social commentary was not lost on me. Pte Hook is the prime example and the character portrayed by James Booth is a curt reminder , that it was the poor , socially excluded and criminals that made up the British Army at that time , the Empire and Good Old Days that some quarters of Britains elite today still hanker and sentimentalise about should be reminded of that fact.<br/><br/>Zulu is definately in my own top ten films , but the damage done by the film , is that only a very few war films can be placed as better or on par with the film. All Quiet On The Western Front (1930) set the complete overall standard , the great war films(not a list in preferance) however , are ,Saving Private Ryan , Schindlers List , Come and See , Stalingrad , Paths of Glory , Thin Red Line and A Bridge Too Far. The worst or should I say the opportunities missed are Anzio , Battle of Midway and Bridge at Remagen. The only films I can think of that was just simply standard , was Battle of the Bulge , Kelly's Heroes and Gettysburg. I just hope my comments on Zulu helps the historical purists to put things into its proper perspective."

The photography and the acting are superb, bringing back the British soldiers of the past in all their discipline and authority.<br/><br/>This was the first time I saw Michael Caine on screen; his transformation from a haughty arrogant man during the course of helping stave off the Zulu attacks on the outpost is inspiring to see.

The Gatling was so successfully used on hordes of spear carrying African natives that it was later used in Europe during World War One.

","It was painfully obviously watching 'Zulu' that it was straining for the movie to be Something Important. I mean, this movie, which is about a British fort trying to defend itself from an onslaught of Zulu warriors just has it all, 70mm , fantastic scenery, an excellent cast, etc. But why is it forgotten today? Like the only DVD available, is a low-rent company's version (with no subtitles and limited chapters!). So why was this delegated to the 1.99 bin? I think the main reason for it, and this happens to a lot of movies, is that it takes itself way too seriously for it's own good. I mean, you can tell some of the actors are just screaming ""OSCAR!"" under their breath, acting acting acting. The chief culprit of this is Jack Hawkins, as a priest, who bellows out his lines every chance he gets, close behind is Ulla Jacobsson who plays his daughter, who tries to chew on the curtains once Hawkins is done with them. Stanley Baker, who plays Lt. John Chard. Is alright, but somewhat invisible. The one that garnered all my attention was of course, Michael Caine, here in his first starring role, and rather amusingly and stunningly, rises above the material. I can almost sense Caine was seeing this was a turkey,. And trying to be as unassuming and sly as possible.

","""You're all going to die! ... Die! Death awaits you all! ... Die! ... Die!"" These are the ominous cries of missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins), as he is bundled off in a carriage with his innocent daughter to flee yet another attack by 4,000 Zulu warriors.<br/><br/>""Why us?"", asks a terrified private of the stoic Colour Sergeant Bourne, played to perfection by Nigel Green. He calmly replies, ""Because we're 'ere, lad. Nobody else ... Just us...""<br/><br/>This typifies the tone of the film: the scared, but disciplined British soldiers, plus their breech-loading Martini Henry rifles of course, facing repeated onslaughts by their fierce and seemingly unstoppable foe, the Zulus, in overwhelming numbers.<br/><br/>I first saw this film close to its release date, and it was the best film I had ever seen. I was a young schoolboy at the time, but even now, forty-something years later, it still stands up with the best of any action or war films.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot, or historical accuracy, as that is well covered, but the reason this film is so entertaining is that it succeeds, and excels, on so many levels: the build up of suspense, the well-written characters, the brilliant acting and directing, the location, the cinematography, the dialogue, and, of course, the action scenes. You might think that a battle that goes on as long as portrayed in this film would get boring, and that you would get numb from so much violence. However, the pacing of the film is expertly judged, and the fighting is punctuated with contrasting scenes, some comedic (Hook, as the eternal malingerer, complaining about his lot in life), some poignant (the Welsh soldier comforting a frightened calf, although one suspects he is really comforting himself) and some dramatic/tragic (exchanges between Chard and Bromhead, scenes in the hospital with the surgeon attending horribly wounded men, etc.).<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. Michael Caine puts on his best ""toff"" (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toff) accent -- which I have never heard him repeat since -- as Gonville Bromhead, Stanley Baker is great as the stalwart Lt. (that's ""Lef-tenant"", BTW, not ""Loo-tenant"") Chard, James Booth does a great comedic, yet believably courageous, turn as Private Henry Hook, and Jack Hawkins is excellent as the missionary Witt. All the supporting characters are also perfectly crafted by their respective actors, aided by a superb script which I will mention shortly. The performance which steals the show, in my opinion, is the brilliantly understated, yet immensely solid and powerful portrayal of Colour Sergeant Bourne by Nigel Greene. He is the absolute personification of the British ""stiff upper lip"", calm, reassuring attitude in the face of danger. Whether it still exists as mythologised in this and other films is debatable, but Nigel Green is completely credible as the unflappable Bourne. ""Button up your tunic, lad. Where do you think you are?"" A seemingly ridiculous order, considering the context, given to a soldier trying to gain relief from the intense African heat. Yet the actual effect is that it restores the sense of military order and consequently takes the soldiers' minds off the approaching horror and chaos. Also reinforcing his character is his attitude toward the drunken Reverend Witt - it is respectful, as befits their social ranking in those times, yet firm. He expects no brooking of his command, ""Mister Witt sir, be quiet now, will you? There's a good gentleman. You'll upset the lads.""<br/><br/>The script is brilliant, there are more memorable quotes in this film than I can think of in any other. Never mind ""I'll be back"", ""Go ahead, make my day"", ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"", ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!"" (somewhat obscure Michael Caine quote, I couldn't resist) - these and many other films have only at most a handful of worthwhile quotes. Somehow, a lot of them also seem a bit self-conscious, like they were written to be ""sound-bite"" type quotes. With Zulu, they are quite natural, and never sound hackneyed.<br/><br/>One last note: Ridley Scott liked this film so much that he used the Zulu war chant as the battle cry of the Germanic tribes in the opening scene of Gladiator. It is instantly recognisable."

Also in 'Zulu', the warriors are portrayed as brave and, indeed, sophisticated opponents.

","I don't hand out 'tens' very often, but few will question my choice here.<br/><br/>From the tremendously visceral theme music to the wonderful African back-drop; this work has it all.<br/><br/>It is the siege of Rorke's Drift. With a cast that still seems to embody the entire Zulu nation, and many of Britain's acting cream, we see this famous battle come to life in a way that could never be beaten even today. Special effects and CGI are no substitute for the real thing.<br/><br/>There's the quiet beginning with a bridge to be built. A sly little comedy of manners about army protocol is played out between Stanley Baker's Lt John Chard and Micheal Caine's Lt Gonville Bromhead. Then the bad news arrives. <br/><br/>From that point on there is a simple choice: cut and run, or make a stand.<br/><br/>The sense of impending doom is built-up to a point that is almost tangible. People are seen to be fleeing the dreaded though as yet unseen Zulu hordes as, to the disbelief of his fellow officer and most of the enlisted men, Stanley baker's Chard quietly sets about turning their group of mud-huts into a defensive garrison. It looks like military suicide.<br/><br/>In due course, a curious noise is heard like the approach of a distant train. It is the beating of thousands of clubs and spears against hide shields.<br/><br/>There are so many excellent acting turns in this movie that it would be pointless to list them all - at least as many as there were Victoria Crosses won. The battles are epic in scale at times, whilst being ferocious, bloody and intimate in hand-to-hand detail. No quarter is given by either side. The conflict and its drama is absolutely believable. It's bloody, ruthless and glorious. Yet at the same time, there is no excess, no gushing arteries or decapitated heads.<br/><br/>The story is told; frankly, for the most part honestly, with very little racial bias or imperialist gung-ho.<br/><br/>The colours and still wonderful. The camera work and editing absolutely first-rate. The pacing, tempo and duration just about perfect.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie many times and it is scarcely less gripping and engaging than the first sight. If there's any attempt at a re-make - perhaps in a more modern politically-correct context; it will surely fail.<br/><br/>This is a unique stand-alone war epic. I love it. I can find no fault. It gets the 10 stars it deserves."

","Zulu is an undeniable classic. It is based on the battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879 when 96 British soldiers had to defend themselves against a massive force of 4,000 Zulu warriors. This film shows the bravery of the British soldiers who fought in the battle, showing how tough it would have been. The film did focus on the British soldiers, but did treat the Zulus with respect, showing them to be brave, excellent fighters and were not portrayed as evil.<br/><br/>The film has some fine actors who give very good performances. Stanley Baker is very good as Lieutenant John Chard and Michael Caine is good as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, and it still gets me that he speaks with a posh accent.<br/><br/>Zulu is epic in it portrayal of war, a large number of extras were used. This added to sense of what the Zulu war would have been like. It was gritty when it battle became a hand-to-hand fight and destruction was happening. The Zulus were shown to be tactically knowledgeable and even started to get hold of modern weapons.<br/><br/>The film also has some good scenes not involving the war, including the Zulu warriors and British soldiers singing before an attack by the Zulus, the singing by the Zulus at the end of the battle, the roll-call at the end of the battle and showing the soldiers who earned Victoria Crosses.<br/><br/>I admit that the film is not 100% accuracy, the Zulus did not honest the British after the battle, but Britain and the Zulu did respect each other's bravery. British soldiers did also execute Zulu warriors after the battle, which was admitted from the film because it would not have been such a romantic story if they shown that. Zulu however is a more accuracy then many American films about war, such as the Patriot, Pearl Harbour and U-571.

","I don't think you can say enough good things about this movie. As a study of the British Army during the 19th Century, it is outstanding: The interplay between the officers, the sergeants and the foot soldiers is dead on. The sequence between Bromhead and Chard when they discuss seniority may seem petty, but it is true and even goes on today, unfortunately. Caine's performance and transformation is very believable, from a martinet to a true soldier.<br/><br/>I think the best sequence leads to the best line of the movie; the last line of defense, the three tiered barrier shows what this type of fighting truly is: Butchery. Nothing glamorous, not fighting for the King or Queen or whatever, simply fighting for survival. Chard puts it simply: ""If it's a miracle, Colour Sergeant, it's a short chamber Boxer Henry point 45 caliber miracle."" This is an important point for military historians and theorists that can be applied today. Unconventional warriors fighting a set piece battle against trained, disciplined, well equipped soldiers will lose. However, turn the tables around and the unconventional warriors will win every time. Had the garrison moved out as Bromhead suggests and met the Zulus in an open field, game over."

","If you've not seen this film then do not read on. This film is simply superb, though as I found out later inaccurate in some respects. However do not let this put you off. As most people know the film is a dramatisation of the military action that took place in December 1879 between around 130 British troops and roughly 4000 Zulu warriors. The performances given by the cast are superb and the panoramic shots of the surrounding country are true cinematic gems. Some people who have posted earlier have complained about the special effects, to those I say remember that it was made in 1964 and the fact that its not soaked in buckets of blood a la Saving Private Ryan (another excellent film by the way) in no way retracts from the depiction of the horror of close hand to hand combat. Also to the one's who commented on the protagonist's on both sides succumbing too easily to spear or bayonet thrust's they should try having a couple of inches's of steel shovelled under their rib's and see how chipper they feel. There are a few memorable line's contained in the film such as Colour Sergeant Bourns response to a trooper when asked ""Why us sarge"" Bourn's reply of ""Because we're here lad that's why"" and I found myself mouthing ""Hold them , hold them"" (Chard's command to his flying column of troopers during close combat) under my breath during an England football match when the defence was under pressure. The subconscious is truly strange.

It seems to have all the expected military stereo-types, at least of the British Army. The movie takes its time and has an interesting ending. It is an example of a world power ""interacting"" with a native people. I enjoy military cinema and this covers an area not too well known in the states.

"sol-","Null","1","3","16 June 2005"," My brief review of the film
","Reasonably well made on an appropriate budget, the film uses good locations, has a great set design, an exciting score as well as some commendable camera-work, but it is overall not quite as good as perhaps it could have been. Some of the sequences are a bit clichéd, and there is a severe lack of background information, but the biggest problem comes from something that would have not been a problem at the time of the film's release. Nowadays, the typical viewer is educated to sympathise with the Zulus, rather than the invading British, and in the film, the Zulus are all one dimensional and the British characters are not developed too well themselves, which makes it a bit hard to know who to sympathise with. Towards the end, the fighting sequences also become quite monotonous, but there are some parts that are interesting. It is a quite well made film overall and Caine is quite effective in a very early screen role, but it is not near perfect, and to a modern audience there is a question of how effective it would be."

","The Battle of Rorke's Drift...the mere name sends a ping of pride within the soul of every Englishman.  A battle where a mere 104 soldiers of the English 24 Regiment of Foot stood up against an incredible 4000 Zulu warriors at the mission station of Rorke's Drift in South Africa during the Zulu war. Throughout the film you are on the edge of your seat wondering: will the red coats be able to survive against this overwhelming force, or will they go down in a blaze of Glory as the Texans did at the Alamo.  You have plenty of time to wonder since 3/4 (or more) of this film is devoted to the battle itself.<br/><br/>Now those who have seen the film often complain about the lack of realism concerning the way people died in this film. An example they would give would be when a soldier would only touch a Zulu with his bayonet and then the Zulu would fall over dead.  You must remember that this film was made during the 1960's, a time when the film industry frowned upon blood and guts flying everywhere during a war flick.  Films like Saving Private Ryan would never had made it to the theaters because of the realism.<br/><br/>But one problem that I found with the film was the amount of historic liscense Hollywood took in the making of this film.  Many scenes which are depicted in the film never transpired in real life (based on my limited knowledge of studying the Battle itself).  But unless you have actually studied the battle you would have never guessed that parts of the film are fiction, they did that good of a job making the film.<br/><br/>All and all, I loved the film and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good war flick...or a good film."

","I was very disappointed with this film; I purchased the DVD based on the high rating on IMDb. The film cinematography is excellent; the music is powerful (john Barry). But the action is disappointing, it show how fake is the killing and stabbing and the shooting. I never felt a moment of thrill except for one thing which I think it is the reason why this movie is over rated. It seems most of the viewers were thrilled by the majestic sounds of the Zulu fighters and their war songs which gave the movie its only thrills.<br/><br/>In my view, at the end it was the Zulu ethical stand and respect for courage who won."

","A friend suggested I take the film out. I have very little knowledge of the conflict in South Africa so I have few preconceived notions. I was told that this is a true story which is always a good thing. Now, for the movie, I found the scenery beautiful to look at, often quite awe inspiring. The Zulu warriors and their lady folk looked about as authentic as I would expect, with nothing looking contrived. The ritual group marriage dancing was quite interesting. The main battle sequences were quite stirring, with the sounds of many warriors singing and chanting. Truly one gets a shiver up the spine at the sound of thousands of warriors viciously beating their spears into the back of their shields.<br/><br/>Where I found the film to appear dated and weak were in the up close contacts between the British soldiers and the Zulu warriors. It must have been a difficult or impossible task given to the director to make up close film of people getting speared all over their bodies without showing realistic looking wounds. On the scale of that battle that would have been one huge cost to re-create. Perhaps given this, the director opted for fake jousting and fake puncturing. This resulted in people falling over just about as soon as some pointy object touched them and this really looked silly. Sure guns were going off in all directions but again when Zulu's were shot it had all the hallmarks of a school play in grade 5. It was just not believable. I know, I've been jaded with the many years of watching Hollywood big budget movies that spare no money in creating real death scenes. Perhaps it should have been left as it was, rather than the eye popping stomach churning sounds and look of death that say ""Saving Private Ryan"" gave us. OK, so call me a complainer.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy Michael Caine's portrayal as I found it confusing. He is at times effeminate, remote, too quiet, boyish, a dandy, and on the other hand can bark out orders with as much salt as the best of the boys. I could not follow what his personality was trying to create.<br/><br/>Jack Hawkins gave his usual flawless characterization even if that of a crazed religious/drunkard.<br/><br/>The film to my eyes looks a wee bit faded at the edges. You look at Gallipoli (the film) and you can see how much more superior the final product was. Different times, different director. I know. Still, an interesting historical piece."

","Great film, much surrounded by myth. Apparently the Zulus who attacked Rourke's Drift were not those who had destroyed the British at Islandwana (apologies if that is not spelt correctly) and were in fact acting against the order of Cetawayo (more apologies!)since Rourkes Drift was across the border in Natal.They didn't have guns and, as Stanley Baker says at the end of the film, the victory was a 'martini henry' victory or words to that effect. If the Zulus did have guns they weren't captured from Islandhwana.also btw the British guns apparently had a range of 400 metres, not 100 as said in the film. I imagine this would have helped."
"missrljane","5","2","11","16 May 2008"," It Is What It Is - If Western-Style Historical Battles Are You - Then Go For It
","The plot leading up to the battle of 4000 Zulu warriors against only 100 British soldiers is hard to follow, mainly because there are far too many characters to remember who they are and it is difficult to hear what they are saying, and no one bothers to explain the historical setting, so unless the audience has studied 1870s African colonialism wars, they're going to be a bit lost as to what is going on and why.<br/><br/>Scenes of the Zulu warriors dancing, or singing, or preparing for battle are lingered on, presumably because they took a lot of effort to film, but are so long and uneventful, it is difficult to concentrate.<br/><br/>Due to some camp acting and a strange lack of violence, with people being murdered with quick pokes of spears or bayonets as if this is a game of tag, Zulu can be hard to take seriously.<br/><br/>Within the plethora of characters, it becomes questionable who the audience is supposed to like. Perhaps the film makers had no one in mind, and were trying to give an honest portrayal of each man, but each character has moments of likeableness and moments of detestableness so it is difficult to pick favourites, there is an awful lot of setting up of the peace-loving Reverend who becomes a screaming alcoholic force of evil, just because he thinks murder is a sin and the battle of power between Lt Chard and Lt Bromhead makes each constantly switch in the affections of the audience, Bromhead originally being set up as a fop, but later it seeming wrong that Chard is stealing his command.<br/><br/>Zulu is a film that will be liked by those who want to see a film about a historical battle, but it doesn't have anything to offer on any other level. It is exactly like Westerns that focus on homesteaders versus Native Americans, with the small band in the wagon circle being beaten down by an expert warrior race that are on their own land and yet feel like the villains. The Zulu warriors are never represented as bad, in fact they are constantly praised, however, watching 4000 of them attack 100 British soldiers, and willingly sacrifice their own men just to test the enemy weaknesses makes it very hard to want anything other than for them to lose. And towards the end, when the British get some really organised firing lines in action, it is actually quite exciting. Everyone loves the underdog, and a film of 100 men being slaughtered by 4000 men would never have been made, so it is just a matter of sitting it out to see how these few will defeat the many."

","It's a little hard to feel sympathy for the British troops in this film, as they are being attacked by Zulu tribesmen (whose land they, um, INVADED..anyway) who simply object to their presence in the African wilderness.<br/><br/>But, let's throw all politics aside, shall we? This is a good movie, about a group of 100 British soldiers who, in 1879 ""defended"" Rorke's Drift (a British outpost in Africa) from a force of Zulu tribal warriors numbering around 4,000. That premise alone should be enough to attract even a jaded war-movie-connoiseur! <br/><br/>Production values are great, you really feel the beating African sun and dust...it seems as relentless as the waves of warriors who assault the outpost. Used to great dramatic effect is the old British tactic (not sure of the term used) that involves two or three lines of riflemen, firing in sequence (ie first line shoots, then drops to knee to reload while second tier fires, drops, reloads, first moves forward, fires, drops, reloads etc). It is very slow to get going, but once the final battle ramps up it's tension all the way as the Zulus storm the outpost and the desperate Brits engage in some hand to hand fighting.<br/><br/>SPOILERS *** The waves upon waves of Zulu warriors are truly amazing...just when you think they've exhausted their supply of troops, another ominous line of men appears on the horizon, spears and shields at the ready.<br/><br/>The final ""show of strength"" by the Zulu warriors is superb...and will leave you going ""Wow...what if they HADN'T turned back??"" ***SPOILERS OVER <br/><br/>Great Sunday afternoon flick"
"info-au-gay","2","3","22","30 November 2011"," The class issue is very confusing.
","In several of the reviews, mention was made of the class differences between Michael Caine, taking the part of an English blue-blood Lieutenant , and Stanley Baker, also as a Lieutenant and a Welsh patriot. The likelihood of a person from Michael Caine's background making officer at the time of the Zulu wars, is asking rather too much. Similarly, with Stanley Baker.<br/><br/>Snobbery was at the core of the British officer class and commissions were closely monitored. A top-class tailor might just make a good-looking East-End Cockney sit a horse and pretend to be a Cavalry officer. But once Mr. Caine starts to speak, the cat is out of the bag.<br/><br/>This failure, possibly, lay with the casting director. Caine auditioned for the Cockney Private - spot-on - but the casting director felt that his looks were too good for a private.<br/><br/>What was the woman thinking? It just doesn't work - at any level. There was a time when Received Pronunciation (RP) was drilled into all aspiring British actors & actresses. The result was, ofttimes, a highly affected accent, the speaker sounding, like Julie Andrews, for instance, as though they had a marble in their mouth.<br/><br/>Consider ""The Four Feathers"" - from the late 1930s. Apart, possibly, from C. Aubrey Smith, the men spoke with strangulated vowels - Harry Faversham became Herry Fevvershem etc...<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is stretched to the limit with miscasting. Zulu is carried by the action; the set pieces, but the sympathy lies with the Zulus, not with the miscast Baker & Caine.<br/><br/>If contrast is needed, consider David Niven, the quintessential upper-class English gentleman. He doesn't have to do anything other than be himself. In ""The Guns of Navarone"" he plays a private and no one would question his motives in declining to be an officer. We know he would pass the Recruiting Board if he applied.<br/><br/>In ""Bedtime Story"" Niven plays an aristocratic confidence trickster. It is not surprising that gullible women fall for his unassuming charm.<br/><br/>In the less than riveting remake, ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" (both films have appalling titles) Michael Caine is miscast as the aristocrat. He could easily play a confidence trickster (in a different film). He was perfect in Mona Lisa, as the East-End pimp.<br/><br/>But this is not my point.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, a fine action man, was cast as a posh English newspaper reporter in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" and who can forget Marlon Brando fopping his way through the remake of ""Mutiny on The Bounty""? The problem is that one must believe in the identity of the character portrayed. If they are totally miscast, as is the case with Caine, they become comical & unbelievable.<br/><br/>Enough. I rest my case & hope that someone in Hollywood will take note & make their characters believable.<br/><br/>Think Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe or Bette Davis as Margot Channing.<br/><br/>Think Kristin Scott-Thomas as an upper class English lady.<br/><br/>Geddit?"
"johnnyboyz","7","1","4","18 April 2013"," Solid war drama with plenty to get involved in.
","The outpost at Rourke's Drift was a mission, a locale not too dissimilar to what a hospital might look like - a place designed to house the God loving Christian, the sick, the ill, the frail – the weak. It's no surprise that Cy Endfield's 1964 war film Zulu is as good as it is, the whole things has this vulnerable, weak and frail atmosphere about it whenever its depicting scenes in and around this base. When the time comes for a few thousand strong indigenous Zulu force to hit them with mostly everything they've got, as well as a little more in the form of rifles they've acquired along the way, it's little surprise you watch the chaos unfold from behind your hands. At the core of the warring and hostilities is a curious dynamic which, I think, has no doubt contributed to its watchability down the years: strength in numbers against strength in firepower; an invading force greatly outnumbering a surrounded force who're better equipped, but are stuck in one place.<br/><br/>For all its fame and reputation of being a resounding film about triumph and against-the-odds victories, Zulu will open with a crushing British defeat. That is to say, it will open with the reporting of a crushing British defeat: the images of a burning carriage and its load put to a downcast voice over informing us of the bad news does not begin the film in a triumphant, resounding manner. The Zulus, then, are capable of such things; are capable of such victories, and our first sighting of them pushes them into this bracket of the unreal, of the uncanny – an eerie celebratory dance at their camp in the early evening with songs in a language few non-native people will have ever heard up to this point in history, almost placing them into a realm of the supernatural.<br/><br/>Present at this ceremony, however, are a British preacher and his daughter; Endfield's way of visually contrasting just how unalike these two later warring factions really are. The Brits here are stiff and rigid in their sitting and watching, as if unable to look away out of being too transfixed or frightened or a mixture of both by what they see, where the Zulus jump and bounce around out in the open in a very animated fashion. The daughter knows very little of what she sees and must ask her father, who's expertise in these people is enough to answer her questions. This mixture of fear, ignorance and fascination that the white Brits have for these people is established to be present within these African-set circles very early and through this otherwise irrelevant pairing. Later, the film will explode into a procession of violence and warfare with these sorts of conflicts at the core of the warring.<br/><br/>Not so far away at the aforementioned outpost are a group of about a hundred British soldiers, most of them injured or wounded in some fashion. Almost all of them are bored with this slow recovering process – these soldiers kill time with meagre games of shuffling cups in a random order after placing a bullet under one of them. These troops are not, however, stock filmic cannon fodder present so as to be blown apart later on: Endfield allows some of them to be friendly, others to be unkind; some are sexist, one or two of them are criminals - others even enjoying singing. At the core of them is Michael Caine's Lieutenant: Gonville Bromhead, a young man who's softly spoken; elegant and cuts an erect figure but will eventually traverse from such things to this frizzy haired, gunpowder stained character who bellows orders out to his troops in a way it didn't seem possible at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>When it becomes apparent an attack on their outpost might happen, Bromhead mentions some of his relatives from centuries ago and how their achievements in battle at respective places such as Waterloo and Quebec instills him with pride. To this extent, the film and its later warfare will carry more of a personalised air for Bromhead, as he tries to place himself in a similar bracket as those in his family that preceded him in proving his worth in battle. From some substantial beginnings arrives the assault, something which keeps getting worse and worse as one's sanctuary of being inside one of the few buildings is stripped away and the solider count is gradually eroded. The action and warfare wisely avoids falling into a trap that might see it labelled as 'exciting' – but it is a stupendous display of second unit spectacle interspersed by these diegetic chorus' sung by both sides, in what is an eerie instance of original score moving aside for internal music provided by the actual soldiers fighting within the scenes. As far as war films go, and with constructive character studies as well as a sense of film making prose at work, you could do a lot worse than Zulu."
"ShootingShark","6","1","4","22 August 2011"," Men Of Harlech March To Glory / Victory Is Hovering O'er Ye
","In South Africa in 1879, a small garrison of about one hundred men are stationed at the remote outpost of Rorke's Drift when the Zulu nation declares war against the colonialist British Army. Forced to defend themselves against a well-organised force numbering in the thousands, how can they prevail ?<br/><br/>This much-beloved British war classic is a great true story, a highly entertaining action film with an interesting and original backdrop (the Anglo-Zulu war which preceded the First Boer War), fantastic authentic location photography in KwaZulu-Natal province and a terrific ensemble cast playing the (mostly Welsh) soldiers. A resounding success for the star / producer Baker and writer / director Endfield (who previously worked together on a cool little drama called Hell Drivers), it has an unusually powerful structure for its genre; the battle doesn't start for about seventy minutes, but when it does it lasts for the whole rest of the picture, as wave upon wave of Zulus descends on our heroes. The imagery of the soldiers in their bright red uniforms and white pith helmets and the warriors with their assegai spears and ishlangu shields is pretty unforgettable, and the film plays like an old western. There's shooting, brawling, stabbings, cattle stampedes, fires, stand-offs, crazed suicidal charges, tribal chanting, infantry formation barrages, even a scene where the men sing the traditional Welsh military march Men Of Harlech. It's ripping stuff. Having said that though I do have a few problems, chief amongst them being I find it hard to identify with either Chard or Bromhead - Baker and Caine are both great but I never quite know if they are vainglorious or just plain scared. The supporting characters are more interesting, with standout performances from Green (one of the few actors who could pull off a full walrus moustache) as the no-nonsense sergeant, Booth as the malingerer Hook, and the amazing-looking McCarthy as the nature-loving Thomas. On the downside, Hawkins is a bit tedious as the zealous Swedish missionary Witt, and his daughter is a classic example of that staple of big studio movies, the Unnecessary Female. Minor gripes aside though, this is terrific fun, hugely cinematic, a poignant history lesson (eleven Victoria Crosses and four Distinguished Conduct medals were awarded to the survivors) and compulsory Sunday afternoon viewing. Featuring narration by Richard Burton and followed in 1979 by the less successful Zulu Dawn, which details the Battle of Isandlwana immediately preceding the events of Rorke's Drift."
"Sonatine97","8","1","4","26 August 2002"," Overlong But Very Absorbing.
","Zulu is perhaps one of Stanley Baker's greatest achievements in his relatively short movie career. So impressed was he with the real battle of Rorke's Drift between the indigenous Zulu warriors and the British Army during the reign of Queen Victoria, that he financed the entire movie project more or less on his own.<br/><br/>Baker not only produced but also starred alongside the young, fresh-faced Michael Caine. Baker plays Lt John Chard, Officer Of Engineers who marginally out ranks the rather pompous & arrogant Lt Gonville Bromhead (Caine).<br/><br/>Chard is very much a military man brought up through the ranks and therefore has plenty of military experience & tactical knowledge. However, his young rival, Bromhead is very much a blueblood, with a family tree full of colonels, captains & generals and therefore he assumes that he too will follow in their footsteps based purely on his standing & lineage.<br/><br/>The first 50 minutes of this film centres on this rivalry and as the film unravels further and the various battle sieges are played out under the command of Baker, we get to see Caine's gradual fall from grace as he comes to terms with the fact that he has no head for tactics or military command during battle conditions. And by the end of the film he more or less confesses that the battle of Rorke's Drift is in fact his first.<br/><br/>The battle scenes (and there are very many of them) are very well choreographed although the end result is less than satisfying. There are many shots of men being ""stabbed"" with spears under armpits or falling over covering bullet wounds even though there is no telltale holes visible on their tunics.<br/><br/>I also felt the presence of Jack Hawkins as a pacifist missionary pleading with Baker & Caine to hand over their sick & wounded before the attacks begin, was irritating. I don't doubt that there were missionaries during the real battle but somehow Hawkins didn't convince me at all, especially when it turns out they he is also an alcoholic and general trouble-maker (when the film was first premiered, Hawkins hated the final depiction of his character and didn't attend its opening).<br/><br/>The music is also exceptionally good, very much in keeping with the soul & vast presence of the Zulu army and their warrior-like chanting throughout the mountains encircling the small British Army at Rorke's Drift.<br/><br/>The film does seem to go on forever. There is a problem with the pacing from Cy Enfields assured direction. He develops the lead characters very well and the battle scenes are generally well done, but he also spends too much time identifying the support characters, which of course is always important but in this case he covers too much ground with too much talk and not enough action. And as a consequence the film out stays its welcome by about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>But for all that Zulu is a very good, film, totally absorbing at times, and both Caine & Baker do exceptionally well with their characters. Although to be honest Caine's rather snooty upper-class accent felt so awkward & grating because most of know that Caine has a trademark Cockney accent in most of his films. <br/><br/>

","Though I do not sympathize with the british. As a matter of fact, I was rooting for the zulu tribesman the whole time, even though I already was aware of the battle's outcome. It was funny, because in the very end when the british are being ""saluted"" by the retreating zulu horde, I thought to my self ""they won. the freaking zulu won... yet they still retreat and spare the lives of these strawberry lookin' soldiers.""<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, when it comes to survival - I have empathy for both sides. But when it comes to principle, the Zulu were fighting against invaders to who came to their land. Even today, because of colonization, those cultures are barely clinging by a thread. And the bias and dehumanization of the Zulu warriors was really offensive. However, there was one thing in the film that gave those tribesman more character and more presence than any intimidating force in film history - their music. The constant oscillating vocal harmonies and the gutteral rhythyms of the warriors was haunting, beautiful and fascinating. The song they sing preceeding their final march against the british made my heart sink and almost brought me to tears. It was empowering... and when the british started singing their stiff and uninspiring anthem over it, I cried ""GO GET THEM YOU ZULU B**TARDS AND SHOW THEM WHAT FOR!"" ... but alas.<br/><br/>Aside from my personal point of view regarding the way the film's bias was handled - the performances, cinematography and just the sheer scope of the film is utterly fantastic.

","A lot of people seem to really like this movie, and while the first time I watched it I thought it was okay, it has become one of those movies that you can only watch once because I found that it does drag on a bit. Basically the first half of the movie has a bunch of British Soldiers milling around a missionary outpost waiting for the Zulus to attack, and the second half of the movie has wave upon wave of Zulus being beaten off by the British. Mind you, they do not have a Gatling gun so it can be termed as a battle as opposed to a massacre.<br/><br/>From what I gather though they tried to be as accurate as possible in remaking this battle, not that the battle of Rourkes Drift is all that famous (I hadn't heard of it until I saw this movie) though it is not really a battle of good verses evil, but rather a battle between the conquerer and the conquered, and the conqueror wins. However it is not as if the British were doing anything that the people of Africa had not been doing for thousands of years beforehand, and that is going out and conquering territory and taking it from other tribes and suppressing them. I believe at that time the Zulus were basically in the ascendancy, though that changed when the British came through.<br/><br/>Mind you, the British were basically just another tribe that was marking out their territory, and it is not even that their propaganda was any different because I suspect that the Zulus used their own form of propaganda to convince their people that what they were doing was right. In then end, it is just that the British were far better equipped than the Zulus that they managed to hold out (though the Zulus did have sheer force of numbers, and could still have swarmed over them, but in the end gave up).<br/><br/>There has also been thing said about the reaction to the Boar War that the natives were shocked when white man went to war with white man. Personally, there is no difference, once again, to the natives because they would fight amongst themselves as well, however I suspect it is because that simply did not understand the white man and though that they were all the same rather than actually being two different cultures and 'tribes'. Hey, I can't tell the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese."

Basically it is 1879 and the British have suffered terribly with the war against the Zulu forces. The British are trying everything they can to both stay alive, and keep the Zulu from taking their land. The film is dominated by these hard hitting and sometimes intense battles with the red coated Brits and the black army, and that is why it is a really good film. Starring Stanley Baker as Lt. John Chard, Caine as Lt. Gonville Bromhead, Jack Hawkins as Rev. Otto Witt, Ulla Jacobsson as Margareta Witt, James Booth as Pvt.

It had a certain Boy's Own appeal and (as I thought at the time) some decent action sequences. It was, and is, in many ways a British Alamo. Almost half a century on, the faults are manifest and glaring. I watched it recently on bluray on a 106"" screen. Not quite as it was meant to be seen but close. Off topic, the bluray PQ is as bad as most knowledgeable critics have said. DNR and edge enhancement are glaring to the point of distraction. I haven't seen anything that bad since the bluray of The Italian Job, coincidentally another Michael Caine film. On to the film itself. The script is adequate. It restricts itself to a very limited perspective and that's a choice. I don't know but I hope that it's historically accurate because that's the only justification for such a narrow POV. The cinematography is flat. It takes talent to make Africa look boring, to miss the contrasts between the land and its natives and invaders, the sweeping views and the claustrophobia of the mission. I wondered what Vilmos Zsigmond might have done with it. The acting varies from good enough, Stanley Baker and Nigel Green, to hopeless mugging by the rest, led from the front by Jack Hawkins. Michael Caine is miscast as a British officer. The direction is borderline school play, with some shockingly badly realised scenes. Watch Stanley Baker et al stand around impotently as Hawkins persuades forty native soldiers to desert. The fight scenes are worse. I lost track of the number of spear or bayonet impalings where you could see that the blade was beyond the target body. Like The Alamo, this seems to have been a labour of love, with Stanley Baker standing in for John Wayne. I suspect that the budget was less than The Alamo's $12m but that doesn't explain the amateurish feel of the enterprise. It also doesn't explain the film's standing today. For all its political agenda, Tony Richardson's Charge of the Light Brigade is a far, far better film but you wouldn't know it from current reviews. 6 out of 10 for old times' sake."

","I enjoyed ""Zulu.""  It is an entertaining 1960s film.  But the battle scenes are largely silly when compared to modern film-making standards of realism. I'm speaking mainly of the absence of bullet wounds.  It's funny to see the Zulu warriors briefly clutch their clean, smooth chests when supposedly struck by a high-powered-rifle bullet, then lower their hands to prepare to hit the ground, revealing the same unmarked, clean, smooth chest.  I must admit, though, even modern blockbuster films are not entirely consistent in their realism.  In ""Gladiator,"" for example, you can watch at least one of the charioteers hold out his arms to catch and pull in the spear being ""thrown"" at him.<br/><br/>Another 1960s cliché in ""Zulu"": Stanley Baker spent entirely too much film time posing for the camera.  But when you're the producer, you can take as much camera time as you like."

","I recently had the opportunity of seeing a restored version of Cy Endfield's epic tale of The Battle of Rorke's Drift and just have to say at the outset, that it looks magnificent. If ever a film was highlighted to depict it's locations to optimal advantage, Zulu would be up near the top of the list. Largely filmed by cinematographer Stephen Dade in the nearby Drakensberg Mountains, the scenery is never less than spectacular, whilst the sets faithfully recreate the small settlement of Rorke's Drift.<br/><br/>The other beauty of this film and arguably the reason Zulu is still so highly regarded 55 years after its initial release is its intelligent screenplay. Though clearly taking a British perspective of the battle, it is careful to never disrespect the Zulu culture. From the extended first act mass weddings to the extensive detailing of the Zulu battle strategies, the film takes a fairly even-handed approach to to the concept of colonial imperialism, neither condoning it, nor denying the ambitions of the British power intruding into a foreign land.<br/><br/>As is usual in historical depictions of past events, liberties are taken to increase the dramatic impact of scenes. But in Zulu, these are relatively minor. Ironically one of the more obvious examples, is that the British body count onscreen is clearly far nigher than it was during the actual battle, when remarkably only 15 were killed.<br/><br/>Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are both excellent as the junior officers leading the defence, again renewing a collaboration begun in a similar themed movie from the previous decade called A Hill in Korea. Baker, who also co-produced the film obviously knew pretty early on, that he was on to something good. It's pity that his premature death stopped him from pursuing the sequel, which later turned into the inferior prequel Zulu Dawn. One can't help feeling that if Baker had had the opportunity to produce, it would have been a much better production. Nigel Green as the phlegmatically patient and calm Colour sergeant Frank Bourne is also outstanding, but I do wonder, as apparently Jack Hawkins did himself, why so much onscreen time, for relatively little outcome is devoted to the drunken Reverend Witt. It just seems distracting to focus so much on a (likely) fictional, unsympathetic character, who disappears into the dust prior to the main battle beginning.<br/><br/>The second half of Zulu is dedicated to the battle and again one has to be impressed in the manner in which the action, pretty much parallels what occurred in real life. Both sides are seen to be highly disciplined in their actions, with the point being made, as many military historians have concluded, that the British prevailed, in what became and is depicted, as desperate hand to hand combat, through the deadly use of their bayoneted rifles. The long percussive Zulu War chant heralding the onset of the Zulu attack still has the power to provoke a foreboding sense of dread, even for one who has seen the film many times.<br/><br/>Sad that due to the Apartheid and strict censorship laws instituted in South Africa during the 60's, many of the Zulu actors were never able to see the production, their participation was so fundamental too. One hopes that many were later able to do so, after the dismantling of Apartheid in the early 1990's."

","This film didn't strike a chord with me, it felt very dull. I did not sympathize with any of the characters, nor did I learn anything about the British or Zulu culture in the late 19th century. Perhaps I was looking for the wrong thing when watching this film - I was expecting a historical fiction piece that would show both sides of the battle, but in reality, all I got was a long snooze fest battle scene that relies on nationalism to really enjoy.<br/><br/>I feel like this is just a film that appeals to the people who like war movies because they show courage. Sure, this film shows the courage of these British soldiers, and it does it fairly well, but it also never developed any of these characters. I watched this film fairly recently, but if you asked me to name a character, I couldn't. With every other movie I've watched this year, I could probably name at least 3 characters from each one, but Zulu gave me no reason to learn about characters, the majority of the film was showing the British getting ready for, and then fighting the Zulus, which personally didn't appeal to me at all."

","Much blather about ""bravery"", ""heroism"", ""valor"", etc. ad infinitum, in the discussion of this movie, but the fact of the matter is that none of these qualities comes into play when your back is against the wall and you have to fight for your life or die. After all, were the fighting men given a choice as to whether they might prefer to retreat into Natal and spare themselves a pointless battle and slaughter? If they'd said, ""I think I'd prefer to take a pass on this battle,"" they would have been summarily shot (indeed, one soldier was shot for exercising his good judgment and attempting to clear out). Or did they have the option, once they viewed the overwhelming Zulu forces arrayed against them, to surrender? Changes are, again, they would have been executed, in this case by their captors. Real heroism et al. comes into play when you willingly put yourself into harm's way, and that ain't the case here. These were simply individuals fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>And they were fighting a battle that was stupid and useless. Rorke's Drift was located on the border between the Zulu Empire and Natal, and the Zulus had no territorial ambitions vis-a'-vis Natal. As it happens, the Brits chose to withdraw their forces from Zululand after the debacle of their first invasion. Six months later they returned to Zululand and conquered the Zulus and ""pacified"" their territory. <br/><br/>So, in the end, the hundreds of Zulu lives lost and the 2 score Anglo lives lost were lost for nothing. This isn't a matter of hindsight--it's a matter of the kind of stupidity and pig-headedness commonplace in warfare at the level of military command. And so instead of celebrating Lt. Chard for his ""bravery"" and ""heroic stance"", we should see him more in the light of ""we were waist-deep in the big muddy and the damned fool said to push on."" <br/><br/>P.S.: A BBC investigative report into the battle found that Lt. Chard was described by his fellow officers as ""a most useless officer fit for nothing."""

","By 1964 the British empire had collapsed and the crown's former possessions had gained political independence. That year, ""Zulu"" offered film-goers a vision of British hardiness in the face of fierce native resistance. The film does not acknowledge the irony of its own existence or offer political commentary or even stick to the facts of the events it depicts; is a shameless exercise in romanticism and war-movie heroics. Yet it is a rich and rewarding film nevertheless. The look and sound of the encircling Zulu army create an atmosphere that filmmakers have often sought to replicate, as Peter Jackson did with his orc hordes in ""The Lord of the Rings"" in the early 2000s."

","The story of the defence of Rorke's Drift is Britain's equivalent of the story of the defence of the Alamo in Texas.<br/><br/>The 1960's saw the release of movies such as Zulu, Lawrence Of Arabia, Mutiny On The Bounty and Waterloo to satisfy British audiences of a new found sentimentalism for the days of Empire. It didn't last long as they were soon superseded by Carry On Up The Khyber and Monty Python spoofs to ridicule traditions of Empire.<br/><br/>Since then the British Empire has been largely relegated to the role of the bad guys in Hollywood funded movies; one of the few exceptions being Master And Commander which flopped at the US box office. Only James Bond has been found acceptable because he was relocated to the Cold War.<br/><br/>Zulu is masterpiece of British military virtues even though it fails to capture all of the historical events that took place that day. The notable exception is any Brummie accents since 46 of the soldiers were from the Birmingham district. No mention is given either of the bayoneting of injured Zulu warriors the day after the battle; revenge for the mutilation of British soldiers in the hospital. To its credit though, Zulu is one of the few war films where the enemy are shown as courageous combatants and regarded with great respect by the viewer.<br/><br/>You probably have to be British to admire this movie in its entirety. We Brits enjoy the humour more than the battle itself. Hooky and the Colour Sergeant are such symbolic opposites of British attitudes. The scenery is spectacular and the Zulu battle chants are awesome, as is the accompanying music. <br/><br/>Zulu is also a tribute to Stanley Baker who died in 1976. Though as Lt. Chard, Royal Engineers, he appears to be missing his best drinking friend beside him (Richard Burton), and has to rely upon young Michael Caine instead. <br/><br/>It's a great war movie but I'm still not convinced it's the best war movie ever made."

","Everyone should see this film, I can't believe it doesn't make the top 250. Maybe that's a reflection of the subject matter and modern anti-imperialism, those that mark it down for this miss the point. The film is about courage, about overcoming immense odds and the remarkable achievements human beings are capable of. 139 British troops defend a small garrison besieged by 4000 Zulu's. It sounds impossible, but it's a true story. For me though the insight into the courage and determination of the Zulu's is also important. The courage of the Zulu's to launch wave after wave of attacks, despite suffering horrendous casualties is in itself inspiring, their determination to rid their homeland of invading forces and their willingness to pay the highest price to defend their country. Whenever I watch this film I find myself in awe of the warriors from both sides, I find it hard to comprehend the levels of courage displayed, it is truly awe inspiring.<br/><br/>The film gives a fascinating insight into the nature of human courage, and for that alone its worth watching, but it offers so much more.

","The only 'spoiling' of this film, of actually a very fascinating actioner and history of the Zulu war, is of course, the stretching of the facts. Naturally, there are too many to go into, but to accept this great film for what it is, is the best thing to do. A tiny garrison, at a mission station/hospital, isolated, waiting in 'high-noon' style anticipation/apprehension for the Zulu attack, stirs both the horror and 'stiff upper lip' among the defenders. We're treated though, to the facts here occasionally, that the Zulu army is NOT a rabble of savages, as one would think, in their loin cloths and mud huts. They prove a worthy and intelligent adversary, yes, with a few guns, but mostly pour defiance at the defenders by running into shields of lead every time armed only with their own cow-hide shields and assegais earning our admiration at times, as do the defenders. The British know of the shock defeat at Isandhlwana, therefore adding to the tension. Chard and Bromhead, played by Stanley Baker and Michael Caine respectfully, have had an uneasy liaison, but are thrown together to defeat the horde as it were. Bad boy turned hero 'Hooky' played by the late much-underrated James Booth, shows both humour and new courage in the face of adversity and stirs his chums in the centre of the melee, the hospital, to fight to the death. Plenty of suspense, action, human tragedy and the beautiful backdrop of The Royal Natal National Park made this an epic, supposedly British-made, but the Hollywooders had some input for the money put up for it, thus the sensationalising of the true facts and characters. Just like 'Dad's Army', you can apply plenty of the human touches, as there's equally plenty of soldiers to pick on, in a military situation. I've mentioned Hook, but Gary Bond makes the scared young lad - or is he just a conscientious objector-type? At the end of the fight, with heaps of Zulu dead around them, Chard and Bromhead show another 'conscie' attitude, mentioning the 'ashamed' feelings and 'butcher's yard' mentality of it all, that we should entertain, even though we began watching it for the action, showing our boys against 'the black horde' as it were. We're humbled by it though despite this original reason and it reaches a satisfying conclusion that the Brits are safe due to their bravery, but it's obviously, at the same time, hard not to feel sorry for the Zulus, who showed the same, and what the hell were we doing there in the first place? A brilliant film nonetheless."

","The story of a small force of British troops thrown into the unenviable position of facing thousands of fearless Zulu warriors. A battle fought between two sets of very different soldiers. A battle that will forever be part of South African folklore. The British people involved were ordinary common soldiers not national decision makers, it was not their choice to be there and they fought for their very lives. The characters portrayed may be slightly out of sync with the actual people involved but that is poetic license and several people may have been rolled up and portrayed as one person (in the case of Hook especially). You get to know each of the characters involved and feel their hopes and very real fears but you are not subjected to gallons of blood being splashed around (which was undoubtedly present at the actual battle). The actors involved do a fantastic job but with people such as Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, Michael Caine, Nigel Green, James Booth and Patrick Magee being involved, you wouldn't expect anything else.

","I really like this film. It is destined to be one of the greats, I think. Overall, the acting is quite good (save one), the story well-written and the cinematography is well done. My major complaint about the film is one of directorship. There are several scenes where the camera focuses on individuals fighting at close quarters. Very often, a British soldier is seen to ""bayonet"" a Zulu warrior, only the camera very, very visibly shows that there was no contact between the bayonet and the Zulu. What I'm saying is, if you can't be realistic about something like that, perhaps they should have just cut away at the last instant and shown only a grimace on the face of the warrior as he is being ""stabbed"". My other major complaint is regarding the acting of Jack Hawkins as Rev. Witt. His acting is pretty bad in this one, which is surprising, since he's usually quite good (witness ""The Cruel Sea""). Enough about the acting. The story is a true one - 2,000 Zulu warriors attacked a puny force (slightly over 100) British soldiers from a Welsh regiment. The soldier earned 11 Victoria's Crosses during the battle. At the end of the battle, the Zulus saluted the British soldiers and then left the field. Overall, a pretty good flick.

For a pretty good summation of this battle, and the ZULU war, pick up ""The Washing of the Spears.""<br/><br/>As I have recently reviewed ""We Were Soldiers"" (and having read the reviews from non US residents at that site) I can't help but ask why there is no morale outrage expressed in the reviews of ZULU. WWS is actually considerably more accurate than ZULU, by the way.  And what exactly were the British doing in South Africa?  That said, I'm really quite a fan of British society, but let's view all war movies under the same lense, shall we :)<br/><br/>
Lastly:  Has anyone ever been a cool as Nigel Green?  Michael Caine was excellent as the fop Bromhead, too."

","action movie that also deals with British class structure of the time - really exciting and well done - Michael Caine is great as the initial ""foppish"" officer, historic event with a lot of accuracy - the sequel is not quite as good -"
"glenn1961","Null","0","2","17 November 2001"," Historically accurate, to a degree
","This film, to a certain degree, is historically accurate.  It depicts what is perhaps the most glorious moment in British military history - 11 Victoria Crosses won in a single action.<br/><br/>The acting is superb; the action scenes are done just right; the authenticity is breathtaking.  I remember seeing this film as a child and being blown away.<br/><br/>The only unfortunate thing about it is, that no matter what I've read or seen since (including a visit to the South Wales Borderer's museum in Brecon), I can find no reference to a Colour Sergeant Bourne - easily the film's best character.<br/><br/>That aside, this is definately one of the best British films ever made and it's a shame that ""Zulu Dawn"" had to come along and tarnish it"
"luxor180","Null","0","1","21 January 1999"," An unforgettably colourful depiction of a great moment in British history slightly spoiled by artistic licence
","Driven by a majestic musical score the film rises to a terrible finale where the brutal killing power of Victorian volley fire is stunningly portrayed. it takes an hour for the film to get going, but this is partly forgivable given the first rate cast who hold our attention.  unfortunately, a significant part of this hour is taken up with the rantings of a hysterical preacher and his daughter, both of whom were nowhere near the fight.  If this is bad, the character assassination worked on private Hook, the hero of Rorkes Drift is disgusting.  The man was a fine example of the Victorian professional soldier, but he is depicted as a drunken, wife abusing, malingerer, skulking in the hospital.  The British army would not have given him a medal with that background if he had fought off the Zulus single handed.  On top of this, an awful lot of 60's philosophical hogwash is put in the soldiers mouths.  Some of the soldiers must have spun in their graves with dismay! The fighting when it comes is brilliantly staged.  Only 600 Zulu extras were used, but the careful camera work makes it seem as if the original 4000 are there on screen.  Colourful beyond describing, the battle builds to the same ponderous magnificence of John barrys spare, but telling score, totally gripping throughout. John Ford once said words to the effect ""If the legend seems more real than the truth, print the legend"". This film illustrates the point.  The 24th South Wales Borders had been fighting bush wars in Africa for a long time, yet they are shown in parade dress.  The mealie bag barricades at the real Drift were much more formidable than the flimsy stacks shown in the film. At some points the Zulus have to wait for someone to come and stop them climbing over the bags.  And nobody mentions the fact that Bromhead - Michael Caines character was stone deaf.  An excellent reason for Chard to take command. Was this a glorious page in British history?  The Boers held us in contempt for it.  136 men went into the fight and a third became casualties.  The Boer settlers took on the entire 50,000 Zulu army and BEAT it, with no appreciable loss at Blood River.  Oh well! Print the legend. All this aside, it is a glorious piece of cinema and must stand high in the Panthenon of great action movies.  Much of the dialogue is outstanding. ""He's a Peeler 716. Come to arrest the Zulus!"""

","Zulu is a masterpiece of a film. There is a great story behind a great cast. The battle scenes are so real and you actually see the actual Zulu tribe playing the extras as the Zulus in the film. This is definetly a must see!"
"hedgehog-10","9","0","3","16 January 1999"," A good film but ...
","It's a shame that this film which covers factual battle strayed too much into the entertainment side. The film has several inaccuracies which have been covered by other reader's comments."
"don*g","9","0","2","5 June 2000"," Life Changing Movie
","A great movie, the only film ever to make me want to go to the site on which it was based. Great performances, especially Michael Caine. I have visited Rourke's Drift on two occasions, on the second, I was lucky enough to be guided round the area, which gave an excellent perspective to the action. Favourite character, Henry Hook."
"Markark","9","0","1","30 January 2000"," Terrific movie
","I have liked this movie since I saw it as a kid on late night TV.  Baker and Caine are great, Color Sergeant Bourne is a classic, Hook is a hoot (though the real Hook was a teetotaler, so is libeled), and all the cast is finely realized.  Even the Zulus, who dont say a word, have majesty.  Plus the singing attack at the end is thrilling.  I like this movie so much, I almost bought one of the rifles when I saw it on sale at a pawn shop."
"rupie","8","0","1","31 January 2000"," hard to beat for its genre
","I found it most interesting to read the comments of British viewers more conversant with the history of the battle of Rorke's Drift, on which this wonderful movie is based. I learned a few things, but my admiration for the flick is undiminished by the few historical liberties I learned the movie takes (although evidently Hook's descendants should sue for slander).<br/><br/>The stunning sweep of the cinematography makes the letterbox version (which is available) essential in order to sense the vastness of the African countryside and the turmoil of the battle scenes.<br/><br/>A wonderful script is brought to life by some great acting, the greatest of which is by Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Bourne. His portrayal of Bourne as a seemingly impossible combination of stern disciplinarian yet gentle paterfamilias to his men, some of whom are barely past boyhood, is powerful and downright moving in places; it ranks as one of the finest screen performances I have seen, and makes the movie worth seeing for it alone. If his work here is indicative of his ability, I am at a loss as to why we never saw more of this fine actor. Also notable are Patrick Magee as Surgeon Reynolds, and Michael Caine in his first screen appearance. Richard Davies and Denys Graham provide understated comic relief as a sort of Welsh Laurel & Hardy. And Jack Hawkins scenery-chewing job as the sodden Witt - ""You're all going to die!"" - is worth the price of having no basis in the historical record (his presence here as a sort of prophetic voice is well-justified dramatically).<br/><br/>In short, in the genre of historical battle flicks, ""Zulu"" is in the top ranks.<br/><br/>Has Leonard Maltin actually seen all the movies listed under his comments??? His reference to Richard Burton's ""narration"" gives one pause. Burton's brief voiceovers at the beginning end amount to no more than a total of five minutes of speaking, and can hardly be called a narration (which would have killed the movie anyway)."
"JohnSeal","8","0","1","10 January 2000"," One of the great war films
","Zulu is a film I can watch over and over again. It's filled with terrific performances, pulse pounding action sequences, and ravishing photography that can only be appreciated widescreen. It's the true story of two proud empires--the British and the Zulu--locking horns at Rorke's Drift in 1879, and the bloody waste of life that ensued. Watch for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi---still a political force in South Africa today---as Cetawayo, the main Zulu chief. If there were ever a patriotic anti-war film, this is it."
"rmaki","10","0","1","4 September 1999"," Great battle scenes!
","This is a fantastic film of a true, historical event with some of the most stirring battle scenes in the war film genre.  The final battle scene sends chills up my spine every time I watch it.  The way the tension builds with the Zulu warriors chanting, and the British soldiers singing, is superb film-making.  The end of the film is also a true heart-stopper the first time one sees it."
"Grand","9","0","1","10 June 1999"," Ye Gods, what a stirring movie!
","(I was getting chills just casting my vote for it!)  How good is this movie? It is SOOO good that when I learned that its prequel, ""Zulu Dawn,"" was to premiere in London, I was ready to fly (full fare) from LAX to Heathrow JUST to see the prequel.  Fortunately, I didn't -- it was a disappointment. Making a prequel to ""Zulu"" must have been like making one of those horrendous sequels to ""Gone With the Wind.""  The last ten or fifteen minutes of ""Zulu"" are among the most memorable I have experienced watching a motion picture  --  and I have only seen this on television!  It must be a wonder on a theater screen. ..."
