","Before I saw this movie, I respected Mozart's genius, but his music wasn't my cup of tea. Beethoven was more to my taste, I tended more toward heavier classics. But this movie moved me to tears, especially at the end when they did Mozart's REQUIEM while he was working on what was to be his last piece of music. Now, I'm a Mozart fiend. This was a great movie. True, there are some historical inaccuracies. Anyone who has studied music history knows that Sallieri did not help Mozart with his Requiem. It was a student of his named Sussmayer. But it does make this story ironic, that the man who was so dedicated to the ruination of Mozart ended up helping him in the end. (I question the historical accuracy of that as well.) I recently bought the director's cut to this movie. Until I saw the director's cut, Sallieri seemed like a more sympathetic character, someone who just couldn't buy a break. Who can't identify with that? But after seeing the director's cut and seeing what I think is an important scene between Sallieri and Mozart's wife, he seemed more like a jerk. You also understand why Frau Mozart was so rude to Sallieri at the end of the movie, whereas before, you see the next to the last scene and you think, ""Whoa! Where did this come from?"" This was a great movie, for entertainment value only. If you want historical accuracy, watch a documentary or read a biography from the library or something. Because of this movie, I am now a rabid Mozart fan. If the movie can make Mozart converts, then it can't be bad at all."
"miknnik","10","65","70","30 January 2007"," True Gem for Movie and Music Fans
","I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest. Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a short opera called ""Mozart and Salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.<br/><br/>That being said, Peter Shaffer's movie adaptation of his own play is still an astounding achievement. Have you ever seen a movie based on your favorite book and come out of the movie theater rather disappointed though the film version faithfully followed the storyline of the book? Amadeus is definitely not one of those movies. Shaffer clearly understands the difference between stage and film; the story is more elaborate in the movie, and some of the lengthy lines are replaced with more subtle images and close-ups.<br/><br/>I'm often surprised to find that people don't get that Amadeus is the story of the fictionalized character, Antonio Salieri, not the real one, who adored Mozart's music but hated everything else about him. In other words, the movie viewers are seeing Mozart through Salieri's eyes. Needless to say, his view is rather slanted. If you have read Shaffer's original play, you probably remember he describes Mozart's laugh 'grating.' In the film, this annoying laugh becomes more symbolic. Though Salieri speaks in front of a Catholic priest, he is actually having a one-sided discourse with God. At one point, he declares, ""One day, I will laugh at you. Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at you."" But as he is wheeled out of his room by an aide at the asylum, what we hear is that screeching laugh of Mozart--or is it? It becomes obvious as we watch that this movie is called Amadeus because that's what Salieri wished to be--God's beloved.<br/><br/>The movie might give some viewers who don't know much about Mozart a wrong impression that he was a cad, and it gives incorrect information on some of his music (e.g.; the count in The Marriage of Figaro sings ""Contessa perdono"" AFTER he learns that the woman dressed in the maid's clothes is his own wife. There's no mistaken identity here. Read the title of the song--Countess, forgive me!), but these are minor offenses. Though I am a die-hard Mozart fan, I can laugh at tongue-in-cheek references to Amadeus in other movies. My favorite? In Guarding Tess, a secret service agent tells his partner, ""He (Mozart)'s a jerk. One day, a guy shows up with a mask, and he drops dead."" <br/><br/>What's not to like about Amadeus? The tale Peter Shaffer tells is gripping, the actors are first- rate, and, of course, there's music. The selection of Mozart's music in the movie is excellent; you can truly enjoy the beauty of his music no matter how much or how little you know about it. In case you are wondering, a little tune Mozart plays on his back and hands crossed as a penalty at a party is Viva Bacchus from The Abduction from the Seraglio, a duet for Pedrillo and Osmin. Pedrillo, while singing this song, is trying to get Osmin, the harem guard, drunk to help his master rescue his true love. No wonder Schikaneder calls it 'our song.' And the improvised version of Salieri's welcome march is actually a famous song, Non piu andrai farfallone amoroso, from The Marriage of Figaro.<br/><br/>As I said, I'm a huge Mozart fan, so my rating may be somewhat biased, but what the heck, I gladly give ten stars to Amadeus. I watched it close to a hundred times over the years, and it still gives me a great pleasure every time I see (and hear) it."
"Alec-11","Null","276","333","26 June 1999"," A rare masterpiece
","SPOILER: Amadeus is an extremely well written story, covering the last ten years of Mozart's massively prolific yet unusual life.  I have read much that it paints a rather inaccurate picture of the genius's life, and yet I am not dissuaded from ranking this film as one of the greatest made.  The historical problem should be addressed first, because it draws the most criticism.  I would advise anyone to shut out the self-righteous whining of those people who fancy themselves as Mozart experts, when they really have little solid evidence for their assertions.  History is only seen by us in fragments, be they documents or eye witness accounts.  These fragments certainly do not amount to a full picture of events, and so Milos Forman and Peter Schaeffer are perfectly entitled to form their own story of genius.<br/><br/>This issue aside, the picture is one of fantastic colour and scale, crammed with lavish costumes and wonderful architecture.  This keeps the eyes occupied, but the ears get the biggest reward.  The film uses a large amount of Mozart's music, and does so in a way which is carefully considered. For example, when the insane and enfeebled Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) reminisces on the sheer beauty of Mozart's compositions, we hear music to match his words, ""And there... an oboe, high and unwavering... until a clarinet takes over, and forms a phrase of such longing...""  The effect is deeply moving.  Examples of this collaboration of music and picture are many; when Mozart (Tom Hulce) swaggers through the streets of Vienna taking swigs from a bottle of wine, we hear a jolly piano concerto; and he is hurled into a mass grave to the sorrowful Lacrimosa of his requiem mass. The music should move any viewer, however much they confess to hating anything classical.  If you haven't seen this film, watch, or rather listen, for the scene where Salieri inspects samples of Mozart's music.  The originality in switching the music as he turns the pages is profound. The acting is superb, particularly from Abraham.  Hulce's cackle provides comic relief, and his wonderfully child-like mannerisms are testament not only to his acting skills, but to Forman's exceptional direction and vision. On the other hand, we are shown two moments of antithesis, namely when he is composing at his billiards table (his face taking on a look of such mature concentration), and when he is dictating his Confutatis to Salieri. Yes, we do get to see Mozart compose, and talk about tonic, dominant, second measures, etc.  I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered.  Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart.  We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy.  Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin.  He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri.  Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak.  The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold.  In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real.  This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement.  He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down.  He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee.  Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy.  On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy).  The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning.  This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away.  The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10."

","In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.<br/><br/>The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.<br/><br/>The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.<br/><br/>As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.<br/><br/>The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.<br/><br/>The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision."" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.<br/><br/>Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king."

Tom Hulce was a terrific choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music.

","It is because of this movie that I began listening to Classical music. Up to the age of 20 I wouldn't listen to anything but rock, rap, hip hop, punk. Then I fell in love with Mozart. And because of this epiphany I went on to listen to other styles of music such as country (Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Hank Williams), Edith Piaf, Al Jolson, and so on. This movie is breathtaking. A knockout and I wish I could see it on the big screen! Tom Hulce was wonderful as Mozart! Elizabeth Berridge who plays his wife Constanza looks eerily like the real Constanza judging from portraits of the great composer's wife. <br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham deservedly won the Oscar for his outstanding turn as Mozart's arch enemy-fellow composer Antonio Salieri who was NOT a 'mediocrity'! He was a brilliant composer in his own right. It is just that there are the fair, the good, the great-and then there are the gifted. <br/><br/>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the gifted. When it comes to music even the un-trained ear can tell that God kissed the man right on the lips. <br/><br/>And there was nothing Salieri could do about it. He could train in music for a million years and he still could not come close to the genius that was Mozart-who's ""Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik"" is recognizable today even to non-classical music fans."

","I remember as a child, my sister told me to watch this film. That it was the best film she ever saw. I didn't watch it until I turned 10; finally I sat myself down and watched it. I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amaudeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.<br/><br/>The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about...?"", he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!"" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with a emotionless face ""I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constanze played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constanze is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music. Salieri vs. Mozart: on the next celebrity death match!<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is a fantastic movie that anyone could easily love and enjoy. It's definitely a must see for movie fans and anyone in general who is just looking for a good movie. This was the best picture of 1984 and it's well deserved, just trust me and the awesome reviews it's getting!<br/><br/>10/10"
"DRIAINCLARK","Null","108","147","1 April 2002"," Ravishing in sound and vision
","The unseen star of this film is the Academy of St Martin's in the Field, London. Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart's music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.<br/><br/>But beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer's portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart's personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart's sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart's brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.<br/><br/>Another unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic  that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.<br/><br/>This film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart's life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart's music. If you have not yet done so, see it."

Salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known.

"tombew","Null","129","190","9 September 2000"," A triumph of genius
","""Amadeus"", while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart's genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer's play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and ""Don Giovanni"".  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, ""Amadeus"" is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  ""Amadeus"" is one such film."

","When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman's Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri's desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart's demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart.

They seem to be under the impression that he died of working hard and stress, or just being driven mad. PAY ATTENTION PEOPLE! There are SO MANY scenes of Mozart drinking. There are scenes of him SNEAKING OUT to go drinking. There are scenes of his wife finding bottles littered around the house. Keep in mind that alcohol brewed in Vienna during Mozart's time was pretty potent stuff. History says Mozart died of an ""unknown feverish illness"", but it seems clear to me that the filmmaker was trying desperately to make the viewer see that his vision of Mozart drank himself to death BECAUSE of the stress. Observe Mozart's final hours. His skin, his eyes, his fever. How can the public at large, no matter HOW old you are, not recognize that this movie suggests Mozart dying of cirrhosis of the liver? Therein lies the brilliance of the movie. They never SAY this is the cause. Could it have been poison? Salieri doesn't remember it that way, but then, he could be omitting that detail. More likely it was Mozart's own drinking problem that killed him in this movie. Like so many geniuses, Mozart was his own killer. Legendary talent and fame that burns brightly always accompanies a life that winks out of existence quickly. The message of this movie would then seem to be that Salieri WAS blessed by God, and that Mozart was the cursed one. Salieri was blessed with long life, while Mozart died poor and young. The irony is that Salieri, being a true artist, recognizes that his long life of mediocrity will not- CAN not- measure up to Mozart's legend, despite his short life. Salieri would trade that long life for a short life that guaranteed him people knew his music forever... And in the end, he is forgotten like the rest of us. Is there a villain in this movie?

The fact is, that in Foreman's case, he previously directed another film which has been critically earmarked as perhaps the most spectacular movie ever produced, that motion picture being: ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" Milos Foreman won the academy award for best director in '1975 for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", just as he won the academy award for best director in '1984 for ""Amadeus"". Foreman takes a monotonously challenging approach to his films. I am convinced that this world renowned director could build a perfectly designed New York City skyscraper using only a pair of tweezers. This is how detailed Milos Foreman actually is! ""Amadeus"" was a simply remarkable movie which engages in a comprehensive biography of one of the most masterful composers of classical music in the whole history of all creation, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This movie depicts how Mozart did not even write the notes to his sheet music on script paper, he memorized all of the music which he originated !! That is just simply amazing! Clinically using the adjective, prodigal, for describing Mozart, would merely be a paramount utterance of understatement. The culprit to Mozart's vulgarity was due largely in part to his baroque environment! Mozart's corrupt candor cultivated a tailor made invitation for his spontaneity to allow his personality to open the floodgates for him to maximize his flourishing aggregate potential! The movie ""Amadeus"" purported an intensely vivid clarity for pointing out a great many of Mozart's talented attributes! In a time when Germanic culture carried an assertively chauvinistic aura with the world's paradigm, Mozart was convinced that if he was going to write an unequivocally marvelous opera, that this opera should be composed and expedited in Italian. The English translation for this opera was entitled ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The cerebral complexities to Mozart were simply astounding. The grass root recognition of ideological fervor which prevailed with the hierarchy during the period of nineteenth century Austria was portrayed with a very subtle disposition in this film! The rendition of Mozart's music which was performed by the Dallas symphony, and conducted by Edward Mata, was a compendium of Mozart concertos which I will emphatically categorize as marvelously top notch entertainment. When I was in Austria, while visiting Salzburg, I ate lunch at a restaurant which use to be Mozart's home. The plethora of Mozart artifacts in Salzburg were, to say the least, intellectually sensitizing! This enriching sojourn of mine became a reflective synopsis of how influential Mozart was to the entire spectrum of classical music. As a matter of fact, I became passionately imbued with an aesthetic appreciation for Mozart as a result of watching this film,!! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart auspiciously revolutionized all of western civilization.The film ""Amadeus"" executes a successfully cogent expertise at illustrating Mozart as an aficionado with an artistic finesse and an unprecedented musical flair!! Winning the academy award for best picture back in 1984, this is just simply the introductory tip of the iceberg in terms of being an indicator of how wonderful this motion picture truly is. If you have not seen ""Amadeus"" yet, make it a point to do so. The acting is great, the cinematography is enlightening, and the directing, by one of the all time directors in the whole history of Hollywood film making, Milos Foreman, is totally sensational!! See this film!! Five Stars!! Perfect Ten!! No Question About It!!"

","Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but it also stuck with me afterward. In most respects it is well put together. The story if multidimensional and carries the viewer along well. The acting is superb; F. Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work. It is not historically accurate, but if one keeps that in mind, what harm can it do to appreciate its beauty?"
"sol-","Null","15","22","16 February 2005"," My brief review of the film
","A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film."
"AlsExGal","9","9","12","16 January 2010"," To give everything you have to music and come up short
","At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.<br/><br/>This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.<br/><br/>Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.<br/><br/>The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended."
"pelicans_and_such","10","11","16","30 October 2004"," F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce shine
","I've just acquired a video of ""Amadeus,"" and I have a much greater appreciation for it now than I did when I saw it six years ago. I was filled with the urge to see it after watching ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" repeatedly, which stars Tom Hulce as the voice of Quasimodo. Yet, as I watched ""Amadeus,"" though Tom Hulce was exceptional as Mozart, it was F. Murray Abraham with whom I was most impressed. He is PERFECT as Salieri, and he does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in my life in this part. He plays his character in such a real and believable way that I was completely taken in by him. Also, so great is his talent, that it took me about five times of watching the movie all the way through (and checking the credits!) to realize that it was the same actor playing ""Old Salieri"" and ""Middle-aged Salieri"" throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this movie just of Abraham alone, though the entire thing is a masterpiece. I went out and bought a cd of Mozart's Requiem Mass after seeing it just twice! Overall, this movie is intriguing and entertaining, and the actors are perfect. No one could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce, and I don't think I have to mention how amazing F. Murray Abraham is as Salieri again. I give it a 10/10. Simply fantastic."
"bandw","6","8","11","13 December 2013"," The casting of Hulce was a problem for me.
","I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat. <br/><br/>Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.<br/><br/>There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.<br/><br/>The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of ""The marriage of Figaro"" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from ""The Magic Flute"" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.<br/><br/>The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted."

","Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.<br/><br/>It's a shame that so many of these actors never did much else, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise because it allows them to embody their characters without other movie associations getting in the audience's way.<br/><br/>I was worried that the extended edition would hurt the film's pacing (most extended editions are a bad idea - the material was cut for a reason!).  But in fact, all of the restored scenes are excellent.  I should have expected no less!  Beautiful costumes, beautiful locations, beautiful everything...very fittingly, ""Amadeus"" stands above and apart from the mediocrity."
"mstomaso","9","7","10","26 December 2005"," Landmark historical speculation
","Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me. <br/><br/>Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.<br/><br/>Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life. <br/><br/>Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended: (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened. <br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics. <br/><br/>This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age."

","As of this writing, I have about 90 reviews on IMDb. I'd only began submitting reviews a few years ago, so the films I'd seen in the past were never reviewed by me. I thought I'd take the time now to give a quick review of the 10/10 films I'd seen in my life.<br/><br/>First one up is ""Amadeus,"" and to me, the best film ever made. It's the movie I compare all others to, including classics like ""The Godfather,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""Schindler's List.""<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" has it all - excellent acting, excellent cinematography, excellent costume design, excellent music production, excellent set design, perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, and tons and tons of classic, memorable lines, especially those delivered by Salieri. I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I was 18 years old and it made me fall in love with classical music. <br/><br/>Director Milos Forman is truly a wonder, given that he's helmed quite a few films that made my top 25 list - ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Ragtime."" How fitting it should be, then, that my favourite song of all time appears in one of his films, ""Hair."" Coincidence? I think not. The man's a genius, plain and simple. He's also caused me to structure some of my screenplays and novels based on ""Ragtime."" Talk about influential."
"ironhorse_iv","9","4","5","20 August 2016"," Rock me Amadeus! Amadeus is a beautiful musical masterpiece
","Extraordinary! On the page it looked nothing! The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse. And then, suddenly, high above it, beautiful music. A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film."

Most likely this is because they were no doubt impressed by the score which featured masterworks by one of the greatest musical geniuses in all of history. Or, perhaps this was their first exposure to music of this caliber.<br/><br/>But to anyone who knows the real historic truth about Mozart, these raving positive reviews are the equivalent of these uniformed reviewers wearing a t-shirt that says in big bold letters: ""I know absolutely nothing about music history"".<br/><br/>Of course, any complete novice of classical music would be impressed by a totally fictional and insulting movie about Mozart simply because of the music. And the obvious fact, they don't realize that what they are watching is pure fiction, ignorant to that it is revisionist history, and to anyone who knows who Mozart really was, an offensive insult. <br/><br/>In reality it's a film that exploits Mozart's music in order to win over the uninformed, and then proceeds to fill their heads with a mockery of who the man really was. The result is the masses, who know nothing about Mozart, go away impressed by his music but believing a fictional mockery as the truth. It uses his creative works to perpetuate a mockery of the genius who composed them. Sad, really sad."
"spiderdan","1","53","119","7 August 2002"," A terrible waste
","I saw Amadeus at the Cambridge Film festival. I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival. How much was I disappointed, often irritated and by the end I felt thoroughly used and exploited by what I can only describe as a terrible, terrible film. But why? Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition. Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time.<br/><br/>For such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things. First was good music, but this was a taken. It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart. All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good! So I give it 0 points for the score, you want good classical music then buy the CD.  I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance. As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.<br/><br/>You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you want the story of a flawed but fantastic composer then get Shine out on video, you wont be disappointed. If you prefer your musical period drama documentaries full of irritating actors, pretty costumes, tedious storylines and bits of opera then do watch this, and if you would prefer to while away your time for three mind numbingly boring hours then check out the directors cut. Amadeus, you owe me £5 and three hours of my life, I wont forgive you until I get them back. dan"

The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme.

","I know I thought highly of this movie in the past, I remember that our music teacher in school actually recommended to see it. But now that I recently watched it again, I was gravely disappointed by it.<br/><br/>Basically none of the story is historically (the time and circumstances of his death; the relationship between Salieri and Mozart; the relationship between Mozart and his father; the origin of Constanze; Mozart as a drunkard) or musically (most music one hears is clearly recorded using modern instruments; how the conducting is portrayed; how Mozart ""dictates"" the music to Salieri) true, some of the set decoration and costuming was awful (modern pool table in a home in 1791; obvious electrical candles in quite a few scenes; modern fabrics were used in the opera scenes). If one finds the characters as laid out in the script believable (which I don't) one could probably find the acting to be outstanding, but since I don't believe the story (any more), I cannot subscribe to that any more, either.<br/><br/>What remains is the powerful use of some of Mozart's greatest music, for that I agree with Neville Marriner who has supposedly said that he was happy to see this movie built around the music and not vice versa.

","""Amadeus"" is an insulting, juvenile, historically-inaccurate comedy sketch stretched to two and-a-half hours. It does not reveal the true character of Mozart or shed light on his musical brilliance- it does not even try. The movie plays like a practical joke, a humorous hypothetical on what might have been, but almost certainly wasn't.<br/><br/>First, our story is told through the eyes of rival composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who is little more than a narrator/stooge for the audience to laugh at while identifying with the rogue genius of Mozart. This is the movie's first stunt, and it only gets more manipulative from there. We are introduced to Mozart as a skirt-chasing, irreverent, giggling idiot, while of course the men in authority and powdered wigs stand around looking shocked at his behavior. Outrageous...<br/><br/>This is a cheat that director Milos Forman has been using for years: the misunderstood, irresponsible genius who is always bucking the system and stirring up controversy, but whose actions are justified by his sex drive and/or having one woman that loves him. Adultery and a steady girlfriend do not make up for being a jackass, but Forman applied the same formula here as he did in ""Man On The Moon"" and ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt."" It still doesn't work.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart as a giggling manchild- to assure the audience he wasn't as dry or stodgy as we might imagine- backfires completely. He's so over-the-top ridiculous I wound up having less respect for Mozart AFTER the movie than I did before. Of course, the Mozart portrayed in the film has little or nothing to do with the actual man.<br/><br/>Mozart was not- by any account- a childlike fool, nor did he write perfect manuscripts of music already composed in his head. Mozart and Salieri- who might have experienced a natural rivalry- were known to be good friends, and Salieri had no part in Mozart's death from natural causes. But then ""Amadeus"" seems to lose some of its spark without a bad-guy antagonist whose only goal is the destruction of our hero.<br/><br/>Finally, while I can't hold awards against a film, I cannot for the life of me understand why F. Murray Abraham- the film's lead actor- was nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category, and the fact that this film won both Best Picture and Best Director is a scandal. Don't waste your time on ""Amadeus."" Listen to some of Mozart's timeless music and you will know everything about the man there is to know.<br/><br/>GRADE: D"

","Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that ""Amadeus"" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these ""monsters with green eyes"" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...<br/><br/>Once again, ""Amadeus"" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.<br/><br/>Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young."

The use of quite earthy American accents among the gentry of 18th century Europe is also somewhat grating (although this is what may have endeared it to the academy awards)however the real problem is the script.<br/><br/>The script labours the same point of coarse genius versus pious mediocrity over and over. There is a curiously 20th century lack of deference to one's social betters (such as Mozart's wife constantly and annoyingly always referring to him as ""Wolfy"").<br/><br/>But this pales by comparison to the hatchet taken to Salieri. The author has taken the real life rivalry and created a fantasy completely removed from history. Salieri had nothing to do Mozart's requiem or indeed Mozart's death. The true history is actually far more interesting than this fabrication.<br/><br/>Salieri as written here, is a one dimensional villain. One almost expects him to be swirling a moustache.

"MovieAddict2016","10","6","10","13 October 2005"," A brilliantly ambitious, sprawling, and truly epic film
","Few films create such a lasting impact as ""Amadeus."" Although it may not be as well-recognized as some other classics, those ""in the know"" have been privy to one of the great films of the 20th century. Its Director's Cut re-release a few years ago re-established it as a classic, and enticed many new viewers.<br/><br/>Personally, having been subjected to this film years ago, watching the Director's Cut is a delight, because it seems to flow even better now, even with an extra twenty minutes of runtime.<br/><br/>The film begins with the composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) telling his story (and Mozart's) to a priest (Simon Callow). Antonio feels personally responsible for Mozart's early death, and finally - after years of silence - spills his beans.<br/><br/>The flashbacks (intercut with scenes of Salieri reciting the story from memory) show us the infantile and juvenile Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by ""Animal House's"" Tom Hulce) and his domination of musical composure in Vienna, where he was the subject of jealousy from Salieri, whose lifelong dream was to be half as great as Mozart.<br/><br/>The performances are wonderful - Hulce perfectly embodies the Mozart many of us weren't aware existed - the troubled, disrespectful and hyper-active man-child. Today, historians claim Mozart probably suffered from attention disorders like ADD. Whatever the reason for his behavior, Hulce never lets up on the believability.<br/><br/>Even more impressive is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. It is really he who carries the film on his shoulders and is the vital link to Mozart. I personally think it was a brilliant decision by Peter Shaffer (playwrite and scriptwriter) to convey the story through the eyes of another man close to Mozart, rather than Mozart himself. It's far more effective than a simple narrative, which would have detracted from the effortless intrigue of this movie. (Once you start watching, you're hooked - even though it's three hours long on the Director's Cut, it's over in what feels like less than half that long.) Milos Forman has been responsible for some wonderful films throughout his career (other highlights include ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") but in my opinion, from a directorial standpoint, this is probably his strongest. ""Cuckoos' Nest"" may have had deeper themes and drawn greater parallels between characters and events and symbolism, but ""Amadeus"" doesn't need to be complicated, and it isn't. At heart it is the story of a brilliant composer and the man whose jealousy destroyed them both. This should be seen by everyone at least once - because once you see it, you'll come back for seconds."

","AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br/><br/>Sound format: Dolby Digital<br/><br/>Many years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), the aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...<br/><br/>Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys. The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen. Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.<br/><br/>The director's cut runs 180 minutes (the original theatrical version ran 160m) and reinstates various bits and pieces which help to clarify a number of crucial plot developments (the antagonism between Salieri and Mozart's wife is more fully explained, for example). Incredibly, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.<br/><br/>NB. The original version was released theatrically in 35mm and 70mm editions, featuring a 6-track Dolby Stereo soundtrack."

Amadeus can easily be viewed as a tragic-comic essay on the artistic personality in general. It was this focus that made it such a valuable learning experience for me.

","To be blunt, I found AMADEUS to be one of the most Overrated and preposterous bores in all of motion picture history, and that goes back a long way now. It's not very often that I'm this clueless as to the almost universal appeal of a certain highly revered work of cinematic art, but I just couldn't help wondering just what was supposed to be so damned compelling about this very, very lengthy and dramatically vacant exercise in tedium?<br/><br/>For openers, I just couldn't buy Tom (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE) Hulce as ""the"" Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the very moment he first came on screen, groping after an equally miscast Elizabeth Berridge as his fiancée-wife, I knew I was in for a very rough ride; here I was only 20 minutes into this thing and already the leading lovers were utterly irritating ... and with 140 minutes left to go!<br/><br/>Hulce looks like what he is - a 20th Century guy in a 1700's period white wig - and though she's actually over the age of 20, Berridge hardly appears old enough to play anything but his kid sister. Somebody should have told these two to lose their modern accents; Berridge loves to say ""gonna"" (""I'm not gonna marry you"") and she tells someone that ""only an idiot would ask Wolfie to work on that 'stuff'"". Oh well. All the same, I'd imagine that speaking in a proper 1700's dialect would have sounded even more out of date while delivering such silly dialog as this:<br/><br/>MOZART: ""Here, everything goes backwards. People walk backwards and dance backwards and sing backwards and even talk backwards.<br/><br/>GIRL: ""That's stupid"".<br/><br/>MOZART: ""Why? People fart backwards..."" <br/><br/>How idiotic. But this is not limited only to these two bozos; even another character uses the modern expression: ""if you marry him you won't have a pot to p*ss in"". It also seems like the phrase ""kiss my ass"" was very popular back in the days of Mr. Wolfie, too.<br/><br/>Enough about the dialog. There is still one glimmer of hope in all this mess - and that's F. Murray Abraham (who won the Best Actor Oscar) as Antonio Salieri. What very little there is to admire in this movie is solely owed to his interesting performance, and in the character himself. Maestro Salieri's overwhelming envy of his childish colleague's superior talents, and the gradual resentment he feels toward God for leaving him in the dust of mediocrity, is the only saving grace keeping the film from total ruin. It's a pity that this angle of the story was historical fiction, though.<br/><br/>And then there was that giggle... that ever-present, idiotic giggle...<br/><br/>* out of ****"

","With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages. But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.<br/><br/>Winning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.<br/><br/>Of course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his ""rivalry"" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.<br/><br/>What didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Another thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film. Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant. Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.<br/><br/>I may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another. The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while. As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce. Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.<br/><br/>+Abraham<br/><br/>+Music<br/><br/>-Hulce<br/><br/>-Characters lack humanity<br/><br/>-A tad long<br/><br/>5.8/10"

","The highest praise I have for this movie is that the music is good, but of course that is no thanks to the filmmakers. Your 160 minutes (180 for the director's cut) would be better spent listening to Mozart's music alone.<br/><br/>How could I say such things about this Best Picture Oscar winner, this universally acclaimed masterpiece, which has been included among films such as Citizen Kane and the Godfather on numerous ""Bestest-ever-movies-in-the-history-of-the-past"" lists? Well, I also disliked ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (Forman's other vastly overrated dud) so I am no stranger to blasphemy against the film canon.<br/><br/>To be fair, I liked this movie the first time I saw it -- when I was 8 years old. I liked it largely because it was one of the few ""grown-up"" movies I could fully understand at the time. Upon viewing it again a good decade years later, I realized why: the film explicates its themes in such a blatantly obvious manner that it insults the intelligence of ""grown-up"" viewers.<br/><br/>The most flagrant and pervasive example: F. Murray Abraham's (Salieri's) entirely redundant voice-over narration. Tom Hulce's over-the-top performance as an arrogant, childish Mozart, complemented by Abraham's over-the-top sulking and scowling, is more than enough to tell us that Mozart is obnoxious and that Salieri dislikes him. But alas, Salieri must narrate to us his already obvious disdain and shock that this person could be ""God's instrument."" The viewer can certainly also gather from Salieri's exaggerated swooning over Mozart's scores that despite his contempt for Mozart the person, he is still infatuated with his music. Still, we must have this narrated to us as well.<br/><br/>Two-time Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""All the President's Men"") says that what makes a great screenplay (and thus, a great movie) is SUBTEXT  what is happening beneath the surface of the scene, what is conveyed and understood, but not stated. In ""Amadeus,"" there are fleeting moments of subtext, such as Katerina Cavalieri's piano lesson with Salieri, in which it is clear that Salieri is in love with her, and the subsequent scene at the opera, in which it is apparent that she has had an affair with Mozart. But the subtext in these scenes is instantly killed by the ""Spark Notes""-like narration in which Salieri tells us that he loved her, and knew at that moment that Mozart had ""had"" her. And Salieri, is it really necessary, while burning a statue of Jesus on the cross (a heavy-handed enough symbol as it is), to narrate that you are angry with God? Other annoyances abound in ""Amadeus,"" including the miscast Hulce, Jeffrey Jones, and Elizabeth Berridge, their laughable acting not aided by their very American accents. It becomes difficult to believe we are watching 18th century Germans when one actor sounds like a Shakespearean Brit and one sounds like a cowboy.<br/><br/>The movie does boast some strengths aside from Mozart's music: the art direction and costumes are terrific, for instance. Even the theme of pride and jealousy among artists is valid and powerful; if only it were handled with just a touch of subtlety then this could have been the masterpiece it is widely (and wrongly) considered to be."

For example, her distant behavior/bitterness towards Salieri (at the end of the film), her protection of her husband & his well-being, her humanity as a woman, etc. are so much more easily understood in this version. In the original theatrical/D.V.D. release not much was presented about her character; audiences felt that this was due to actress Elizabeth Berridge's shortcomings as a performer, when I feel that it was more of a lack of her character in the screenplay & some unfortunate cuts in the editing process. <br/><br/>Bottom line: This could be considered the ""Stanzi Edition"" as she shines in her supporting role & brings so much more to the film than she ever had before... 9/10"

","It is not a bad movie, certainly not a masterpiece as claimed by most people in this web page either. In total it is mediocre and forgettable. I really prepared to like it. I love this kind of theme: 'the burden bestowed together with gift. By the end you are not sure how to look at a genius mind: a blessing or a curse.' But it turned out to me a major disappointment. I was most deeply let down by the portrait of Mozart. I wouldn't have mind it so much if the movie hasn't kept on pressing the point via the statement of Salieri: the contradiction within Mozart - God's voice from a unworthy man. The movie totally failed itself in this aspect. On one hand Salieri went on and on with how magnificent and brilliant Mozart's music is that my head starts to ache. On the other hand Mozart has shown himself as a funny, sincere, self-confident man, cute and cuddly, with an off-beat laugh, a loyal son, a tender husband, simply an example of morality. It is a mystery that how come he didn't become the most popular man in Vienna. So many other works have done it much better, 'moon and six pence' and 'shine' to name a few, over the dark anti-social side of genius that 'Amadeus' in corporation only offered a very pale and shallow endeavor. Another thing bugged me is the other main character Salieri. He blamed himself to madness and tempted suicide. For what? What EXACTLY had he done to Mozart? True, he has not been a true friend to Mozart. Is that the reason Mozart died? No way. Those little tricks he had applied to harm Mozart, did they succeed? You better be kidding me. From what I can see they either missed miserably or by the unexpected turn of events helped Mozart instead. He hated Mozart and wished him dead, but that didn't make him a murderer. The director overdid the contrast between the two main characters and massed it up. And, the maid, played by the one of the ladies out of the sex and city. What an annoy! She lamenting 'Oh I am scared!' For what! and tears over Mozart's death. Again, for what? When did she grow so emotional over Mozart? What the director was thinking, did he forgot the story? Everybody hates Mozart, right? In conclusion, everything is pretty lame here, plot, direction and acting. Only recommended if you are an opera nut. Otherwise, skip it."

","'Amadeus' is arguably one of the most ambitious films of the 1980s. It presents a popularized account of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart following his arrival in Vienna from Brno, at the age of 17. His reception by his new patron, Emperor Joseph II, disturbs courtier and established composer Antonio Salieri, who becomes consumed with a burning, selfish passion to physically eliminate Mozart, while recognizing the latter's unique musical genius.<br/><br/>Aside from adding considerable interest to an otherwise prosaic script, Salieri's confessional narration that guides the film provides the vehicle for a truly phenomenal performance by actor Frank Murray Abraham. Milos Forman's thorough direction augments Abraham's superb theatrical delivery, and is in turn amplified by the outstanding soundtrack furnished by Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.<br/><br/>Inevitably, most of the remaining protagonists fade miserably in comparison to Abraham, including the overacting Tom Hulce, as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Elizabeth Berridge, as Constanze Mozart -both complete with distinct Yankee and Texan accents respectively. This latter aspect is arguably symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the film, which subscribes to a somewhat Americanized version of W.A. Mozart's character, overstressing the composer's historically unfounded maverick and nonconformist traits. There is also little -if any- historical evidence of any schemes by Salieri against W.A. Mozart. Indeed, the film's commitment to historical accuracy appears to be exhausted at a number of pictorial shots of Vienna and the striking facial resemblance of actor Jeffrey Jones to Emperor Joseph II.<br/><br/>Yet, the film's daring illustration of the many negative sides of Mozart's character, including his artistic arrogance and his self-destructive womanizing, is commendable, as is its achievement to popularize the music of one of the icons of Western musical tradition.

","I re-watched this film recently after many years, and my opinion of it hasn't changed. This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this."

","Amadeus (1984)<br/><br/>A million reviews have been written about this deserving movie--and the big points are good ones. And debatable. <br/><br/>One, the play was better. Maybe. The play couldn't use cinematic tricks for its effects, but the movie really took it all much further in movie terms. It's a movie, not an adapted play.<br/><br/>Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course. <br/><br/>Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.<br/><br/>Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical. And if not as silly as Tom Hulce's interpretation, still a renegade socially and musically.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Yes, a great movie. Who won't like it? Well, people with an aversion for historical dramas might, but even here, it zooms with such crazy, fun, funny energy, I don't know why it wouldn't just suck people in. Eventually though there are short scenes that are basically straight opera, with some continuing story along the sidelines. If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.<br/><br/>There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including ""Hair"" as a kind of precursor and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive ""Goya's Ghosts,"" which has a similar structure to ""Amadeus,"" building a large world around a true rebel artist.)<br/><br/>Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F. Murray Abraham is a wonder as Salieri, young and old). And it is layered with some of the most emphatic and resolved music ever written."

","How awesome is this movie? It's a visual feast for the eyes, a hilarious comedic effort, with the backdrop to one of the most intriguing plots of all time. In that, 'Amadeus' is a very rare film. A film that contains everything that is enjoyable about watching movies, yet is unlike any movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, the website sums it up as ' The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told in flashback mode by Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.' But the story is as much about Mozart (played by Tom Hulce in a career defining performance) as it is about his jealous counterpart, Salieri (A much deserved Best Actor performance by F. Murray Abraham.) The root of his jealously? Mozart's musical talent, which speaks for itself. Salieri can't come to grips as to how this young man, who acts with immense immaturity, has been gifted this extraordinary talent. It's a story every human being should be able to relate to. I mean, who hasn't been envious one time or another? That's what a great film does, takes a richly exotic scenario and applies real world issues to the plot.<br/><br/>See this movie if you haven't, I personally guarantee you will be pleased. I know I was. This film deserved every Oscar it was a given (all 8.)"

","I have seen the original version of ""Amedeus"" 6 times and no doubt, it is and always will be a deservedly crowned masterpiece and Best Picture. While I agree with that 100% , I've always had this feeling that there could or should have been more to it. Not because the original was cut by 20 minutes but because it seemed to have more focus on the absurdity of W. Amedues Mozart himself. <br/><br/>Yes,he's the title character,but the point of view of the story is told by Salieri and it seems,aside from his aged version and the times we see his young self on screen,in the original his story of his disillusionment with God seems too quick. <br/><br/>In this director's version,we find out more than we had before about this. Scenes of him quietly praying but at the same time crying out to God to help him have as great a gift as Mozart.<br/><br/>Every failure and snub he receives in his life,from the arrival of the young genius culminates in his declaring God his enemy and burning the Holy Cross in the fireplace. The new scenes help build it to a better climax on that note. <br/><br/>Along with this the expanded story of when Mozrt's wife secretly visits Salieri to show her husband's work to him,to gain a paid teaching post. This leads to the deleted section of Salieri telling her to ""come back in the evening"" , for illicit purposes. <br/><br/>Once she later arrives and removes her top garment exposing herself,for whatever reason,he decides to instead have her shown out the door. I'm assuming out of his own sense of decency,he decided not to go through with it. It's Mozart he wants to punish ,not her. Even though he has. <br/><br/>Lastly,there's also the funny scenes with Mozart trying to instruct a nervous young girl while her family and dogs make constant noise. It's something that causes him to storm out and feel indignant at having to put up with something like this. It adds only a little to the overall story. <br/><br/>With the film expanded to 3 hours,again,I feel I saw a much more complete storyline,with both Salieri & Mozrt represented equally on screen. ....but whether in it's original form or this version,there's no way I'd ever rate ""Amedeus"" less than 10 stars. <br/><br/>That'd be like telling Mozart his music has ""too many notes"",so...well,there it is. {END}"

","I'm writing this more than anything as a response to the comments about Tom Hulce's accent, the use of English, etc.<br/><br/>1. As was already mentioned by another post, the English is used every time the characters ""should"" be speaking German, and so it was done in the songs as well.<br/><br/>2. As for the accent, I don't see why this is such an issue. The American accent is a dialect of English spoken in North America, granted. But who cares? That doesn't make Mozart sound any less European. With an English accent, I argue that he'd sound no more Austrian. It's well-known that the characters in this movie, although all speaking German, should represent a huge variety of dialects and accents, not least of which would be Salieri's, who, lest we forget, was an Italian.<br/><br/>Other than that, I think the film is outstanding.

"mircea85","4","12","25","10 July 2005"," Mediocrity as a subject as well as the resulting movie
","Mediocrity is not only the topic of this movie but also the movie itself. Is is mediocre to say least. One would expect more out of a movie called Amadeus. The correlation with Mozart is totally out of place. There is nothing in this movie about nobility, greatness, extraordinary people or anything else among the lines of higher understanding or one self's quest for betterness.<br/><br/>The characters behave totally out of place. The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the ""american style"" (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).<br/><br/>The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for ""desire gratification"". This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life {and by doing so destroying character consistency}, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality. One example is when ""the great Mozart"" has to submit his work to be evaluated by a committee despite the fact his works is great, he is intimate (i.e. close friends) with the emperor and the emperor could just appoint him. Like please, get real, in life people DO get appointed even when their work sucks just because they have access to the decision factors. As it must've become obvious by now, I am highly resentful of this type of ""your situation is better than you think and you should accept it as it is the same even for the most noble"".<br/><br/>Art should propose a message and argue its validity, not try to impose it by all sorts of subliminal affirmations.<br/><br/>Acting is terrible. Like no one really expects the people playing ballet on the scene truly be ballet-players. But they SHOULD move in at least a decent amount of sync. And when the piano is played, again, some correlation between the melody and the motion of the hands over the keys is expected.<br/><br/>That being said, this is perhaps one of the best movies for its purposes. The story is told trough the eyes of the mediocre court-composer Antonio Salieri. The troubles of the characters are the troubles of the average individual of the 21st century (like bad credit, alcohol, bureaucracy, father, mother-in-law, etc.). What disappoints me about the movie is that these issues are not treated from a higher-perspective like one would expect but instead they are settled within the scope and understanding of the average individual."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","6","7 March 2010"," Absolutely brilliant!- funny, charming and touching, a masterpiece!
","I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Several comments in reply:<br/><br/>1) ""Why opera in English?"" - Actually, it's pretty clever how they handle this... In the movie the Italian operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Salieri's Axur) are sung in Italian, but only the German operas (Abduction, Magic Flute and the parody-vaudeville) are in English. My supposition is that we assume that everyone in the movie is speaking German, but we hear it as English, except when they speak in Italian or some other language. It's like having a selective Babel-Fish (read Douglas Adams if that one is lost on you).<br/><br/>2) ""Why would they refer to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as Wolfie?"" Believe it, because they did. Constanza refers to Mozart numerous times in her letters as ""Wolferl"" which could translate to English as ""Wolfie""... also believe me that she (and others) had names for him that would cause Buddy Hackett to blush. The letters of the Mozart family (Wolferl, his sister ""Nannerl"", and papa and mama Mozart) are full of scatalogical references and sexual humor that still seems pretty crude in our day and age. <br/><br/>3) Salieri. Yes, he is quite maligned. I think everyone knows that. He was one of the most famous composers in Europe and gave lessons in vocal composition to Beethoven, among others. He even commanded one of the artillery batteries in the premiere of Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory"". However, some of Beethoven's conversion books survive where Beethoven's nephew Karl writes that Salieri has gone mad and claims that he murdered Mozart. It's not true, of course, but could very well have been the product of an enfeebled mind."

","Visually, the movie is pretty, and F. Murray Abrahamson's performance as Salieri is what keeps the movie going.

Arguably it is natural for Hollywood to take artistic license and not try to be too realistic, but in this case they overdid it.<br/><br/>For one thing, Mozart wasn't a magician who could create beautiful music without effort; indeed his music was the result of hard work. Also, the movie implies that Salieri might have murdered Mozart overnight while his wife and child were away; another reviewer had noted that Mozart died in the evening so that scenario is pure fiction. Salieri might have hated Mozart, but it is unlikely he had the opportunity or willingness to resort to murder.<br/><br/>This could have been a better movie if they tried to be more realistic."

"Hancock_the_Superb","5","8","16","21 July 2008"," Exquisitely photographed, but empty and often dull
","Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) was born with the love of and desire to create music. He is the Court Composer for Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and lives a relatively contented life, even if his music is less-than-brilliant. But when Salieri encounters Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), the young, arrogant, vulgar - and brilliant - composer, he realizes just how feeble his attempts at music are. Salieri denounces God and declares a campaign of destruction against Mozart; he is enraptured by Mozart's music while hating the man, and will go to seemingly any length to destroy him.<br/><br/>Based on Peter Schafer's play, Amadeus should be a great film. It has an intriguing story, a marvelous production design, full of glittering and gorgeous period detail, a talented director in Milos Foreman, and a score by Mozart - which, if nothing else, should provide some amount of enjoyment. So what is it about Amadeus that doesn't work? A combination of factors, from a bizarre cast to a weak screenplay with a startling lack of authenticity to an overall feeling of staginess that doesn't translate well to film.<br/><br/>Let's start first with the screenplay. I am unfamiliar with Schafer's play, so I will not bother comparing his screenplay to the stage script. But the screenplay falls prey to something fatal: anachronism. The dialogue and characters are extremely modern to point of being post-modern, only creating an air of inauthenticity which strikes a false note from the get-go. This is a legitimate approach to a subject - it worked well enough in A Man for All Seasons and Becket - and, to be fair, using arcane period language carries its own perils. However, it takes an accomplished writer to pull it off, and if Schaffer is such a writer he doesn't evidence it here. The movie isn't convincing for a second as a period piece set in 18th Century Austria. As with The Lion in Winter, we lose track of the historical context in order to keep up with the witty and anachronistically self-aware dialogue, and the film suffers greatly for it.<br/><br/>The cast is another bizarre aspect. The casting of profoundly American actors in virtually every role produces a disconcerting effect which only exacerbates the problems of script and character. F. Murray Abraham is good as Salieri, but his performance is subtle and understated to the point of being dull. It would have been interesting to see how the original Salieri, Paul Scofield, tackled the role; he was an actor who can be understated without boring the audience. Tom Hulce is an odd choice as Mozart, but Hulce actually handles the part very well, and is at least fun to watch. Elizabeth Berridge on the other hand is absolutely dreadful and out-of-place as Mozart's wife, with a distracting New York accent. Jeffrey Jones and Simon Callow (the original Mozart) are quite good in smaller roles, but they don't have a lot of time to register. The rest of the cast is made up of talented actors - Christine Ebersole, Roy Dotrice, Charles Kay, Barbara Bryne, Cynthia Nixon - with virtually nothing to do. <br/><br/>Most of Amadeus's quality comes from its admittedly lavish production values, but when coupled with the ""modern"" dialogue and characters and the bizarre cast, they only add another discordant note to the film. The story is rather interesting - the idea of Salieri as a man who can recognize musical genius while lacking all but the most remedial talent - but it's overwhelmed by a plethora of banal plot ideas and character development and trite symbolism (reaching its nadir when Salieri burns a crucifix in protest of God's favoring Mozart), as well as horrendous pacing. Too much time is spent watching operas and musical performances by Mozart and Salieri. Not a bad idea sparingly - we ARE watching a film about a composer - but used repeatedly, they only slow the film's pace to a painful, deadening crawl. At 160 minutes, such sloth is fatal. Oh, the music is brilliant, but we've always known Mozart was a talented composer; we didn't need this film to tell us that.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, Amadeus is a dull if nice-looking slog. To answer the Emperor's question: ""Is it modern?"" The answer is yes, and it's very much to the film's detriment. ""Though the libretto was written by accomplished artists, the plot is that of a third-rate operetta"" (Phillip Ziegler). <br/><br/>5/10"

It is everything I remember about it.<br/><br/>First the good...<br/><br/>The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. ""Elvira Madigan"", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became ""the Elvira Madigan theme"".<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.<br/><br/>Now for the bad...<br/><br/>The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. The<br/><br/>
Mozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life.<br/><br/>Salieri's portrayal as a mediocre composer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.<br/><br/>Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for ""the spa"" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle.<br/><br/>Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious ""man in gray"" who intended to pass the work off as his own.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 8 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth."

I'm not against American culture per se (far from it) but the Americanisation of history in films (i.e. which gives the impression that many significant figures from the past grew up somewhere near Disneyland) is a terrible thing - it whitewashes cultural diversity & gives a totally distorted view of the world as it was, and still is. This cannot be overlooked. If an Austrian actor was chosen for the part (not Arnie) the film probably would have made less money so I guess that wasn't an option? Better to cast someone who appeared in ""Animal House""? Instead of a ""Directors' cut"" how about a ""Realistic cut""?

","""Amadeus"" is one artist's approach to solving the many mysteries of young Mozart's life, including the now-mythologized circumstances surrounding his early death at the age of thirty-five. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the film was more of a character study on Salieri, a Composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The film opens with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). ""Amadeus"" takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri's words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that the accompanying music is phenomenal. Mozart' compositions are essential and forefront enough throughout the entirety of the film to be considered a character. The costume design, period production, mise en scene, etc. was all exceptional. However, I could hardly watch the film because of Mozart's character. Especially his laugh. To make this worse was the fact that this was all in the director/writer's imagination. Yes, this is historical fiction. And I understand that not all facts portrayed in the film need to be historically accurate. However, although this has been perfectly fine for me in other films, in this film, it simply did not work. I really wanted to like this film, I did. But I could not. I had to force myself to watch most of the scenes, saved purely by beautiful costumes and melodious compositions. I found myself hating Mozart, but why? I should rather hate the Mozart this film has created! <br/><br/>As I said, thankfully this was more Salieri's than Mozart's plot, and Salieri, although far from lovable, was a watchable and complex character. Although he idolizes Mozart's genius, he hates his character, and struggles with this up to the very last moment. And, really, that is precisely how I felt."

I think Wolfie would have loved it too. F. Murray Abraham's performance is perfect, I try to find one scene where he's not so good, and there's none. Those scenes where he recalls his history with Mozart to the priest is especially well done. Salieri adores Mozart's music genuinely and resents his god given talent bitterly. Abraham just waves through the admiration, jealousy, bitterness, pain, self-loathe, cynicism and borderline insanity seamlessly."

","The 1980s was unique in that twice within two years the star of a three hour historical film (playing the lead historical male character) won the Academy Award for best actor in such a picture. Normally biographical films are considered box office poison, even the superior ones like Daryl Zanuck's ""Wilson"" in 1944. But both ""Gandhi"" (1982) and ""Amadeus"" (1984) were box office successes, culminating in the above mentioned Oscars for Ben Kingsley in the former and F. Murray Abraham in the latter. Both deserved the award for a change - both did fantastic jobs in bringing Mohandas Gandhi and Antonio Salieri to life. By the way, if Kingsley seems to have had better roles since then in films than Abraham, the latter has had a far more interesting career on Broadway in a number of plays such as ""Angels in America"".<br/><br/>Based on Peter Shaffer's dramatic hit play, ""Amadeus"" is a study of frustration and jealousy in art - here in the world of 18th Century music. In 1785 the leading composer in the court of Emperor Joseph II of Austria (Jeffey Jones) is Antonio Salieri. He is well regarded by the Emperor and the other leading musical figures in the court. In comparison to them Salieri really merits this high regard. But along comes a young, fun-loving, and unpolished figure named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), or ""Wolfie"" to his wife Costanza (Elizabeth Berridge). Salieri is always the proper courtier - he came from a poverty background in Italy, and really worked hard at both his music (which he hoped pleased God and through God man) and his diplomatic skills until he reached his position. He first comes upon Mozart fooling around with Costanza in a break before a concert he is going to give. The unpolished bumpkin does not strike Salieri as a threat. But then he hears his music, and Salieri's self-esteem begins to crumble a bit.<br/><br/>He tries to put it out of his mind, sensing that Mozart is his own worst enemy due to his unpolished manner. But when Costanza brings him some of the music her husband has worked on, Salieri (whose knowledge of music is really high) realizes it is the work of a genius. Sure enough, despite roughing the court's feathers, Mozart is slowly gaining massive public and court support. Occasionally there is a sticking point. When some jealous rivals (slightly goaded by Salieri) argue against the length of one of his operas, Mozart teaches them a lesson by having the orchestra not play the music during a ballet between acts. Emperor Joseph is fascinated by this odd idea and asks why no music is being played. Mozart explains that the others think there is too much music. The Emperor (in my favorite piece of dialog - which appears to be true) suggests maybe they were correct. Mozart shows the Emperor the music, and asks what notes to take out. Joseph II can't give any answer to that one.<br/><br/>The effect of Mozart's rise is to make Salieri feel that God tricked him in their deal - he would serve God by making beautiful music. But this bumpkin makes far better music. Bitter he watches for any opportunity to undercut his rival. Then Mozart's estranged father Leopold (Roy Doltrice) dies, and Salieri sees that this has an emotional effect on Wolfgang. Building on the latter's guilt, Salieri tries to send him into a decline. And soon Mozart's health begins to decline. He has been composing a requiem, and Salieri intends (pretending to befriend the dying Mozart) to steal it and claim it as his own work. I'll leave the outcome of that to the readers when they see the film.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is told in flashback, with Salieri having attempted suicide about 1819 (a few years before his death), and recovering in a mental institution. He has also made a statement that he poisoned Mozart. This issue is not really settled in the film, and historically it is still debated with most musicologists thinking Salieri was hallucinating. Abraham's performance is wonderful, as he slowly comes to realize he has become the symbol of the mediocrity we mostly fall into. Hulce shows the bumptious reality of pure genius in Mozart, and how fragile it all was. Berridge is fine as the loyal Constanza, as is Jones as the rather good natured but fatuous Emperor, and (in his few scenes) Doltrice as the disappointed Leopold.<br/><br/>The historical Salieri was not the equal of the big three of Vienna in the 1780s to 1809 (besides Mozart, Beethoven, and Joseph Haydn), but he was respected, and even gave musical lessons to Beethoven in this period. His serious music will never quite be accepted by the public after the big three, but both the play and the movie reopened interest in him - his work is beginning to reappear in some concert halls."

","Although filled with rather tedious scenes and occasionally lackluster attempts of humor, this is definitely one of the most remarkable movies in terms of drawing its audiences into the realm of the protagonists. This achievement is primarily brought by the carefully selected background music connects perfectly with the movies from scene to scene, but most importantly, all the background music are Mozart's compositions, and through this movie we celebrate Mozart as a great composer who can transfer his feelings not by language, but by music. And it is a guarantee that by the end of the movie, you will be so completely absorbed into this movie that you will forget to take the DVD out until the cast list is over. Unlike other movies, Amadeus requires the utmost attention to every line, every detail of the movie, otherwise you will be lost. For the same reason, you may actually appreciate watching this movie a lot more after the first viewing."

","Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.<br/><br/>Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, ""Mozart and Salieri,"" and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.<br/><br/>It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this ""unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as ""an infectious giddy"" and ""like metal scraping glass."" Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words ""Leck mich im Arsch"" and ""Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber"" as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.<br/><br/>Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score  mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century."
"philip_vanderveken","9","4","7","11 January 2005"," I hate costume dramas, but not this one.
","I've always hated costume dramas, especially when the story is situated in 18th century Austria or Germany. There is just too much gold foil, too much ugly wigs and pompous costumes, too much over the top decors, just too much of everything that I detest.<br/><br/>Big was my surprise when I saw ""Amadeus"". For the first time I wasn't trying to switch channels as soon as possible. From the first minute on it had my attention and never let me go, not even after the movie was finished. What I liked most was the co-operation between the music and the images. It all added to the drama. If a modern composer had written the music for some parts of the movie, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as great as it was now. I've never been a huge fan of classical music, but I sure can appreciate it from time to time. And there can be no doubt about how good the music in this movie is of course. It's Mozart, what more do you need? If you can't appreciate this music at all, than I'm afraid there is something wrong with your education. There is more in life than screaming guitars or techno beats.<br/><br/>So for me the big star in this movie was the music, but I have to say that I also liked the way the story was told. I liked the flashbacks, telling the story from Salieri's point of view, the old and bitter man who now lives in an insane asylum, completely forgotten and still in Mozart's shadow. He explains to a priest what exactly had happened and why he always wanted to murder Mozart. I don't really know if all this is historically accurate, but I don't have any doubts about the fact that this is good cinema. <br/><br/>Overall the movie was great, but sometimes there were a few details that bothered me. My feelings about the costumes, the wigs and typical architecture you already know, but there were also other things. Mozart's giggle for instance. It annoyed me enormously. I understand that it shows that this man was still very immature from time to time, that he sometimes still acted like a child, but still... Nevertheless I have to admit that this is a wonderful movie and despite some minor flaws it was almost perfect. I give it a 9/10."
"igor-28","10","4","7","6 January 2005"," Wrong Profession
","The story of Salieri is classic. The guy just chose the wrong profession. He should have become a music critic, not a musician. He wants to compose to the glory of God, but fails, simply because he is not talented enough. On the other side he has the gift to see the astonishing talent and genius of Mozarts music. Thats what makes Salieri a unique character in recent film history. The best critic ever seen on screen in a leading role. Besides that, Mozart is not the leading character in this movie. We see Mozart from the eyes of an admirer. Thats why we get a totally wrong impression from the life and work of this musical genius. The ultimate climax of the movie, the requiem scene in Mozarts flat shows the melting of two characters into one. Salieri becomes Mozart for a night. The synthesis of criticism and creativity."

","""Amadeus"" cleaned up on Oscar Night, 1985, and in its time was as much an event as a film. It even spawned a #1 worldwide hit, the silly but infectious ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Then the movie kind of disappeared. You didn't hear about it much when people discussed great cinema, even from the 1980s. The actors, all hailed when the film came out, seemed to slip back into relative obscurity, except for Cynthia Nixon, the future ""Sex And The City"" girl unrecognizable here as an innocent housemaid. Maybe that's why director Milos Forman and the film's producers decided on releasing a special Director's Cut when it was time to make a DVD.<br/><br/>The result, as Salieri might have put it, is breathtaking. The film breathes with new life, shaking whatever period-film shackles held it back in 1984. We see Mozart struggling to make himself an instructor for rich, untalented girls; enjoy with the common people of Austria a rousing farce of ""Don Giovanni;"" and finally get a satisfying reason for one of the original film's few problems: Why Mozart's wife Constanze angrily sends Salieri away from her husband's deathbed. The end result: What was great before is perfection now.<br/><br/>Its brilliance is not in its costumes, its set design, its bravura performances or crafty plot. It's not even the music, though classical-music snobs I encountered claimed that was the only thing in the movie worth noticing, though in its hacked-up state it was more ""Hooked On Mozart"" than anything truly edifying. No, what's great about ""Amadeus,"" what makes it rise to the utter top, is how all these brilliant elements are brought together in a way that carries the viewer with it from beginning to end. Even if you don't get it all the first time you see it, your appetite will be stoked enough for you to wish to see it again, and that's where the film really makes it mark.<br/><br/>Like other landmark movies, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" and ""Jaws,"" ""Amadeus"" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard, the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.<br/><br/>Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constanze, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.<br/><br/>That's a good way to describe ""Amadeus,"" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.<br/><br/>Is this a film about the folly of seeing a religious design in the patterns of life, in thinking some divine being guides all and decides who is great and who is not? Some would say so. Others might incline to Salieri's own belief, that God is a being not of mercy but of caprice, striving to undo those who strive to be better than He intends. Finally, there is the idea, which I go with, that Salieri's great loss was not in being there when Mozart came to Vienna but to be so choked with jealousy as to not help him, despite the many opportunities to do so, and to suffer the consequences of seeing Mozart's posthumous reputation rise to greater heights while his own music ""grows fainter."" The brilliance of that last scene, of Salieri helping Mozart write the Requiem, is realizing that with a different, more positive and truly pious outlook, Salieri could have been Mozart's champion, and shared some of his boundless fame.<br/><br/>Of course, this is all fiction. Salieri didn't drive Mozart to his death. Ironically, he was more a devoted servant of greatness, as history records him being the chief teacher of the one composer whose reputation arguably eclipses even Mozart's, Ludwig van Beethoven.<br/><br/>But screenwriter Peter Shaffer doesn't let this get in the way of a great story, and so we have a great movie, and Salieri, a measure of notoriety his own music never brought."

"HSauer","9","4","7","18 November 1999"," Flawed, but who cares?
","This powerful narrative of Mozart's adult career in Vienna - largely devoted to his operatic work, as befits a theatrical event - runs about 30 minutes longer than it might have, and has the power to put attentive viewers to sleep, or into a sort of hypnotic funk.  Mozart's last days are stretched out inordinately.  Nevertheless, this film has depth, humor, and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll ever hear.  The historical facts are inseparable from the fantasy that forms the basis of the plot, so beware of citing Amadeus as an authority on the lives of Mozart & Salieri.  Mozart was not so unworldly in real life, nor was Salieri so obsessed with his colleague, at least while both were alive.  Mozart's music was very popular throughout Europe, though he didn't earn as much money from his compositions as he deserved.  While Mozart didn't die entirely forsaken, as the movie implies, he was a victim of bad health exacerbated by overwork.  Consider that modern ""recording artists"" like Michael Jackson, et. al. release a dozen new compositions every 4 or 5 years, while Mozart composed two full-length operas and the bulk of a Requiem mass, among other things - several hours of classic music - in a few months, while he was dying.  Anyway, about the movie - see it and fall in love with Mozart's music!"
"MartinHafer","7","7","15","11 March 2012"," Grrr...the history teacher within cannot allow me to completely enjoy this film.
","Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as ""Pocahontas"") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While ""Amadeus"" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in ""Amadeus"", facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.<br/><br/>Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F. Murray Abraham is great as the conniving Salieri--even though he's very fictional. Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom. Without this laugh, he would have been MUCH better.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they have just created a story about FICTIONAL characters instead of fictionalizing real peoples' lives? If this had been done, the film would have been exceptional in every way. As it is, it's a severe irritant to anyone wanting to know about the real life characters portrayed so badly in this film. And that laugh...that HORRIBLE laugh has got to go!"
"stefanbe","10","5","10","5 July 2007"," A treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music.
","Without music, would life have as much meaning? Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces. One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time. Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.<br/><br/>Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.<br/><br/>The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart."

Saleri was the court composer for Emperor Joseph of Austria during the Renaissance. He is at the top of his game and thanks God for all that he has been given. Emperor Joseph hears about Mozart (Tom Hulce), a musical prodigy that composed and wrote his own operas as young as four years of age. When Mozart comes to Austria to give a private concert, he mocks and completely outshows Saleri. After this we see Saleri sink into depression, enflamed with rage at God, and wanting to kill Mozart to reclaim his glory as the emperor's favorite.<br/><br/>During the story we see beautiful operas and plays written and composed by Saleri and Mozart. The visual effects and the sound are absolutely stunning. The pieces that are played just add to the greatness and make it irrestible to look away or take in the music.<br/><br/>Mozart was directed by Milos Forman who directed the Oscar winner One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and later to go on to The People Vs. Larry Flynt, two Oscar wins and one nomination for Best Director. What Forman didn't realize was that he was going to peak Abraham and Hulce's careers, thus putting them out of good work that they absoluetely deserve. Both actors were nominated for Best Actor in 1984, and low and behold Abraham won. Abraham was forced to work in silly action flicks during the 90's including Survivng The Game and Star Trek: Insurrection, and a small role in Finding Forrester. Tom Hulce's career was eradicated. Hulce appeared in nothing major to this date, and remember he was nominated for Best Actor, and by the way he is very talented."

","I don't understand how people get off criticizing the film. It is practically flawless. The acting was incredible, and delivered incredible scenes. Mozart on his deathbead dictating music to Salieri is the best moment I have watched in any movie, period. I was awestruck. Anyone who speaks negatively about Amadeus is just trying to get people riled up, and should best be ignored.<br/><br/>Brilliant."

","I saw the Broadway play years back, with F. Murray Abraham playing Salieri. It was nothing less than spellbinding. Afterwards, I went to see the movie. I was prepared to be disappointed, but the movie was just as compelling, just as engaging as watching it on stage. Aside from the obvious accolades for stunning costumes and, of course, the music, what makes this movie so wonderful is the amazing acting. There are scenes that carry more acting skill in a couple minutes then many movies have in total.<br/><br/>

","Amadeus is my favorite movie of all time. I spent much time deliberating this after my dad declared that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was his favorite movie of all time. I love this movie because I love music more than anything, except for books. The music in this film is the most magnificent ever written and if ""The Marriage of Figaro"" doesn't make you cry than another piece surely will. The acting is simply phenomenal. Tom Hulce is amazing as Mozart and every other performance he does is shaped by this one. I even love the laugh. Still, the best performance is F. Murray Abraham's with his ability to go from madness to utter lucidity in one line. The costumes are amazing and some day if I can I want to design my house like the apartment of the Mozarts. A perfect story, even with the historical inaccuracies, and my pick for the best movie ever made!"
"ljp-2","10","3","5","3 March 2000"," One of my all-time favorite films
","There are so many things to say about this film that I could never get them all in! Most of them have been said by other reviewers anyway.<br/><br/>I saw ""Amadeus"" in a theater when it first came out, applauded wildly when it won I don't know how many Academy Awards, and have enjoyed it any number of times on video since then.  Peter Schaffer brilliantly adapted his play, which became even more dramatic and human onscreen. The story is moving and profound, and the performances wonderful.  F. Murray Abraham was truly brilliant as the tormented mediocrity Salieri.  So was Tom Hulce as the callow genius Mozart.  Not too-often mentioned is Roy Dotrice as Papa Mozart; he was great, as was Jeffrey Jones in a slyly funny performance as the officious but empty-headed Emperor. I was delighted by the fact that the film avoided the stuffiness so often associated with period drama.  I will even confess that I giggle just as insanely as Amadeus every time Salieri calls Mozart ""The Creature""!  The scene where Salieri takes dictation from Mozart and we see artistic creation happening must be one of the greatest ever put on screen. I hope everyone takes the opportunity to see this wonderful film on video. <br/><br/>
OK, I do have some more serious stuff to say.  As a budding screenwriter myself, I was impressed by the writer's attention to depth of character, and subtle, interlocking themes.  As a student of cultural history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across onscreen.  Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation).  When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas.  And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri.  And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway).  Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity ""Shakespeare in Love"", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar!  There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and cliches about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see ""Amadeus"" instead!"

","I wasn't sure whether I would like this film when I was about to see it but after just ten minutes I was engrossed. The life of Mozart was very interesting but what made the film so good was that the film took the perspective of someone who loved Mozart's work but hated him at the same time. This is what makes it so fascinating. The costume design was magnificent along with the directing and acting, all together it was a great movie but it didn't have the sting that I look for in movies. For instance I felt Psycho had everything with that sting but Amadeus had everything but lacked that sting. Maybe others will feel that this film is one of their favourites but despite how good I think it is I can't place it in my top 20."

They start showing the childhood of the person portrayed, after that how he/she started to make success or to have prominence, then his/her marriage, the children and finally the very sad death- if it doesn't show the person dying, it shows some subtitles saying what happened. Of course there are some exceptions, as ""Hilary and Jackie"" (that is great, even following this formula) and this masterpiece, ""Amadeus"", that tells by flashback the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>Milos Forman is a great director, and also proved that with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Valmont"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" (also a biography). Instead of showing a light, sweet, depressing story, he decided to make a disturbing film, with some suspense and wonderful visually.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri is a musician who is not very recognized and for that he envies Mozart, showed as a very weird man, but also with a very recognized talent. Salieri can't stand this situation and he will do anything to get this over. With this simple storyline, the film tells a important story, about envy and ambition, both present in our world. Forman's aim was just to focus on this situation. So, yes, he may have committed some historycal mistakes, but it doesn't matter. With a great screenplay, great cast, wonderful costumes, music and scenery, he did a superb film, winning 9 worthy Oscars.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is a must-see, even if you don't like classical music."
"requiem1896","10","3","5","10 February 2000"," A brilliantly done depiction of the life of a great composer
","Amadeus is one of Milos Foreman's masterpieces.  It is the story of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The movie is visually stunning.  As a costume drama it is very accurate to Vienna during the time of Mozart's life.  It has a rather questionable ending (for the purpose of historical accuracy) and leans toward the belief that Mozart was slowly being poisoned to death. However the movie does not claim to be a biography so it cannot be marked because of this.  I gave this movie a 10 because it is so well put together. Everything from costume to set design to cinematography, editing, and directing is astounding.  The acting is also decent to great.  This movie is definitely one of the best of the 1980's.  It is a must see for any music fan as well as any fan of the great historical Dramas of Hollywood."

","One of the best films ever made, from the actors to the costumes, to the lighting. To do this film from Salieri's viewpoint was an excellent choice. The soundtrack is excellent, and if you're not a fan of classical music, watching this movie and being able to understand Mozart and what a genius he truly was, you will begin to appreciate classical music, or at least his. Today's artists get paid millions for singing songs that most of them don't even write, yet Mozart composed more than 600 pieces of music in his short 35 years of life, probably earning less than what he was worth. A great movie that never gets dull or boring, I recommend it highly!"
"StoryCharts","1","9","23","23 July 2013"," Jealousy can destroy a career, but not divine talent
","Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world.<br/><br/>The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career.<br/><br/>The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.<br/><br/>My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca"
"alexandermangoldt","7","4","8","12 April 2006"," The mediocre and the genius!
","A rip-roaring film about the problems that occur when you have a passion but not the talent to create outstanding work in the area of your passion. On the one hand, there is Salieri, a man whose entire life is devoted to music and who can't think of anything else 24/7, but who lacks the genius it takes to be remembered for his work by people two hundred years from now. And then, Mozart: a childish, immature kid who composes the greatest operas ever with the utmost easiness and who knows that he is a genius and therefore despises all the musicians and composers that are beneath him. I feel with Salieri. He is not an unsympathetic character at all, I understood most of his actions and I truly understand why he is envious of Mozart. After all, he is right: What is the point in working your life out in order to create something that will be forgotten the minute you die or even before. What is the point of striving for some kind of recognition, if, no matter what you do, there are at least a thousand people who know how to do it better? If you think of all the works of art throughout the centuries then there is probably just a handful of works that are worth being mentioned. Think of all the people who devoted their entire life to art but who never managed to amuse anyone but contemporary society. It's a shame, isn't it. Nowadays art has become an industry: We are confronted with more and more works of art, but which of these works can truly be called a stroke of genius! Very few, I believe!"

It's Mozart! I liked the way the music was literally being played in the head of the actors, reflecting their deep emotions. Just pure grandeur. F.

","This is a spectacular film showcasing the brief life of one of the world's most renowned musical genius's;""Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" (Tom Hulce). The story is told in flashback by one of the emperor's musical directors; Antonio Salieri (played to perfection by F.Murray Abraham). The film opens with Salieri trying to commit suicide and is quickly transported to an insane asylum. Here he starts to unburden his innermost resentments and jealousy's to a young priest who is visiting him one day. He gives the viewer such an insight into his recollection of the past; on how he first met Mozart and the contempt he had for him. Mozart was nothing more than a mere child in an adult bodyhe was reckless, vulgar and childish, but the genius of the boy was inescapable.<br/><br/>The entire production and acting were outstanding, an astonishing 8 academy awards were given to this film. The musical score by Neville Marriner gave the final touches to an inspirational, thought provoking epic. If you don't care for classical music or period pieces you will no doubt dismiss this film from your 'must see' list, but I do recommend everyone see it, regardless of preconceived opinions.

Hulce never reveals to us the intelligence beneath the mask of silliness.  Great artists may sometimes be silly or half-crazy, but none of them are such complete morons.

"bencsik-laszlo91","10","2","3","31 December 2015"," ""A Tale Of Obsession""
","Before Amadeus, i haven't seen a single movie from Milos Forman, but now i'm convinced that i need to catch with his previous works. If you're responsive to personal tragedies, then this movie will leave an impression on you.<br/><br/>What's the true brilliance of Amadeus? There was no battle, duel, or any kind of marvelous chase, but some scenes radiated more energy and tension than the final battle of Avatar. This is where you witness the directing skills of Mr. Forman. He was able to create epic scenes with the simplest tools. For example, the scene where Salieri reads Mozart's compositions occupies a prominent place in the hall of extraordinary movie moments.<br/><br/>Every character was prepared with meticulous care, even the seemingly insignificant imperial counselors formed separable individuals. A simple word or a tiny gesture was completely enough to figure out their personality. Portrayal of the emperor was another great implementation. He always wanted to appear educated and smart, but he couldn't even make a single statement without his crew"". Tom Hulce's Mozart was clearly a new approach. It helped to build up the story, and served as a perfect symbol of divine injustice. However, everyone's performance was dwarfed by F. Murray Abraham. I've never seen anyone who is capable of expressing amazement and hatred at the same time. He was balancing on this imaginable thin line through his facial expressions so well. Not a single word was necessary to see inside his head and understand his feelings. A very complex and well-built character with a sad and unfair destiny. <br/><br/>Each concert ensures opportunities for the music to prevail and presents the real beauty of classical music. During these shows you can actually feel energy that flows through your body. These passionate composers are in love with music, and this obsession is a curse and a gift at the same time. However, the music was just the frame that ensured a breeding ground for the conflict to unfold. Forman could have presented a rivalry between two carpenter, and it would have made sense too. <br/><br/>Those who keep complaining about the historical inaccuracy didn't get the point. Amadeus's goal is not to be a tribute to Mozart, but to be a tribute to the people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time"". You can work your ass off, but at a certain level, work can't beat talent. Salieri was clearly the Patron Saint of Mediocrity"". During a lifetime everyone feels at least once what it feels like to be mediocre (at something where you want to be the best), and Salieri's personal tragedy is a base that people can identify with. However, talent can't stand on it's own. We witness that total lack of respect always leads to self destruction. Mozart's passion for music was visible, but humility can't be replaced by talent. Talent vs. Commitment. Mozart had, what was missing from Salieri, and Salieri had what was missing from Mozart. The perfect combination would be the mix of these two, but the world doesn't work like this.<br/><br/>At some points, it settled down a little bit, but it only lasted a few minutes, which is nothing compared to the length of the movie. It's definitely up there on my top movies list. Even those can appreciate Amadeus, who don't consider themselves a classical music fan."

"sharky_55","10","2","3","22 November 2015"," It is miraculous.
","Amadeus, or Loved by God. We view this figure through the historical lens of an ageing and seemingly senile Antonio Salieri, but I am struck by how clearly his memory haunts him, however accurate his representation of Mozart may be. In reality, Mozart was not some genius whose notes came to him as easy as breathing did, but that is how Salieri remembers it. We see how beautifully his recount flows in the editing; how these L cuts create such magnificent sound-bridges which link each period of Salieri's fall and Mozart's rise like a symphony. A crumpled letter from the angry Leopold transitions into the sound scattering a flock of deer as the Emperor proposes his niece as a pupil. Caterina Cavalieri is one minute a student of Salieri, the next inexplicably the star of Mozart's Seraglio, another cruel blow. And in the most evocative scene of them all, where a disbelieving Salieri inspects Mozart's original works, and each turn of the page unveils another masterpiece, and both Salieri's are trapped in ecstasy. F. Murray Abraham's dual roles are masterful; in one he is silent, so caught up in the majesty of these ink-strokes on the page as he trembles, and in the elderly voice-over, recalling the discovery crystal clear, and we know how wrapped up he still is after all these years in conflict, in admiration, in respect, in bitterness and unbearable envy at being passed over by God. See the contempt as the father hums along to the recognisable strings of Mozart's Serenade No. 13. I must admit I too can only recognise one of the three, and so there is a little bit of truth in this dramatisation. <br/><br/>Who does God choose? Not some respectable, esteemed genius but a rather crude and vulgar child playing games through the halls. The most iconic part of Hulce's performance is of course the peals of his high- pitched feverish laughter which seem to punctuate the guise of each formal setting that he enters. Some would say it is out of place. I would say that it is highly appropriate for Salieri's tales; the laughter becomes infuriating, and each instance of it only further confirms his anguish and disbelief that such a crass and unrefined brat be gifted with such musical genius. This is God mocking him with the same giggle, divine injustice personified. <br/><br/>In its production design the film is of course gorgeous. The sets and costumes are detailed alike, bathed in natural light, and made alive. We see how exquisite dress is required for symbolising status, these great billowing gowns, ridiculous wigs and enormous headpieces, but it is the act of removing them that we get a more authentic characterisation, as seen in the nervously determined way in which Constanze offers up her body to boost her husband's career (and look at how defiant Salieri is, in refusing and determining he is to beat Mozart fair and square, not by some act of God). In another Director's Cut exclusive, as he plays a jaunty tune to cure a rowdy dog, these simple notes transition into the gorgeous 3rd movement of his 15th Piano Concerto. Other pieces of his work are brilliantly entangled into the drama. The immense, brash opening of Don Giovanni's Overture blasts as we break open the doors to find an elderly Salieri with bloody wrists and an inconsolable heart, wracked by the guilt of his sinful deed in destroying a genius. The same is used as Leopold re-enters atop a staircase in black, and as the same dark foreboding costume by Salieri is used to trigger his composition of his unfinished Requiem, and to loudly announce the death of a father. These moments hit us as abruptly thunderous as they do to Mozart, and his music mourns and weeps for him. <br/><br/>Abraham's performance carries each opera, and provides us with an audience proxy by which we appreciate in its extremities. His voice- over is so remarkably tender and the sounds of the symphonies reaches into his storytelling years and years gone by, as he describes what is simply notes on a page with the most unabashed admiration. And there is conflict, the most painful conflict I have ever witnessed on screen. Watch as his eyes shut in bliss upon Mozart's work, and as they scrunch up in petty glee upon a simple yawn. Oh, but he went to each and every one of those five performances. As he tricks Mozart into composing a masterpiece under his own name, he himself becomes entranced by the master at work. He formerly remarked that Mozart's music was as effortless as taking dictation from God, and here he can barely dictate the words coming from a bed-ridden Mozart. But still he is horrified as Constanze demands they cease composing, and lives the rest of his life in utter regret. In one conversation, he advises Mozart to end his operas with a bang, to inform the audience when to applaud. And yet, he knows in his heart that Mozart's music speaks for itself, and that the audience should know, as he so very much knows, when to put their hands together. And as I finished this film, I too knew this feeling."

"joshuafagan-64214","10","2","3","15 September 2015"," As Good a Film as Mozart was a Composer
","This is a film that tells its story so well that there is no need for another version of it. After seeing this film, I have no desire to see another Mozart film. This one gave me everything I wanted. Such is not to say that another great, original Mozart film could not be made. I have too much trust of the creativity of the human race to not believe that. There is just no purpose in doing so. There does not need to be more LOTR films, there do not need to be more adaptions of To Kill a Mockingbird, and there do not need to be more movies about Mr. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>If Forman's other great movie, OFOTCN, is a gloriously humanistic and smartly rebellious, if more than slightly manipulative, knife of a movie, this one is an over-the-top, stylistic, creatively- flourishing, operatic broadsword of an epic. This is the kind of movie that is not just made by a the mind of a director but by his very soul. OFOTCN is 'directed by Milos Forman.' Amadeus is a 'Milos Forman film.'<br/><br/>The film mostly takes place in late eighteen century Vienna. It centers around the lives of two men; the eponymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played expertly and to an Academy Award nomination by Tom Hulce, and Antonio Salieri, played expertly and to an Academy Award win by F. Murray Abraham. The former is depicted as a boorish brat and playboy who can nonetheless compose some of the finest music ever heard by human ears, the later as his opposite: a dedicated musician who is nonetheless consigned to be 'the patron saint of mediocrity.' We follow Salieri and go through his eternal misery of being one of the few people in the world who can fully appreciate Mozart's talent yet being completely unable to replicate it. <br/><br/>Yes, if you check actual historical accounts, Salieri was not as antagonistic towards Mozart as he is in the movie. But that's not the point of cinema, something that a lot of so-called 'movie fans' don't seem to understand. Yes, I respect and am a fan of Schindler's List and the like. But realism and staying true to actual events is about as essential to a successful film as massive car chases. <br/><br/>Film is about feel. Film is about emotion. Film is about style. Film is about characters. And in all these respects, this film soars. Watching this film is like being an opera at one of the old opera houses of the Old World. The watcher is taken into a world of magic. Not Harry Potter-style magic; there are no magicians casting spells. And not abstract, surreal magic either; there are no volcanoes erupting out of nowhere and covering the world in stylistic lava.<br/><br/>No; this is high-quality stage magic. When I watch this film, I feel like it has gone up to me and said it was going to entertain me like I had never been entertained before and that I had agreed, giving it my time and my imagination, letting it do with them what it pleased.<br/><br/>And it never disappoints. You start trusting the film, building a relationship with it. It starts to become that rich, adventurous friend we all wish we had, one who would take you with him on his trips around the world. And though this film is by no means a 'perfect movie' (I hate that term, by the way), it never fails you so egregiously that the trust you have formed with the film is broken.<br/><br/>Every part of this film succeeds all the way through, from the acting to the cinematography to the plot to the near-entirely Mozart- composed soundtrack. Like many of Mozart's compositions, it flows so smoothly yet gloriously that you are both dreamily carried along and strikingly aware of the greatness you are witnessing.<br/><br/>My favorite of these aspects is the character of Salieri. Though there is no doubt that he is a villain protagonist, he is also one of the most tragic and unique figures of film. His struggle manages to be both operatically grand and deeply personal. I, for one, was impacted by it on a level that most films cannot even comprehend. I think that in a way, we all feel that way about the geniuses we encounter in our lives. <br/><br/>And while I chastise movies for fulfilling simple fantasies, I applaud them for creating characters like this, who are in ways personifications of some of our deepest feelings. Though he knows how idiotic the king is for declaring that Mozart uses 'too many notes' (one of my favorite quotes, by the way), he is still wanting the young prodigy to be taken down a peg. He knows that if he had been born with Mozart's gifts, he would have been as famous, if not more famous than his nemesis. But alas, he is not.<br/><br/>There is a scene in which an elderly Salieri play some of his compositions and asks if the priest who has come to hear his 'confession' has ever heard of them. He shakes his head 'no.' Then Salieri plays one of Mozart's pieces and the priest instantly recognizes it. Whether you have seen this film or not, there is no doubt that Mozart was on a different level. So, too, is this film."

","""This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.""<br/><br/>As I sat there breathless staring at my screen watching this astounding masterpiece while listening to its amazing soundtrack, I couldn't help but relate to F. Murray Abraham's Salieri in his admiration for Mozart and his genius, although my admiration was geared towards Milos Forman's outstanding direction and not on the actual composer himself. What a unique experience this three hour film was for me. Amadeus was a movie I had been putting off mainly because of its extremely long running time and its subject matter: a biopic about a classical music composer, but what a pleasure it was to finally get to experience it for the first time. My concerns about this film couldn't have been so far off because this was such a rich treasure to discover. Amadeus is a timeless film, directed in 1984, it could just as well have been directed today and you wouldn't notice the difference. Everything from the art direction and the set pieces, to the costumes and makeup, to the cinematography could rival any film released this year. I still can't believe this was made in 1984 because it is better than most biopics made today. Just as the central figure of this movie was such a creative and talented composer, Forman proved once again to be way ahead of his peers and was a prodigy director during the 80's. I thought there was no way he could top his marvelous work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but he just did. To say this is one of the biopics ever made is an understatement, because it is one of the best films period. Roger Ebert couldn't have said it better in his review when he wrote, ""the film is constructed in wonderfully well-written and acted scenes -- scenes so carefully constructed, unfolding with such delight, that they play as perfect compositions of words."" Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, the Oscars oddly awarded the more deserving film that year. <br/><br/>Amadeus couldn't have a more suitable and meaningful title, taken from Mozart's middle name which in Latin means ""loved by God,"" the film explores the tormented relationship he had with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), the court composer of Austrian Emperor, Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was so passionate about music that he begged God to make him the best composer the world had known by promising to remain chaste and devoted to Him. We learn this during a confession he is giving to Father Vogler (Richard Frank) after having attempted to commit suicide and confessing to being responsible of Mozart's death decades ago. The film is told in flashback as Salieri narrates what an impression Mozart had made in Vienna during his youth. He was eager to meet this prodigy who God had blessed with such an immense and unique talent, but when Mozart (Tom Hulce) is finally invited to perform at the Emperor's court, Salieri is shocked by what he discovers. Mozart is a childish and vulgar fellow with an obscene giggle that only seemed to mock everything he believed about God's immaculate and pure music. Feeling betrayed and confused as to how God could allow this hideous being to be blessed with such an amazing talent, he makes it his personal vendetta to defy God and bury Mozart's career. <br/><br/>The film centers on themes of artistic genius and creativity as well as professional jealousy and uncomprehended talent. The universal theme of man against God is also tackled throughout the three hour runtime. These themes are perfectly explored and balanced with comedic moments scattered throughout, which allow the pacing of the film to move at a pleasant beat. Very seldom do you find such a perfectly balanced biopic that manages to remain comic and tragic at the same time. Some of the success of Amadeus must be attributed to the gorgeous location in which the movie was filmed. Choosing Prague to depict the mid 1700's Vienna was a perfect choice and the stages where the Opera scenes where performed were simply mesmerizing. Forman also allowed his actors to retain their American accents which was another intelligent choice. There is no need to give the actors silly English European accents if you are going to have them speak in any other language other than the original. The screenplay adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Award winning stage play was also a hit because the dialogue in this film is truly inspiring and I can recall several great quotes from it. <br/><br/>The two lead performances in Amadeus are incredibly powerful. F. Murray Abraham took home the Oscar for best lead actor and he will forever be remembered for his role here as the frustrated and jealous Salieri. The inner conflict he experiences as he easily goes from admiration and bewilderment to hatred and jealousy while listening to each composition is outstanding. Tom Hulce is just as great playing the titular character. Never in a million years would I have cast him in a role like this, but it only added to the underlying theme of looks and talents not always going well together. Hulce's cheerful and giggly demeanor slowly grows on the audience as he is first presented as an irritating figure, but gradually begins to appear more sympathetic, and our initial alliances with Salieri begin to turn while he grows darker. I could go on writing about this amazing film, but I feel no matter what I have to say about it, it's simply going to be another mediocre review of an incredibly masterful film. There are no words that can justly describe this film, so by all means if you haven't seen this masterpiece go check it out. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","If you ask me ""What is the best movie you have ever seen?"" (and I was reluctant to say ...The Matrix!) I would probably call ""Amadeus"" as one of the best i've seen and one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>The fact that it won 8 Oscars is an indication for the quality you can expect.<br/><br/>Best picture, screenplay, direction, costumes, some of the best music ever composed, marvelous performances.... A true masterpiece.<br/><br/>The story follows the apocryphal legend that Antonio Salieri was responsible for the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart out of jealousy over the latter's music. (As far as I know, even the descendants of Mozart are considering this as fiction.)<br/><br/>There is no excuse not to see this movie. Even if you think that classical music isn't your thing or you don't care about an 18th century drama, the movie is so emotional and at the same time enjoyable and entertaining that it will win your heart and soul.<br/><br/>The movie has so many memorable scenes that if you own a hard copy, you might find yourself watch them again and again.<br/><br/>Overall: One of the best movies ever made, and it has the awards to prove it."

","I don't care if this film is historically incorrect, there's so much poetic truth in it. People apparently don't realize that the narration form is ""unreliebale narrator"". It means we see things the way the old and deluded Salieri remembers them, nobody says this is what actually happened.<br/><br/>The movie is full of emotion, psychology, interesting faces and beautiful music.<br/><br/>Apart from the 3 main characters (Mozart, his wife and Salieri), I especially liked the emperor and Mozart's friend. To see what Renaissance Europe (kinda) looked like is really wonderful. I mean especially the lower class people, like the maid secretly hired by Salieri. And the women who pass past Mozart's body in the rain in the end. I also liked that part where the sick Mozart is carried out of the theatre and three little boys dressed like angels curiously walk behind him. His fate was already sealed.<br/><br/>The part where Mozart's pranks prevented Salieri from secretly eating a candy from the archbishop's table is funny. So he took Salieri's woman and his faith in God, and even the candy, aaaaaaw that's mean.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is light and cheerful, the second half is dark and gloomy. That reminds me of James Cameron's Titanic.<br/><br/>It also got me into classical music, when I was 10. So I recommend it."
"jayson_valentine","10","2","3","3 October 2011"," Greatest Film Ever.
","Peter Schaffer's ""Amadeus"" is my nomination for the greatest film of all time. There is much to review; however, I will stick to the core principals which make this film so timeless. Most of the universally acclaimed works in cinema are usually recognized for their mastery of a certain cinematic feature. Very few films extend into the reaches of all-around perfection where no single element is embellished to anchor the film. <br/><br/>Amadeus's perfection begins in script, which evolves complex psychological profiles of two antipodal characters: Salieri and Mozart. The plot begins with what you think is a Cain and Abel archetype, but you soon find that the two composers are not at war with another. The real conflict lays in Salieri's mind, which is tormented by the level of genius that the impious Mozart possessed. Throughout the film, Salieri argues with his own conscience while blaming a god he claims to no longer believe in for his suffering.<br/><br/>Aside from the brilliant writing, the production values of this film are all grade A: the set design, the costume design, the cinematography, the sound editing and film score. The film was entirely shot with natural light which in my opinion makes this film the most aesthetically beautiful Hollywood film. The cast was entirely comprised of relatively unknown actors and actresses, who all gave performances above what most mainstream players would have at the time. Abraham's portrayal of Salieri ranks among the finest performances in any English-speaking role. Compare his acting as Young Salieri, depicted as a stern and polite gentleman to his acting as Old Salieri, who smiles with comical look of defeat. The polarization is drastic, yet it is the same character. Not to mention Hulce's awkwardly cunning work as Mozart.<br/><br/>Forman's directing compulsively executes a delicate blend of over-the- top and subtle scenes, while thoroughly setting into place everything going on from the direction of the lead roles down to every single extra. Not one piece of this film was overlooked by Forman's attention to detail and realism. His work equates in cinema to that of which was done by the subject of the biopic in music.<br/><br/>I don't think you have to have an intrigue in classical music or 18th Century Europe to enjoy this gem. I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a cerebral movie done in homage to the older styles of American cinema. This film will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly think."

"vincentlynch-moonoi","8","2","3","24 February 2011"," Solid biopic or film masterpiece, depending on your perspective
","There's no denying that this 1984 biopic, directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer, is a great film. It's a story about the old adage -- life is unfair. In fact, just to demonstrate how unfair, it probably should have been entitled ""Salieri"", rather than ""Amadeus"", because its really the story of Salieri and his bitterness over the success of his contemporary. But, the average person is somewhat familiar with Mozart, so let's be commercial about entitling the film.<br/><br/>If you are ""into"" classical music, there will be little to dislike about this film. You'll find a great story and lots of the music in which you revel. If you are not really into classical music, but are watching for the story, you may find the film a bit long with some sections highlighting the music (opera scenes) a bit lengthy. I'm the latter, but still, this film maintains your interest.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the film is that Salieri tells the story of his rivalry with Mozart as a sort of confession to a priest, after the court composer has been placed in a lunatic asylum for attempting suicide. And, though brief, the scenes in the asylum are chilling. I think the technique of flashbacks in films is overused, but is perfect for the telling of this story, because it allows Salieri (Abraham) to narrate the story effectively, thus aiding in understanding his feelings and motives. It may be a little difficult for us to understand that Salieri supposedly saw his musical talents as a product of his devotion to God -- a different time, to be sure. Mozart's irreverent and lewd general behavior surprised me, and in the light reading I did after viewing the film, appears to be accurately portrayed. Hence the source of Salieri's bitterness -- God appears to have graced the rude and obnoxious Mozart with the talent, while nearly bypassing the serious efforts of the pious Salieri. I did find Mozart's childish squeal of a laugh quite entertaining. Salieri comes to believe that God is using Mozart's genius to cruelly laugh at Salieri. Hence, Salieri's plot to kill Mozart, though the latter actually dies from exhaustion (?) -- the film not clear at all about the actual reason for death (and does not make obvious the many medical struggles Mozart has through his life). Particularly considering the length of the film, I would have liked a couple of minutes more dialog by Salieri describing Mozart's funeral and burial...just to put it all in more understandable perspective -- why the anonymous burial in a mass grave -- common at that time? What's interesting is that both Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham were nominated for Academy Awards (the latter won), but neither went on to luminous careers in film. The film won 8 Oscars in all, and deservedly so."
"JamesHitchcock","10","2","3","3 September 2010"," The Patron Saint of Mediocrities
","Most films about composers- Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" about Tchaikovsky and ""Immortal Beloved"" about Beethoven are examples- rely upon the cliché of the creative artist as tortured, neurotic genius. Perhaps we like to console ourselves for the fact that we are not ourselves geniuses with the thought that genius must be paid for in mental suffering. Of course, not all composers fit this stereotype- Haydn was stoical in the face of misfortune (including a miserably unhappy marriage), Rossini was a noted bon viveur and it was often said of Felix Mendelssohn that his forename (Latin for ""happy"") well suited his character. But when did you last see a biopic of Haydn, Rossini or Mendelssohn? ""Song of Norway"" told the story of Grieg, another composer who doesn't really fit the ""tormented genius"" label, but it bombed at the box-office. <br/><br/>""Amadeus"", however, attempts to overturn this cliché with a vengeance. The Mozart portrayed in the early scenes is about the least tormented genius who ever lived, obnoxiously hearty and cheerful, without the slightest doubt about his own talents. The tormented character is his rival, Antonio Salieri, but Salieri is no genius; in his own mind he is a hopeless mediocrity whose talents pale into insignificance besides Mozart's. <br/><br/>The story is told as a confession made by the now elderly, half- mad Salieri to a priest in 1823, long after Mozart's death, the earlier scenes being seen in flashback. As a young man, the deeply pious Salieri vows that if God will make him a great composer he will live a chaste, virtuous life and use his talents to God's glory. At first Salieri believes that his vow has been accepted. He quickly achieves fame and is appointed Court Composer to Emperor Joseph II. When Mozart arrives in Vienna, however, Salieri realises that the young man's music has a transcendent beauty which his own can never match. <br/><br/>Salieri's attitude towards his rival is not one of simple jealousy. Were Mozart a man of his own austere, puritanical stamp Salieri would not resent him nearly so much. Mozart, however, is very far from being puritanical. He is not a bad man, but he is very young, and his are a young man's faults- brashness, overweening self-confidence, a bawdy sense of humour, a keen eye for a pretty girl and a lack of respect for authority. (Actually, those last two are not really faults at all). His most irritating characteristic is his high-pitched laugh like a braying jackass. In Salieri's eyes, however, Mozart is a vulgar upstart, a smutty, sex-obsessed boy. Salieri believes that God has cheated him, by denying him the musical talent he deserves and giving it to an unworthy recipient. (The title is an appropriate one; Amadeus was not only Mozart's middle name but is also Latin for ""beloved of God""). Salieri therefore plots a diabolical revenge against both Mozart and God. <br/><br/>The director Milo Forman took the brave decision to cast little-known actors in the three main roles, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, Tom Hulce as Mozart and Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's beautiful young wife Constanze. In each case, however, that decision paid off admirably. Constanze has sometimes had a bad press from biographers, but here Berridge portrays her as strong-willed but loving and kind-hearted. <br/><br/>Both Abraham and Hulce were nominated for ""Best Actor"" Oscars, and it was Abraham who won. Good as Abraham is as the gloomy, saturnine Salieri, a man eaten up with obsessive hatred, I still think that Hulce should have beaten him. There is a remarkable contrast between the brash young jackass of the early scenes and the Mozart of the later ones- a more mature, serious family man who has learnt the meaning of responsibility and who is for the first time starting to experience worries- about his finances, about his health, about his career. Hulce's achievement is that he not only makes these two Mozarts equally believable but also indicates that they are not two distinct individuals but rather two aspects of the same complex personality. There are also good performances from Jeffrey Jones as the conscientious but bumbling and musically tone deaf Emperor Joseph and Roy Dotrice as Mozart's autocratic father Leopold.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is not, and is not intended as, a factually accurate biopic of Mozart. As Peter Shaffer, who wrote both the screenplay and the play on which it was based, was well aware, there is no real evidence that Salieri was obsessively jealous of Mozart, and absolutely none to support the old legend that he murdered him. He was not in reality a celibate puritan- he had a wife, eight children and a mistress. Shaffer uses this legend as the basis of a fictional story which explores complex questions about the nature of artistic creativity and the relationship between man and God. <br/><br/>The film, deservedly, won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1984; indeed, it is in my view one of the finest films of the eighties. It works on a number of levels- as a lavish piece of ""heritage cinema"" recreating the Europe of the late 18th century (the sets and costumes are particularly fine), as an intellectual exploration of philosophical issues, as a well-acted human drama, as a fictionalised study of a great man. The soundtrack is heavenly, but that is only to be expected, containing as it does some of Mozart's greatest music. <br/><br/>The film has had a curious side effect. It could have condemned Salieri to perpetual infamy as a jealous minor composer who was supposedly responsible for the death of a great one. Instead, it seems to have led to a revival of interest in his work; he is certainly better known today than he was in 1984. Many musicians would now regard him as something far more than the ""patron saint of mediocrities"". God may have answered Salieri's prayers long after his death. 10/10"
"gavin6942","9","2","3","12 May 2010"," An Interesting Take on the Amadeus Story
","Peter Schaffer (perhaps better known as the writer of ""Equus"") has an interesting tale to tell: an annoying laugh coming from the belly of God through the mouth of Amadeus, which angers and frustrates his chief rival. Is there a historical basis for the laugh, the rivalry, or the manner of Amadeus' death? Not really, but we can just let that slide because it makes a good story.<br/><br/>I really loved this film ,and even though it was nearly three hours long, it seemed to go very quickly. Tom Hulce, who I know from nothing else, was a delightful Amadeus. At first he was a pain, but once I adjusted and began to sympathize with him, I think he played the part perfectly. Beyond that, everyone played their parts well -- even Jeffrey Jones, who (for me) is hard to see as anything but a comic actor or a Tim Burton regular."

","If cinema lasts another thousand years, men shall still regard this as its finest hour. Never before have such beautiful words been written about music - whether in film or academia - as Peter Shaffer's exquisite script. Each line is chiselled into perfection. Each scene is contoured with such mastery that it could stand in isolation. F Murray Abraham's embittered snarling Salieri is, simply, one of the greatest portrayals in cinematic history.<br/><br/>The film matches the beauty of Mozart's music, which in itself is sublime on a scale never heard before or since, even when one considers the new Ndubz release of beatbox mastermixes. When lazy ignorant musical journalists compare the modern day chart toppers to the Classical giants, Amadeus reminds us that the majority of the new breed are music illiterates. Mozart's genius and insatiable desire to achieve perfection reminds us that for all the advances in the modern world, we must truly humble ourselves to the towering achievements of our artistic ancestors."

","Never before (with the exception of Apocalypse Now) have I watched a film one day, woken up the next with a new, urging interest to watch it again; this happened to me with Milos Forman's brilliant adaption of Peter Shaffer's play, 'Amadeus'. Brilliantly paced the film runs for 180 minutes (Director's Cut version) and is full of detail (you'll never see a film film so exquisitely ornate with fantastical costumes and production design - it's like a baroque twist between Stanley Kubrick's 1975 'Barry Lyndon' and a wildly imaginative ""anything goes"" style), dizzying narrative depths and extravagant cinematic power. The character studies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) makes both for career-defining performances, the spiraling relationship between them makes for a dynamic pace that keeps upping the drama towards the powerfully dramatic climax. The music of Mozart feels like the final third main character, so beautifully edited to the masterfully shot scenes by Miroslav Ondricek (the elegant gliding through the corridors, the flaring candle-lights, the crane-shots in the opera... it's truly the finest piece of cinematography ever), the film will reveal new artistic elements ""simply"" in its grand beauty. Importantly, the film is not about Mozart, it's about Salieri and his Mozart and his God, and through several viewings it reveals new sides in the tales of greed, guilt and faith, and it's psychological and darkly painted drama simply enhances more and more as years go by."

","1. The Movie Making You Want More 2. When I heard about the film Amadeus, I was not very thrilled about seeing it. I didn't think I would be very interested or even like the movie in the end. As I watched the film I started liking it more and more. I feel this film deserved all the Academy Awards that it won. 3. Amadeus is a film about Mozart's life while in Vienna. Antonio Salieri is out to kill him because he is jealous of his success. The film starts out with Salieri in an insane institution looking back and telling a priest the whole story of Mozart. Mozart starts out in Salzburg, but soon gets kicked out of the town and decides to move to Vienna to further his career. With the help of the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Mozart is composing many various operas and writing symphonies. Mozart meets the love of his life Constanze and they have a child together. She is by his side the whole time, supporting him and praising him for the work he is doing. Mozart thinks that Salieri is actually trying to help him and one of his friends, but little does he know that Salieri is hoping that he dies. In the end, Constanze leaves him to decide and take some time away because Mozart has a very bad drinking problem. She eventually comes back, but doesn't come back to find the happiest thing. 4. I really enjoyed the film because of all the colors and settings. The settings were very broad and stood out. All the costumes and makeup were bright and catching of the eye. The scenery really used big props and had spectacular visual effects. The music was another big factor. The sound was enhanced to keep the viewer interested and wanting more from the film. When something bad was about the happen the music got really loud and the opposite when something good was about to happen. The transitions in the movie were very smooth. The movie didn't switch scenes really fast without warning. 5. I didn't really like how the film wasn't fully portrayed to the fullest. There were a couple things missing and things turned around to make the film more interesting. In real life, Mozart and Constanze actually had four kids. Salieri was not actually jealous of Mozart and he was famous at the time in composing his music. I didn't really like how the movie portrayed Mozart as being a bad person because he went out and partied all the time. This was what kept him going and focused on his music. It also wasn't portrayed well that his wife was nagging him all the time. 6. I really liked all the characters. The actors were all selected very well for playing the characters in this movie. I don't think anyone could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce. He had the serious times when it was needed and he had a sense of humor. I think certain audience members would be able to relate to certain characters. 7. I would love to see this film again and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't want the movie to end. I thought there was more to come and it just ended. You don't have to appreciate music to see this film. It has much more to offer and is a lot more interesting than someone would think. You also want to see this film to find out what happens at the end. This film is a must see. I would give this movie 8 stars."

","""Amadeus"" was a historical biography about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, whispering Italian. This man, Saleri, plays a key character. Saleri plays as the narrator for some parts in which he is telling about his past and being with Mozart. He then has flashbacks of when he was a court composer and Mozart was just in his youth. Saleri was in love with the music that came from Mozart and was somehow always around Mozart when he had come up with new music. Saleri, himself, being so intrigued with the music and melodies, came up with his own composure's to try and please the Emperor. The Emperor is pleased, however, has Amadeus play it and while doing so, he changes a few keys here and there. This made Saleri upset because Amadeus did this quite often and leads us to believe that Saleri should've been the ""real celebrity."" A lot of Mozarts ideas are inspired by Saleri but with no credit given to him. Amadeus is married and has four children but the movie only portrayed one. He is quite the drunk, he spent all his time writing material and the moment he got paid for it, he spends it all on going out and getting drunk. He has the nice house and all, but his only happiness is coming up with music for everyone to hear. Even though this film is historical, I enjoyed the plot. Describing someone's life is definitely not easy, but Peter Shaffer did a great job with coming up with the plots and screen work. And showing the inside drama within each of the leading characters (Amadeus and Saleri) was interesting and led you into each of their lifes. The acting and music was great, I liked that they actually used his own works and used them correctly. The dramatics between roles were extreme but not the point where it was too much. And having Amadeus have a ridiculous laugh made it more enjoyable and more humorous. Some things I think the director should've pushed more for would be a better German accent. These characters seemed to have more of an English talk. The way they made Amadeus seem like nothing more than a drunk, turned me away. In many scenes in which he was coming up with plays, he always had some sort of drink in his hands, making it seem like it was his only getaway. They made Saleri seem more of like the jealous type and that the only thing he was living for was to get revenge on Amadeus, when in fact Saleri was quite the composer himself and is well-known. With the time transition, they should've made the characters age as years went on. Amadeus looked just about the same the whole movie. The choice of the cast was great, to me there were no actors that are too well-known and would be more favorable than others just because of their acting experience. They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate ""Amadeus,"" by Milos Forman 8 out of 10. Great movie with a killer laugh!!"

","The film Amadeus conveys the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an extremely talented child prodigy who matures into a famous composer. Incidents arise when Salieri, an Italian composer, becomes jealous of Mozart's brilliant work. Amadeus is a brilliant movie which captures the entire essence of music at its best. Mozart's scores are naturally uplifting, and therefore draws a person into the movie with each powerful note. The attire throughout the film provided a very realistic window into Mozart's time period. The beautiful detailed textiles of aristocratic men and women's clothing were brought to life on the big screen. On the flip side, the only negative aspects of the move can be found in the long, drawn out scenes concentrated on Mozart and his opera plays. The scenes could have been cut down into shorter time spans. The film has great comedic relief; however they could have dealt less with crude childish humor (such as when Mozart bent over to relieve flatulence). Casting roles also played an imperative part, making this movie worthy of all its Academy Awards. I quickly fell in love with Tom Hulce playing the part of Mozart. His overall cheery disposition and conceited attitude lightened the mood for what would be a rather dry movie if everything was absent. Frank Murray Abraham's roll as Salieri captured the character's lust to be the ultimate superior to Mozart. His character's script speaks with great use of dramatic detailed imagery. Overall, Amadeus is a terrific movie filled with great costumes, characters, and music. The casting roles fit every character to a tee.

","For all intents and purposes, I have split this review/comment into two portions, namely the subjective and the objective.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the subjective: I personally don't like musicals on the Silver Screen; they just don't work for me (I said the same thing about CHICAGO). And while I agree that this is not a musical per se, it does feature a lot of overly dramatic operatic pieces/plays, which brings me to my second point: I don't like opera. Maybe it's just me, but I just can't get into it no matter how hard I try. Thirdly, I'm not necessarily fond of period pieces, and have only liked a handful of movies of this type (most notably BARRY LYNDON and ATONEMENT). As such, I really did not appreciate this movie as much as I probably should have.<br/><br/>Now onto the objective: The acting by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce is simply extraordinary. Abraham (as Salieri) presents a character who is conflicted and troubled upon meeting Mozart, not necessarily because he hates him, but because he believes that God is teasing or mocking him by placing such musical genius into the hands of a disrespectful, idle, and roguish youth, while seemingly giving the pious Salieri nothing more than mediocrity. As such, Salieri is decidedly presented as the 'reluctant' villain whose guilt and jealousy and sense of divine betrayal constantly eat away at his conscience. The conflict faced by Abraham's character is evident in every scene in which he appears. Tom Hulce presents the prodigy Mozart as somewhat of a modern day 'rock star', living a reckless and carefree existence. It is a bit unfortunate that he had to contend with Abraham for the Best Actor nod, since it was a battle that he was never going to win.<br/><br/>Biopics about artists are generally long and boring and do not succeed in connecting with the audience. This is where AMADEUS proves itself to be exceptional; it is not really a biopic and is in fact more of a story than a documentary, as Milos Forman and Frank Shaffer took some liberties with the storyline, resulting in a quite compelling story.<br/><br/>Then there's the Music. I mentioned earlier that I am not a fan of musicals, but that doesn't mean that I am opposed to Music in Motion Pictures. On the contrary. I was quite curious to see how Mozart's music would fit into this film, and the end result was simply breathtaking. The musical pieces are not inserted at random in the film as I feared; instead each featured piece succeeds brilliantly in capturing and enhancing the overall mood evoked, and it is evident that much forethought went into the music selection.<br/><br/>A final note about the title 'AMADEUS': this film could have been called 'MOZART' or 'WOLFGANG' or anything else that would indicate that the film is indeed about the legendary composer (as not many people knew that Amadeus was his middle name). Any student of language will know that 'Amadeus' loosely translates to 'Loved by God', and it is this concept that drives the film, as Salieri believes that God has forsaken him by blessing Mozart with the musical talents which Salieri believes he himself should have had. It is the resulting bitterness and jealousy that propel the story.<br/><br/>This is a great movie overall, and a wonderful character study. It deserved the Best Picture and Best Director (a second for Forman after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) Oscars in a relatively weak field that year (1984). Nonetheless, it is just not my type of movie and I find it difficult to give this movie more that 8/10 since it would seem that I am bending to the will of other critics, influenced by the 'popular' vote rather than my own. I give this film 3.5 stars (out of 4) since I believe that as an Oscar winner it should be seen and studied. This film will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list due to the superb acting, direction, storyline, and music, rather than to the overdone and seemingly never-ending operatic segments. Highly recommended."

","***Spoilers*** Well, I must admit- when I watch this movie, I have to watch it backwards (ie the 2nd part first, then the 1st part) cause it's so sad. I mean, as much as I loathed Mozart's character in this movie, he more or less brought it onto himself. He drank, he barely slept, he didn't seem to have a normal, consistent diet, he blew through his money. The pplz back then had a low life-expectancy then, my goodness. He certainly didn't do himself any favors Lol :-P I still sympathized with him. But anywhoo, this movie is quite brilliant. I wanna know whose idea it was for Tom Hulce's ""giggle""- that insane, despicable lil giggle. I wanna strangle them, and shake their hand at the same time, if that makes any sense Lmao :-P It really was the icing on the cake in depicting how unique of a personality Mozart was (or more appropriately, Wolfgang).<br/><br/>The acting- was all superb. F. Murray Abraham played the perfect old & tortured, guilt-ridden Salieri. The first couple of scenes when the priest first enters the room, he's describing who he is/was and what he is/was- an instrument of God. And he was a good lil church boy, good lil Christian boy. That is-until he meets his nemesis, which turns out to be Tom Hulce's character, Mozart. Now Tom Hulce, who is probably more known for his ""off-the-beaten-path"" characters, does miracles with this. This pompous, childish, irresponsible ""creature,"" who was inexplicably in love with ""Stanzy"" (and who wouldn't with those breasts staring at you everyday? hahahahahaha :-P)- he played it to a tee. I think Elizabeth Berridge had her moments, most very good, some others another actress than herself could've done.<br/><br/>Muscially- the operas and the plays were astounding. However, whoever chose the choir which was used for ""Requiem"" in the movie- needs to go back to music school. This was my favorite piece, and I was highly disappointed. I have a much better recording for this, dunno who the choir is (copied it from my choir teacher's CD hee-hee).<br/><br/>My rating is 8/10... for messing up Requiem, and cause it dragged a lil bit.<br/><br/>Take care, Jess :-D"
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","2","3","15 May 2008"," An intelligent, imaginative and slyly satirical study of the creative mind in all its ruthless glory
","Milos Forman's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's award winning stage play of the life and ultimate downfall of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and his difficult relationship with arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is certainly something of a flawed work, albeit, one that is incredibly pleasant and engaging nonetheless. The principal focus of the film is on the character of Salieri, from his guilt ridden suicide attempt at the beginning of the film, through to the scenes in which he recounts his story to a priest from the confines of a mental hospital. From here, the film deals mainly with Salieri's crippling jealousy over the younger composer and the natural rivalry that intensifies between them, as Mozart's natural talent and flair for presentation finds him embraced by the Emperor (Jeffery Jones) and the people of Vienna.<br/><br/>As Mozart gains more and more success, it is Salieri's obsession to destroy the composer at any means necessary that drives the narrative further and further. Although you could argue that the whole thing is woefully inaccurate in a historical scene, you can't help but marvel at the film's style, wit and excellent period evocation. Shaffer's script fizzes with depth and amusing character quirks that should resonate with anyone who has some familiarly with the actual story at hand, while Forman's direction is close to Kubrick's greatest film Barry Lyndon (1975) in terms of scope, scale and detail. Here, the director is aided by cinematographer Miroslav Odericek's and his staggering use of composition and lighting, with the look, combined with the costume and production design evoking the true grimy beauty of the period.<br/><br/>There is also a great pace being maintained by the editing of the film, with some interesting juxtapositions between the worlds of these two composers, and the intelligent use of Salieri as the teller of the story, which opens the film up to ideas of the unreliable narrator, thus somewhat anarchically excusing itself from the more obvious inaccuracies. This all goes towards making Amadeus (1984) a fascinating character study with some wonderfully bawdy comedy and, unsurprisingly, that fantastic use of music. A great look at one man's shallow obsession to share his art with the people and god, but is overshadowed at every turn by a much greater talent, something he only realises too late."

","God, why do so many people like this movie?  I mean, I thought it was cool when I was a little kid and I saw it, but other than some cool performances from Hulce and Abraham, what has this movie got to offer?  Excerpts from Mozart's most popular stuff you could buy for $2 on any discount classics CD?  It's got director Forman's usual overuse of head shots and quick reaction shots, his usual reliance on audience reactions to carry the supposed impact of a star's performance (as seen also in his lackluster 90s bioflick, Man on the Moon), plus you've got a whopping case of historical falsification.  The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.  But viewers of this movie will, unfortunately, probably walk away from it thinking that Salieri was a bad, bad man indeed.  This is unfair to his life and his music, but the producers of this hero-worshipping (though also hero-deflating, in the modern ambigously ""realist"" style) flick couldn't care less.  I guess they just didn't see any other possibility for drama in the tale of the spoiled, brilliant musician and instead of concentrating on his professional laxitude and his obsession with sex (which did get an airing), they came up with the whole Salieri murder thing.  Bad idea, bad movie."

","In your life, or in your career, in your school or college, have you ever been through such an experience where you have always been overshadowed by someone's soaring personality; where, no matter how much you try, it is always not enough for you to beat, at least for once, that supremely talented rival of yours? Have you ever been a Dravid to a Tendulkar? A Platini to a Maradona? A Ben Jonson to a Shakespeare? Have you always been an ""undisputed"" second-boy of your time? Then you would perfectly understand Salieri's pain!<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is not about the genius of Mozart, but more about the envy of Salieri. It is a movie about the morally destructive nature of jealousy. Salieri, cursed with the talent of a second-rate composer but the ear of a first-rate music-lover, is constantly aware of the supremacy of the his competitor and his own mediocrity. This is the same awareness which leads him to extract the final masterpiece from the fevered brain of Mozart in his death-bed. But Salieri's love for music is more overpowering than his enmity to Mozart. A pious man, devoted his entire life to the service of man and God, while Mozart's has been one of excess and debauchery. Yet it is Mozart's music which is touched by God, and not Salieri's; and he knows this, and is tortured by this. He is not a traditional villain, but, at one point, almost a Shakespearean tragic figure, burdened with guilt, jealousy, and the belief that God has abandoned him.<br/><br/>""Your merciful God. He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity share in the smallest part of his glory. He killed Mozart. And kept me alive to torture. Thirty-two years of torture. Thirty-two years of slowly watching myself become extinct. My music growing fainter. All the time fainter...till no one plays it at all. And his...""<br/><br/>That's why the title ""Amadeus""- not ""Mozart"" or ""Salieri"" -which means ""Beloved of God"", fitting perfectly with Salieri's view of Mozart as the chosen-one!<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham's Academy Award winning performance seethes with a wannabe's ambition that is frustrated at every turn by his rival's sublime brilliance. His jealousy is devouring him from the inside like a cancer. Even in his smile, the conflict in his eyes can be envisaged- a constant tug-of-war between the desire to carry out his plan and the recognition that the world's greatest musical voice is about to be silenced. It is just Tom Hulce's misfortune, I think, to have been nominated opposite Abraham in the same category. His Mozart is a spoilt child in a grown man's body, striding heedlessly through the world, expecting it to conform to him, and living far beyond his means. He is as far behind everyone in social skills as he is ahead of them in music.<br/><br/>But few of us can identify with that kind of genius. Salieri, on the other hand, is someone we can see in ourselves, albeit our worst selves. Every frame of Abraham's performance reveals some new moment of humiliation - some fresh, sickening glimmer of anguish that feels all too familiar. His is the destiny of all mediocre talents in this world, thriving under the shade of some far-superior, a God-like contender, whose genius cannot be challenged or conquered, but only be appreciated with a sense of awe. Hence, Salieri's proclamation to the world:<br/><br/>""I will speak for you... I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint. Mediocrities everywhere...I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you all."""

","To be fair, this movie doesn't even touch the more known Mozart's works, yet it's a glorious way to celebrate his music, if not his legacy.<br/><br/>The story is told by a seemingly mad man, Antonio Salieri, the Emperor's teacher who loves music more than anything else in this world. He has a lot of ""self-image"" issues, and when he's faced the reality of Mozart's existence, he's lost his faith in God, and himself. The abstinent musician, falls in love with Mozart's work, while simultaneously proves his-self unworthiness. That's a hard paradox for his appreciating jealous mind to handle. So, the double identity, as a coping mechanism to his respective mediocrity begins. He is allegedly Mozart's best friend, who little ""Wolfie"" knows, has sabotaged his work and even made an indecent proposal to his wife. Secretly, he's Mozart's biggest admirer. He confesses it many times himself.<br/><br/>He's broken in his soul, more than Mozart was ever broken financially.
Try to love Costanza, ingenuous woman with a heart of gold who loves Mozart very much. Mozart himself is portrayed like a very proud, bold and almost pertinent man-child who has no respect for anything but his music, not even money; profligately throws his life away in debts.<br/><br/>Beside the fantastic acting of the two important roles, costume design, music, makeups, and whatever else this movie has excelled to set the bar, Milos Forman's way of story telling is yet another masterpiece of his that puts Amadeus high up and close to his other masterpiece; One flew over the cuckoo's nest. He, once again, shows a great deal of artful directing, having mastered directing a big crowd. 2:40 hours and not even once you feel bored when watching this movie. Also, he's decided on giving Wolfgang a signature laugh that stays with you, that I promise.<br/><br/>Back to the story, the priest is broken in the end, just listening to Salieri's subtle sinister; imagine Salieri's torture for 32 years living that story.<br/><br/>It's such a good movie, and this is not only my opinion, the Academy has acknowledged this radiant of a movie with a lot of trophies.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, watch this movie."

An illustrious rivalry between Court composer Salieri and young newcomer Mozart that's so tiny in scope, but epic in scale! Where do I even begin with this beauty!? Both a visual and aural treat that celebrates the work of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The sublime music is beautiful interwoven into the narrative which makes the biopic absolutely spellbinding. Salieri is just as fascinating and important as Mozart. Played phenomenally by F. Murray Abraham, Salieri is maddened with envy after discovering Mozart and his divine musical gifts. He literally utilises any means necessary to see that Mozart fails as a composer, but beneath this cold exterior is an individual who yearns for greatness. The fear of his work being forgotten and diminished by a far superior talent. It's a bittersweet tale, one that hauntingly resonates with me. Tom Hulce was impeccable as Mozart, the laugh alone was stupendously charismatic. Forman's direction was perfect, embedding luscious operas into a savage rivalry. Using classical music to push the story forward. It was just sublime, it really was. The period costumes were accurate and authentic. Vienna's rich and lavish lifestyle was conveyed eloquently. The script was sharp and injected plenty of charisma into these characters with many subtle humorous moments. The first act does take a while to get going, but once the ignition is on Amadeus is the gift that keeps on giving. So so so close to perfection.

","As an Mozart-admiring and yet hate and jealousy filled composer, Salieri seems to be a compelling vessel for telling us about Mozart's ingenuity - as well as his flaws. But I hope audiences realize that almost everything in this movie regarding the relationship between Mozart and Saliery is simply made up. I enjoyed the realistic depiction of the life in Vienna during that time. Also, the movie partially grants an idea of what Mozart's personality really could have been like. But the whole plot is just a fantasy of Salieri (at least the movie version of Salieri, who is plagued by feelings of guilt, jealousy and self-awareness). Should one take it metaphorically? Mozart's struggle between life and art killed him despite being one of the greatest talents. While Salieri had to outlive him despite not coming close to this genius and being fully aware of it. It's like god's punishment for movie-Salieri.<br/><br/>So, one has to keep in mind that this movie has actually only one historical inaccuracy: Salieri telling such a story in real life. The rest is an interesting fantasy."

","I honestly cannot fathom the enduring popularity of this film.  It is over-produced, garish and vulgar, directed with a ham-fist by Milos Forman...and would appear to be only incidentally about Mozart's music.  I know, I know, the point is that hapless, buffoonish Mozart was also, ironically, a prolific and endlessly inventive fountain of matchlessly elegant, mostly joyous and altogether perfect music (though emphatically and unfortunately not the politically astute schemer that the plodding, envious and sinister Salieri was).  However interesting the conception of this film undeniably is as a dramatic device, would not an important additional point of a biographical picture about the life and times of a composer be to attempt to somehow relate that life to the creation of his music?  I don't imagine that this relationship was quite as arbitrary and incidental as it is presented here; the music itself, and its connection with Mozart's life and soul, is given pretty short shrift, in my opinion, and is not in fact a subject at all.  The screen  is instead filled to bursting, like an over-stuffed sofa, with broad cartoonish performances, frantic cutting, goggle-eyed camera work, and hideous wigs and make-up that attempt unsuccessfully to present a highly stylised re-creation of the Eighteenth Century.  Where in all of this indigestible and copious display is the soul and spirit of Mozart's matchless elegance, lightness and clarity, which was in many ways the definitive musical expression of the soul and spirit of the Eighteenth Century itself?  Not anywhere apparent that I can detect.  If you, as a filmgoer, want to experience a magically evocative and completely realised  stylisation of the 18th C. I suggest you view ""Fellini's Casanova"" (and ignore the dubbing and stilted performances).  And if you want to see a brilliantly expressive and gorgeous film about a Great Composer (Beethoven), and his times, his soul and his music, and his enigmatic life as an artist, then seek out, and savor, ""Immortal Beloved""(1994).  A magnificent film, and everything that busy, noisy tedious and empty ""Amadeus"" is not.  Sorry, but ""Amadeus"" stinks."

And while this may be worhty of some interest as a footnote or even a few paragraphs in a Mozart biography, it is not a justification for the bloated treatment rendered in ""Amadeus."" Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon. There is a great deal missing from this composer biography, and it is saddening to think that this may be considered a definitive depiction of the life of this great composer. There comes a point when historical accuracy and integrity must override purely commercial motives."

My impression from the numerous trailers for 'Amadeus' was that it was a farcical treatment of a real-life classical composer, starring a man with a stupid grin wearing a fright wig, accompanied by a lot of people in 18th century garb dancing in ballrooms.<br/><br/>Yep, that's what it was.

","Amadeus is a movie on the life of the legendary composer Wolfgang Mozart. From a very young age Mozart has had a gifted ear for quality music. Among other things Mozart carried a horrible attitude toward anyone who tried to counsel him. He was very immature, and irresponsible in a number of ways. He had many adoring fans but the fame and attention goes straight to his head. Not even the kind words of his lovely wife could take him off of his high horse.<br/><br/>From the very beginning of the movie, Mozart was shown as a very childish young man. Not only was he childish, but he was also disrespectful. There was no one above him as far as people to respect. His father tries to steer him in the right direction but goes with no success. After being banished from his original home he seeks redemption in a new country. He goes to try and conquer another city with his remarkable musical talents.<br/><br/>The film itself was well written and well executed. The music was good and the majority of the actors fit their roles very well. Costumes and makeup were perfect; they really did a great job of giving you an idea of what people looked like in those days. The overkill wigs and the extreme dresses put me in the mind set so I could better understand the setting.<br/><br/>The major cause for my overall dislike of his movie was the character Wolfgang Mozart. The fact that Mozart was so obnoxious and immature made me happy to see the conclusion. His humor was never funny, his laugh was brain wracking, and his arrogance was angering. The only thing good about Mozart was his ability to crate music. I have no sympathy for people with his character.<br/><br/>For people who are interested in the life of a legend this would be a great movie. The director got the story right. The actors brought out the characters very well. The character Salieri was played very well. For the most part his is an overall good movie. I would rate it 4 out of 5. My personal opinion toward it is skewed off of my strong dislike for the character Mozart. Not everyone else may feel as strongly as I do but the movie itself was impressive."

","Long after his rival died at a young age and his world essentially obliterated by the Napoleonic wars, Antonio Salieri as played by F. Murray Abraham looks back on his life from the confines of an insane asylum. Everywhere the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is played and hummed familiarly by even the masses. Scholars study Salieri, the people from all walks of life listen to the notes that Amadeus put down for posterity.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a wonderful recreation of the court at Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna during the age of reason. The Hapsburgs have now become the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine as a result of Maria Theresa becoming the first female monarch of their empire. The empire and the court are now ruled by her son Joseph as played by Jeffrey Jones. <br/><br/>What I liked about the film is that author Peter Shaffer obviously researched with great care the period this rivalry between Salieri and Mozart takes place. Jones remarks on more than one occasion about letters he got from his sister Antoinette from the French court and what she's observing, but not quite understanding.<br/><br/>Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.<br/><br/>And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved. Besides those already mentioned I think you will enjoy Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's long suffering wife and Roy Dotrice as his more staid and settled father who can't cope with a mercurial genius of a son any better than Abraham can.<br/><br/>And Amadeus brought a revival of interest in the old classical masters and that's always a good thing."

","Amadeus represents a humanistic film on the grandest stage. An excellent period drama, the film draws the viewer into Romantic Vienna, cultivator of masterful talents, and home to a foreigner, the young, extremely talented, and quite conceited Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film beautifully contrasts Mozart's poor handling of his immense talent with his rival, Antonio Salieri's, contemplations on mediocrity and his attempts to carry out his only wish, to be the mouthpiece for God through his music.<br/><br/>Alas, it could not come to fruition for Salieri, as he must sit back and admire the genius of Mozart while at the same time be appalled by his chauvinistic and childish mannerisms. Salieri always acts with composure toward Mozart and never ceases to assist the man in his times of need. Behind the scenes, however, Salieri questions his faith, even burning the cross of Jesus in a powerful scene. The man cannot understand how God could make Mozart the instrument of such musical beauty.<br/><br/>The movie Amadeus is the centerpiece for some of the finest music ever put on film. The film's music is a character of its own, always in the background enhancing the action on screen. The film, despite its length, feels like a true journey into the heart of two men driven by music. It is hard to watch Mozart mishandle the great gift that he was given, but it is more painful to watch Salieri unable to move past mediocrity despite all of his attempts.<br/><br/>Without question, this is one of the finest films ever crafted. It features amazing performances from the cast, and the script is amazingly adapted by the playwright Peter Shaffer. Its 8 Oscars are duly noted, for Amadeus presents itself on screen like few other films have in history.<br/><br/>A powerful example of jealousy, humanity, talent, and music, the film Amadeus serves as an instrument for bringing the genius of Mozart to life and for bringing the real drama of two men's struggles onto the big screen in a very entertaining and emotional way. This film is a masterpiece of cinema, and one of the most deserving 10s I have ever reviewed."

Most would say that this is a bold statement given the utterly unfathomable number of marvelous movies that have been created throughout the world; once you recognize the genius of the man behind the music, though, it becomes much clearer. Whether you first saw Amadeus in 1984 and many times since or are watching it for the first time, you're fascination with Mozart, his life and music will only be enhanced. Even if you have no interest in classical music, the passions of this film will reach every emotion. This film is a must see for all... truly a 'triumph deluxe!'"
"gazebo350","9","3","6","4 February 2007"," Amadeus as entertainment
","Admittingly this is a highly entertaining film. the historical accuracy is poor however. salieri as everyone should know by now was not Mozart's assassin. this was a tale that was bruited about for sometime without foundation. turning perhaps the greatest musical genius that has ever lived into a buffoon however is an even greater travesty. however once you have jumped this hurdle the movie offers much entertainment in its showing of scenes from some of his most famous operas. costumes and sets are superb of course and very life like. still it is many miles ahead of the pablum that was offered back in the 1940's in terms of bios of great composers. Mozart was a man of many moods. childlike in some ways. and naive of the ways of the world in others perhaps. scatological jokes were rampant however in the lives of the southern Germans (mozarts father) and Austrians (mozarts mother). you would have to read of the letters these two sent each other to know that bodily functions in the 18th century were much more out in the open than in todays much greater privacy. that would help explain Mozart's sometimes out of the norm tom foolery. it was part of the patois of the time. still you have occasion to hear some of the most beautiful music written and i suppose be grateful for that. when will we ever have a lifelike portrayal of the great composers? a brilliant spectacle non the less."

","Movie Review Amadeus was a wonderful about the life of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and it tell whether Salieri is a murderer. The main characters were played by the phenomenon actor F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulked who played Mozart. Antonio Salieri was the psycho everyone said in this movie. This movie brought the spectacular music of both Mozart and Salieri. This tale was talented. It started out as old Antonio telling of the life of Mozart while in an asylum. It was a tale of pure talented and jealousy ending in tragedy. This movie was a good movie that director Milos Forman made to inform and also entertain the viewer of the life of such a great composer as Mozart. I give it 4 ½ out of 5 star. Get the DVD or VHS and watch it."
"conspracy-2","10","3","6","19 October 2006"," F. Murray Abraham is excellent
","Amadeus is in no way the perfect Mozart/Salieri biopic. It takes tremendous liberties with the truth, but that's no matter: it's entertaining and inspiring beyond belief. Mozart's natural musical acumen which Salieri envies so much is portrayed beautifully, and I almost felt myself becoming better at appreciating the highest ideals of music through his descriptions. The scene in which Salieri and Mozart work on getting the Requiem down on paper is the highlight of this side of the film: hearing and understanding the separate layers before hearing them altogether is a goose-bumpingly great experience.<br/><br/>And F. Murray Abraham is an astonishing presence in the film. At one point, a rather poor actor playing a doorman comes to the door as Salieri is giving a lesson. The doorman delivers his line flatly, but Abraham's acting, in comparison to that, is incredibly nuanced, natural-looking, well-performed and believable. That's when I discovered that he won that Best Actor Oscar for a very,very good reason indeed."
"vox-sane","10","3","6","25 April 2006"," Great Movie Despite Silly Premise
","The window-dressing (halls, clothing, lighting, etc.) lend ""Amadeus"" an appearance that is scrumptious, and looks extremely accurate. All the scenic design is icing on a delicious cake half-baked on a silly premise, that Mozart(presented almost like an idiot savant, with emphasis on the first word) is -- and here's the spoiler, if there's a person on the planet who doesn't know -- ""murdered"" by fellow composer Antonio Salieri. That ""Amadeus"" isn't like a hollow Faberge egg with a dumb morality tale rattling around inside it is a tribute to the artists behind this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri is the pop sensation of his day. He has the approval of the emperor, the friendship of the court, the adulation of the masses. He lives in palaces, moves with the ""in"" crowd, and the fame and adulation keep rolling in. He has a burning ambition to be the best -- and for everyone to know it. He has everything . . . except talent.<br/><br/>He hears distantly of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, boy prodigy, and he hopes one day to meet this musical marvel and strike up a friendship with a fellow artiste. When the fabled Mozart finally crosses his path, Salieri is appalled by the young man's vulgarity and his lack of appreciation for the finer things.<br/><br/>Yet when Salieri hears Mozart's music, he desperately desires the one thing Mozart has that he himself lacks: musical genius. This comes through powerfully later in the film when Salieri tricks Mozart's wife into bringing him Mozart's ""originals"" -- page after page of rough draft music that was written out finished, and beautiful, and better than anything Salieri himself could even do (this is the most famous scene in the movie and may have been instrumental in winning for Abraham his deserved Oscar). And when Salieri learns Mozart had been fiddling around with his girl, he earnestly hates Mozart with an earnest detestation.<br/><br/>Though he refers to Mozart as a ""creature"" he envies him. Mozart has proved that everything in his life is superficial, and that he has never, and probably will never, produce anything of lasting value. Just as everything in his life has been outward show, he easily abandons his superficial religious faith. Instead of disbelieving in a Deity who could dispense His gifts to such a man as Mozart, Salieri's envy and hate sets him on a course to ""punish"" God by ridding the earth of the creature that makes such pretty noises. And he will gain public admiration forever by authoring a requiem for his ""friend"" -- though, in his wry sense of irony, Salieri will make W.A. Mozart actually write the thing before he kills him off.<br/><br/>Salieri performs several little cruelties on his way to the ultimate cruelty. The restored DVD version gives a scene where Salieri savagely humiliates Mozart's wife, Constanze.<br/><br/>It is not clear if Salieri the anti-God actually killed Mozart or if it was the natural order of things, but Salieri gets his comeuppance, his own ""Confutatis maledictis"" that is helped along by the more savvy Constanze, who knows what sort of man Salieri really is. The scene where Salieri and Mozart hammer out the Mass is one of the most exciting scenes of cinema in the '80s -- with one man sitting at a desk and the other lying in a bed! <br/><br/>In real life, Antonio Salieri was an accomplished musician, many of whose works remain in print. His stuff fell out of favor -- but Vivaldi predated Mozart and Salieri, and his music was barely heard after his death until the 20th century! Musical tastes change -- how many discotheques are open in the 21st century? Not as many as in the 1970s, I warrant. And there are ample implications in the historical record that Salieri and Mozart got along quite well. So the story inside the beautiful decor is a libelous fiction -- in fact, it's a lot of hooey. But when have novels or films cared for historical fact over a cracking good story? And it's probably more correct to call it a parable.<br/><br/>Mozart and Salieri aren't really meant to be embodiments of their real-life counterparts. Salieri is an archetype. And if Mozart was this much of a bozo in real life he deserved all he got.<br/><br/>All the performances are wonderful, especially in the Emperor's court. Charles Kay is superb, Jonathan Moore is the epitome of sincerity, and Jeffrey Jones expresses more by his extreme underplaying than many more notable actors do in several movies of bluster. Sometimes you wonder if someone ought to take Jones' pulse, but you're always aware of what the emperor is thinking.<br/><br/>The two majors are amazing. Tom Hulce's pixilated Mozart and F. Murray Abraham's envious Salieri are so good they could've carried the movie if it had been a two-man show, a ""My Dinner with Wolfie"""
"glennsouthall","10","3","6","22 April 2006"," Salieri does not hate Mozart.
","First of all, let me say that Amadeus is as flawless a movie as I have ever seen, with probably the finest acting job in motion picture history in F.Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri. It is a delight for the eyes, for the ears and the heart from beginning to end. But I am only repeating most reviewer's comments in saying this. What I wanted to pick up on is that time after time I read in the reviews of Salieri's hatred for Mozart....but this could not be further from the truth. Salieri is consumed with hatred, that much is true, but not for Mozart, rather for himself and a fickle God. He hates himself when realising in his heart that he will only ever be mediocre and God who should mock his mediocrity by bestowing the very gifts that he had coveted (genius and popularity)in the form of a crude and childlike person such as Mozart.<br/><br/>I ask all of you who have described Salieri's hatred for Mozart to watch the movie again and consider the truth..... Here are the things to look out for;<br/><br/>Salieri never appears angry when listening to, or reading Mozart's music, quite the opposite. He sees and hears only beauty - even the voice-over confirms this. Watch Salieri's eyes and facial expressions whenever he is talking directly to Mozart. Often we see adoration, awe, even love - and sometimes coyish embarrassment....but never hatred...never anger. Even when Salieri is trying to kill Mozart (to spite God and to appease his hatred of himself) his eyes can only offer pain and love. Watch what happens when Mozart collapses near the end of the movie. If Salieri really hated Mozart could he be so gentle and caring? And when he helps Mozart to complete his Requiem on his deathbed, every mannerism and gesture of Salieri speaks only of admiration and adoration. If Salieri had truly hated Mozart he would have been joyful at the success of his scheme. Finally, when Mozart is buried in a paupers grave - there is no sign of Salieri's joy at finally dispatching a great and hated rival. His demeanour speaks a very complex language of sadness mixed with uncertainty, doubt and self-loathing.<br/><br/>Watch the movie again and you will see why I said earlier that F Murray Abraham's acting job was the finest I have ever seen, because the subtlety of his gestures, the silent emotions etched in his face and his eyes all bear witness to the truth. Salieri adored, and maybe even loved, Mozart."
"zolaaar","9","3","6","30 January 2006"," 250th Anniversary Tribute, More Than Deserved
","Externally an ostentatious and grandiose highlight of the epic wide screen cinema, innerly a complex, moral essay about the classic motive of the vain who dares to start a fight with almighty powers, ""Amadeus"" was an enormous success, received eight Oscars in 1984 and three further nominations which was more than deserved in all respects.<br/><br/>The plot is half based on facts, half fictitious (especially the core of it - the relationship of Salieri and Mozart and their characterizations). In 1823 Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) claims, while being in a hospital, he had murdered Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and tells a young priest the story about him and the superstar of the classic period. 40 years earlier, Salieri is the court composer of Kaiser Joseph II. (Jones), young Mozart (Hulce) appears in Vienna. He is a nervy, foolish, voluptuous contemporary and laughs provokingly and grossly - but above all he wants to prove that he is the greatest composer of all time. After a short time, Mozart is introduced to the Kaiser, rewrites a quick authored composition by Salieri into a little, ingenious masterpiece, which later slips into ""The Marriage of Figaro"". He casts Katerina Cavalieri (Ebersole), Salieri's favorite student, for this opera in the lead role. And, to complete his luck in life, he marries Constanze (Berridge) and becomes the teacher of the Kaiser's niece. Salieri, meanwhile, starts to be more and more impressed by the divine music of Mozart and gets obsessed with the idea to murder his rival. In his life he only sees the sense to destroy the muse who seems to be predestined by God in creating such a terrific music. Salieri fights, intrigues, not only against Mozart, but also against God who apparently does not hear the desperate entreaties of making himself, Salieri, the divine musician on this Earth. That's why he burns the cross and tries everything to let Mozart die.<br/><br/>Forman stages a story of insanity  the insanity of Mozart and the insanity of Salieri, which are so contrary as are both characters. On the one side, you see the young, agile, in love with life Mozart, who thinks he is the greatest composer of his time. He is a lunatic showing that he does not work as a musician, he lives the music. He composes every single note in his mind, hears a whole score before writing it down. He is a person who tries to escape his dominant father, who faces life so unpractically that he has found the happiness in his wife, Constanze. She loves him unquestioningly and sees to do everything so that their little family can exist and survive. Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge are playing their roles enthralling and wonderfully convincing. On the other side, there is Salieri, a self-obsessive man, who has the same dream as Mozart, but inwardly doubts his own skills and talent. In prayers, he obligates God as an ally to make his dream come true. Salieri lives in the condition of extortionate, egocentric insanity. He puts himself the claim to absoluteness. A staunch ascetic who works hard and intransigent. And then Mozart appears, a goofy clown, a ridiculous twit who makes supernatural music. Ravished by Mozart's music and ravingly jealous and envious at the same time, he starts to develop grim hatred and obsessive thoughts of murder. F. Murray Abraham plays the fictitious character Salieri grandiosely complex which makes it to one of the psychologically most interesting figures in cinema's history and got him the Oscar for Best Performance of the year.<br/><br/>The music also plays a sustaining role. There is probably barely another picture who incorporates given original material that perfectly makes Mozart's music a piece of the entire film in such an obliging way. It even takes the effect of being written only for it. In the course of the plot, one will see the core scenes of four Mozart operas: ""The Abduction from the Seraglio"", ""The Marriage of Figaro"", ""Don Giovanni"" and ""The Magic Flute"", and the staging of them are perfectly arranged and choreographed. Also captivating is the scene shortly before Mozart's death, when Mozart lies in the bed, composing a requiem in his head and telling Salieri to write down the notes to it. At the same time, music builds up for the viewer in the background, making it a seven minutes scene of impressing cinematic magic. Here is the genial mastermind of music, sick and bed-bound, and there is the clerk, staggering between awe, admiration, envy, despair, fantasies of obliteration, who holds the magnum opus, who sees the notes which he has written down but hasn't created, who sees how Constanze locks it in a cabinet after Mozart's death the next morning because she thinks that this composition has killed her husband. Salieri looks at the notes behind the glass door for the last time, a divine requiem, which, after all, is responsible for the death of Mozart. He succeeded in letting him die. Yet God took revenge on Salieri: Wasting away in a hospital, his music is forgotten, but Mozart's creation remains immortal. <br/><br/>Forman's ""Amadeus"" is an epic, where everything fits, a subtle, prudential composition, just like Mozart's operas. It's a dramatic, but at the same time comical production. Decors, the costumes, the baroque splendor of the absolutism, the cast, the music, the dialogs - everything is ingeniously attuned to one another. One does not have to be fond of classical music to appreciate this film. Some even say, through ""Amadeus"" you can get really enthusiastic about Mozart's music. But above everything the film is a story of a struggle: The insanity of an egotist against the insanity of a genius. And this Story is told in an immensely enthusing way. The question, if it complies the facts of the historic biographies of both lead characters correctly is completely unimportant because after all ""Amadeus"" is a cinematic, opera like drama and not a document on history."

","Surely one of the best films of the 1980's, or even perhaps of the last quarter of the 20th century. Everything about this movie, from the complete character foil of Amadeus compared to Salieri, the conflict within conflict storyline of the rise of genius versus the toil of mediocrity, to the ultimate demise of 2 men, one whose talent is consumed by the ravages of alcohol and guilt while the other's soul is consumed by the power of envy. It's the very rare modern day film, with all the trappings of today's film debauchery (language, sex, violence, etc.) that could just as easily have been produced back in the golden age of Hollywood (pre-1950.) F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is truly Oscar award worthy. What better way to teach history than to show it through the eyes of the third person in which every step of the title character's role is seen with enough detail as to not confine the character within the facts of histories already known. Yes, as within most Hollywood's rendering of history, there are surely many facts that have been left to the director/screenwriter's interpretation, but then again - this is entertainment, not education.<br/><br/>A must see."
"Sledgeh101","10","3","6","21 June 2005"," Stretching the truth never looked so beautiful
","If you've never seen this movie before, you may be forgiven for thinking that you're about to watch a biography about Mozart. The truth is that the movie (and the play this movie is based on) take quite a few liberties in trying to make a dramatic point. Just as in other movies about larger-than-life personalities (think ""JFK"" by Oliver Stone, and you get the idea), the point of this is that it's a MOVIE first, and fact second (or possibly further down the line).<br/><br/>Having gotten that out of the way, let me also say - IMHO, this is one of the best movies you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a 17th century composer, Antonio Salieri, who one night decides to attempt suicide by slashing his wrists. He's soon brought to a mental hospital, and in the morning a young priest comes in to talk to him. He then goes on to discuss the events that brought him to this point - specifically, his jealousy and hatred of Mozart (it's quite amusing to see him perform a few bars of his own music for the priest, to try and get some recognition out of him, and only 'succeeds' when he starts playing Mozart's famous Eine Kleine Nachtmusik - you'll recognize it too when it starts playing).<br/><br/>The movie shows in rich detail Mozart's life, primarily starting when Salieri first met him in person at a concert for the Archbishop of Salsburg. What makes Salieri burn is that Mozart appears to be a ""filthy, dirty creature"" with a foul mind - and that his music seems to come directly out of Mozart's head, ""without corrections of any kind"". During the course of the movie, Salieri's anger and jealousy start to consume him, until he devises a plot to 'kill' Mozart and get his revenge on God (the anger in old Salieri's eyes, and the fear in the priest's, make that scene the most powerful one for me).<br/><br/>Besides the beautiful music of Mozart that fills the movie, one of the things that makes this movie work so well is how they made 17th century Vienna look authentic, giving you a feel of what life must have been like back then (of course, some of the stuff was probably also enhanced by the people making this movie, but you'd be hard pressed to point out any problems). My favorite 'play within the movie' has to be where Salieri is watching Mozart's version of Don Giovani. Besides the haunting music and wonderful singing, it's the attention to detail - including 'demons' swirling around with lit torches - that really make this movie stand out.<br/><br/>Regardless of what type of movie you normally would watch - action, comedy, horror, whatever - I urge you to watch this movie at least once. You'll be better off for having done so."
"Silver_Dollar","10","3","6","22 March 2005"," A text book definition of a perfect film
","Impeccably executed - A brilliant fusion of music and drama beautifully written and acted. As someone who detests musicals I was spared the My Fair Lady scenes where the protagonists spontaneously breaks into song and instead the music does not dilute the drama and momentum of the film. Neither does the film suffer from the emptiness and superficiality which is prevalent in costume dramas. The brilliant screenplay by Peter Shaffer and the masterful direction of Milos Forman skilfully handles the comedy and tragedy behind Amadeus in a way that leaves the viewer emotionally drained just as he did with One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest. Every creative aspect of this film is perfect from the opulent locations and interior settings of modern day Prague, which were used as a back drop for 17th century Vienna, to the unforgettable performances. Then there is of course the sumptuous score by Neville Marriner which is skilfully employed to enhance the cocktail of emotions on screen. I cannot recommend this film more highly.A must see."
"gengar843","8","3","6","16 March 2005"," Scribbling and Bibbling
","I would like to make some short comments. 1. Acting - a. F. Murray Abraham - there wasn't much for him to do except brood. Flashes of intensity, but for the most part, he seems swept through the action by happenstance. b. Tom Hulce - over-the-top performance still made believable by the restraint of the script. Especially convincing is Mozart dictating to Salieri. c. Elizabeth Berridge - unconvincing, underplayed to a fault. Relying on script and costuming is a poor way to make a living as an actress. d. Jeffrey Jones - made an impact on me as a catalyst and not a flunky of the circumstances. Leopold's brief interactions are nonetheless very important to the storyline. 2. Writing - the plot line is pretty cool: a little bit of Hitchcock straining at the leash, but mainly we're treated to a chronology of Mozart's works, albeit truncated and jumpy. The subplots concerning Mozart's father and Wolfie's wife are thin, and to me don't add any substance to the transitions nor the ending. What stands out is the God-given talent of Mozart, which is brilliantly displayed in both the context and the acting. Hulce brings to life the torture of genius. What it feels like to be blessed by God, which can also be a curse. He has all the music in his head, and the rest is just ""scribbling and bibbling."" To say that Mozart worked himself to death wouldn't be outlandish, even knowing that his alcoholism contributed mightily. But which was the killer? Was it the strain of dealing with all the music that wanted to be released, or was it liver and/or kidney failure? The ambiguities here and in Salieri's story are riveting, if ultimately unsatisfying. One moral I came away with: be happy for what you DO have, for jealousy will drive you mad as surely as ambition will drive you into the earth. 3. Design - costuming was heroic, and the settings were impeccable. The extras were very believable, and the atmosphere reeked of baroque. A little more definition of Vienna was perhaps needed just to reel you in a little deeper, but I'm being trifling here. 4. Music - I'm not crazy for Mozart, but I walked away with a greater appreciation for the prodigy and his vocation. I've always looked on Wolfgang Amadeus, the composer, as very pompous in his assumptions concerning the listener, and this was pointed out in the film as well. Nevertheless, the pieces are short enough to placate my A.D.D. and yet long enough to satisfy my curiosity. 5. Objectionable Material - concerning sexual content, there is no nudity, but there is some adult speech. No violence."

","A fictional story revolving around the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), ""Amadeus"" is a tremendous achievement in film. The story is one of revenge fueled by the jealousy and overshadowing of another composer, Court Composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Mozart's work was considered the work and voice of God himself, and many including Salieri could not understand why God would give such amazing talent to such an undeserving man. Crude, vulgar, immature, and irresponsible, Mozart was all of these things...but he was also the source of music that had no equal and talent beyond all comprehension. Court Composer Salieri felt that he could not let God get away with such hypocrisy and made it his sole purpose in life to ruin and destroy the man who mocked him and highlighted his mediocrity. Through true genius and talent from many involved, ""Amadeus"" is simply, a flawless masterpiece in every aspect.<br/><br/>Entirely deserving of it's eight Academy Awards, it seems I'm not the only one who feels this way about this film. I consider it to be perfect, but the most impressive aspect of it to me is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the vengeful and envious Salieri. Through his performance and narration, one is swept away in the emotions his character feels to the point of understanding his hatred and intentions. Possibly a little out of his mind, you can empathize with his character as his feelings hurl him towards madness and violence. His performance as an old man is incredible and entirely believable right down to every mannerism. It's amazing. This is no doubt complimented by the excellent make up work done for this part of his character, which was also awarded an Oscar. Tom Hulce was perfectly cast as Mozart, the wild and unparalleled composer. Had his performance not been equally impressive, Abraham's performance may have not been as incredible as it wouldn't have been as easy to empathize and identify with. The supporting cast is also not to go unnoticed. An overall superb casting job.<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is...it's truly magnificent and makes the film. The costumes even further add to this atmosphere of realism.<br/><br/>There really isn't much else to say about it, it's simply one of the best films I have seen, complimented by an excellent story set in a very romantic time period in history about one of the most famous people in history.

","The first time I saw Amadeus, I was 13 years old. Although I always loved classic music I thought it was the dullest, longest film ever made. The only memorable line at that time being ""...people so lofty they sound as though they s*** marble!"" When I was 17 I saw it again and the mastery of the complete work slowly dawned upon me. I am now 29 and watch this film at least once per annum and there is always something fresh, witty and intriguing that I had missed on previous viewings. (Often when people ask how can you keep on watching the same film over and over, my answer is: why do you buy a painting?) The acting of F. Murray Abraham is indeed worthy of an Oscar. It is strange that he never again reached this acting peak in the subsequent years of his career. In the scene where (as an old man in the asylum) he narrates his fantasy of his intended murder of Mozart and the ensuing, beautiful funeral (...Mozart's LITTLE coffin, while from the choir the most heavenly music - composed by his dear friend, Antonio Salieri! Ssss...!!) I ask myself if better acting has ever been filmed. Also the music used in this film is masterfully selected an played by St Martin in the Fields. When 4 Mozart experts were asked to recommend a conductor for this project; the choice was made easy when all 4 wrote on their slips of paper: Neville Marriner. A film which is truly worthy of the clichés ""unforgettable"", ""masterpiece"" and ""monumental"". This film is not an accurate description of the Mozart-Salieri affair; but never claimed to be. Watch it - several times."

","Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time Amadeus is also the one movie that has it all, drama, laughs, great music, spectacle, and of coarse GREAT ACTING!  Is there a better-acted, more thrilling scene in all of cinema than the one at the end between Mozart and Salieri ?  F.Murray Abraham and Tom Hulse give us a tour de force that has seldom been seen in movies. 	Most people know the story of Amadeus so it's fruitless going into to many of the films main - plot points. It might help to note however that a lot of what is portrayed in the film is fictitious, Salieri didn't actually sit at Mozart's deathbed while he dictated the Requiem, this is fiction, but it is the stuff great dramas are made of.  On the director cut version of the film Peter Shaffer explains that the ending is his favorite scene in the whole movie because it is so unlike any other Hollywood movie.  Here is a climax of a film and it is basically two men composing a piece of music, no explosion, no shootout, and yet it is exciting.   Of coarse the set up and the story of Salieri's mad jealousy are all part why that scene works so well. Many other details of the actual story of Mozart are also fiction yet many other parts of the story are in fact true.   By combining fact and myth Peter Shaffer has created a truly great drama. This is also a movie that looks and sounds amazing. And although it evokes the 18th century perhaps more authentically than any movie this is also a film that refuses to take itself too seriously.  Milos Forman is a genius for the way he brought this play to the screen.  Another director may have made a dull, overly dramatic piece out of Shaffer's play.

","There is very little that I can say about this film that hasn't already been said.  For all the critics that say that this is not a correct biography of Mozart, well.... I don't think it is  meant to be that.  What is is however, is a masterful piece of film.  This movie is so well put together.... the writing, the acting , the editing, the cinematography.  F. Murray Abraham's performance in this is jaw dropping. His gestures, his glances while he is telling the story as an old man are incredible.  The anger and jealousy that he portrays are truly frightening!  Some of the scenes in this movie   stay with you for a long time.. for instance when Salieri recounts how moved he was when he saw ""The Marriage of Figaro"".. it was so beautifully written! I think his performance was standout like Meryl Streep's in Sophie's Choice. The rest.. the editing... the writing.. the costumes and sets are all wonderful. I consider this one of the best movies of the 80s. 10/10"

","it's strange, i don´t particularlly lisent to classical music but somehow this picture caught all my attention. this is a movie about wolfgang amadeus mozart and his rival antonio salieri. film starts with salieri (f murray abraham) conffesing he killed mozart, so he´s taken to an assylum after he deliberately cut his trhoat. there he meets with a priest and he tells him the story of when he met mozart. we watch salieri as a child wanting to be a great composer, but when he finally accomplished his dreams, mozart appears and salieri begins to feel that god has abandoned him and his hate for mozart grows very quiqly.<br/><br/>the plot is ok with some very good moments and situations. surely the best thing here is abrahams performance, it's wounderfull and exquisite, i kept thinking trough the whole movie what a good actor he is and then i thought about his short career and that he never did a protagonist role after this, what a pitty. tom hulce is good. the music is of the best (obiously, it's mozart) and direction by milos forman is his all time best.<br/><br/>special mention to jeffrey jones as the emperor (he's very funny).9/10."

Everything in this movie is grand. The music of course, but also the production, the sets and costumes. Top notch acting on all counts seal this as one of the best adaptations ever made. Admittedly, in strict comparison to the play, some important facets of the characters are missing, such as the depth of evil and conflict within Salieri and the sexual tension with Constanza. However, many a classic lines and scenes have been added to make up for it. Entertaining from start to finish, this is a film which will retain its quality for decades to come."

","Peter Shaffer's 'Amadeus' is back on general cinema release today - in Forman's original 'Directors Cut'. With an extra 20 minutes of added footage the film that blew me away as a kid did it again.<br/><br/>I sat like a stunned 10 year old in and was blown away all over again - I sat and laughed at Mozart's antic's, marvelled at the absolutely amazing music (especially the scene's of Mozart conducting his Operas), and gasped as he descends into an illness and madness forced upon him by Salieri.<br/><br/>This is cinema as it's meant to be - MASSIVE. Watching it again after nearly 15 years I saw how it's influenced today's cinema - most notably 'Moulin Rouge'. Weighing in at nearly 3 hours, and with the seriousness of the film it's certainly not for lightweights - the largly empty cinema (3 other people were in there I think) a testament to that fact. I think this is a sad indication of the current filmgoing public when the horribly terrible 'Reign of Fire' was showing to a nearly sold out audience at 1.30 on a Friday afternoon (the dragon's were nice tho).<br/><br/>This is a film that people NEED to see. It's about genius, it's about love, it's about hate, it's about tragedy. It'll make you laugh, gasp, and cry. It really is that good. If your into music the whole spectacle will make your jaw drop - if your not into music you should see the film at least 3 times until you are. It's definitely one of my top 10 all time faves."

I was subsequently appalled to learn that this was a complete fabrication; the real Salieri was a colleague of Mozart's and was not the jealous, evil villain portrayed in the movie.  That entire plot device was artistic license to artificially dramatize the story; doing so at the expense of a real person's (living or deceased) reputation is unacceptable.

"pooholf","10","3","6","26 November 1998"," The man who chose God vs. the man whom God chose
","A centuries-old Calvinist theory of pre-destination underlies Amadeus: a composer (Salieri) who dedicates his life and work to God becomes envious when he sees his efforts to please God met with indifference and scorn because God chose another (Mozart) as his musical incarnation. Salieri is perplexed beyond sanity that, in contrast with his own saintly lifestyle, the Chosen One is a vulgar runt who tells filthy jokes, plays around with women, and giggles like a hyena. Enraged and humilated when he recognizes that his hard work falls far short of Mozart's effortless superiority, he decides to strike back at God by trying to destroy his loved one.<br/><br/>Most of the music is Mozart's own, performed by major league musicians, and it is a rare thrill to encounter such music, so well performed, in a movie. But you don't need to like classical music to enjoy this picture, which contains high drama, profound character study, comedy and tragedy, and is a Thanksgiving feast for the eyes as well as the ears with its lush backgrounds and 18th-century costumes. A masterwork of a film, without weakness anywhere. Name any department: music, acting, direction, costumes, cinematography, and only one word applies to any of them: ""10""."

","This is possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  The movie is really about the mediocre composer, Salieri.  The title 'Amadeus' (Mozart's middle name) translated means 'gift of God.' It was Mozart's gift that has Salieri diabolically jealous.  In this way the movie becomes a study of his emotions.  As Salieri, F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning performance was the best I have ever seen.  The use of Mozart's music as the score is perfect. Don't stray from this movie because you think it will be boring.  'Amadeus' moves well, the narrative format keeps things going fast, it's also very funny in parts, and as the film approaches the ending it becomes very suspenseful and even a little spooky.

","This movie disgusted me. I felt like I was watching a badly-written skit from Saturday Night Live. What really bothered me the most was seeing Mozart, a truly self-centered bastard, go bonkers and not care that his wife and baby were starving to death. His wife had to beg for food from strangers because her husband was such a self-absorbed jerk. If this actually happened, then Mozart was very narcissistic and probably bi-polar, too. I'm tired of movies about crazy, self-centered geniuses. Too painful to watch. We were supposed to enjoy his kooky, wacky personality and crazy behavior, but I felt sorry for his wife, who was forced to suffer from his insanity."
"Rachel-20","10","3","7","7 December 2002"," Brilliant!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It defies criticism from a film-making perspective -- the costumes are wonderfully done, the acting is very good, and the script is great.  The shining element of this movie, though, is the music.  Not just Mozart's music (although you can't go wrong with that) but the use of it in the film -- the intertwining of it around the story, the way it seems to tell the story for itself at times.  The ending scenes with Salieri transcribing notes for Mozart is a perfect example of this. <br/><br/>The leads in Amadeus are extremely well-done.  F. Murray Abraham, as Salieri, earned every ounce of his Oscar in this role where he played both a 30-something composer, and the same tormented man 30-odd years later.  He *breathes* venom, dementia, and pain so naturally that one forgets that F. Murray Abraham was ever anyone *but* Salieri.  Tom Hulce and the supporting cast are good as well, but they can't touch Abraham in my opinion.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful, wonderful movie. Don't go in picking apart historical inaccuracies, if they exist; see it for the music, see it for the story, see it for the way it's all put together, and prepare to be overwhelmed."

The sets and period costumes, stunning.<br/><br/>Amadeus is nearly Shakespearian in it's deft portrayal of the Royal Viennese Court Composer, Soliare, who descends into a jealously so intense, it leads him to ruthless betrayal, murder and madness.  Then there is Mozart, the object of Soliare's all-consuming envy.  A brilliant musical genius who is haunted by guilt and insecurity driven into him by his father.  In the end, Soliare plays on Mozart's deepest fears, orchestrates his doom, and composes his untimely demise.  His most ambitious work, by far.  I think he would agree."
"DanB-4","10","3","7","6 September 1999"," Not great history, but great entertainment
","Oh, how I love this film. <br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning portrayal of Salieri alone makes this film infinitely watchable. I saw this at the age of 19 and walked out of the theater and for the first time said to myself, ""This is the best movie I have ever seen."" It currently sits high in my all-time top ten.<br/><br/>Don't go looking for history retold. Few true stories re-told accurately make great films. But the creative liberties taken here add spice, intrigue and drama and do not detract one bit from the film.<br/><br/>One of the great achievements of filmmaking and the best scene in this picture has Mozart, weakened by fever, essentially dictating his Requiem to Salieri. As the movement builds from Mozart's imagination, we can see Salieri finally accept the extent of his true genius. That is certainly director's Milos Forman's finest hour - especially when you stop to consider how badly that could have played out.<br/><br/>I think that those of use who grew up musicians appreciate this movie more, not because of Mozart, but because we can relate to the searing hatred and jealously of Salieri. For all of us, no matter how hard we tried, there was always someone better.<br/><br/>This movie translates poorly to the small screen, as do most epics - but it is still a worthwhile rental. Here you will see the peak of Forman's, Abraham's and Hulce's career, played out with a little bit of history and heaps of extraordinary entertainment.   Without question,  **** out of ****."
"hartig","10","3","7","15 August 1999"," My all-time #1!
","I don't know whether it's the music, the dialogue, the costumes, the superb performances, or the moving drama.  But something about ""Amadeus"" puts this ahead of such powerhouses as ""The Godfather"" and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" on my favorite movie list.<br/><br/>Being that I'm a musician, seeing such an enjoyable (albeit fictional) account of the Maestro probably helps a lot.  W.A. Mozart - though he is really not the main character - is portrayed as an 18th century wild-guy. His musical talent is treated with the respect it deserves, but with a flair of sexual playfulness, all-night partying, and defiant zaniness.  Mozart is undoubtedly the finest composer of music ever to live.  But the added twist on his corny demeanor and fish-out-of-water relationship with the Emperor's court makes the film so much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Special kudos go to F. Murray Abraham for his unforgettable and passionate portrayal of Antonio Salieri and to Jeffrey Jones for his underestimated portrayal of Emperor Joseph.  Tom Hulce - like George C. Scott with Patton - will forever be identified with this character.  He does a miraculous job turning Mozart into a classical version of Jimi Hendrix.<br/><br/>Note that this movie (and the stage version from which it was derived) is pretty much total fiction.  While some elements of the film are accurate, no evidence exists that suggests that Salieri and Mozart had such an adversarial relationship.  Salieri also had nothing to do with the composition of Mozart's ""Requiem.""<br/><br/>But don't let this spoil the fun.  ""Amadeus"" is a fine example of film-making at its most rewarding.  Watch it!!!"
"Spleen","10","3","7","10 August 1999"," All biopics about creative artists are virtually identical - this one excepted
","Thank heavens there's none of that tortured genius stuff.  You know the line: X is a great composer, but what makes him great is that he pours out the innermost secrets of his soul when he sits down to write music, music which burns with blah, blah, blah.  Mozart here is a professional musician of abnormal talent, but his talent is no more a part of his soul than, say, his political beliefs are, and his character has neither more nor less depth than Salieri's does.  When Mozart suffers it's for the same mundane reasons that everyone else suffers.  This allows Forman and Shaffer, for once in history, to tell a different story about a composer.<br/><br/>The legend of Mozart and Salieri is an old one now and this movie is really the story of the legend.  Considered purely as a legend it's one of the best stories I know of.  (Considered as fact it's false.  This makes no difference to the aesthetic worth of ""Amadeus"".  A legend is a legend.) Salieri is a mediocrity who ascends to some measure of success by dint of hard work and perhaps a little bluff.  Mozart is a genius who composes better music than Salieri ever could, without any effort.  Salieri's unique torture is that he is the only person who can see this - indeed, Salieri is in all respects the only clear-sighted person in the entire film.  Salieri is SO clear-sighted that when he later expresses the belief that divine intervention was responsible for some of the things that happened, I am inclined to believe him (in the film, that is; not in real life).  ""I'm a vulgar man,"" says Mozart at one point.  ""But I assure you, my music is not."" Mozart really is intolerably gauche, but all in all no-one understands him so well as Salieri does.<br/><br/>Many of the events seem like padding in retrospect but a particular kind of atmosphere has been so carefully built up that I'm reluctant to suggest that any particular scene was unnecessary.  One thing I think ought to have been omitted was the section detailing Mozart's ""vaudeville"" compositions.  All it does is reinforce the most ridiculous and irrelevant of Shaffer's themes. Mozart's worth, Shaffer is saying, was best suited to and best appreciated by the lower orders of society, by the Common People.  Aristocrats just didn't have a clue and preferred to listen to stodge.  This (a) is a tiresome cliché, (b) is the complete reverse of the truth and (c) undercuts the pure beauty of the Mozart and Salieri legend to some degree (since it's essential that Salieri be the only person who realises Mozart's worth while Mozart is alive).<br/><br/>This is a minor quibble.  Forman and Shaffer have so adroitly avoided the dreadfully hammy postures of classical music movies that I can forgive this inconsequential slip.  They've even avoided the temptation to simply quote all the best bits of Mozart's music.  Music is instead chosen for its dramatic effectiveness and appropriateness.  Compare ""Amadeus"" to ""Immortal Beloved"" in this respect.  ""Immortal Beloved"" merely has a better soundtrack.  ""Amadeus"" is by far the better film."

"Chrissie","10","3","7","6 April 1999"," A masterpiece.
","Amadeus is as rich and deep as Mozart's own Requiem.<br/><br/>Most reviewers miss Salieri's fatal flaw, which is not his jealousy: it is his own monstrous ego which leads him into a Faustian abyss of madness. Mozart's egotism, in contrast, is the innocent egotism of a child. For all of Salieri's austere asceticism and Mozart's reckless abandon, it is Salieri with the guilty soul.<br/><br/>History was tampered with in the interests of dramatic effect. Mozart was not made more outrageous for the film in order to convey to a modern audience how shocking his behavior was. To the contrary, he was toned down, contenting himself with flatulating at parties rather than defecating on the table. Although Salieri did indeed plot politically against his rival, and although Mozart believed to his death that Salieri was poisoning him, the truth is that Mozart poisoned himself with alcohol and laudanum. An anonymous patron did indeed mysteriously commission the Requiem, but it was not Salieri. Mozart did dictate the Requiem on his deathbed, but to his pupil, Sussmeyer, whom Constanze hired to complete the work after her husband's death. Mozart really did keep Shinkenader and company waiting until the last minute for The Magic Flute, but while the cast partied downstairs, Mozart wrote feverishly upstairs while Constanze read to him and pumped him full of coffee to help him stay awake for the task. And so on.<br/><br/>Amadeus drew on sketches of original costumes and sets to depict Mozart's operas, and it is these details that add richness to the film. If for some reason you've put off seeing Amadeus this long, correct that oversight now. It's worth it."

Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called ""Mozart"", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.<br/><br/>What's that sound I hear... oh yes... it's old Wolfgang turning in his grave."

","Amadeus is the fictionalized biography of one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most famous classical composer to ever walk the Earth. It tells the story from the point of Antonio Salieri, a contemporary composer, whose name has been largely lost to history except for those that study musical history.<br/><br/>It's an all-around excellent period drama. The costumes and the visuals are top-notch, the score of course features some of the most recognizable pieces of classical music ever made and the production values in general are without any flaw. So it would be a pretty good film even if there was nothing else to it. But there is. This is one of my favourite character studies ever put to film. The character of Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fascinating one. In this film he's portrayed as a musical savant. A buffoon of a man, endlessly consumed by the vices of drink, flesh and luxury, yet within him play the bells of heaven. The arias of God himself make themselves heard through this wreck of a man. And Salieri, a man who has dedicated his whole life to God as thanks for his musical ability, absolutely despises him because of this. Why Mozart? Why not him? What glory has this man achieved to be worthy of the kind of music he's capable of producing?<br/><br/>And yet, despite all his flaws, despite all the contempt we heap upon him through Salieri, Mozart has redeeming qualities. His passion for music is unparalleled. His ability and sheer skill is without equals. He has flaws, vices, heavy leanings towards sin. And yet, though his music, the world is a brighter place because of him. And that has to count for something.<br/><br/>Amadeus places the story before history. There are many facts which happened quite differently. Yet it is a masterful story. Enchanting, deeply personal, philosophical and, above all else, captivating, it will make you weep for these poor souls captured in the webs of their own mortal failings."

Well, many people do pretend to be connoisseurs of art, but there are a few who can actually find a communion with music. One of them was Antonio Salieri, a decent composer but a brilliant connoisseur of music. To him, as he said it himself, Mozart was 'the voice of God', and Salieri could actually understand the genius' thought process behind writing the music. How would this man of extraordinary skills be of character? Would he silent the entire audience with his eloquence and profoundness, outside his music, as a person? <br/><br/>In 'Amadeus', Salieri gets his answer; if the true Mozart were like this, which is highly unlikely, then he would think of these high-brows as 'dlo trafs!'. In fact, Mozart, in Amadeus, is a prodigy in music who never takes anything seriously. Salieri wonders how such a creature could possess such genius; he feels God has purposely avenged Salieri by bestowing upon him average talents while handing Mozart infinite capabilities. As a lunatic in his old age in an asylum, Salieri narrates his life to a priest. In the amusing scene, Salieri plays two of his compositions to the priest and asks them to guess the name of the song, but the priest isn't able to. Then he plays a very familiar tune and the priest immediately recognizes the tunes. Salieri sighs, and slowly tells him that it was 'not' his work, it was Mozart's. It does not come as a surprise here: when I type Mozart in Word document, I get no spell error, but the moment I type Salieri, it is underlined in red!<br/><br/>Poor Salieri believes he has killed Mozart, and tells the priest about his lifelong dream to be a great composer and his contempt towards Mozart, the person while reverence towards Mozart's music. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fiendish, vulgar, lascivious and crude genius who later shows his soft side while Salieri is a passionate, soft-spoken Italian who then becomes two-faced, contemptuous, and monomaniacal and later lunatic. Mozart and his wife struggle to earn money while get fame and respect, while Salieri gets money and fame but struggles to earn talent. For Salieri, it is an internal defeat and hence he tries to bring down Mozart in whichever way possible while wholeheartedly lauding his music.<br/><br/>Much of the film is shown from the viewpoint of Salieri, but then shifts to Mozart's own personal life and hardships. The maid has been thoughtfully kept so that Salieri is able to tell from Mozart's point of view, in case some would be wondering how Salieri knew so much about Mozart's personal life. When Salieri tells about his first experience with Mozart, where the latter is shamelessly caressing his lover under the table in the palace, Mozart plays by telling his lover then wife, Constanze to guess the words spoken by him backwards, then speaks all lewd words. It does feel out-of-place hearing some of the lines here, especially 'eat my s**t' and 'kiss my a**' but nevertheless funny. The scenes with the Count in the palace are absolute bananas, especially to observe the stark contrast between Mozart and the others. Even Salieri's constant plotting is very interesting and enjoyable, especially his most knavish act with Constanze.<br/><br/>'Amadeus', however, fails to provide a thorough justification to its initial build-up. We know how Salieri loved Mozart's music but hated Mozart himself but the moment Salieri's role diminishes and the focus shifts to Mozart, it is difficult to actually sympathize with Salieri's guilt. It is a very common phenomenon, like if we have one actor playing a character for a period of time and then another actor takes his/her place and the audience feels a bit alienated. Also, Tom Hulce gave his Mozart a one-dimensional comic book quality that showed him throughout the 160 minutes of the film as a person of mediocre talents except when playing in those operas in the theater. It is almost impossible to believe that this Mozart was so profound, and 'Figaro' and 'Requiem' were his compositions. I'm not saying that an artist has to have that aura always; I have foul-mouthed, alcoholic, erratic friends who are good actors/musicians/composers/businessmen but these people had a certain quality in them that I could associate with their talent. And this erratic Mozart should have had that quality in him throughout the movie which could make me believe that he was the Mozart indeed. And the incongruous accent doesn't help either.<br/><br/>Salieri is played beautifully by F. Murray Abraham; his effectively gives his character the shiftiness while advising Mozart and honestly while praising his music. But I found the climactic scene between the two characters to be somewhat underwhelming; I know it was difficult to execute, but it still had to have so many more emotions stirring up in such circumstances. This also wore off the effect of the grand catharsis, which is similar but not as effective as the endings in Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange'. Much of this I find fault with Tom Hulce's sterile performance.<br/><br/>Out of the supporting characters, only Jeffrey Jones truly succeeded in playing his character with the right comedic seriousness. Elizabeth Berridge was competent but inconsistent, her accent not helping much either. The only turkey, according to me, was Simon Callow and the c-word was completely unnecessary in the movie. The music itself was brilliantly performed, all of them. One could see the faults with Salieri's congested arrangements and feel the depth of Mozart's compositions, especially in the requiem for his father. And I discovered that these compositions did have words- I was dumb enough to think these singers were warbling just notes, no words!"
"msbloch","10","2","4","20 November 2011"," Amadeus -- Genius unleashed
","Okay, ""Equus"" (by Peter Shaffer) is clever and original but a little far out. But Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" raises the ante by adding enveloping universal themes in a compelling dialog deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award. Who could not be moved by Salieri, the court composer, who initially promises to devote himself and his music to God. Only to realize that he is and will only be ""mediocre."" He is merely blessed ""with an ear"", and the knowledge, to recognize the pure beauty of the work of the silly and vulgar Mozart. As Salieri's devotion morphs into a battle against God and His instrument, Mozart, and as Salieri's schemes succeed and fail by chance and design, the twisting of Salieri's mind is depicted with the painful whisperings and gestures of hands and face (of Murray Abraham) in a way rarely seen on the screen. Iago (from Shakespeare's Othello) has nothing on Salieri. Except that Salieri has fallen and knows it and seeks absolution. As you leave the theater, you may ask why health, success, and happiness comes so effortlessly to the wicked and why the righteous are often overlooked. Or you may ask why Salieri did not simply embrace and foster the beauty in his midst. Or ask why Salieri was not satisfied with the bounty of his life. Most of us are content to hear ""the duet change into a trio into a quartet into a quintet into a sextet with more complex harmonies"" without reviling the composer. But Salieri reveals our darkside that sees another's perfect dive, perfect pass, perfect statement, or perfect notes that prompt ""why not me?"" Of course, the meaning of ""Amadeus"" -- ""God's love"" -- is not lost on the viewer and only contributes to the 10 of 10 rating the movie deserves. Kudos to Shaffer, Milos Forman (director), F.M. Abraham, Tim Hulce (who moves way beyond ""Animal House"" here to create the mathematically musical facility and obnoxiousness of Mozart), and the lighting and musical contributors in fitting the puzzle pieces together so nicely."

","Historical dramas have been many things in the history of cinema – tear-jerking melodramas, long-winded epics, painstaking biographies – but they have rarely been such good fun as this largely fictional black comedy set in 18th century Vienna. Sometimes mistakenly referred to as a biography, Amadeus is really a cheeky historical might-have-been, a storyteller's flight of fancy.<br/><br/>The greatness of Amadeus lies largely in its source material, a play by the renowned Peter Shaffer, who adapted the screenplay himself. Shaffer's twin Anthony was behind some of the best thrillers of the 1970s, and Peter shares his brother's dark wit, but with a mind more towards the dramatic than the suspenseful. It's true that for Amadeus he has updated a baseless rumour and embroidered the truth extensively, but this tale of childish rivalry between two classical composers is simply irresistible. The exaggeration of the characters of Mozart and Salieri, the former into a giggling schoolboy, the latter a stuffy hypocrite, drives the story forward. Shaffer weaves the myth of their antipathy into a fascinating and humorous study on fame, talent, jealousy and ego. The emphasis on Mozart's operas as turning points in the narrative, as oppose to his many symphonies or chamber music, appropriately demonstrates music as storyteller and backdrop for action.<br/><br/>Schaffer's play may be the mighty heart of this picture, but let us not play down the skill with which it has been brought to the screen. The first thing to make an impression is the lavishness of the sets and costumes, conjuring up the excessive glamour of the era, never totally clean, always a little dusty. Director Milos Forman however has such an ability to bring our focus in so totally on the actors that he can make us forget the extravagant backdrops. In example, for the interview scenes with the older Salieri, we move from the authentic clutter and bustle of the lunatic asylum, to suddenly having the background become a black and white blur, with F. Murray Abraham and the clergyman picked out crisply upon it. Still, the director does make clever use of the production design, a chandelier glittering eerily behind Abraham mirroring the fire on which he burns his crucifix. There is much cunning editing, not just of the image but also of the music, snatches of Mozart's compositions, accompanying such visual jolts as the appearance of Leopold, at other times disappearing in the middle of a scene, leaving a feeling of emptiness hanging in the air.<br/><br/>The cast is a good one too. F. Murray Abraham gives a masterful turn, at his best in his scenes as the older Salieri, full of wry cynicism and weary regret. Tom Hulce's Mozart is massively theatrical, but it's a hammy performance for a hammy character, and almost as much fun as watching Charles Laughton in full flow. Good as these two are, I would love to have seen the leads from the first Broadway production, Ian McKellan and Tim Curry, reprising their roles for the screen version. The standouts really are in the smaller roles, especially a witty Jeffrey Jones portraying the Emperor Joseph II as if he was some slightly incompetent manager. The almost universal American accents of the cast may seem a little unconventional, but really considering these characters would in reality be speaking German is no more or less accurate than them all sounding English. Besides it seems the smaller parts have been cast for the expressive range of their accents, some sounding bucolic, others pompous, giving us the idea of character as opposed to where they might be from.<br/><br/>Amadeus stands out amongst historical dramas for its mix of endearing wit and reflexive look at art and genius which is intelligent but never obscure. We are fortunate that it was produced in an era when production values were high enough to make it look stunning, after the days when censorship might have diminished its sharp edge and before the time when it could have been ruined by CGI cityscapes. This is cinema with every note in place."
"Geeky Randy","8","2","4","1 February 2010"," ""There are too many notes."" There are too many scenes.
","Shaffer adapts his play into film, which chronicles composer Antonio Salieri (Abraham) and his plot to ruin Amadeus Mozart (Hulce). Historically inaccurate, but then again it's not a biography. Even though Salieri knows Mozart is a genius, his jealousy craves the ranting towards Mozart's music, such as the Emporer's (Jones) criticism of one of Mozart's pieces having ""too many notes"". It appears Forman and Shaffer should have taken their own advice, as the film starts to drag significantly during the second half, mainly due to drawn out opera scenes. As the film comes to an end, the viewer can't help but feel satisfied by, not only a well-told story, but also (and more importantly) the brilliance of music contained in the film. Hulce was extremely critical about playing music, with musical scholars complimenting that every note of music matches that seen on screen, which is both a film and musical triumph!<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"
"freemantle_uk","8","2","4","20 September 2009"," Music making film
","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is one of the most famous musicians ever to walk the Earth, making some of the greatest pieces of music you will ever hear. He lived a tragic life, being taught to play and write music at a young age, living a life where music was the most important thing of his life, lived for most of his life in debt and died young. So a bio-pic of one of Austria's greatest sons seems like a great subject.<br/><br/>Amadeus is based on a play by Peter Shaffer, and directed by Milo Forman who did excellent work with another play conversion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (please note it was also a novel). The focus of this film is on the Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who was Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) of Austria's court composer. Salieri was a man who wanted to know Mozart (Tom Hulce) because of his talent, but dishearted to discovery he was really no more then a man-child. Mozart is rude, volga, insulting and loves nothing but to drink and party. He seems like he doesn't have to try to make great music and insults Salieri's efforts. Salieri sets himself a mission to destroy Mozart, making him lost favour within the court, make such he can't get money and drive him insane.<br/><br/>Let's start out of the good points. They is great music, there is no denying it. They are great pieces by Mozart and Salieri throughout the film. Even if you don't know classical music that well you properly heard some of Mozart's pieces. This film is Milo Forman's best performance as a director. I love One Flow Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but that was more an actor's film then one that show's a director's talent. With Amadeus Forman keeps the story going, focusing on the characters, the themes and uses the music to great affect. They are a number of good scenes throughout the film and he deserves a best director nod. He uses the music very effectively, such as when Salieri looks at Mozart's pieces on paper. They is wonderful art direction, getting the piece and the way the court look right. The Stanley Kubrick film Barry Lyndon must have been an influence. The script is well structured, going back and forth from the framing device. F. Murray Abraham offers an excellent performance as Salieri, being both a hero and a villain at the same possible. He deserved his Oscar as well. The film also looks at the themes of mass-produced music, whether it is better to produce music for the elites or the masses, the theme of envy and how it could affect a man to explore his dark side and the fact that Mozart's talent is both his gift and his curse; how it ended up destroying him.<br/><br/>But this film is not perfect. I did not like the casting of Tom Hulce, except for the scene of Mozart dying I thought his performance was weak. He has a very annoying laugh and just seems too focused on making the character look at something from the Frat Pack. Kenneth Branngh would was originally casted would have been a lot better. I also did not like the script using modern language and the use of profanity. I think this was done to dumb down the film and appeal to Americans ready then for artistic merit. The film is also historically inaccurate; normally it would drop points with me but they are strengths and I love the music. I dislike how Mozart was portrayed, being so immature and so volger. In real they was mutual respect between Mozart and Salieri. At times you couldn't feel sympathy for Mozart.<br/><br/>If you enjoy Mozart's music you will like this film. It is a good drama, but worthy of top 250? Doubtful. But it's worth watching."
"Lemniscate433","8","2","4","16 July 2009"," If you want a biography, get a textbook. If you want a story, watch this movie.
","The way the tag-line is written, the movie sounds like some Disney film. Amadeus. The man. The music. The magic. The madness. The murder. The mystery. The motion picture. Anyway, this movie is very great. The acting is great, the music is great, the scenery is great. It is just one of those lovable classic films.<br/><br/>So I guess from just the title of the movie, you can assume that this film is based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A biography if you may say. However, this movie is NOT a strict biography of Mozart's life. The movie is not a musical biography like Walk the Line or Ray. So if you were planning to learn all of the small details of Mozart's life, you ain't getting that in this movie. In fact, the background of the movie is based a lot on superstition and creative thinking with the relationship between Mozart and Salieri. We start off with Mozart's life in the movie with him proposing to Constanze, who is later known to be his wife and only wife. Before Mozart got married, there was so much more to his life as a child with the abuse of his father and having to travel all over Europe that could have supplemented his movie. Because in this movie, we learn that Mozart was not exactly a nice guy to be with. He was a social misfit, all because of a childhood he never had which was replaced by his father making him tour over Europe and showing off his musical abilities.<br/><br/>The main premise in this movie is about Salieri and the whole idea that he might have killed Mozart. Salieri tells the story from his perspective to a priest in an asylum about Mozart. Salieri was the most famous composer in all of England, but once Mozart came about, Salieri became a has-been. This got Salieri angry and the growing jealously of Salieri got him to the point where he dedicated his whole life to destroying Mozart. And like I said before, we do not know if this is true that Salieri did kill Mozart.<br/><br/>But enough with the negativity. I thought the acting was brilliant. Tom Hulce acts well as the unattractive and rowdy Mozart. F. Murray Abraham being Salieri was also just as great if not greater than Hulce. I mean they were both persuasive with their acting and used the material they were given for their characters and played it well. Also, there were scenes in the movie that you can tell required a lot of hard work to create because they either had a lot of men and women in the scene or because there was a great amount of sound editing going on. The director's cut clocks at three hours, but I guarantee you that you will be spell bounded for those three hours. Because although the movie does not have a fast pace, it still keeps you locked in.<br/><br/>I would say that the movie did have some scenes were it felt kind of 80s such as Mozart's antics and sexual insinuation that was placed in the movie. But none the less, this is a great story and I am glad that it was not a strict biography, because to tell you the truth, after watching this film, I would prefer this film over a strict biography. The creativeness that Forman and Shaffer add to it makes the movie only more special.<br/><br/>Low eight."
"joliefille411","10","2","4","19 September 2007"," The Ordinairy & the Extraordinary
","Such a combination of humor and bittersweet insight into the soul of the ordinary man, ah, it is divine.<br/><br/>Though named after Mozart, the story is truly about his contemporary, Antonia Salieri. And that is how his life is. Salieri longs for greatness, he pledges everything he has in order to attain it. Yet, he is only given just enough talent to realize how mediocre her truly is. Mozart, on the other hand- everything is about Mozart! He is a prodigy, gets attention from everyone, receives the blessed talent of God and his name endures far beyond his death. But what does Mozart do for it? Nothing! He is vulgar, crass, squanders his time, money and talent, and yet is magically versed in the language of angels. Salieri's consuming jealousy of and fascination with this man leads you down a gripping path of laughter and loathing.<br/><br/>Simply as a historical piece, I think this is an excellent movie. Tom Hulce expresses height of farce and wallows in the shallow depths of his patheticness in a way that brings a fresh contemporary air to the film. But even more than this, Amadeus is a look at the human condition. Each of us grapple with yearning for the greatness that so few attain. F. Murray Abraham more than deserved his Oscar for Saleiri. The biting insight drew smiles as well as tears of irony.<br/><br/>The music is, of course, superb. Apparently Tom Hulce plays, note for note, exactly what you hear in the film. Useless fact, but proof of meticulous attention to detail. The costumes and sets are lovely and the supporting actors are all very good. Credit should definitely be given to the writers, without whom, we would not have such endearing lines:<br/><br/>Emperor Joseph II: Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Just cut a few and it will be perfect.<br/><br/>Mozart: Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?"

","Even thought i have seen this movie before, i had never seen it in it's complete glory until two nights ago, when it aired on TV.<br/><br/>My eyes were literally glued to the screen, soaking up every detail of the settings, costumes, and my ear were at the same times blessed with incredible music.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is following. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is born in Salzburg. He has an incredible talent for writing music, and he uses that talent to become of of the most popular composers in Wien. Even though the movie is called ""Amadeus"" i feel the main character is Mozart's rival and antagonizer Salieri, played by F. Murray Abraham to perfection. It starts out as simple jealousy from Salieri's side, but i quickly becomes personal when Salieri finds out that Mozart have slept with the woman he coveted. He begins to plot the murder of Mozart.<br/><br/>Milos Forman, who have made ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"" before, flawlessly brings the story forward in a calm, but never boring pace, despite the long running time of 180 minutes. (Keep in mind, this is the Director's Cut) The Acting is brilliant from all around, specially Abraham and Tom Hulce, who bring both comedy and tragedy to the character of Mozart.<br/><br/>The Music is awesome, for lack of a better word. The composer have done a great job capturing the old school opera sound.<br/><br/>The Cinematography is also brilliant, taking time capturing the set design and costumes.<br/><br/>Speaking of Costumes, you can see the effort they put into each piece of clothing they wear in this.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping this movie from being a 10 is that the ending seemed to abrupt and i was not really fond of Salieri's ending speech.<br/><br/>""Mediocrities everywhere...

","Amadeus is one of my all time unsurpassed movies.<br/><br/>It's a biopic on Mozart. In terms of plot however it does not play like a biopic. The story is about as faithful to Mozart Amadeus Wolfgang as Forrest Gump was to Forrest Gump. Mozart in Amadeus is a drunken buffoon whose music talent comes so naturally it's merely something he does between scenes for shits and giggles. The real story is how green with jelly the films narrator gets. He hates Mozart yet we rely on him to tell us the story. At any minute during the film you expect the narrator to have a fit of jealousy and stop narrating. On the contrary it never happens because the narrator is a student of music. He loves Mozart's music as do we. This only further exasperates how jealous of Mozart he must be which in turn reinforces how funny it is.<br/><br/>I love this film for its humor, for its music and most of all for its epic depiction of envy. No film or medium better encapsulates the essence of envy than what is presented to us in Amadeus in the form of Salieri."

Mozart was a genius, he was insanely genius and Salieri was jealous and he wanted to take advantage and to play him... Mozart was like a messenger from God to him and Salieri never understood that someone with such a talent was so weird and so pervert in the real life...

","This is a fine example of what Bordwell & Thompson call 'classical Hollywood film-making,"" and what Mark Cousins, in his book, The Story of Film, defines as 'closed romantic realism."" The defining mark of this method is a rigourous narrative order where everything is ultimately explainable. Every door that is openedshuts.<br/><br/>This method creates worlds or worldviews that could only be regulated by a rational (pre-existential) god. Every event has its place on a causal chain, every loose end is tied up, and there is no room for ambiguity or chance.<br/><br/>Of course, we're looking at this through Salieri's eyes, and whatever we see could be explained as a kink in his insane mind. But it doesn't really matter. What we have is a scrupulously sane recounting of events that led Salieri to the mental institution. There is a unity to this retelling that is a reflection of Salieri's understanding of events sewn in to the story's form. Every event in the film is motivated. There is not a look, a phrase, a camera move that is not subservient to the aims of the story. The characters' motives are transparent and conform to an uncomplicated, clearly readable, psychology.<br/><br/>We have an aesthetic of sensation to keep the audience entertained, and all that is missing there is the sex. It is censored out by Salieri's chaste consciousness, substituted for sweets. This sounds like a particular brand of mainstream cinema, which Salieri actually embodies. Competent enough but without depthlacking magic.<br/><br/>We get to indirectly recognise that magic, but never do we see its point of view.<br/><br/>This is a celebration of the Salieris of the world, not the Mozarts."

"Sylviastel","10","2","4","3 November 2006"," Breathtaking! Stunning! Worthy of Every Award!
","There are few films out there even today that can match Amadeus' incomparable genius. For starters, the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F. Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two rival composers. When Abraham speaks, you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well. He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well. It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri. Anyway, the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable. The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries, jealousies, and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred. Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support. I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor. Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole. British actors like Roy Dotrice (when will be honored) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same. It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view. You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna. Salieri's father died while he was young. We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens. Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music. He loved parties and people while Salieri preferred music. Oh what a film for the ages!"

The story is captivating, and the flashback way to do the film adds a wonderful artistic element to it. While the movie may not be historical accurate, 100%, it doesn't hurt it in the slightest bit. It achieves in great lengths in storytelling.<br/><br/>Watching the musical grandeur, and how the classical music can affect us all is amazing. But the movie digs deeper then that, questioning the musical intelligence, relationships with God, feeling inadequate, and people's fear of mediocrity. The movie is not a biography of Mozart.<br/><br/>The words written in the screenplay describing music are amazing.<br/><br/>See this movie, you will not regret it."

","In today's pop-fixated culture, it's easy to forget that the techniques of harmony, musicianship, and so on were invented hundreds of years ago by the classical musicians. Unfortunately, I would say by now that classical music has all but become the real alternative music these days given its minority popularity. As such, I was quite pleased to see a film about Mozart and his rivals in the world of music.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the film has a great soundtrack featuring many of Mozart's best loved works. It also manages to be dramatic without being too heavy. Salieri's angst balances with Mozart's silliness to keep things both entertaining, even humorous, while dealing with a dark plot of unfulfilled dreams, growing madness, and tragedy. All in all, a great film and a reminder of a time before Elvis was king."

","This is for me quite simply, the best movie ever made. The acting, photography, costumes, settings and screenplay are all top notch. Milos Forman brings the world of Mozart to life and all the characters are beautifully cast. I can't think of a single performance that wasn't spot on, which says a lot. F.Murray Abraham in particular gives arguably the greatest performance in movie history as Antonio Salieri. He manages wonderfully to convey the pathos and contradictions of his character, caught as he is between admiration and hatred for Mozart, between his humility and passion for music and his consuming envy of the foul mouthed little genius who outshines him. Practically every scene is a masterpiece. Add to that the music of Mozart, Salieri, Haydn and others and you have a recipe for sheer perfection. The proof of that is that it never loses its magic no matter how many times one sees it,which is the ultimate test of a great movie."

Everything seems to fit in the movie, the acting, the sets, the costumes, the writing, and of course the music. Tom Hulce does a great job playing Mozart, but F. Murray Abraham stole the show. At some moments in the movie you find yourself hating Salieri but in the next you can't help sympathize with him. I went in to the movie with the high expectations of seeing a piece of brilliance put upon by critics, friends, teachers, and siblings. After seeing the movie I find it hard to disagree. If asked ""what did you think of Amadeus?"" I can simply and honestly answer ""One of the best of all time."""

"roghache","9","2","4","9 March 2006"," Masterpiece of jealousy & musical genius, woefully unhistorical
","When I saw this movie upon its release, I was enthralled with it. Even today, I'm sure I'd regard it as a cinematic masterpiece. The lead actors are all brilliant in their roles (especially F. Murray Abraham as the jealous Salieri), the plot gripping, the flashback mode of storytelling compelling, the sets and costumes spectacular, and Mozart's music of course divine, literally, as only God could impart to a mere mortal such musical genius. <br/><br/>That being said, and it may make for tremendous drama, but is it quite right to rewrite history to that extent for the stage or screen? There may have been rumours of a deathbed confession, but to the best of my knowledge there is no historical credence whatsoever given to any claim that Salieri murdered or conspired to murder Mozart. They were contemporaries & possibly rivals, but to what extent was he even jealous? My sources claim more evidence of a cooperative spirit between the two composers than any genuine antipathy. Salieri is not here to defend himself, and it's reprehensible to accuse the deceased of murder (or imply as much), simply to inaccurately entertain the masses and make bucks for the theatre or film industry. <br/><br/>True, the movie never outright states that Salieri murdered Mozart; maybe it is only extreme guilt from his consuming jealousy that makes him believe he did so. However, as presented, many viewers (especially those who aren't music scholars) will retain permanently as truth this film's picture of the two composers, long after the closing credits, and their picture of Salieri will be that of a murderer. Mind you, I had no such qualms of conscience myself when I originally saw this film 20 or so years ago.<br/><br/>The movie seems to have taken a lot of dramatic license as its Salieri makes a vow of celibacy when young, causing him to feel sexually frustrated throughout life. The real Salieri married and fathered eight children!<br/><br/>Of course the plot revolves around the supposedly mediocre composer, Antonio Salieri, who is consumed with jealousy for the genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Abraham plays Salieri to perfection, his hatred and his attempts to conceal it obvious to the viewer, who completely sympathizes with his inner struggles. Also, the entire concept of his devotion to God, questioning why? why? why? did He not impart such musical genius to him, Salieri, who would have used it for God's glory, rather than squandering it on the totally undeserving Mozart. It's a question many people of faith must ask when they look at others and see academic, musical, artistic, athletic, or whatever talents that they themselves long for but lack, while others less worthy in their midst have unjustly been granted them. A theme that many can relate to in ordinary life, brilliantly conveyed.<br/><br/>As for Mozart (played by Tom Hulce), if he was really as silly, crude, and obnoxious as this movie portrayed, I might well have murdered him myself! I was relieved to read one comment claiming that Mozart is not depicted accurately here, that he was fun loving but socially quite proper. Thus, another desecration of the dead. Personally, I found the movie's most touching scene to be near the end when Mozart is buried in a mass, common grave. That outrage at least is historically accurate...a moving, tragic picture that is worth a thousand words, of a genius not truly honored in his day, at least not in death.<br/><br/>Possibly relative to Mozart, but it's unfair to cast Salieri as a mediocre composer. My son (a flute player) actually quite likes Salieri's compositions, praises Mozart's genius but suggests that many of his works are very similar. He especially appreciates Salieri's Concerto for Flute and Oboe. <br/><br/>Yes, Amadeus is a tremendous musical spectacle, a masterpiece of cinematography, an extraordinary (if extremely inaccurate) drama of human jealousy at its absolute worst (yet most sympathetic), but my conscience now does bother me just a little. Antonio Salieri should have been allowed to rest in peace."
"kevin142","9","2","4","8 February 2006"," A genius's tragedy
","When Salieri was a child, his father opposed him to develop his interest on music. After the sudden death of his father, he can put fully his heart into music. When he grew up, he became a royal composer. He often heard people talking about Mozart's music. That raised him big interest. When he saw Mozart in an occasion, Mozart's unusual behavior surprised him a lot. As to Mozart's music, he had to admit its greatness. The more he appreciated Mozart's music, the more jealous he was. That led to fearful outcome to Mozart, then himself finally.<br/><br/>You can hear splendid music from start to end. Of cause the plot is also absorbing. Especially the final part, Mozart gave an oral account for his work in deathbed while Salieri tried to write it down. That is the most unforgettable scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The whole acting and producing level is high and satisfying. No wonder it won 8 academy awards.<br/><br/>A masterpiece worth watching many times. 9/10"

","I loved the movie. It really did tell almost the truth about Mozart. Of course it left some details out about his life but since my husband studied classical music and their composer's he knows a lot about Mozart. But what I found to be very enjoyable was the music of that time which has now, for some, become the music of our time. Mozart was a very colorful character and a highly intelligent a composer for that time. I still love to listen to a lot of his music. I just wish that I could get a copy of the last composition he was working on with Salieri when he died. That piece must be beautiful. Reqiuem for the Dead. Mozart was a womanizer as well as a drunk but he composed his best music when he was drunk. His wife had many men that she slept with when Mozart was away at the opera or the playhouse of the time. Jeffery Jones played a very good role of an Emperor. Unfortunately he listened to the wrong people when it came to Mozart's music. How can there be to many notes in a composition? That's one for the books."

","Very, very few movies have all their pieces - acting, photography, plot, music, etc - come together in a more powerful way than they do in this film. Salieri is magnificent; the camera captures every subtle gesture while still taking in the staging of each delightful scene; the story is fascinating, and made only more dramatic by the exquisitely-performed soundtrack, featuring music by Herr Mozart himself and a few other contemporary pieces (played by St Martins-In-The-Fields, it fills three CDs and is worth every penny).<br/><br/>Even my friends who do not enjoy classical music had to admit that this was a very well-done period piece. It poses an interesting philosophical dilemma, a hero-villain for whom we cannot help but feel empathetic, and gives us a glimpse into the fascinating politics, power, and music of the Classical Age.<br/><br/>One word of advice: Do NOT see the Director's Cut. Several key scenes were added and changed that, I found, made a tremendous difference to my evaluation of the main characters and events in the film."
"imichelet","10","2","4","14 January 2006"," A masterpiece, worthy of the genius it describes
","Vienna -18th Century. The life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, from the angle of his relationships with Hapsburg Emperor Joseph II's Court Composer, Antonio Sallieri. Mozart is here described as a naughty spoiled brat, misbehaving with ladies, disrespectful of authority, wasting the money he really does not have. Overall, a man yearning for the youth he had been denied, a genius laughing at the inability of common people, a human being tortured by the music he cannot live without. Sallieri on the other hand, second-rate musician but true lover of music, probably understands Mozart better than anybody else. ""Here was the very voice of God"", he says of Mozart's music. ""I was staring through the cage of meticulous ink stokes at an absolute beauty"". But he cannot bring himself to help the genius he is so jealous of. Indeed, he will destroy him (""I will ruin your incarnation"", says he to God) and destroy himself in the process. A masterpiece, powerful, beautiful, enhanced by Mozart's music. Brilliant."

","I have only seen Amadeus: The Director's Cut, so I cannot comment on the original version unfortunately. This film has reached the no.3 spot in my personal list of all time favourites. It is so gloriously enthralling to watch, it is a cinematic experience like no other. It is equally terrifying as it is hilarious. ""Do you believe in that? Fire, burning you forever after you die?"" ""Oh yes."" That short exchange between Mozart and Salieri, (no matter how inaccurate my quoting of it is, apologies if it is,) is mind-blowingly frightening. I think that this film is for lovers of great music, classical in particular, intellectuals, lovers of great cinema, and even I think, theologians. It is hard to tell, or it is for me at least, weather this film is a direct attack on God, or a fearful thought on his existence. The characters in the film certainly believe in him. Being a Christian myself, these themes were more poignant in my mind, although there are many others, including love, hate, morality, and the value of life. Overall this is an incredibly beautiful, endlessly enjoyable story, which really made me appreciate classical music more than ever before. I recommend this very highly and hope you enjoy and and enjoy thinking about its themes. It certainly left me thinking very hard, with Mozarts music playing in the background of my mind. (Sorry, Salieri, I'm afraid not much of your music stuck in my head in quite the same way.)"

The film is told by Antonio Salieri a now insane musician who was the finest in the city until Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart arrived with his perfect music. A true genius he was, but his character and manners were crude and rude. Winner of 8 Academy Awards Including Best Picture, Best Director Milos Forman, Best Actor F.Murray Abraham. From the director of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Amadeus is an inspiring, wonderful, dark, colourful film. ""simply breathtaking"" <br/><br/>Amadeus is spellbinding, amazing, sublime: Forman has visualised 18th Century Vienna in breathtaking fashion; but beside all the sets and costumes, it is the characters and more simply the performances. F. Murray Abraham provides an exquisitely calculated, graceful, masterful performance that won him the Oscar. Furthermore, Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart is also astonishing. <br/><br/>Classical music, stunning direction, breathtaking acting, lavish sets, extravagant costumes and a story that is beautifully woven into all the grandeur of this film; what can I say this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen.

I understand that this movie is not entirely historically accurate. I don't think it is supposed to be. It takes the elements of a historical events and creates a very powerful fictional story. All the acting is superb. Murray is fantastic as Salerei. He is so hateful, so spiteful, and yet so astounded by Mozart's ability. This movie looks amazing. There is so much detail and so much texture in each scene, you can almost smell the environment. The sets are as important a character as any person in the movie. The costumes are amazing as well. I think the greatest character in this movie is the music. It lingers through each scene like a lifeforce. It permeates your senses and enraptures you.

","I've seen Amadeus exactly twice now. Let's see, the first time I saw it was back in 1985 That was back when I was 16. I remember it being sort of boring, not exactly my type of movie. (If I recall, my parents didn't think it was so hot either). Well, 20 years later, I've watched this again, and my god, this is such a great and beautiful movie! The story essentially follows the last years of Mozart's young life, and his on again / off again feud with a rival composer, Salieri. Through the composition of several operas, including Figaro and the Death March, Mozart realizes that ambition can sometimes overwhelm the soul.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart! Both are brilliant here, both deserved the academy award, but only Abraham got it. I DO like Hulce better. He's just simply amazing here. He really hasn't done anything since that closely resembles his performance here. The rest of the cast is great, including a real scene-stealer role from Jeffery Jones. He was known for his silly comedies, and this role was great to exposing audiences to another side of himself. (Oh, I could say something else here, but that would be too obvious).<br/><br/>The costuming, decor and time period staging is done just so, but what really gets me, that this is one of the very few movies I've seen taking place in this time period that has a sense of humor about itself.

","This film of Peter Shaffer's play is fairly successful once you get past the clunky opening scenes where Mozart and his intended frolic under the tables and swap indecent puns with each other.<br/><br/>From a very tight stage production, Shaffer opens out the action to include real-life scenes and scenarios rather than the theatrics of the dukes in the chorus. Salieri is the key character here, the title of the film notwithstanding, and is gloriously played by Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham. Curious that Abraham didn't go on to get the meaty roles that should have been there for him.<br/><br/>As Mozart, Tom Hulce is - in the early scenes - an irritating hyena, an overactive child. By the time of the Requiem and the closing scenes his acting talent truly comes to the fore, doing justice to the story and to the wonderful music. Elizabeth Berridge plays his wife Constance very well, while Roy Dotrice is a memorable Leopold (father of Wolfgang Amadeus). Jeffrey Jones is a twitchy Emperor (""too many notes!"") and Simon Callow, Charles Kay, and Martin Cavina make their mark in smaller roles.<br/><br/>The true star of this film though, is the music, and you get to hear lots of it, thanks to Sir Neville Marriner and a team of great musicians."

","Having purchased the directors cut and seen the film again for the first time in 20 years, I was amazed at how well it has held up and has refused to become dated. F. Murray Abraham, whom I first encountered in the Richard Dryefus Film, The Big Fix, gives the performance of a lifetime as the frustrated mediocrity, Salieri. Every nuance, every emotion, every single moment of subtext that passes across his face is a revelation. As a teacher of high school theater, I have often wished I could meet Mr. Abraham to tell him how much his performance moved me. Tom Hulce, as Mozart, gives a much broader, but equally affecting performance. Elizabeth Berridge, as Costanze, is perfect in her vulnerability. Milos Forman creates the correct mood with every set up, and the production design, costumes and make-up are fab. As has been stated, the movie is completely Salieri's. It's Salieri vs. god and Mozart is a vehicle for that, along with providing the perfect scoring to underpin each and every scene. I love this movie so much, that we are doing it for our high school's fall play.

It is one of those films that really show what a cinematic experience is meant to be; the possibilities a movie as a medium offers, are perfectly exploided here. Nothing is left out really: The actors deliver in spades, the cinematography is stunning, the dialogues seem just to be taken from a classic drama (without ever seeming misplaced in any way), the big magic moments we love movies for so much in which characters become aware of an unbelievable, maybe bitter truth or something like that flow richly. The unique, everytime you hear it breathtakingly beautiful Music of MOAZART himself is perfectly underlying the movie; especially the REQUIEM has a fundamental meaning to the movies storyline and conclusion.

Murray Abraham), who is committed to a mental institution after trying to kill himself. He blames himself for the death of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). <br/><br/>Salieri's life and music is faint due to his jealously of Mozart. He is fascinated yet disgusted by Mozart...and wonders why God would use a vulgar, boorish child to be the best composer in history. I like the Director's Cut DVD better, which portrays Mozart's wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) in a more dramatic, involved role. After seeing the prolific scene with Constanze and Salieri, you will see why Constanze carries such disdain for him. Salieri's self-worth is destroyed and he finally accepts he is merely a 'mediocrity'. After seeing this piece of art (I cannot just call it a 'movie'), I grew fond of classical music. The operas and plays were very realistic, as if you were actually in 18th century Vienna! The costumes were lavish, accents perfected, Prague setting majestic and the music was beautiful. <br/><br/>Overall, I give 'Amadeus"" an A+"

","Of course, when Amadeus came out in the theaters, it was hailed as a triumph on just about every level.  It followed the prototype of big, splashy epic-like films of the early to mid-1980's (Gandhi, Out of Africa, Chariots of Fire) but this one was a bit different from all the others.  Not only was it a film about a real person, the back-bone of the film itself was its music.  And what glorious music it is!<br/><br/>Amadeus was based on the stage play of the same name by British playwright Peter Shaffer.  It opened in New York in 1980 and starred Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  It won the 1980 Tony Award for Best Play and so it would only be a matter of time before Hollywood would come to call. Everything about the life story of Mozart cries out to be told in a grand epic-like film style and structure.  From the origins of Mozart's travails as he attempts to be Court Composer to Emperor Joseph the II of Austria to the writing of what some consider his finest work, the Requiem mass, it's all here.  Of course, as we all (should) know by now, much of Amadeus as both play and film is highly fictionalized.  Shaffer does a grand thing by having us want to believe the fact that Antonio Salieri actually kills Mozart, but in the end it is up to our imaginations to wonder if we are seeing the truth or not.<br/><br/>Recently, the Director's Cut was released with an additional twenty minutes of footage cut from the original (1984) release.  If anything, the newly recovered footage draws out the story, but it also puts a bit more meat onto the bones of the life of whom many people think is the world's greatest composer of classical music.  We leave the theater (or the couch) feeling sated in our quest but always wondering could it have been true...or is this merely a great fiction just sculpted to look as if it was meant to be true.<br/><br/>Amadeus was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning eight including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Set and Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Makeup. It was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.<br/><br/>My rating: 3 and a half stars"

","You have to hand it to Milos Forman, he really knows how to thrash out human experience on screen. With wonderful movies such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The People Vs. Larry Flynt and Man On The Moon under his belt he truly is one of cinema's finest biographers. Amadeus is a curious movie, for a multiple oscar winner its rarely mentioned among peoples 'top lists'. Stanger still is the fact that its leading actors F. Murray Abraham(Salieri) and Tom Hulce(Mozart) never really achieved much in Hollywood following the success of Amadeus. A shame really as those who've watched it will know:<br/><br/>Amadeus takes an objective view of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by having Viennese Court Composer, Antonio Salieri narrate the tale. Salieri reveals his part in Mozart's demise and illustrates his legendary hatred for Mozart throughout the film. Yet underneath Salieri's hatred lies an admiration for Mozart's talent that stretches to adoration for Mozart's music. These conflicting emotions cause Salieri to conjure a fascinating portrayal of Mozart and his talent for the audience - Criticisms of the movie mainly revolve around the historical inaccuracies and the portrayal of Mozart himself....to these people I  say that all history is open to interpretation and that the movie itself is told from the perspective of Salieri(of whom little is actually known) who, for the purposes of the movie, resented the success and lifestyle enjoyed by Mozart - F. Murray Abraham's performance as Salieri was majestic, with his awe-stricken voice retaining an authoritative weight throughout the picture. Hulce is well cast as the giggling, and often arrogant young Mozart. Set largly in decorative opera halls and Royal Courts the sets are among the most lavish to hit film and are accompanied on screen by (inevitably) a glorious classical score(so make sure to turn up the volume) giving the audience a wonderful cinematic experience, both visually and aurally.

It never shows Salieri killing Mozart, in fact it never even shows Salieri as the Man in Black, it shows Salieri's reaction to Mozart and God. People blame this for bad feeling against Salieri, but that's simply not true. Salieri was a dead name until this film came about. People aren't stupid enough to think Salieri actually killed Mozart. I cannot understand anyone not liking this film. It's beautifully crafted, written and acted. It's a bit of historical fiction, and revived interest in Mozart. I love this film. I could go on, but I won't. W. A. Mozart is one of my favorite people of all time, and this film shows him in a very human way. They do not portray him as an untouchable genius, but as they very real man he was.   As an aspiring Mozart scholar I would know that this is not a very accurate film. But so what?

Mozart will always be known for his gift of music, and this Best Picture winner seeks to do the same.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that while not one note of Mozart was changed, Salieri's music was made ""better.""<br/><br/>Amadeus is also about human conflict, and Abraham's portrayal of Salieri as the tortured, jealous, conspirator who ranks among the greatest backstabbers of all time.  Brutus among them as well.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a tragedy, and a miracle of catharsis it is too.  Watching it we are held in the firm grip of dramtic irony, unable to cry out and change what is developing on screen.<br/><br/>The most beautiful scene in the film (arguably, ever filmed) shows the genius and mediocrity side by side, squabbling over the Requiem, Salieri to slow to follow Mozart.  This scene is so poignant.  Even in death, Mozart is still better than Salieri.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film reverberates throughout time.

This film doesn't have much accuracy on Mozart's life as many people will say, but it is a truly excellent picture on a man's life. The subtle details of the film really stand out, the costume design, sets, music, everything comes together perfectly. Like Barry Lyndon, it's set in the 1700 - 1800's so there has to be many set designs and decorations. This film took home Oscars for best adapted screenplay, best director, best picture, best actor (F. Murry Abraham) and four more technical awards. The screenplay and direction really stand out, as does the picture. Very worthy of the Oscars, very well written with some good attention to details and the direction of Milos Forman lifts this film up to brave new heights. The acting is very good, especially Tom Hulce as Amadeus, who was also nominated for best actor. F. Murry Abraham lifts the film with his delicate narration and amazing facial gestures. As for the music.. it's the best aspect of the film, gracing every scene beautifully. However, the flaws come in several numbers. The original version of this film runs at 2 hours 40 minutes, but it gets a bit tedious and long towards the ending, and it begins to feel a bit stretched. Also, the plot gets a bit annoying towards the ending for it seems to go out of focus. Still an excellent film, somewhat worthy of the 8 Oscars and also deserves to be in the top 250. 9/10"

","*****Warning****Spoilers AHEAD**********WARNING*************<br/><br/>Milos Forman's does not make many movies, and when he does, he does so in unique and stylish fashion.  This film is certainly unique, and I'd say at times divine, at times very human, and connects with the very fiber that unites all of us.  First, our failed quest for greatness has rarely been seen as vividly as through the eyes of Solieri, who was recognized by his government as the finest musician of his time, but knew in his heart that his talent was only miniscule to that of the great Mozart.  F. Murray Abraham does an extraordinary job with this, and so does Tom Hulce portraying Mozart's flambouyant persona.  The music is top notch, as to be expected, especially the haunting finale where Hulce is singing the notes to his work as Solieri is writing.  Note -- I'm commenting from the Director's cut DVD which is rated R.  I understand the PG rated version is short of the scene where she strips.  I kind of like that scene in the movie...I think it shows her will and makes her disappointment at the end understandable.  I did find this cut a little long...I haven't watched the original...maybe that one is perfect...but this is about as close as you get."

","I was so wary of watching this movie at first that I would leave the room every time my mom watched it. I thought it was just another dull, trite historical epic just dripping with pretention. Boy, I could not have been more wrong. <br/><br/>This Oscar-winning film takes the story of the much-beloved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and tells it through the eyes of a madman, his bitter rival Salieri. After slitting his own throat at a ripe old age, Salieri finds himself in an asylum, telling the story of his great feud with God, to a priest. Of course, he's angry as hell. Why wouldn't he be? God has forsaken him, and given the talent that he craves to the magnificent Mozart.<br/><br/>
Don't get lost yet, though. Mozart is hardly a role model in this movie. He's a drunk, an irritable fellow, he cheats on his fiancee with a ditzy diva, and also manages to insult every authority figure in town. But despite all that, he's still one of the most endearing and charming male figures I've ever seen. He wants so badly to succeed, and do the one thing he loves, making music. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Berridge also steals the show as Wolfgang's young wife, Constanze. She tries her hardest to make him happy, but being not much more than a child herself, sometimes gets herself into some rather interesting situations. <br/><br/>Ultimately, it's hard to say if it's Salieri who did the deed he claims to have done. But I recommend this delightful movie to anyone, anywhere, fan of Mozart's music or not. Make sure and see both the original and the director's cut, in that order, too. ;)"

","Well I was very sceptical about watching this film as I love Mozart's music and didn't want to see anything trivialized, but once I did watch it, I was so glad! The music (naturally) is stunning, and along with superb screen shots, makes the film very dramatic. Not entirely sure how accurate it is, but its as good a theory as any, and it definitely makes a good movie! Tom Hulce in general I don't really like, but his portrayal of Mozart is incredible. I recommend this film to anyone, unless of course you don't like Mozart's music, because you hear a lot of it!"

","Amadeus. What can a film lover say about this gorgeous hulk?<br/><br/>Well, for starters, the acting is truly as good as it gets. F. Murray Abraham was born to play Salieri, and that Oscar was ALL HIS. Mr. Hulce, all due respect, but the Academy got it right that year.<br/><br/>The agony & the ecstasy, indeed. The divine music of ""that little german boy"", Wolfgang couldn't have gotten a better boost in recognition than with this extremely entertaining piece of work by the great Milos Forman. I watch this film whenever I get in a funk. It literally transports me to another time- yet the characters feel like friends & neighbors, not just some folk over in Europe. <br/><br/>The experience of viewing Amadeus should make you very happy.

","What can I say-I loved this film. Its is one of my favorites. I love Milos Forman, and his trusted and incredibly talented cinematographer, Miroslav Ondricek.  This film made me cry. Tom Hulce is an amazing and gifted actor who indeed did Mozart justice. Mozart wasn't the kind of man people liked, and he portrayed him with all his being.  Abraham was just as wonderful as the jealous Salieri. If you know what good filmmaking is, you'll appreciate this one for all it is worth. It is simply breathtaking."
"sdl004","Null","2","4","25 September 2002"," transcendent performance
","I consider Amadeus to be one of the 2 or 3 best movies I've ever seen for a variety of reasons.  The direction and cinematography are flawless, the script is brilliant (seemingly never wasting a word, with every scene moving crisply), and the casting is extraordinary (note the excellent performances by Elizabeth Berridge, the priest who takes Salieri's confession, and of course Tom Hulce).  However, for me, what sets Amadeus apart from many other very good movies is the incredible performance of F. Murray Abraham.  I can think of a number of great individual performances (Brando in ""On the Waterfront"", Paccino in ""Godfather I & II"", Di Nero in ""Raging Bull"", Nicholson in ""Chinatown"", off the top of my head), but none that moved me as much as the Salieri Abraham created.  The emotion, and wit he imbued the character with are just amazing.  I don't wish to spoil anyone's experience with specifics but the creation of a man who, I feel, has an ocean of bitterness covering up his genuine guilt and desire for repentance is something to see.  Often we get to see emotions like rage, desperation, and love portraid brilliantly in films.  Rarely do we get such a showcase for the far more subtle feelings (frustration, pettiness, repression, etc.) that Abraham so deftly displays. The blackness of Salieri's soul is not the normal kind of evil that movies throw at us to the point of exhaustion, but, when revealed, it is no less chilling to the audience (or to his confessor, who's facial expressions in one particular scene of revelation are also masterful).  There are a lot of people responsible for this fantastic film, but what keeps me coming back is the desire to see Abraham's once in a lifetime performance again and again."
"Mr_Hulot","8","2","4","23 September 2002"," Amadeus remolded by Forman
","Was Amadeus a hippie, a hedonist, a proto rock-star, a rebel, or is Forman just portraying him as such to fit the patterns of his continuing cinematic exegesis of historical figures?  Forman was raised under two dire dictatorships, the Nazi and then later the Stalinist.  No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.<br/><br/>     Mozart as presented by Forman fits this mold, and is a spiritual brother to Andy Kaufman, Larry Flint, and Randle Mc Murphy in Man on the Moon, the People vs. Larry Flint, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest respectively.  He is giving us the same character over and over again, and telling us the same story at different times and places throughout the ages. This is fair enough if Forman sees this as the essential struggle occurring within the confines of the cosmos, but does his vision also encompass the masses or is he giving us the anti- Tolstoy an view that history is driven only by the actions of a few isolated great men, visionaries and revolutionaries? Yes, I like this movie, but it does not give us the sweep and grandeur that would properly reflect the music of it's subject.  Ultimately it tells us more about it's author then it does about its main character.  Is this a case of the cannibalism of history in order to support a director's personal vision, or simple appropriation of powerful `symbolic' personalities in order to present a Manichean view of the universe? I cannot pretend to know.<br/><br/>     I know this, the film is energetic and amusing, like all of Forman's work that I have seen, and leaves the audience with a stronger feeling of connection with the misunderstood individualist visionary then it does with the gray world which is bent on crushing him, here represented by rival composer Salieri.  The best thing it can do is inspire an audience member to take the first few tottering steps out of hypnotic TV created reality and try to create a world of his own.  Why Forman hasn't gotten around to filming the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a mystery that remains unsolved.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lizziebeth-1","10","2","4","30 August 2002"," Emotional and musical perfection! COMPULSORY VIEWING - First of my 5 all-time favourites.
","Momma! Emotional and musical perfection. Saul Zaentz's work is impeccable. Mindboggling--he does justice to Mozart! <br/><br/>""...Well, ...there it is."" <br/><br/>From the two opening strains of Don Giovanni you know you're dead. Milos Forman matches shots-to-music in his prologue, like the master filmmaker he is.<br/><br/>The casting of Vincent Schiavelli is also a stroke of genius, as the smarmy peasant/valet to F-Murray Abraham's Antonio Salieri.<br/><br/>Schiavelli was perfect in serious roles, he's physically affecting. For Amadeus(1984) he reaches way back into the 18thC to grab it by the cravat, and suddenly, we're back there, with him! ...The sound fades nervously as Salieri is committing something in his room, and then suddenly we're STRUCK DOWN by stentorian violins as we see what Salieri has done to himself. We then quieten along with the music, as various people fuss at a distance getting Salieri onto the sled ambulance and into hospital. Night fades into day, and then.....we're in the nuthouse!<br/><br/>The prissy priest(Herman Meckler) taking Salieri's confession is the key to our own denouement. He is us. He's so familiar in 20thC terms that we instinctively connect to his all-at-sea-ineptitude trying to understand the demons of a man much older and more distinguished than himself. Salieri is that older man, bearing his guilt, but despising God whom the inept priest is there to represent. And we're the inept viewers of this uberdrama: common salt-of-the-earth trying to understand the life of a genius. The analogy is thoroughly obvious.<br/><br/>Amadeus in real life was paraded around as a prodigy from the age of 4 by his father (1760 was the birth of the ""stage mother""). Based on this, Mozart was a psychologically tortured son, making his dissolution with wine, women, and vaudeville so understandable. Amongst his peers, only Salieri did not dismiss him. ""This was no composition by a performing monkey. THIS was a music I'd never heard--filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God"".<br/><br/>And that's our key: Amadeus(1984) is really a movie about Man vs God.<br/><br/>Indeed there really was a Salieri, but there is no evidence whatsoever that this drama occurred between them. It was Peter Shaffer's play that conjectured Salieri's envy of Mozart's talent ""as a lust in my body"".<br/><br/>Clearly, no composer of the 18thC would ever be able to comprehend Mozart's talents without equating it with the hand of God: ""I was staring through the cage of those meticulous brushstrokes at an absolute beauty"". Mozart was a savant (latest research suggests that all of us can become savants in one field but only at the cost of brain damage elsewhere). ""Displace one note, and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall"", admits Salieri, who secretly disagrees with the other Italians in Emperor Joseph II's court that Mozart's compositions have ""too many notes"". He understood well that an edifice of beauty is still a house of cards. Supremely jealous, however, he made a hate-filled pact with God: ""because you choose for your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty, infantile boy, and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation--because you are unjust, unfair, unkind--I will block you"".<br/><br/>It is in these scenery-chewing emotional confessions that Abraham, the actor, is best.<br/><br/>Even so, I am prepared to go out on a limb: he didn't deserve the Oscar if that meant that Thomas Hulce couldn't get one. I've known F-Murray first from the lowbrow comedy The Ritz(1976), and without a doubt, he was more at home--better--in that (as a flagrant yet lovable homosexual who befriends a straight innocent). In Amadeus(1984), Abraham's obsequiousness frequently looks awkward, and I can't just put it down to character. I've also witnessed a similar discomfort when he was a detective in Serpico(1973).<br/><br/>Both Tom Hulce and Jeffrey Jones (for Jones' unforgettable portrayal of Emperor Joseph II) should have received Oscars too.....but frankly, in a cast of this high caliber, it's a travesty to actually single anyone out! Returning to plot, it's always saddened me that Mozart and Salieri ALMOST connected during the last hours of Mozart's life. Unfortunately each maestro was a terrible judge of people. Salieri was forever dashing himself against Mozart's superior talent, while Amadeus arrogantly overused his single trump card until it stopped having impact.<br/><br/>What a waste of humanity that even such talented men should become so alienated by their male egos.<br/><br/>Amadeus's ignominious burial becomes finally comprehensible: he'd been an impetuous fellow who never appreciated that he needed the help of his peers if he was ever to live amongst them. The perennial problem of genius is how to survive being (mis)understood by those who vastly outnumber him.<br/><br/>Finally, in retelling his story to the priest, Salieri realizes that it was God himself, not he, Salieri, who killed Mozart. He finally laughs derisively at his religion, accusing the priest's ""own 'merciful' God who destroyed His own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity share in the smallest part of His glory"". Indeed, the priest has by the end of Salieri's confession lost all certainty in his own church line. And rightly so, because God-given talent can just as easily be the vehicle for Man's destruction. God always wins. Perhaps Einstein was overly generous to claim that ""God does not play dice with the universe"". Whether mediocre or a perfect talent, people are born to die unjustly, as indeed the entire ecosystem must (all living things rely on the death of others). So is not any level of analysis less than God's a worthless ruse? Salieri had the priest, and by eyeing the audience, us too, pegged right, as mediocrities. In the end, he declared himself their Patron Saint and took refuge in a sanitarium--another ignominy. Today we might diagnose him as suffering from (self-induced?) post-traumatic stress-disorder.<br/><br/>Watch this and BAWL--I did.10/10"

","Amadeus is an almost perfect realization of its central conceit.  If you accept that conceit (and I find it tremendously entertaining to do so, for the sake of the argument) Forman's picture plays it out flawlessly, assisted by phenomenal acting: Abraham's great brooding self-hating Salieri, Tom Hulce's hilarious embodiment of Mozart as a sort of 18th century version of Jerry Lee Lewis, not to mention Jeffrey Jones' brilliant portrayal of Emperor Joseph as a stolid, well-meaning bureaucrat trying ever so hard to be a good and creative philosopher king in defiance of his true (dull) nature.  The music is performed and explained in a way that non-classicists can follow and learn from.  A moving delight that rewards repeat viewing."

What we get is one of the most exceptionally made films of our time, consisting of wonderful sets and performances, especially by F. Murray Abraham. Sadly, like so many stars before, Abraham pretty much fell off the map, never grasping a role that was tailored to his particular style of acting. Nonetheless, a well crafted film which should be revered for its beauty and grace, and it won eight Oscars to boot."
"rdarlington","Null","2","4","11 August 2002"," Visual and aural treat
","I first saw ""Amadeus"" in early 1985, by which time it had already been festooned with 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. I saw it again in the summer of 2002 when it was re-released as a director's cut, an additional 20 minutes taking the total running time to a full three hours. The extra footage does not make much difference to what was already a stunning work, but the digital remastering can only help the appreciation of a glorious performance. <br/><br/>Peter Schaffer reworked his own play to create the screenplay for this psychological and musicological struggle between the young genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) and his much less well-known contemporary Antonio Salieri (1750-1825), while Czech director MiloÂš Forman returned to his former homeland where Prague provided brilliant settings evocative of 18th century Vienna, including the Tyl Theatre where in fact the premiere of ""The Magic Flute"" was held. Indeed the film is veritably a visual and aural feast with sumptuous costumes and sets and plenty of Mozart's sublime music.<br/><br/>
I still have some difficulty with the casting of American-accented and eternally giggling Tom Hulce as the farting but fabulous Mozart, although he is undeniably impressive. However, it is F Murray Abraham as Salieri - a man consumed by jealous over the other's precocious talent - who gives a breathtaking virtuoso performance. Inevitably, when one revisits a film after so long, one notes the subsequent career of the actors. Tom Hulce seemed to disappear, Abraham never obtained a similarly challenging role, while Cynthia Nixon (who played a maid employed to spy on Mozart) has found fame of sorts in the hit television series ""Sex And The City""."

","When Forman left Europe in 1968 he was a quite famous Eastern-European director mostly among the young because of his early masterpieces like: 'The Firemen's Ball' (1967) and 'The Loves of a Blonde' (1966). But when he arrived to the United States, he was just a young Eastern-European director and he had to prove his talent what he did in the 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1976) and 'Hair' (1979). He was one of the biggest and most appreciated director of Hollywood in 1984. This year he decided to make a movie about the life of Wolgang Amadeus Mozart. He decided to go back to Prague and make the film in his homeland, which he left 16 years ago. So this film is not just a fabulous film about Mozart but very important in Forman's life, because he could return back to his home, which was still suffering from the communist tyranny that time. And this detail is so essential in an Eastern-European people's life, because only we, the Eastern-Europeans, can understood that how hard the life of a Czech, Hungarian or Polish people is, if they have to leave their country. He decided to shoot in Prague instead of Vienna or Budapest, because in Vienna there are lot of modern buildings and in Budapest the communication possibilities weren't good enough that time and the price was too high. The Habsburg Empire flourished at the dusk of the 18th century, it was one of the biggest and most powerful empire in Europe. At this decadent time Mozart becomes the most applauded composer of Vienna. He was the indispensable guest of the huge and fabulous balls. Soon he becomes the reason of the intrigues of the royal palace, and the object of Salieri's jealousy. Salieri's (the royal composer) feelings about Mozart are very complex, because in one hand he hates Mozart because of his childishness, but on the other hand he admires him because of his talent. He can't get rid of this complexity all of his life even in the asylum (the pictures of the asylum are very strong, brutal disgusting but beautiful). This rivalry is noticeable between the two actors, F. Murray Abraham (Salieri) and Tom Hulce (Mozart). They were both nominated for the Best Actor Oscar but this time F. Murray 'Salieri' Abraham won. Tom Hulce's performance is also outstanding and he should have won an Academy Award too. This was the hardest decision in the history of the Oscar and nobody could have made a right decision. The costumes and the set design are also terrific. And the cinematography! Miroslav Ondricek is considered to be one of the best cinematographer since his early collaborations with Forman. And he got the Academy Award and became one of the most appreciated cinematographer in Hollywood and made such film like: 'Awakenings' (1989), 'Valmont' (1988) etc. When geniuses meet the result of their collaboration is a masterpiece. And this time that's happened. It's an essential movie of the 80s, all-time classic and the best of Milos Forman's."
"metrevej","10","2","4","9 April 2001"," a masterpiece
","I would like to join a large group of people praising the movie and say that it is one of the best films ever made. Everything is of highest standards in the film: plot, photography, choreography,music, acting etc. It is that rare case, when the words are not capable of expressing all the scale and beauty of the film. You have to see it, then to ponder on it, again to see it and so on. This is a real art: refined, elevated and human,inciting to fall to thinking, meanwhile giving an immense pleasure.<br/><br/>Milos Forman, who I consider as one of the greatest movie directors of all time and with whom you have the highest possible chance to see a new masterpiece, has done an outstanding job. The film is not about music and the two composers, and therefore, can not pretend to be historically accurate (although I don't think it's far away from what was real). The film is about a genius and mediocrity, and their relationship. The film raises a question: why is that from the birth it is decided whether a man will be a genius or not. Further actions, the way of leaving, as well as personal characteristics, positive or negative, are less important. Forman masterly examines the human foibles, revealed in extreme conditions, and we start sympathizing with Salieri: it is even difficult to determine on whose side the director is. We support and like genius, but what we can do if the most part of the world is populated by the mediocre (ordinary) people? and in the final scene Salieri absolves the asylum inmates -and not only them- from the sin of mediocrity.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a brilliant piece of the real art, shining out in twilights of today's depreciated art, including the cinematography."
"eibon09","Null","2","4","27 March 2001"," A Tale of Two Musicians
","Amadeus(1984) is an epic journey into the obsession and perfection driven music life of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The story is told in the third person narrative by Mozart's rival, Salieri.  The film at first suggests that Mozart was murdered.  This changes as Salieri is presented as a tormented and guilt ridden man.  Milos Forman does a great job in recreating the Vienna of Mozart's time.<br/><br/>
Presents Mozart as a talented but goofy and obnoxious young musician. Salieri in his early life believes in god until he sees the greatness in a person that was obnoxious and rude.  Salieri resents god more than he hates Mozart and takes this anger out on Mozart.  F Murray Abraham gives a performance of great tragedy and high emotion.  Amadeus(1984) is half true and half fiction.<br/><br/>
What the film says is that its easiler to identify with mediocrity than it is to identify with pure genius.  After all, pure genius is something  that is a rare quality among human beings.  Even a rarer quality in the field of art and artists.  Mozart was a genius whose music at times rubbed people the wrong way.  It was his genius that gave him room to be goofy and obnoxious.<br/><br/>
Tom Hulce was the perfect actor to play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  He portrays the famous artist with a mixture of goffiness and perfectionist behavior.  Mel Gibson tried out for the role of Mozart.  He would have been wrong for the part because he could not give this role justice.  Elizabeth Berridge as Mrs. Mozart is a mature counterpoint to the gifted but immature Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Andy Kaufman have many things in common.  First, the two artists did things that were ahead of their time and not well received by everyone.  Second, both upset people with their antics, behavior, and manners.  Third, both were driven artists who wanted to be the best of their craft.  Finally, both died at the age of 35 and in tragic cercumstances."

","What's so wonderful about this movie is its ability to get you into the mind of the composer Salieri. Through Salieri's distorted POV we come to love Mozart and are in awe of his genius, but at the same time are blown away by his apparent lack of understanding of his own genius. We can empathize to a certain extent with Salieri, but pity him as much for his own lack of understanding of his own talent and his obsessive jealousy. Forman's movie is captivating, exciting, dramatic, funny, educational and most of all incredibly sad and beautiful. It's a classic."

","This is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. I must have seen it hundreds of times but it never fails to enthrall me, and I'm always left with a lump in my throat at the ending.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce is amazingly convincing as the hilarious, impish Mozart, and shows his versatility - he is alternately hilarious, engaging, arrogant, endearing, loveable, infuriating, and inevitably tragic.<br/><br/>F.Murray Abraham is also terrifyingly convincing as the demonic, possessed Salieri, and acts well with Hulce. Please, please watch this film - although if you are reading this review you probably already have - it is truly wonderful.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the best part of the film is when Mozart re-writes Salieri's little ode for him, to the astonishment of the Emperor, Rosenburg and co. (does anyone else detest Rosenburg with a vengeance??), and this is where we are first introduced to the famous shrieking laugh! I love that laugh so much, it never fails to put me in hysterics.<br/><br/>Anyway, to summarise: Fantastic acting, wonderful soundtrack (of course), sumptuous costumes and backdrops, gripping storyline, range of emotions..... absolutely 10/10"

","the basic plot: A boorish, but unimaginabally gifted young talent named Amadeus Mozart arrives in Vienna from Salzburg , and soon marries Constanza Weber. His rival and other court composer and teacher, Salieri , a mannered and polite man, but with mediocre talent, tries to ruin him by exposing unlawful plans for opera, and then by having him write a funeral concerto which he believes is for himself.This is told in flashback by an old Salieri in an asylum to a priest.<br/><br/>The praise:Thoroughly entertaining.F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce are both excellent in their roles as Salieri and Mozart,and Elizabeth Aldridge and Roy dotrice do their parts as Constanza and Leopold Mozart well. The film is both comic and powerfully full of bittersweet drama, especially during the last part in which Mozart is writing the funeral concerto. Full of poignant nararation by F. Murray Abraham, in an excellent role which won him an Oscar, it also has a feel of masques, decorative follies and elaborate costumes, architecture and hair that characterize the period. The message that the movie gets across is that you can not judge a persons character  by their talent, and along the way you listen to a lot of great music and the genius of Mozart is explained . The ending in which Salieri proclaims himself King of mediocrity is classic. <br/><br/>The flaws: A little too long."

Salieri was not the court composer when Mozart arrived in Vienna; Gluck held that post. Salieri was the conductor of the opera. When Gluck died Mozart replaced him (Gluck) as court composer. Salieri's chief ""fault"" was his own self-deprecation. He often bemoaned his own limitations as a composer. It seems that if you claim to being a failure, people are willing to believe it to be a fact. Western Society likes ""winners"". In fact Salieri was a better composer than he thought himself, if not as great as Mozart, and was an outstanding musical teacher who's pupils included Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert."

","As this film is more of a historical fantasy than a biopic, it's perhaps too much to ask for accuracy in all the events portrayed.  However, it is a fantastic film for summoning up the rococo decadence of the 18th-century European court.  The writing is clear and believable, and the author--speaking through the character of Salieri--shows a lyrical appreciation for Mozart's musical genius.  The cinematography is fantastic, and this film contains one of the most effective visual segues I've ever seen--the visual of Mozart's scolding harridan of a mother-in-law matched with the high-pitched notes of the Queen of the Night.  With one notable exception, the actors are well-suited to their roles and play them to perfection.<br/><br/>The exception, of course, is Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife, ""Stanzie."" Clearly out of her depth in this role, she seems vastly more suited to play a Valley girl than an Austrian hausfrau; in many scenes she literally seems unable to grasp the meaning of her own lines.

","To me, the main theme is how someone with limited talent deals with someone else who is more talented.  Salieri is a popular mainstream composer, with a good income and power in the Viennese musical establishment.<br/><br/>The difference between Mozart and Salieri becomes apparent at their first actual meeting.  Salieri worked very hard at a small piece with which to welcome Mozart.  Mozart hears it played once, very badly, and is able to reproduce it accurately and to improvise a continuation, discard it, and improvise a better continuation.  (The actual piece is a march from Mozart's opera ""Idomeneo"" -- and is used in Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"")<br/><br/>Salieri is immediately struck with jealousy -- how dare God give such talent to ""that dirty-minded creature"".

","I love this movie and watch it every few months.  It is awesome and must be viewed with surround sound for the full effect.<br/><br/>The story is compelling in the way it is told from Salieri's point of view. Salieri is an adequate composer in Vienna held in high position in the court of Emporer Joseph(Jeffrey Jones). But when Mozart arrives from Salzburg, suddenly Salieri feels threatened. Right away Salieri's image of what Mozart might be like is blown- seeing him ""rolling on the floor"" playing a childlike sex game with his future wife, Constanze. Mozart inadvertently insults Salieri at a meeting with the emperor and all the court composers so from that point on  Salieri is driven to revenge by jealousy and envy of his talent, which he hails, ""music already finished in his head, as if he were taking dictation.  Then I knew, this was no performing monkey, this was the voice of God, coming through this infantile buffoon of a man"".  (These quotes are not exactly verbatim, but you get the jist of it). This a well spent 158 minutes.  Although this is not an actual biography on Mozart, which was not the intention of Peter Schaffer or Milos Forman. The point that I derived from this film is the fact that society never appreciates true genius while they are in the present.  Mediocrity will be hailed in the present, but the true genius will be shunned (and you can see that fact true to this day).  That point is driven home as ""Amadeus"" comes to a close when you see Salieri being wheeled into the mental hospital claiming to be the patron saint of mediocrity while in the background, you hear Mozart's giggle, having the last laugh at all his rivals, in that his music will live on forever. I feel that not only did F. Murray Abraham deserve the Best Actor Award by the Academy,  I wish that Tom Hulce could have gotten it also.  It should have been impossible to exclude one, both performances played off each other perfectly."
"halnexus","10","2","4","18 September 1999"," *** 1/2 (Out of four)
","There's a certain structure in Milos Forman's ""Amadeus"" which is bewitching in allegory, even if it proves somewhat shaky in execution.  Based on Peter Shaffer's play, ""Amadeus"" illustrates in flashback through narrator Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) the contradictive genius behind child prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce), a man with a gift for musical symphony underlying a childish, though unintentional facade.  Caught in a tug-of-war between 18th-century censorship techniques of the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and his own regrettable appreciation of Mozart's revolutionary genius, Salieri embarks upon a subplot which occasionally results in him being lost in his own autobiography.  This flaw would be more glaring if it weren't for a magnificent performance by Abraham as a man slighted by divinity.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Salieri's confession to a priest in a hospital following his suicide attempt.  After claiming to have ""killed Mozart"", Salieri proceeds to explain his motivations.  These originated with Salieri's childhood dream of becoming a ""musical instrument"" for God, only to be taunted by the Almighty through Mozart's melodious compositions. Aghast at the aspect, Salieri forsakes Him and proceeds to plan his own bitter destruction of the ""beloved of God"".<br/><br/>Even if the film were nothing more than a costume epic, it would still be a marvel to watch.  Women in busts barely concealing their cleavage and men whose masculinity protrude through even the most rigid of wear personify the lust still inherent beneath all those layers of decoration.  Patrizia von Brandenburg's set designs are nothing short of immaculate with their lavish plethora of details. <br/><br/>The film's goal to balance Salieri's jealousy with Mozart's musical martyrdom seems at times implausible.  If the story is seen through Salieri's eyes, how can it intrude upon Mozart's married life?  Indeed, during the film's central act, Salieri tends to disappear for long stretches at a time.  <br/><br/>Nevertheless, one could make the argument that it is necessary to detail both lives in order to show the turmoil between conservative aristocracy and Mozart's vastly underappreciated compositions.  Of course, like Forman's ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", the film makes inevitable comparisons to the modern-day debate of expression, including the emperor's traditional beliefs that there are ""too many notes!"" in Mozart's work.  This sort of modernized, countercultural philosophy is presented not only in Mozart's uninhibitedness, but also in various other elements: the unapproving father, the conservative establishment and the eventual degradation of classics into more accessible media, such as the vaudevillian treatment ""Don Giovanni"" receives.  Indeed Salieri, through the amazingly subtle actions of Abraham, sees the future and ""speaks for all mediocrity"" in condemning those whose extraordinary talents put others who are merely ordinary to shame.  This is an instinctual part of human nature: from schoolboy to occupationist, from 18th-century Austria to 20th-century America, there will always be those envious of one's superior talent.  But Forman and Abraham dramatize just how hard it is to pass the torch to potential scene-stealers.  While Mozart's music may lift us to otherworldly elevations, Salieri's story entrenches us into our own humanity."
"Chuck-149","10","2","4","10 September 1999"," One of the best movies ever made by a genius, Milos Forman.
","If you look back at Forman's passed movies, you think essentially of one of them, that movie being the all-time classic ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".  But you can't overlook his second masterpiece, ""Amadeus"".  Although not quite as excellent as his previous classic, Forman's tale of jealousy and tragedy plays out as well as it could have.  Plus, a terrific performance by F. Murray Abraham and a terrific script kept the movie as good as it could be for its complete running-time.<br/><br/>  The movie's opening scene consists in the camera filming two servants running over to their master's room whom we hear yelling.  After they break into the room they realize that their master, Antonio Salieri (Abraham), has tried to commit suicide for his neck is slit.  However, he is saved just on time and taken to a hospital where a priest comes to see him offering him forgiveness.  However, Salieri uses the priest as a witness to his tale of the murder of Amadeus (Tom Hulce).<br/><br/>  The movie shows all the facts that made Salieri hate Amadeus all the more as well as the trouble Amadeus could get into and his difficulty to make end's meet also.  You finally see how Amadeus dies, according to Forman naturally, and why Salieri blames himself for the murder of the composer.<br/><br/>  Between the directing, the acting, the script, and the costumes, there isn't much Forman doesn't include.  Of course, the music is better than in probably any other movie.  But I think that what impressed me the most about this movie is Abraham's truely beautiful, convincing performance.  It's a shame he hasn't played in any other great movies since because he is a tremendous actor.  But the bottom line for this movie is this: See it."

That scenes when he writes his music are simply magnificent. The music inside his mind and he just writes it. Then how he is describing his own music. By the other side, there is no shown any pupil working with him. I know that wasn't the purpose of the director (Milos Forman), but it would be interesting at least if one of his pupils had appeared.

","As a biography, the detractors are right. This film is only a 5 on that scale. But IMDb says the genre is Drama. I disagree. But if they are right then this flick is only a 7. And it is that high only because of the magnificent portrayal of the jealous Salieri by F. Murray Abraham. He has redefined Jealousy to include non-sexual jealousy, something Hollywood had forgotten. So classic was this rendition that Bill Buckley now calls Liberalism ""Salieri's Disease."" Once you see the picture you will understand the reference to wanting to destroy those who are more productive or talented. But the true genre is Musical. And the rating there is a 10, although the score is not reflective of the scope or the best of Mozart's compositions. Even so, this is Mozart. That makes the film a 10, and one worth seeing over and over and over!"

Murray Abraham is spectacular as the scheming Salieri, a competent, if not gifted, composer forced to watch ""this crude little man"", Mozart, achieve all that Salieri wanted in his own music.<br/><br/>See this movie at all costs.

When I found out that it was re-released in the theatres I went to see it right away and was so assaulted and engulfed by the sights and SOUNDS.  Then the music of Mozart itself moved me in such a way that I delved deep into classical music throughout my college years.  Milos Forman put together two outstanding actors, an incredible costume and wardrobe director, a phenomenal screenplay (let's not forget that this was a Broadway play first), shot the film around incredible architecture, and combined all these elements to support the music.  The film is gratuitously generous with the music of the man himself.  Neville Mariner, the conductor of the orchestra used in the film, was a man inspired by the greatness surrounding him for his renditions of Mozart's music for the film rivals even the best recordings I've heard.<br/><br/>Amadeus still ranks in my top three films, if not number one, even after fifteen years."

Tom Hulce gives Mozart a boyish charm, and that laugh!  That high pitched giggle that haunts Salieri till the very end.  The music of Mozart is heard constantly through out the film. You can see the foreshadowing and hear it, whenever Mozart's father appears. And when the Don Giovanni piece appears, it all makes sense.  The best scene in the film is when Mozart is ill, and Salieri sees this as his chance to get even with God.  Mozart hears the music that will eventually become the Requiem, all in his head.  As he dictates the score, Salieri becomes overwhelmed by the genius of Mozart.  But, the ultimate indignation for this great composer comes at the end.  The Lacrymosa is playing and we see Mozart's final resting place.  A mass, unmarked grave.  All dramacticaly punctuated by a massive choir, and you feel just like the priest that is taking Salieri's confession.

Oscar nominee Tom Hulce gives the greatest performance of his career as Mozart, the childish, immature brat that God chose to be the greatest musical composer ever. Hulce gives so much light to the screen annoying the hell out of everyone around him, especially F. Murray Abraham, (who overshadows Hulce with an Oscar winning performance) who plays Antonio Salieri, a mediocre composer who went insane with jealousy against Mozart for his God-given gift. Salieri, who is now comsumed by hatred and sorrow, swears vengeance on Mozart, and even God Himself.<br/><br/>The film Amadeus, is like Mozart's music itself, miraculous. Tom Hulce and Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham add so much dramatic intensity to the 2 1/2 hr. film that it never seems half that long. You have to see it to really know what I'm talking about, but it is certainly well worth the time.

But seeing Amadeus immediately piqued my interest in all classical music through its unique use of Mozart's music as not only a part of the plot, but also as theme music for each scene.<br/><br/>Amadeus so moved me that I have read several books on Mozart's life.  I learned that Salieri once claimed he had killed Mozart.  However, he quickly recanted this.  Therefore, Amadeus is strictly fiction.  Once one recognizes that, he may enjoy the movie more as an entertainment than a biography, which it definitely is not.<br/><br/>In fact, there are many theories as to how Mozart died.  One book even suggests that his wife, Constanze, poisoned him!  It is more likely, however, that he died of `natural causes,' which in 1999 could have been easily cured.<br/><br/>Whatever the cause of Mozart's death, and whatever his personality might have been, Mozart's music is THE standard for all other classical composers. There will never be another like him.  And Amadeus gets this point across to people who aren't initially classical music fans.<br/><br/>If this movie isn't a 10, there aren't any 10s out there!"

Who hasn't felt the desire to do something but felt inadequate ""Why implant the desire like a lust in my body, and then make me mute?""...salieri ignoring the fact that he himself was quite talented...i certainly can't write an opera, he wrote 40! I love the depiction of Salieri's battle with God, and the title could not be more appropriate ""Amadeus"" which means, beloved of God. You can empathize with both characters, Abraham and Hulce give such depth to the characters. We see that Mozart is a childish, vulgar man, in his outward attitude but when it comes to his music he is nothing but sublime and beautiful. Salieri is an insecure, talented man who seems to feel sort of like the 2nd favourite child. The scene near the end when Mozart is composing the Requiem is almost breathtaking. It lends to the imagination what the composition process might've been like for Wolfi, but most importantly it demonstrates the complex layers of Mozart's music and how well they all fit together. He writes beautiful melodies, but the structure of his music as a whole is what makes it truly amazing ""misplace one note...and the structure would fall""."

","Before seeing ""Amadeus"" I expected it to be a boring movie, but wow! I was captured immediately from the starting scene of the movie. I like this movie so much because it gives me strong feelings. I think everybody who has a passion on something and want to work in the same field can somehow identify with Salieri... When you try v. hard to improve but what you achieve is work, not art; but others know exactly how to create perfection. They can't tell you how they make it but bong! there comes a piece of great art. <br/><br/>
  The movie is so good that the characters give me strong feelings. I pity Salieri but dislike him for not being content with his own talent.My heart ached in the scene when Salieri was conducting his own opera (the one he invited Mozart to see). He was passionate in his work & he was soo happy when he heard the applause and when he's praised by the Emperor. Another person may already be content in his position but Salieri tortured himself so much by his jealousy. He ruined his own life. This character gives me so much mixed emotions. Both Salieri & Mozart give me mixed feelings. They can be lovable, hateful & pitiful AT THE SAME TIME! (the portray that Salieri loves dessert & the happiness he shows when he's praised give him a lovable side in his character) btw, the scene when Salieri helped Mozart to write down his music is v. successful to give me strong, mixed emotions. The pity for both of them, & the strange relationship % them. (think about how Mozart perceives Salieri )"
"THX 1138","9","2","4","9 January 2002"," Historically inaccurate but sublime in every other aspect
","Amadeus is a great movie and gains in quality after repeated viewing. It's right up there in my top ten list. Why historically inaccurate? Well, I am a big Mozart fan and I've read all the published letters he wrote to his father. Believe me, if Mozart had a disliking to someone, he'd mention it to his father without having reservations. If Mozart ever mentions Salieri in his letters, he refers to him as his colleague and doesn't have one nasty thing to say about him. Salieri never commissioned or helped Mozart with the Requiem score nor did he poisoned him (which also has been rumored) nor did he work him to death. I feel sorry for Salieri because he himself had only nice things to say about his colleagues. I think he deserves better and wonder why he's being portrayed as such a villain. (Bad enough for him no one knows his music...) By the way: Mozart's outrageous giggle which everyone loved and was the onset of an imitation-contest in Italy was ""made in Hollywood"". If the makers of Amadeus would have read the letters he wrote to his wife and niece, they could have dispensed with the fabricated intrigues and use factual material that would make Milos Forman's Mozart look like a choirboy. But hey: I still love to watch this movie, even for the umph-th time! Thanks Milos!"
"acbryan","10","2","4","3 December 2001"," Cinematic Perfection
","Amadeus is cinematic perfection.  I admit I have concluded Amadeus to be my favorite motion picture of all time.  Start to finish, this film is filled with so much.  I will attempt to name just a few of it's greater elements.<br/><br/>Firstly, after reading a couple of serious, highly regarded and obviously heavily researched biographies of Wolfgang Mozart, I was shocked and pleased to discover that Peter Schaeffer and Milos Forman had clearly not only done mountains of research to perfect their sketch of this man, but these two men interpolated every little known nuance with exquisite perfection.  Thanks to them, Mozart is alive as real on the screen as if he were alive passing you by on the avenue today.  True, there are historical inaccuracies, but clearly they meant as artistic liberties, taken to create drama and flow (they demonstrate such intimate knowledge of all the little details that they are allowed to skew the big details).  The important point is that the composite picture of this man is a brilliant recreation of real life, to the best of anyone's knowledge.<br/><br/>The acting is remarkable.  Not only are F. Murray Abraham's rushes unforgettable and poignant, but there are so many apparent accidents with respect to other casting choices.  Hulce's uncanny portrayal is exactly as one would have imagined him after reading any of the serious bios, to say nothing of that mad cackle.  Tom Hulce, of course, is not a prolific screen actor, but this rare performance is so incredibly strong, it is as if his entire life were tailor-made for it, and his contribution to cinema is as great as any actor's simply with this one role.  Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart is another seemingly accidental perfection.  Leopold is played with the precise mixture of intelligence, love, misery, and pathos to be the composite of how the real man is written about.  Once again, it is as if every player had done exhaustive research, conceptualized and made their character's lives part of their own psyche so that they act and react to new situations as if they were that person.  As for Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor, he was just wickedly funny.  All in all, the acting is simply astounding.<br/><br/>The music of Mozart has been selected for the soundtrack by true masters. The pieces used are dazzling and truly encapsulate that dichotomous sense of bliss and horror that Mozart always strove to capture.  The music leaves Mozart-neophytes yearning for more, and long-time Mozart fans cheering their favorites.  When I first watched Amadeus, I belonged to the former group. I am now proud to say I belong to the latter, and when I re-screen Amadeus, I do cheer and weep tears of joy, bliss and shiver with terror at the marvelous orchestrations.  Salieri's analysis of the music is also fascinating, if subjective.<br/><br/>The choice of Prague as the shooting location was brilliant.  Prague in 1983 (when this film was shot) was still part of the Eastern Block of countries and, as such, was untouched and unhindered by the West.  It's cobble-stone streets, cathedrals and tenements all still stood as they did in the eighteenth century, (and in all likelihood, as they did in the fifteenth century) without the desecration of Western-style neon signs, modern architecture or other such telling signs of the twentieth century.  In other words, it is the  perfect character to play eighteenth century Vienna; in a sense, another excellent casting choice.  Together with the flawless costume design, and all the perfectly selected character actors and bit players, the deception is complete.  We are all hypnotized into believing we have arrived in Vienna c. 1780's.<br/><br/>I love every frame of Amadeus.  The plot takes liberties, of course, but that is the very nature of cinema.  Besides the above elements, the content is full of rich and substantial themes and sub-themes, leading the audience to further provocation: hatred, anger, mediocrity, the nature of savants, prodigy, beauty, envy, vengeance, the differences between (Salieri's fleeting) form (of fame) and (Mozart's lasting) substance (of fame), and the list continues."

","I never cared much for the music of Mozart until Forman made this brilliant film. Tom Hulce draws a believiable (sic!) portrait of an artist at work, while F.

"divaclv","Null","2","4","3 October 2001"," An exquisite experience
","A brilliant treatise on artistry and ambition, ""Amadeus"" tells a largely speculative story about the professional rivalry between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The historic accuracy is questionable, but that hardly matters as the film is not a meticulous attempt to recreate the Vienna of the Classical Era, but a thoughtful commentary on the arbitrary nature of genius and fame.<br/><br/>The comparison and contrast between the sober Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, whose performance is the driving force of the film) and the vulgar, petulant Mozart (Tom Hulce, whose work here is second only to Abraham's) is in itself worth the price of rental.  Both men are passionate souls, driven by their own ideals of artistic perfection.  But while Salieri prays in vain for a brilliance that elludes him, Mozart's talent for music is so effortless that at times he seems to take it for granted.  Did Salieri descend into madness and engineer the death of a man he both admired and despised?  Or did Mozart simply burn himself out with the fire of his own genius?  Was the creation of some of the world's greatest music by an impish, rude man a manifestation of a perverse sense of humor in the Divine?  The movie prefers not to answer these questions, leaving the audience to carry away its own opinions on the matter.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there is the music itself--some of Mozart's finest works (including one of my favorites, the Mass in C Minor) are highlighted in the production.  The operatic staging by Twyla Tharp is marvelous, as are the voices used for the scenes.  The costumes magnify the differences between Salieri (somber blacks and browns) and Mozart (garish colors and a variety of outlandish wigs).  The end result is facinating, haunting, thought-provoking, and unforgettable."

","Every once in a while, Hollywood gives us a lush epic similar to the ones they made so often in the 50's.  Most of these films are not good.  Most of them are too long or are just ridiculous.  For ""Amadeus"" this is not the case.  Every wide-screen frame is lovingly packed with detail and color. It is perhaps the most beautiful movie of the 80's.  The script is impressive, and although the writers may not have been too true to history, they certainly appreciated the otherworldly genius of Mozart.  F. Murray Abraham does splendid work, and Tom Hulce is the ideal actor for the musical nut case.  (By the way, what's happened to Tom Hulce?)  The film is surprisingly witty for a period film.  Over all, ""Amadeus"" is definitely a fine epic worthy of butt-numbing for."

We have eyes, and we can hold a paintbrush - just apply the right colour in the right places. What more is needed?<br/><br/>And Mozart, what is necessary to create music similar to his? Salieri could sit at a keyboard and work the keys, plink plonk. He knew which notes go together and which don't. He knew a good tune from a bad one...<br/><br/>And Forman, and Schaffer. They made a movie: Amadeus... Simple... perhaps anyone could do it with a bit of practice? You get a nice adequate budget and professional actors.

","My favourite bit is the part at the beginning, where Mozart improvises an ""improvement"" on Salieri's music - without even seeing the score!<br/><br/>This film may be seen as ahistorical - but if it is, it is based on old myths. Even Beethoven believed that Salieri killed Mozart. In fact, at one time Salieri was let into an asylum, just as in the film, claiming that he had poisoned Mozart. He later denied it. But nonetheless the film can be seen as historical in that Salieri is mad at the time, and watching the film we are seeing the past through temporarily insane eyes.<br/><br/>  There are some indications to suggest such an interpretation is correct. For example, Salieri thinks he killed Mozart at the beginning of the film - yet at the end of the film we see he has done nothing of the sort - he mrely plots to kill Mozart, who dies of overwork and illness.<br/><br/>In other words, don't knock the film for being too fictional. It can be seen as a view of Mozart through the eyes of Salieri who is temporarily mad.<br/><br/>Jonathan Lim"

","Grazie a Lei, Milos Forman for your skillful direction.  Whatever a movie is supposed to be, Amadeus is definitely it.  Although the dialogue stumbles over some colloquialisms, the movie is otherwise extremely beautiful and well-thought out.  It made me almost regret my mediocrity and sympathize with Salieri.  Almost.<br/><br/>I first saw Amadeus in my junior year of high school, after a friend recommended it to me.  It made such an impression that I decided I was going to go to the Mozart Music Festival in Salzburg the following summer. Probably what struck me most about the film was its dramatic portrayal of Salieri, a man who blended into the 18th century music scene so well, his history can only be linked with Mozart, and although not mentioned, Beethoven, one of his later pupils.  Watching Salieri struggle with his mediocrity created a pang in my side - how often are we all forced to witness genius and know that we can never achieve it?  What is even more interesting is the dichotomy between the side of him that longs to destroy Mozart and the side of him that worships every note Mozart composes. Mozart's character was more conventional in that it portrayed an artist who falls short of his work.  ""Your majesty, I am a vulgar man, but I assure you, my music is not...""  Even if the less than factual depiction of Mozart offends some people, the dexterous use of music alone is worth watching the movie.<br/><br/>Go see the movie already, if you haven't."

"gab-14712","10","0","0","8 May 2020"," My Favorite Film of 1984!
","Amadeus, without a doubt, is my favorite film from 1984. Looking in from the outside, the movie looks to be a dark, disturbing tale about the feud between legendary composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. In reality, while the film has some extremely dark moments, it is also light-hearted and quite funny. The casting is perfect. Tom Hulce as Mozart is one of the best casting of all-time, and it comes out of nowhere! The costumes are fantastic. Should I even mention the music? This film made me appreciate the fact that Mozart is one of the greatest minds in human history.<br/><br/>In 1975, a movie was released called One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. That movie was one of my favorite films that year and also won Best Picture at the Oscars, just like this movie. Both films were directed by Milos Forman. Forman directed the heck out of the movie. Each scene was expertly staged and meaningful. Considering the world was entering the MTV stage, Forman took a giant gamble creating a three-hour long movie about classical music. That gamble paid off. I liked where he chose to shoot his film- in his native Czechoslovakia. Even though the film is set in Vienna, Prague had the scenery of what the world would look like two centuries prior.<br/><br/>People question whether the film is historically accurate or not. From the beginning, Forman and writer Peter Schaffer made it clear that the film is only loosely based on history. Most of the movie is just a drama made to entertain. The central premise of the film is the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri. While sometimes competing against each other for commissions, the two men were actually good friends. Salieri is depicted as a loner with a religious heart but was actually a married men with eight children. So, before you decide to critique the film on its accuracy, well this what the filmmakers intended.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is in love with Wolfgang Mozart's (Tom Hulce) music. He finds it divine and out-of-this-world. Salieri, who resides on the court of Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), desperately wishes he were as good as Mozart. As a devout, religious man, he believed his talent was to praise God. He receives the shock of his life when he discovers Mozart is actually a vulgar, and rather self-centered man. He asks God why this creature deserves even better musical gifts than himself. He takes it to himself to take revenge on Mozart...and ultimately God.<br/><br/>The movie is a period costume drama and they can be somewhat dry and stuffy if not casted well. The casting here is absolutely genius and it makes the film fun as ever. If you seen Tom Hulce's performance in Animal House, you would not expect him to play a composer. Mark Hamill was originally considered but Forman thought his Luke Skywalker persona would be a distraction. Hulce's casting is genius. He played Mozart like a 60's punk hipster, and it worked so well. That laugh, though. Very unforgettable! On the flip side, F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri with such intensity. He commanded the screen each time he was on. Whether he was imitating Mozart's father (was played wonderfully by Roy Dotrice) or just giving the overview of the story whilst in the madhouse, just stay for his performance. I also liked Elizabeth Berridge's performance as Mozart's wife, Constanze.<br/><br/>Do I really need to mention the music? When performed well, Mozart's music is like heaven. Mozart is a genius and it amazes me he was able to create such magic at a young age. Just to think in today's age, we get Taylor Swift. Who am I to judge? There is a reason why he is one of the greatest minds in history. If you like classical music or not, you will not forget Mozart. Forman did a wonderful job in making sure Mozart's music help tell the story.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a film that asks important questions. If you know someone who is better than you, how would you react? How would you feel? Would you do anything? Such as murder the better person, as the film suggested Salieri did in the opening scene. Jealousy is the big theme that drives the movie and it allows us to feel for Salieri when the film ended. The character of Mozart is why the film is allowed to breathe with light-heartedness and humor. History remains to be seen whether Mozart was a crude person or not or had that infectious laugh (which I hated at first). Anyhow, this is my favorite film of 1984. It delivers a blend of emotions, is well-acted and well-directed, and the music is excellent as we should expect. Apparently, the Academy agreed.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","""Amadeus"" is a weird and vibrant portrayal of the life of Amadeus Mozart, as told by Antonio Salieri, the man who claimed to have killed him. Despite it's nearly three hour runtime (that's mostly comprised of dialogue heavy scenes), it's still a very compelling and engaging watch. So although I don't view ""Amadeus"" as a 10/10 masterpiece, it's still worth a watch for music and film fans alike.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both did an excellent job as the film's two lead characters. They both strike the perfect balance of being both unpleasant and likeable, causing the audience to constantly change their allegiance during the course of the movie. It was a smart decision to make the antagonist of ""Amadeus"" essentially the main character, as it gives the both of the main characters protagonist and antagonist traits. As we witness how childish and vain Mozart could be and the obsessive lengths that Salieri goes to in an attempt to destroy his rival, we can root for both characters, even if we don't agree with their actions.<br/><br/>One of the best elements of ""Amadeus"" is it's superb cinematography. Whatever you may think of the movie's depiction of its title character, you can't deny that this film is outstanding on a visual level. The rich colours combined with the opulence of the locations and the deep darkness that envelops the gloomier scenes creates a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>The visual design in ""Amadeus"" is very impressive; the elaborate sets and lavish costumes effectively capture the feel of the time period, which helps the story feel grounded in reality despite the film's bizarre style.<br/><br/>As this is a semi biopic of Amadeus Mozart, one of the most prolific and beloved composers in music history, music is obviously a key aspect of ""Amadeus."" The music is utilised brilliantly here, it gives the film a dreamlike and theatrical atmosphere whilst also elevating the more dramatic sequences to near operatic levels. Unlike many modern films based upon the lives of musical superstars (like the ridiculously overrated ""Bohemian Rhapsody""), the soundtrack in ""Amadeus"" isn't just shoehorned into the movie unnecessarily, it's an organic part of the film that helps tell the story in a more creative way.
My only major criticism of ""Amadeus"" is that the section of the film that takes place in the less-extravagant theatre that plays low-budget Mozart productions goes on for far too long. I understand that these moments depict that Mozart was financially irresponsible, but these scenes became tedious and dull pretty quickly.<br/><br/>To summarise, I really enjoyed ""Amadeus."" It's not the sort of film I'd usually gravitate towards, but I'm really glad I saw it; the performances are top-notch, the visuals are spectacular and the way that the story unfolds is intelligent and powerful. I'm aware that it has the potential to greatly anger history buffs, but I would definitely recommend ""Amadeus."""

I never thought Opera could be so meaningful and profound as i have seen in Amadeus and that too when i don't really understand anything about it. There are so many biographical dramas made over the years but no one came with this kind of uniqueness and proper use of fictional writing. Amadeus is story of Legendary Piano artist Amdeous Mozart but the story is told by guy who used to feel jealous of him. The entire narrative is driven by negative character which doesn't really feel negative when the film ends. Like he says, how could god take him away just to stop mediocrity to have a little share of his glory. Wow, wow, just wow... Amadeus will always remain special and different for this reason that the villain doesn't look a villain and the hero goes less admired than him. In Musical aspects Amadeus explodes all the correct tunes with top class presentation of Opera. F. Murray Abraham won Oscar for the portrayal of Antonio Salieri and the dominance was damn too high. Tom Hulce gets the madness right, his face expressions and that funny laughter seemed amazing. Elizabeth Berridge as her wife gets little enough to do. Coming to the most important person behind this miraculous presentation, the Director The Milos Forman, how do i find words to admire him when i feel like have used all adjectives already for others. I just wanna say this, Dear Milos Forman thank you for showing an art of storytelling in feature film attire.

","This movie is an abomination, both to music and the cinematic art.
Firstly, the story is told from the point of view of his supposed rival Salieri, who is basically a nobody. This allows Mozart to be portrayed (from Salieri's POV) as a frivolous and arrogant persona who doesn't deserve to be the vessel for the divine music he produces.
The actors all have different accents, which makes for a very distracting viewing. Mozart's American accent in particular sounds exceptionally farcical. That is not to mention his ridiculous pink hair and over-exaggerated mood swings.
I honestly don't understand why this movie is so highly rated. It is more about Salieri's vices and unamusing instances of humor than about Mozart and his music. Just because the producers were able to put together some historical costumes and locations doesn't add any worth to the movie.
The producers of this film clearly did not bother putting together a decent filmwriter and casting team, and that sticks out like a sore thumb.
I only wish that the Mozart's name had not been shamed by being chosen as the title of this huge, huge bag of disappointment."

","Since 100s of thousands of people have already said the obvious -- that this greatest of masterpieces was beautifully written, acted, directed, and shot -- I'll add this. Period dramas generally try to hard to be accurate to the way people used language during that period, from very formal and stilted ways of speaking to rough and primitive language. But what almost always gets lost is the ""right nowness"" of language. This film tosses aside any pretence of ""That's the way people spoke during that period"" in favor of natural and plain language.

","To judge the biopic or musical aspect of this film is to miss the essence of the film.
Besides, Forman never wanted / claimed to make a realistic biopic about Mozart's life.
Amadeus is clearly announced as a reinterpreted fiction of the character.
As for the music, it's Mozart's, so if you don't like it, it's hard to appreciate it, because anyway, the film remains orchestrated around his music (you'll notice the sequences between his songs and the scenes of the film...).<br/><br/>But what is most interesting (daring) is to have been interested in Mozart's personality and to have shown a ""Mozart"" as he was most probably: brilliant (his genius seems hardly questionable), but haughty, proud, womanizer, pierced basket and kid.
In short, a Mozart a little more ""real"" than what we are used to retain from him."

","Now there's two methods that can alter my perception of a film for me to consider one a stark, viable masterpiece. The first method of mine when dictating the intricacy of a cinematic experience would have to be just after the viewing when a noetic conception is instigated. Secondly I'd place the denomination of masterpiece on a film if it entire encapsulated me within the first 10 minutes of it's duration. I've visually perceived 3 films up until this point that are of the latter. I would jubilantly integrate this piece of filmography to the list.<br/><br/>From the first shot I'm consummately captivated by its Cinematography and score. From there it only ascends. It tells the story of Antoine Salieri, a man overshadowed by the great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. As the film perpetuates Antine abhorrence and jealousy towards Mozart gets more ostensible. But deep down no matter how much he abhors him, just like anyone else just can't gainsay how brilliant and fantastic Mozart is. You get these astonishing scenes of Antonio endeavoring sabotage Mozart's integrity and ruin him. Every single time he just fails miserably solely just because of how magnificent Mozart is. After a couple of failed endeavors he comes up with his master plan; To kill Mozart and engender a Requiem that would be played at his funeral. If everything fell into place Antoine would have the last laugh. Haplessly prior to him culminating his requiem, it is abruptly cut short by the death of Mozart. It is at Mozart's funeral that a disgrace of a funeral is being set for one of the most influential and integral musical composers of the baroque/classical period. Its at this point he realizes this was an act of god to torture Antoine. He's coerced to live the rest of his dying days in pristine torment kenning that he will never be better or even reach the greatness of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>This is an impeccable film no doubt about it. It's great cinematography and shot composition. The astonishing performance from Tom Hulce. We can't forget about F. Murray Abraham who gives an even better performance. Utilizing Mozart's music gives the film on inequitable advantage to other music utilized in films. The set design and costumes are all well done. All this accumulates to not just the best film of the 1980s but one of the all time great. At the end of the day this is a 3 hour film that I don't believe is overrated or too long and that's I'll that really matters."
"davidmvining","10","0","0","21 November 2019"," A Fantastic Entertainment
","Re-Introductions and Introductions<br/><br/>When I first discovered Amadeus, I loved it, and I showed it to my father. We watched it together (one very nice thing about him was that he's willing to watch almost whatever I try to put in front of him), and his reaction was much more tempered than mine. He said, ""You'll like it less as you get older."" Not that he didn't like the film, but he just didn't love it like I did.
I didn't watch this movie for at least seven years until this week when I finally revisited it. I was a bit terrified. Was my dad right? Would I finally rewatch the film and decide that it's simply not as good as my younger self had determined?<br/><br/>Thankfully, I loved the film as much as before, and that started with one particular moment about ten minutes into the film. Salieri, having attempted suicide, is sitting alone in a cell in a sanitarium playing some small tunes on a harpsicord. A priest comes to hear his confession. Salieri wants nothing to do with the priest until the priest insists that all men are equal in God's eyes. That attracts Salieri's attention.<br/><br/>He starts by trying to draw the priest into his story by playing some of Salieri's old tunes, music that the priest should be familiar with because he studied music in Vienna in his youth. The first tune passes over the priest's head, much to Salieri's distaste.<br/><br/>It's a simple cut to a tracking shot, and it completely pulls me into the film.
Salieri plays the first few bars of the music. He takes his fingers off the keys to revel in the sound in his head. We, of course, hear it, but the priest does not. The cut takes us to a live performance of the music sung by a woman, gaudily dressed, on stage. The camera pulls back to reveal a man conducting an orchestra. As this man turns, the camera changes focus from the woman to him, revealing Salieri, decades younger, and at the height of his influence and power.<br/><br/>It's such a simple cut and dolly, and it sells two things. The first is the basic structure of the movie. We're going to see what he's talking about. The other is character based. His telling of his story really starts with Salieri at the height of his influence and popularity. He's adored by music lovers, and he's firm in his commitment to his art. That simple cut and dolly puts such a smile on my face every time.<br/><br/>Mozart<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri is the protagonist of the film, and Mozart is the antagonist. Not to say good guy and bad guy, but Salieri is obviously the one driving the plot in the film. He hinders and helps Mozart, driving him from success to failure.<br/><br/>Mozart, though, is a delight and played by Tom Hulce (who lost the Best Actor Oscar to F. Murray Abraham for his performance as Salieri). He's an effortless genius who's been spoiled to the point that he can usually get away with any manner of vulgarity. This is evident when he first approaches the Emperor Joseph II and admits that his idea for an opera (in German!) he will set in a harem. The courtiers around the emperor gasp at the mere thought, but the emperor hides a small smile. He's obviously entertained by Mozart's brashness, eventually giving in to every wish Mozart has in terms of his art.<br/><br/>The scene that that plays out in is where Salieri begins to truly hate Mozart. Not only is Mozart vulgar, as opposed to Salieri's own reserved modesty (which he offers up to God, along with his chastity, in order to praise Him through music), but Mozart is also effortlessly gifted.<br/><br/>The second scene that I want to highlight is this. Salieri worked hard on that little march of his. He played with the fortepiano for every note, trying to craft something as an appropriate welcome to the wunderkind. Then, presented with the music sheet, Mozart waves it off. He's already memorized it after one hearing. Not only does he then prove that he can recreate Salieri's simple tune perfectly, but he, on the fly, improves it tremendously (eventually turning it into something that actually comes from The Marriage of Figaro). Salieri had worked diligently and reverentially to produce the piece that this creature (as Salieri calls Mozart) instantly turns into something so much better.<br/><br/>Salieri's dismissive attitude towards the priest's contention that all men are equal in God's eyes comes into full view in an instant. Salieri isn't equal to Mozart. God obviously prefers Mozart considering the difference in talent and perceived holiness between the two men.<br/><br/>Composition<br/><br/>The last scene I want to highlight is the writing of the requiem mass as Salieri assists Mozart after the production of The Magic Flute (quick aside, Ingmar Bergman made an absolutely marvelous production of The Magic Flute, and you should find a copy at your local library).<br/><br/>Salieri, a lover of music who understands the stark contrast between his ability and Mozart's, wants Mozart to write his own Requiem mass and then to take credit for it. Left alone with him, Mozart's wife having left Vienna in disgust at Mozart's inability to focus on making money in favor of potentially empty promises, Salieri dictates Mozart's work. Together, they compose a few bars of music for every instrument in the piece. They build it layer by layer. Voices, horns of different types, strings. It all comes together, sometimes just sounding like noise, but once it all comes together the audience can hear the confluence of the different pieces to create the harmonious music in its entirety.<br/><br/>The fact that Salieri is behind and can't understand until it's spelled out for him is marvelous. He knows enough to aid Mozart, but he's obviously completely out of his depth. Mozart seems to speak in a different language the deeper into the composition they get. Let's take a look!<br/><br/>The Movie Entire<br/><br/>The movie itself is obviously much more than the three scenes I've highlighted, and what really carries it is Salieri himself. He's such a wonderfully complex character who balances his hatred of Mozart the person with his love of Mozart the artist.<br/><br/>He often lies to Mozart. He lies about trying to help Mozart at court, only to be thwarted by circumstance. He lies about how he'll try to help him with an appointment. But he can never lie about how he feels regarding Mozart's music. Whenever Mozart asks Salieri what he thought of Mozart's newest work, all pretense falls from Salieri and he tells the honest truth, that it was magnificent.<br/><br/>In addition to Salieri, Constanze, Mozart's wife, looks like someone who would be completely out of her depth in regards to anything serious, but the fact that she's the one who sees things clearly offers Mozart a firm base from which to operate. When she leaves, Mozart loses all of the support she offered and falls into the hands of Schikaneder and Salieri.<br/><br/>The court is a joyful little comic delight. Most of them are as opposed to Mozart as Salieri. They use every ounce of their power to keep Mozart in check, but the Emperor Joseph will walk in and completely overturn anything with the smallest of suggestions (""Let me hear the scene with the music."") that put Mozart back on top.<br/><br/>The movie really is not what one would expect from a three hour film about a classical composer (side note: The Director's Cut really is a Director's Cut and probably is the superior version of the film). It's light and joyful where it needs to be. It's got surprising contemporary touches like Mozart's pink wig which evokes mid-80s punk rock. The movie really does fly by, never feeling like three hours, and is one of the most fun times I ever have had at the movies, so to speak.<br/><br/>A Small Note on Historical (In)Accuracy<br/><br/>I don't insist much on historical accuracy from films. I don't expect history lessons from movies, but I do expect to be entertained.
Amadeus is bad history. Mozart had six kids, not one. Salieri didn't help Mozart write the Requiem. Salieri wasn't a celibate. There's so much in this film that's not historically accurate.<br/><br/>And yet, the movie is filtered through Salieri the character. It's a telling of the events through an unreliable narrator. It really gives the film credence to be as historically inaccurate as it wants to be. And, probably because of its complete disregard for actual history, the movie is a fantastic entertainment and explores what it means to be an artist."

The music is done really, really well, infused throughout the film to create drama. I found the narration by the elderly Salieri perhaps a bit too literal at times, I didn't need to be spoon-fed quite so much. The last hour also dragged a bit, with a bit too much time spent on the re-creation of some of Mozart's operas.

","Makes nearly 3 hours feel like 5 minutes, a masterclass in pacing and telling a compelling story. The film doesn't take itself too seriously. It would've been way easier to make a by the books serious historical drama. The film decides to make everything a farce and challenge your preconceived notions of what truly makes a great composer and ultimately what makes good music. Amadeus himself is a ticking time-bomb.<br/><br/>Constantly making a joke out of a lot of the situations he gets into. The one thing that keeps him so interesting is his willingness to go against norms of the time. Wolfgang made the music he connected with and you can see that when he conducts. It explodes off the screen. His music absolutely kicks tons of ass. Even if the people in Mozart's day didn't think the same. Salieri is the perfect antithesis. People loved his music at the time but unlike Mozart, his music has been pushed to the side. He still has an appreciation of Mozart's music but he doesn't like the implications and the behaviour of the man that comes with it.<br/><br/>By the last 30 minutes, the two come together and it is one of the best and most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. Perfectly captures the magic of composing and loving music. The amount of humanity that is shown between these two is the emotional heart of the film and feels like the perfect climax.<br/><br/>Amadeus doesn't hold back, it's exciting and bombastic but it never forgets the humanity behind its characters, and I think that's what makes it truly special."

","The plot of this film requires Mozart to be portrayed as boorish, annoying git. Hulce turns in a great turn doing just that. If anything he is too good at being annoying. Pretty much every time Mozart laughs you will want to stab him or your own eardrums. While that is precisely the point of the story it can make the film hard to watch in places. Fortunately the rest of the material is so compelling that you can usually overcome this issue. The film at least is great to think about.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with Salieri being such a compelling figure. Through his envy and mediocrity but also his social graces the film presents a compelling version of the problem of evil. Given Murray's tour de force the 3 hours are just utterly engrossing.<br/><br/>It also helps that the film is very operatic.

","This film presents an interesting take on the problem of evil, envy and the way natural talent is allotted at birth. Salieri is deeply compelling figure of commonness who has just enough skill in his chosen field to be able to understand true genius. But he is also a proper man. Mozart is the opposite as it required by the story dynamics. Murray plays with such great sensibility and understanding that you can't help but understand him. And in a sense cheer him on. The 3 hours just fly by because of how compelling Salieri is.<br/><br/>However, for this plot to work Mozart has to be portray as an annoying, boorish git. Hulce is more than up to the task.

"elicopperman","9","0","0","10 January 2019"," A Biopic Unlike Any Other
","If you were to ask me what are my favorite biopics on well known musicians or composers, one immediate answer would be Amadeus. Based on the play of the same name by Peter Shaffer (who also wrote the film's screenplay), this film won multiple oscars in 1985, one of which being best picture. But what exactly makes this film so special to not only me, but to so many film buffs and critics alike? Well, given that the film is a fictionalized depiction of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it doesn't actually focus on his whole life. Instead, the central focus is told from a lesser known composer who knew the lad, Antonio Salieri.<br/><br/>The main storyline revolves around Salieri loving Mozart's incredible work but resenting the man's obscene and repugnant behavior. Due to not being as good as Wolfgang, Salieri becomes jealous to the point of taking vengeance on the young composer. What makes Salieri so intriguing as a lead is how spiritual he is, as he fell in love with music after getting close to the lord. So upon seeing that the lord bestowed such miraculous talents to a raunchy individual, his bitter perspective of Amadeus makes for great rivalry. However, the film also showcases Mozart's own struggles regarding his personal life with a concerned wife and father and getting his visions out with the emperor's approval. This contrast proves how even though Salieri wishes he was in Mozart's shoes, it wouldn't do him any good since the rival's life was no better than his.<br/><br/>Then there's the actors, who really help convey the right emotions and charisma to each given character. F. Murray Abraham represents Salieri as a very down to earth and respectful admirer of music, but he also captures his stubborn animosity towards Mozart through subtle emoting and expressions. Tom Hulce clearly had a lot of fun playing Amadeus whenever he would act goofy and immature, but he's also able to sell the character's inner worries and passion in a very relatable way. Elizabeth Berridge is able to bring a good mix of heart and pathos to Mozart's wife Constanze, which again, proves how Mozart's life was not as grand as Salieri thought. The other actors are either appropriately subdued or lively in their own regard, but the main actors are the glue that resonate with viewers the most.<br/><br/>While the film may not be completely accurate to the real story of Mozart, it is highly detailed in terms of getting the 18th century time period down. The costumes by Theodor Pistek look very fashionable for their day, and one can tell how much creativity was put into them. From a technical standpoint, the cinematography recreates the film to resemble the aforementioned century, from the color scheme to the establishing sets and shots. It's almost as if we're viewing what that century looked like back then. In fact, some of the operas performed in the film were even shot on location at the original Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague. Not to mention, musical professors and scholars have said that not one note in this film is misplayed, so this flick might be the right choice for a music class.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Amadeus is not only well crafted in nearly every way, but it also succeeds in telling us how stubborn some people are. No matter how much you envy someone whose better than you, that should never be a reason to let it consume your well being. Sometimes, you just have to accept the fact that you might not be as accomplished in your passion as someone else, and then you can move on with your life smoothly and rationally. So if you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely give it a watch any time. Remember, it's not called Amadeus because it focuses specifically on Mozart. It's called Amadeus because it focuses on another composer's view on Mozart; think about that."
"SimonJack","10","0","0","28 December 2018"," Great film about a great composer and time in musical history
","A lot of writing isn't necessary to praise a great film, and ""Amadeus"" is just that. The novel approach used in this film works beautifully. A major character in the plot tells the story of Mozart and his great music. F. Murray Abraham plays the Italian composer Antonio Salieri wonderfully. It is through his eyes that the story is told.<br/><br/>Abraham won the best actor Oscar in 1984 over the film's co-star, Tom Hulce, who also was nominated for best actor. Hulce's performance as Wolfgang Mozart was as good - even better than was Abraham's role. This was not the first time that two leading players in the same film have been nominated for the same award. It is a rare occasion, and even a much rarer one when both of the leads give outstanding performances. It's too bad that the Motion Picture Academy couldn't make a double award in such cases.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is a delight for many reasons. The best, of course, is the music. Parts of many great Mozart works are played throughout the film. That makes this great film as much an enjoyable listening experience as it is a wonderful story to watch. All aspects of the movie excel - from the detail in the cultural settings and costumes, to the camera and film production.<br/><br/>Any such biopic will naturally be fictitious, especially with the many incidental details in a subject's life. Perhaps the biggest aspect of fiction in this film, though, has to do with Salieri. The film clearly shows him as a much less auspicious composer than Mozart. But Salieri had a major career and influence on opera of his day. He was a renowned and talented composer, conductor and teacher who wrote operas in three languages. He held a number of key music posts. Even though he stopped writing music by middle age, he had several famous pupils, including Beethoven, Schubert and Liszt.<br/><br/>Salieri's music did fade into oblivion within a few decades. And Mozart's continued to soar in performance and popularity. But with this film, Salieri's music enjoyed a revival in the classical world.<br/><br/>There may have been some rivalry felt by Salieri toward Mozart. And there likely was some envy over Mozart's talent. But there just as likely was a modicum of professional respect between the two men. Although few could match the musical genius of Mozart in creating masterful works in his time, many accomplished conductors and players performed his music. Salieri was among them.<br/><br/>This film is a delight. One can't help but wonder how much more great music the world might have had if Mozart had lived beyond his youthful age of 35. The movie is a must for any serious film library."

","Amadeus was neither the first nor the last great motion picture crafted by gifted director Milos Forman. Nine years earlier he made One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest. 12 years later, his The People vs. Larry Flynt became the darling of the critics. Yet, of all the projects Forman has been involved with, none has striven for and achieved as much as Amadeus. No matter how many additional great movies he makes, he is unlikely to surpass this one. Whether you choose the original 1984 theatrical version or the extended Director's Cut, you won't find a better motion picture depiction of genius, art, and the artist. Not only is Amadeus a fascinating character study, but it also features a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions in the twisted triangle of Mozart, Salieri, and God. No movie before or since has so effectively woven music into the tapestry of the motion picture."

 I very much enjoyed it. The acting was entertaining I love the ridiculous attitude of Mozart and how to everybody around him seem he's crazy/odd. Such example would be his laugh it's very awkward and uncomfortable, no one says anything though because there is no doubt to them he is an artist and they have to respect for that. This all comes off as appealing to the story. Very fitting for the story of Mozart.

"Hawkensian","8","0","0","23 December 2017"," Amadeus is an entertaining if factually dubious biopic
","At the heart of Amadeus's narrative is Antonio Salieri's jealous admiration for Mozart's prodigious talent, with the wider meaning being about unearned privilege and power attempting to control and hinder creative genius. The most odious example of this is Count Orsini-Rosenberg (Charles Kay), the Emperor's most pompous little minion.<br/><br/>It's also a film about the selfishness and immorality of faith, as shown in Salieri's obsessive behaviour and the faith he uses to explain it. Salieri, who jokes that he is the 'patron saint of mediocrity', believes that God gave musical genius to a crude, immature young man like Mozart just to spite him. Blinded by his self-absorption, it doesn't occur to Salieri that his anxieties are trivial and insignificant because he believes God is omnipotent - 'He' can listen to everyone's concerns no matter how trivial they are. So on the delusion continues...<br/><br/>The film's main strengths are the leading performances from Abraham and Hulce, the opulent design work and the flashback narrative construction. This combination makes for a very absorbing film for the first 120 minutes or so, but Mozart's quite sudden decline did lose me somewhat. Could bereavement and a challenging project really cause such a spirited young man such damage? Well, it's little surprise that his decline would seem dubious because Mozart's mysterious death remains the subject of heated debate.<br/><br/>Criticisms are few and minor. Some of the language is rather inappropriate for a film set in the high-society of 18th century Vienna -would Mozart really have said ""kiss my ass""? Also, the film's authenticity was wounded by the American accent of Tom Hulce, who otherwise does a great job."

","Amadeus is a brilliant film. From beginning till end, it seizes your attention and holds it, refusing to let go until the final moments. Milos Forman has achieved something superb here.<br/><br/>To begin, F. Murray Abraham was fantastic, easily deserving of his Oscar win for Salieri. Tom Hulce gave a vibrant Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, full of life and was equally deserving of his Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast were also great, delivering their lines believably and passionately.<br/><br/>The film looks gorgeous, the set design epic and grand, the costumes lavish and complex. It's wonderful to look at, with each frame easily able to be a painting, full of detail. The cinematography is great and fully captures and realizes the world of Mozart and Salieri.<br/><br/>The editing is excellent, the pace constant and never felt like it was dragging.<br/><br/>The sound design and effects were great, bringing the world to life through audio. The soundtrack was superb, full of grand operas - a soundtrack performed by Mozart and Salieri.<br/><br/>The film traverses the world of an art, what artists do and are willing to do to realize their dreams and visions, and what they're willing to do when things do not go their way. It's passionate and bold, and is quite timeless, not feeling like a film from the 80s.<br/><br/>This film has a brilliant scene where two men write a piece of music together, bond through it and become one. It's a brilliant moment in the film and a brilliant moment in film in general.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film. It's entertaining, dramatic, stunning, and it sounds great.

"kenjha","7","3","8","7 January 2010"," Too Many Scenes
","This mostly fictional account of the relationship between Mozart and Salieri, a journeyman contemporary composer, is well filmed but has ""too many scenes,"" to paraphrase Emperor Joseph. At three hours, it overstays its welcome with repetitive scenes. Was it necessary to spend 20 minutes on ""Don Giovanni""? The film's portrayal of Mozart as a vulgar buffoon is hard to reconcile with his genius for creating sublime music. Also, it gives the impression that Mozart only composed operas whereas the vast majority of his output is non-operatic. While Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, Hulce's idiot act becomes tiresome, and Berridge is badly miscast as Constanze. Jones is amusing."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","3","8","6 September 2008"," Solid
","I found that the film was not at all as I expected- a staid Merchant-Ivory type production mixed with a hint of Masterpiece Theater. This was both good and bad. On the positive side is the very dramatic structure of the film, being told from Mozart's inferior rival's, Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), point of view. On the down side is the over the top performance by Tom Hulce, as Mozart, especially with that pointlessly distracting guffaw. Also, as the DVD delineates which scenes were altered, extended, or added in toto, it becomes obvious that director Milos Forman's original cut was the superior, as none of the added scenes adds palpably to the thrust of the film. Yes, I liked the added scene of Mozart's wife, Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), getting naked to try to sexually please Salieri, to advance her husband's career, for Berridge was certainly a major hotty with the body back then, but, despite my prurient interest, the scene is pointless. Unfortunately, in either version, this is nowhere near a great film. It's a fun, solid romp, but the American accents and slang that infiltrate Eighteenth Century Viennese society are just too much, as is Hulce as Mozart. No, a staid portrayal of the man would have been dull, but a genius as idiot savant, or a step above, is not worthy of this dramatic treatment, either. That it only heightens Salieri's frustration is dramatically defensible, but since the whole notion of Salieri's envy and hatred of Mozart is a historical fiction, there really was no reason to go so over the top in the first place.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does fairly well. Berridge as the clueless wife, Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph, is a dolt with a heart, who doesn't understand how to run his own life, much less a nation.All in all, I would recommend the film, but as a light diversion, not a serious inquiry in to art nor the artistic mindset. That film has yet to be made."

Mozart (Amadeus) was one of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Yet he was murdered through the use of psychology by a crafty satanic jealous Catholic priest-Salieri. He could not see how God could give such a great musical gift to a man who he perceived as being toally immoral! Salieri denied the Christina faith and sold his soul to Satan like Dracula in the movie BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Some of the world's most evil people are connected to the church! As witness to what manipuLators clergy are and were, the chess opening, The Ruy Lopez, was invented by a Spanish Bishop of the same name!So, I really think I benefit from not being accepted in church. And I think I have some evil Salieri in my own life, some smug self-righteous religious jerk who tries to destroy my life as well. And as the movie ends, the point I also see is that at the end of even a great historical life, the Grim Reaper comes for you and they wrap your body in a shroud, throw you in a hole and cover you up with dirt!

I had watched it when I was about 10 years old and at that time it made absolutely no sense at all much as the Godfather was incomprehensible to me. Having watched it again the pieces fall right into place. F. Murray Abrahams is dynamite and just blows you out of the water with his performance and he's not the only one. Tom Hulce is the gasoline that gets the blaze going. The two of them are bigger than the Fourth of July. Before I watched this I knew that Mozart was a genius of music. I didn't realize that he was THE genius of music. There has never been anything like him before or since. He did for music what electricity did for light bulbs. Here are two men that are rivals. Bitter rivals. It is impressed upon you in every scene. Salieri is great, a true living legend. And he hates Mozart, not because he is better than him but because he is a unsophisticated, uncultured, impish childlike boob. He wants him dead. Does everything he can to utterly ruin him and make him fail. But he loves his music and operas completely, unabashedly and without limits. Covets and appreciates his talent like no one ever could and knows without doubt Mozart is the best composer in the world. But he won't let Amadeus succeed. As a result, Mozart sinks deeper and deeper into a pit of alcoholism, sickness and depression. Wife leaves him and he's flat broke. His father's death haunts him like a demon released from purgatory. Salieri hastens if not actually perpetuates his death and what does Mozart tell him on his deathbed? That he thought Salieri didn't like his music and that he respected Salieri more than anyone and begs his forgiveness for being so wrong! That is a biggest slap in the face I've ever seen delivered on screen. It takes the cake for pure cinematic irony. Mozart, in all probability would have died regardless of what happened but Salieri cannot and will not forgive himself for what he has so underhandedly done to Mozart and even more importantly to the world of music. The way this film is told is brilliant and I'm not surprised it won the many coveted awards it did as it certainly deserved them. Best film of 1984."

"soumik-datta","7","2","5","30 March 2005"," a better film on Mozart would be hard to make
","Forman, though he worked in Hollywood,was Polish; and his films often contain traces of the more subtle European art-house sensitivity. The most sensitive of these decisions in case of Amdeus was to invite the Academy of St. Martin's in the Fields to play the music in this film. Under the conduction of Sir Neville Mariner, St. Martin's had been definitely the best interpreter of Mozart's music in the 20th c. and their playing just lifts the film to another level.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film is also visually stunning, though it relies heavily on the acting of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as MOzart to carry it through. And they do carry it through with real aplomb. Especially Salieri comes across as an unforgettable character, though probably because his part is so amazingly well-written, from the brilliant description of the 'Gran Partita' in the beginning to the unbelievable death-bed sequence of Mozart where Salieri takes down whatever Mozart dictates, and what he dictates impromptu is the unfinished Requiem. Again a brilliant thing about this was how Shaffer and Forman constructs this sequence, breaking down the Requiem into its individual parts and lets the music just build up and carry us away. Working with a background score consisting of the best pieces of Mozart has its advantages, and Forman is so very much aware of that, that he consistently uses the music to overwhelm us."

Jeffrey Jones was actually good as the emperor, but the rest of the virtually unknown cast didn't leave much of an impression. The attempt at recreating post Baroque Vienna was admirable, but the grossly rewritten history was insulting and blasphemous. Who would believe that Mozart spent his last hours writing music with his good buddy Salieri? The scene in Heat where Pacino and DeNiro have coffee together was more realistic!

","You do not have to be a lover of Mozart's music to enjoy this film. The circumstances surrounding the composer's death remain a mystery, and it would be a mistake to see the film as a historical account. The achievement of the film lies in the extent to which it enables us to share in the joyful and almost boyish enthusiasm with which Mozart (Tom Hulce) expresses himself through his music, and to marvel at his eternal optimism in the face of constant adversity, much of it caused by his jealous rival Salieri (Murray Abraham). Hulce's performance is wonderfully spontaneous and energetic, with Abraham's appropriately menacing. Not a great film perhaps, but an enormously entertaining one nonetheless."
"pjstudent","10","2","5","1 May 2002"," A great mass of death
","Has there ever been a greater facial expression than the one worn by Salieri (Abraham) when he utters those lines?  Maybe, but probably not.  That's one reason why Abraham deserved to win the Oscar for his role, but not the only reason why this is an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Amadeus is more than a movie about a petty jealousy.  This film would rather tell the story of how a pious man turned his mediocrity against the God who had implanted the passion of music in him and denied him the talent to create it.  Unfortunately for him, and for Mozart, his talent had to be measured by that of Mozart's, an unfair comparison for almost any composer. <br/><br/>
What he sees is a licentious young man undeserving of his talent, the talent Salieri feels he should have had.  But while it may seem as if he devises a way to claim ownership of the Requiem, he is rather using what he considers to be God's voice (Mozart) against God himself; why else would he have stayed to work with Mozart at his deathbed, instead of simply killing him and taking the unfinished Requiem.  No, he wants God to write the music to His own funeral because he has lost his faith, perhaps why he laughs at the priest at the end of the film.<br/><br/>And what does God do instead.  He kills Mozart before it can be finished, and He keeps Salieri alive as an added punishment to hear his music fade into nothing, while His music is resurrected, so to speak.<br/><br/>That is a great story by any stretch of the imagination, and the film does everything to make it a reality.  Nothing in the 1984 version is out of place.  However, on the new director's cut there is a seen in which Constanze has to bare her breasts for Salieri in return for his recommendation.  While this seen may be prized by the superficial male, it seems unnecessary, as Salieri is not interested in sex or in defiling Mozart's marriage.  He only cares about getting back at God, but how can anyone do that?"

","The directors cut of Amadeus is far better than I initially anticipated.  I knew I would find it satisfying since it's one of my top 20 films of all time, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was significantly better.  Much like the directors cuts of The Abyss, or more appropriately, Touch of Evil's ""restored"" edition the film has a clearer story and smoother pace with a tighter climax.  It is too bad that many studios and/or producers feel the need to shorten films for fear of the audience being lost and/or bored.  One would think that with the success of so many ""long"" films even since the early days of the medium the industry would have learned that folks do not mind a well done story even if it is long no matter the medium. 	Anyway, I had not seen this film on the Big Screen since its initial release and not on video for  many years so it was wonderful to see it as it was meant to be viewed.  The print was of above average quality for one that had made the rounds for sometime which was also wonderful since it let the fabulous sound resound and stir the passions of  the film as it was designed.  The power of the music and the imagery was nearly breathtaking (it was a small screen with a slightly aging sound system where I watched it) and more powerful than I remember as a senior in high school. 	My favorite aspects of the film however are still a toss up between the score and the performances of Abrahms and Hulce, exquisite it the only word that comes close.  The costumes and set where of course first rate and helped create the mood without over powering it and I found that the cinematography was more interesting and subtle than I remember.  The script was witty with just a few dashes of charm which accentuated the horror and sadness wonderfully, like your favorite meal, or piece of music!  It is still wonderful to delve into the depths of tormented soul as this film does so perfectly. 	See this film again, especially if you have yet to see this cut!"

Murray Abraham, who manages to convey a way of understanding the world that has lost currency today, namely the belief that God controls every little event. This man of great faith, Salieri, looses his faith because he cannot understand the fundamental unfairness of life and, thereby, of God.  I will stop here but I will add that the readers should watch it with new eyes.<br/><br/>This is the greatest film of the last half of the 20th century."
"vonbeaver","10","2","5","8 April 2002"," One to return to, again and again...
","I think back to perhaps the first time I saw this movie.  I believe, as a part of the joy that is public school music education, our disillusioned teacher popped in a video, and showed us all Milos Foreman's AMADEUS.  At first glance, the dialogue is witty and involving, the sets and costumes glorious, and the acting superb.  Even in my youth I could recognize the greatness of this film.  With Peter Shaffer's game of ""What if...?"" that comprises much of the film (i.e. what if Salieri recognized his own shortcomings in sight of Mozart's genius, and then...), the stage is set for true drama.  There is conflict galore in this multi-layered film, and it brings the heart of the humanities close to us.  Why do we love music and what makes it great?  Can a less-than-perfect person create perfect art? The list goes on...<br/><br/>My point being that this movie is perhaps my all-time favorite film, and one that I watch at least once a year.  Revelations abound with each repeated viewing, whether it be a nuance in a performance, a detail in the set, or a new insight into the interplay of music and image.  If (for some incredible reason) you haven't seen this glorious film, DO IT NOW!!"
"hila4","10","2","5","26 March 2002"," I never knew such movies were possible
","Amadeus is a fantastic movie! It's clever, witty, harrowing, and chilling, mastering both the darkest drama and the lightest, most playful comedy.  The acting is superb.  F Murray Abraham, as the bitter and tormented Salieri, gives us one of the most powerful and memorable performances in cinematic history.  As the bawdy genius Mozart, Tom Hulce is wickedly funny.  The score is lush and will appeal to classical music lovers like myself; the production is lavish and the details exquisite.  This is no mere period drama; Amadeus transcends its genre and can be appealing to a wide variety of tastes."
"coverme6","Null","2","5","18 March 2002"," An intelligent biopic drama
","F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce lead a great cast in this biographical drama about the life and high times of Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Abraham takes an excellent turn as Salieri, the Italian composer who believes strongly this his own great talent was given to him by God, until he met the cackling, womanizing Mozart. How, how can that little rascal be so gifted, yet not take this gift to a serious level? That's the conflict of interest Salieri had been lingering over. Filled with lavish set designs depicting 1600 Austria, even more lavish costumes of that same area, AMADEUS certainly gives owes itself a great deal of credit to its two leads."
"adamcritchlow","Null","2","5","24 February 2002"," The eternal struggle of reason vs. lust, one of Shaffer's greatest works.
","Amadeus is one of the more interesting and smart movies I've seen. Shaffer has the ability to communicate on multiple levels from the banal to the philosophically urgent with style and an ability that film writers today have yet to achieve. One thing that I think most viewers dont understand fully about this movie is that its dealing with more than the fall of a great composer, one who is truly gifted by God. This film is about the contrast of the Dionysian and the Appollonian.  Apollo the God of the moon, and of peace and knowledge versus Dionysus the God of parties, wine and those eternal desires not tamed by evolution that every person posses. Mozart is our representative of the Dionysian, living to fulfill his desires, yet incredibly gifted and blessed by God.  This is important to understand in a culture that sees giftedness and talent as a reward for good living, just like illness was seen as a punishment for sin.  The question this film poses is how to balance the earthly desires and the use of reason and learning."
"yucel81x","10","2","5","23 February 2002"," One of the best movies of all time...
","First off, I must make note of a few things.<br/><br/>First, to those of you who criticize the film for being historically inaccurate, or who think the script is incoherent, or who think it's too long and boring, or who think the ending was disappointing, or all of the above...you are all IDIOTS!!! It's quite clear you are the type of person who would not go to a performance of Shakespeare, or who think that ""Armageddon"" was the pinnacle of filmmaking. Uncultured, uneducated morons...that's all you are! Second, I first saw this film when I was four years old. Now, I'm not as big into classical music as my parents are, but I do listen to the occasional symphony, sonata, and even some opera. But from the beginning, even at my young age, I knew this was one of the most extraordinary films I'd ever see. And to this day, I've been right. I've yet to see a film that captures my heart the way ""Amadeus"" does.<br/><br/>Right from the start, this film is NOT a historical account on the life of Mozart. Of course it's inaccurate because Peter Shaffer wrote the original play of ""Amadeus"" not as a biography, but as a drama based on events in the life of Mozart. So the question as to whether or not Salieri really hated Mozart, whether or not he really killed him, is totally pointless. The point of this film was to tell a dramatic story, based on two figures in history. And those two figures are portrayed masterfully by F. Murray Abraham (who totally deserved the Oscar he received) and Tom Hulce (it's a shame he didn't get an Oscar as well). And while every actor played their roles wonderfully, Abraham and Hulce are truly the stars, not just because they got top billing or because they are the main characters. Both play their roles with great passion, humor, and empathy. Both are able to represent their characters with great humor, while simultaneously demanding the attention and sympathy of the audience. Salieri comes across both as a man worthy of our respect and our sympathy, while at the same time never sacrificing the image that he is a deranged man who was hell bent on ending Mozart's life. The same can be said of Mozart, who we see to be the vulgar clown he was, whose exploits were matched only by his passion for his music.<br/><br/>Peter Shaffer's script is brilliant, full of subtle humor and wonderful dialogue. If you disagree, then I suggest you read a few more books before you can get to the level of sophistication required to appreciate it. Milos Forman's direction is also brilliant. The use of natural light to capture the atmosphere of the time period was a clever touch that created a marvelous effect on the visual tone of the movie, matched only by the great stage direction, costumes, and the music.<br/><br/>Ah, the music...Neville Marriner conducting Mozart's music is a wonderful compliment to the action in the film (or rather...the other way around, the film compliments the music). My favorite scenes are those of Mozart or Salieri in the conductor's seat, directing their music on stage, especially the Commendatore scene of ""Don Giovanni."" My other favorite scene is when Mozart is dictating ""Confutatis"" to Salieri. Both scenes just as Salieri described ""Don Giovanni,""...""It was terrifying and wonderful to watch.""<br/><br/>This is truly one of the greatest films of all time, and to this day I still make it a point to watch it at least once a month. Each time, I find something new about it...and if I don't, then it doesn't matter...it's still a joy to watch. Not many films have stayed with me since my childhood, but this one I will watch until the day I die. Those who can not appreciate it...go back to watching ""American Pie"" or whatever brainless teenage movie they're coming out with now. Jason Biggs or Seann William Scott could NEVER reach the level of acting potential shown by this movie. Nothing Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer can make will reach the level of cinematic perfection presented by this film. ""Amadeus"" truly is ""Beloved by God."""
"paddyryan","10","2","5","15 February 2002"," I just saw the Director's Cut of the movie. Wow, this version just enhanced a movie that was already awesome, and the added footage fits in perfectly. I highly recommend seeing this version if ever available
","The Director's Cut shows Mozart actually struggling to get pupils, and Salieri taken direct action and spreading rumours to keep Amadeus down, and we see why Mrs. Mozart hates Salieri so much at the end. There's also more footage of the operas. The extra footage also fits in perfectly, and is not out of place at all, actually adding better understanding to certain scenes. The acting is just incredible in this movie, and it's almost a shame that Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham couldn't have have both received Oscars. This new version comes in at just over 3 hours, and is just great."
"cschenk-1","10","2","5","14 February 2002"," Absolutely Fantastic
","So much has already been said about this film.  Largely ignored, however, is the absolutely FANTASTIC incorportaion of Mozart's music into the film. Granted, it is not a completely faithful biography, but how appropriate to use his music as the sountrack to his life. All I have to say is that the musical direction of this film is some of the best I have ever heard."
"andrew7","9","2","5","31 January 2002"," Complex, powerful
","The central premise of this film is remarkable in that, for its complexity, it remains remarkably powerful.  In film, as in music, as in almost every realm of human experience, complexity and power are natural enemies. Complexity dilutes power.<br/><br/>The central premise of ""Amadeus"" concerns Salieri's motives for killing Mozart.  [As an aside, whether or not Salieri killed Mozart in this film is utterly irrelevant... what's important is that Salieri wanted to kill him, hatched a plan, put the plan in motion, and Mozart died.  Whether or not there is a causal link is entirely beside the point.  Of course, whether or not Salieri killed Mozart in reality is even less relevant.]  Of course, Salieri was jealous of Mozart's talent, but if that were all there was, it would be a poor film indeed.  Salieri didn't want to attack Mozart (not directly, though certainly, this was involved).  Salieri wanted to attack God.  God, who had given Salieri an inexpressible longing to music, but had not given him the talent to pull it off.  If one accepts this premise, it is very easy to accept Salieri's conclusion, that God is cruel, because to give a man an all-pervading desire and deny him the ability to achieve it is a great cruelty.  Greater still to force him to watch it achieved by such a vulgar man as Mozart.  <br/><br/>So, in this contest, the players are Salieri and God, and Mozart is just the battlefield.  This is complex, and it is powerful.  It is also, by virtue of its complexity, interesting.  Fascinating.  Compelling.  More than justifying the running time of this magnificent film. <br/><br/>
The performances are a bit uneven, though.  F. Murray Abraham is superb as Antonio Salieri.  His voice, his face, his posture, manner, all perfect. <br/><br/>
The script is great.  I've talked about the story, but the script also is masterful.  <br/><br/>And the music.  It's easy to talk about how great the music is, but be sure to notice, beyond that, how well the music is used.  Any film can have great music... there's loads of it around, just find some and throw it in the film.  But to use music to its fullest and best extent is something else. This film nails it.  I'll never forget the bedroom transcription scene, when Salieri is helping Mozart with his Requiem.  Brilliant.  We hear each part, one at a time, and think ""Oh, yes, that's quite good.""  But then, hearing it all together, it's a shock... a visceral, stomach clenching shock.  And while hearing this incredibly powerful, yet complex (hmmm) music finally coming together, we see Frau Mozart's carriage returning her to Vienna.  We have no specific reason to dread her return, but the music, so full of dread, prepares us masterfully for the final confrontation. <br/><br/>
Ahh, a spectacular film which rewards every viewing.  One for the ages.  So few movies of true and lasting quality emerged from the culturally bankrupt 1980s.  This is one to cherish for all time."

This movie is a bad movie because of the music, which gets on my nerves.  The directing isn't great and the storyline is boring.

","I was so appalled by the enormous amount of praise that this movie has recieved on IMDB, that I was forced to register so I could voice my complete and utter dissaproval. ""The directing is virtuous!"" -- but the director's primary source of characterization is the applause of an audience for an icon whose actions are never seen first-hand. not persuasive. ""The acting is marvelous, especially that Abraham fellow"" -- i have seen acting this presentational since 'Debbie Does Dallas.' Abraham and Fulce have had no other features in the film industry because their work in Amadeus was the most unnatural, hackneyed, inauthentic, and 2 dimensional pair of performances I have ever seen in my life. not to mention the supporting cast. Sheez, the emperor is played by ferris bueler's principal? Mozart's wife has a texan accident(momentarily)? There are three 2D characters in the king's court designed to highlight the true-to-period aspect of this film: the uptight german, the squeamish brit, and the stoic scholar (region undetermined, but they're all really from america, anyway). It was the acting that angered me the most. But the script was equally pathetic. Oh, so, it was based on a play? Did they use the same cast from one of the vaudeville shows? Maybe that's why they made facial expressions that could be read from 500 feet away. Film acting is different; don't annoy me. Stop laughing like that, Mozart, stop laughing like that; I hate you, Mozart; you were supposed to stand for the immortal goodness in art that always stands the test of time, Mozart, will you please stop laughing like that? I hate you now, Mozart, I hate you.<br/><br/>It's gonna take me a while to undo the trauma this movie has placed on my ability to appreciate Mozart, but I'll get on through. Maybe one day we'll rip this pathetic excuse for a movie off the top 100 (oscar nominations? this makes me so sad....) and... well... be better people."

","Amadeus: 7 out of 10: Brilliantly filmed fictional account of the rivalry between Antonio Salieri (Well deserved Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance). <br/><br/>The costumes and settings are spot on as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. (This is one place independent film doesn't hold a candle to Hollywood). With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife the supporting cast is excellent (especially Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the 2nd like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.) <br/><br/>The plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart not himself this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered. <br/><br/>Besides Berridge's performance there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of either Mozart's work or some of the pieces that invariably made him immortal (It's a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his 5th and 9th symphonies.) <br/><br/>The movie is also bit long and drags some in the middle. In one scene during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. At 2 hours 40 minutes it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from myself."

It amazes me that people get hung up about black actors playing previously white parts (example: Denzel Washington in The Manchurian Candidate) but don't realize that someone can just be too American to play a European or other racial groups. Did you believe Jeff Chandler as Cochise? How about John Wayne as Genghis Khan? Also, from what I've seen the depiction of Mozart as a boor is not historically accurate. Too bad because the theme of Salieri's jealousy is well handled."

The 'paupers' grave was BS. It was common during that time for non-aristocrats to be buried in 'common graves' that were re-used 10 years later. 
The bitter rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, the basis of the movie & that Salieri killed Mozart are BS & most likely come from a Pushkin short story. The movie totally ignores that Mozart became a Freemason 7 years before death & the importance it had it his life."

","I decided to watch Amadeus because I thought it was a comedy of some sort and I just wanted to watch something to have a good time. I really was not expecting the masterpiece that I was about to watch.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a wonderful film that portrays the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It portrays it in such a way that you are always paying attention and it never gets boring.<br/><br/>The film is told through the eyes of Salieri. Another musician who was jealous of Mozart. I thought this point of view was absolutely astounding. Because although I loved the character of Mozart, I loved even more the character of Salieri.<br/><br/>He is a man obsessed with being the best at music and he has offered God a lot of things in exchange for that. Actually, I really enjoyed his relationship with God. How he thought God communicated with him and sent him messages through other people.<br/><br/>Many people don't like the film because of some historical inaccuracies, but you have to take into account that the character is told through the perspective of someone in a mental hospital. It is told through the point of view of a madman.<br/><br/>I really loved how the film progresses. Every characters begins high up and starts its decent. For Salieri it is his madness. For Mozart, it is his alcoholism. And Mozart's family starts having money problems.<br/><br/>They portray Mozart in such a different way. This movie shows how he is a genius, but he is no gentlemen.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked is how Mozart thought of music. He heard the music in his head when he was writing it. I thought that was a really nice touch. Specially in a scene in which he starts hearing music when he is talking to his mother in law.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint it would be that it is too long. Im pretty sure that some things could be cut out. The problem is that I don't know what. Everything is amazing.<br/><br/>If you love a good film, you should definitely watch this one."
"sia-28148","9","1","2","18 April 2017"," A Beautiful Tale About Mediocrity Meeting Genius
","Amadeus, despite its title, is really not about Mozart. It is about Salieri, who is the court composer for the Austrian emperor and witnesses Mozart's rise from child prodigy to child-like adult. Salieri wants nothing more than to compose beautiful music, but instead his own mediocrity is made all the more apparent when contrasted to the seemingly divine talent of the impish Wolfgang, which irritates him to no end. Salieri's feelings of inadequacy resonate with anyone who has badly wanted a talent for themselves only to see it ""wasted"" on someone else who didn't appreciate it.<br/><br/>The movie itself is beautiful in every degree- costumes, set, direction, and especially orchestration. With a soundtrack that is almost completely written by Mozart himself and which helps to guide the film, no other score can come close and the entire spectacle is a treat from start to finish. Though some complain about the lack of realism and introduction of fantasy into the events surrounding Mozart and Salieri, that should not be a deterrent. If you want strict accuracy then watch a documentary or read a book. This movie is meant to entertain, and entertain it does. This is a must see for any film buff, lover of classical music, or for anyone who has ever labored in the shadow of true genius."
"snorlax3111984","10","1","2","14 April 2017"," Pros And Cons of Amadeus
","Pros 1. F. Murray Abraham more than deserved his Best Actor Oscar for his unforgettable performance as Salieri. He makes Salieri's frustrations and jealousy completely believable and relatable even for people like me who have never been interested in becoming a professional musician. Tom Hulce, in my opinion, would certainly have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar if he hadn't unwisely been submitted in the Best Actor category. The decision to make Mozart silly and fancy-free was controversial but makes him more relatable and understandable.<br/><br/>2. The entire supporting cast is great. Even Elizabeth Berridge, who is usually the Amadeus cast member who gets the most flack, does a great job as Stanzi. She shows Stanzi as a woman who gives Mozart when he needs, whether he needs a friend or a kick in the rear. I especially liked all the court members like the Emperor, Chamberlain Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Kappelmeister Bonno as they struggle with Mozart, a music force clearly after their time. Also worth noting is Karl-Heinz Teuber's hilarious appearance as the wig salesman.<br/><br/>3. It's no wonder this film won Art Direction & Costume Design Oscars. The set design and outfits never fail to impress. This was the first big Oscar hit to win for Best Makeup and with the gorgeous old Salieri makeup, it's not hard to see why. The makeup doesn't look fake at all.<br/><br/>4. It goes without saying that a movie about Mozart has awesome music. It's not hard to understand why Salieri thinks Mozart has divine music talents.<br/><br/>5. This movie has no shortage of funny parts: Salieri falling out of a kid's bed, Mozart giggling sheepishly to Katerina Cavaleri when it's revealed he's engaged, the Emperor mocking Mozart's fixation on love, etc.<br/><br/>6. The movie does have a happy ending: Mozart dies tragically young but will live forever in his music and as for Salieri: he fought the God and the God won.<br/><br/>7. Best Line Salieri: (referring to Mozart's Serenade For Winds) On the page it looked nothing. The beginning simple, almost comic. Just a pulse: bassoons, trumpets. Like a rusty squeezebox. Then: high above it: an oboe. A single note standing there unwavering... until a clarinet took it over and sweetened it to a phrase of such delight. This was no composition by a performing monkey. This was a piece i'd never heard. Such longing, such unfulfillable longing.<br/><br/>What's wrong with Amadeus? Not a dang thing!"

","Amadeus opens with the suicide attempt of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) leading to a confession that has been weighing on his heart for years. Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man. <br/><br/>Salieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway) <br/><br/>Amadeus has a myriad of factors that could work against it. The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them. Amadeus is excellently paced, brilliantly illustrated through narrated flashbacks providing an in-depth look at the people involved in the story, and are wonderfully brought to life by seeing the pieces the composers worked so tirelessly on. <br/><br/>Salieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen."

Absolutely everything is beautiful and well done, the production, the performances, the direction, the costume design, the make-up, obviously the music, the cinematography, and the film editing."

"KineticSeoul","9","1","2","19 July 2016"," It kept hitting the right key notes
","This movie is one heck of a experience that really knows how to hit the key notes. Sure, it has a simple narrative that is easy to follow but it's more driven by the vision and the experience for the audiences over the narrative. Now this movie has gotten some backlash, mainly because of it's depiction of the historical figures. So yeah, although the story might not entirely be focused on telling the exact truth, it does a fine job of blending fiction with reality. Because it does have important scenes that are deemed to be historically accurate or assumed to be. Never the less, the main focal point of this movie isn't to tell the step by step of Mozart's life. But to make it a experience that would draw the audiences in with it's depth and soul. Even the directing style comes of slightly strange when it comes down to it. So the story is told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri who was one of the well known composer during his prime as a composer. But in this film he is depicted as a mediocre composer trying to be more than what he is. Salieri in this comes across as a overly self-righteous, pompous jerk that has a huge jealousy towards the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since Mozart in this film is portrayed as a party guy that loves the ladies and just like enjoying the moment with his lavish spendings. Which kind of makes him a rock star during his time period. And since the demeanor of Antonio Salieri is vastly different from Mozart, Salieri not only makes Mozart his rival but his sworn enemy. Sometimes people like to pick apart and only try to focus on the negative side of someone they are jealous towards and that really shows through Salieri in this. He is a character that will do whatever it takes to bring Mozart down by slowly diminishing Mozart's chances to show his musical talents to the world to see. In this, while Mozart is a musical prodigy Salieri is a mediocre composer that is gifted in scheming, manipulating and has a very cunning persona. It shows the colliding of personalities and the ill intentions of Salieri as he picks apart Mozart. I also found Mozart's focus when it comes to his music and how he enjoyed life and his family to be touching and yet interesting. May it be entirely true or not, the man was a musical genius and his music will continue to carry on for generations. Overall though, this is a intriguing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed despite it being 3 hours. It's quite a depressing film though, so I probably wouldn't pick it up immediately to watch it again. But I will say, it is a splendid film and a experience.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mestophilious","10","1","2","17 July 2016"," A film of rare feeling and magic
","Very rarely does a film come along like this one. I remember seeing it on the BBC. As a young boy, at the time I liked Stallone and Arnie action stuff.. This was so far away from my ""zone"" that it was ridiculous. I happened to catch it right at the start and just sat down to watch.<br/><br/>The voice of Salieri immediately spoke to me. This film in a way, is about the gradation of talent; one man who is gifted above all others ( or so he thinks) and is humble and grateful to god for his gifts, is suddenly brought to the realization that there are a few people, so far above him in talent, that he cannot even understand their method or genius. With humility he thinks ""this genius Mozart must too, be a humble, hard working man who has striven greatly for this level of talent to manifest. Of course Salieri is soon disabused of this fact. Mozart like most true geniuses creates so easily and naturally that he in a way is almost contemptuous of the toil which others must endure, to produce works which pale in comparison with his least trifle.<br/><br/>The film is told in flashback by Salieri at the end of his life, confined in a madhouse, confiding to a young priest. He thinks that his actions lead Mozart to his death and is both proud and tormented by this. He is aware that Mozart is a ""true"" genius. Salieri has been flattered all his life with this word and he too, realizes that his great gift is the ability to discern the real thing when it is before him. He both loves and hates Mozart, as he both loves and hates himself , for being good but not great, but good enough to know good from great and being on the wrong side of the divide.<br/><br/>This film is filled by amazing actors and every small role is memorable and brings something to it. I don't wish to cheapen the film by giving a synopsis of the plot, but I will say this - you will rarely spend a more splendid, enlightening and fulfilling couple of hours. You will go away thinking about classical music and the idea of genius and envy and you will maybe even hum the strains of Don Giovanni.. who can say fairer than that?"
"gwarren16","10","1","2","26 June 2016"," A dazzling spectacle
","This fictionalised take on the life of one of the most talented composers of all time is what I would describe as a once in geneneration film. F.Murray Abraham portrays the religious and sceptical Italian composer Antonio Salieri , who does nothing to hide his jealousy for the former child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Salieri's bitterness towards Mozart yet his unwavering admiration for his talent cause Salieri to question his own faith, believing God to be mocking him for his own mediocrity. It's this developing rivalry that keeps viewers entertained throughout the film as Mozart grapples with alcoholism, his father's death, writing the Magic Flute and his crippling financial situation. We are constantly led to believe that it is Salieri who is such a negative influence on Mozart, eventually leading yo the composers unexplained death at the age of 35. He was writing the Requiem at the time of his death and it is shown that Salieri finishes it for him. The film then ends leaving us to ponder over whether it was Salieri who killed Mozart or if it was God who reclaimed his ""Beloved"", in reference to the Italian meaning of the film's title. This film is truly one of the great 20th Century dramas."
"grantss","10","1","2","11 June 2016"," Enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece
","It is the early 19th century. An old man is thrown into an insane asylum after trying to commit suicide. He is Antonio Salieri and in the asylum he is visited by a priest, to whom he confesses that he killed Mozart. He then recounts his time as court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Mozart appears at the court and is hired by the Emperor to produce an opera. His genius is quite evident. Salieri is a devout Christian man and believes all musical talent and inspiration is given by God. Mozart's personal life and extracurricular activities appall Salieri. He cannot reconcile Mozart's talent and his lifestyle and sets out to drive him from the court. Initially his aim is to undermine him but over time his intentions turn deadlier.<br/><br/>An enthralling, enchanting, edifying masterpiece. Directed by Milos Forman, who also gave us One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Ragtime and, later, Man On The Moon and The People vs Larry Flynt. Like in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, insanity is one of his themes, especially, here, the link between creative genius and insanity (this was also touched on in Man On The Moon). <br/><br/>With this in mind, there's a lightness to the movie which propels it along. The movie could easily have been a long, linear, paint-by- numbers account of Mozart's adult life, but Forman gives his characters heaps of depth, and, as mentioned, creates a vibrancy which is very engaging.<br/><br/>There is also plenty of darkness, and this plays off against the light on a few levels: insanity vs sanity, funny vs sombre moments, Salieri's faith vs the hedonism of Mozart (and Salieri's later doubts of his own faith). A wonderful combination of contrasts.<br/><br/>Most of all, this is an exploration of creative genius, the genius that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Forman, aided by Tom Hulce as Mozart, F Murray Abraham as Salieri and a wonderful orchestra and soundtrack, powerfully illustrates just how staggeringly talented Mozart was. For example, we have him writing down compositions without correction - he didn't need to play them, it was all in his head and perfectly formed. We also have Mozart dictating music he had just created in his head, showing his thought processes. His creative process is laid bare for all to see, and it is amazing.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the soundtrack is great. Background pieces are produced well and chosen well.<br/><br/>Both Tom Hulce and F Murray Abraham were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, and both deserved their nominations. F Murray Abraham's Salieri is a study in machinations and malevolence. Hulce is wonderfully over-the-top as the free-spirited genius Mozart. Abraham won the Oscar, but both are fantastic in their roles.<br/><br/>Supporting cast gives solid performances. Among the cast are Jeffrey Jones, as Emperor Joseph II, and Simon Callow plus Cynthia Nixon in an early-career minor role."
"lostncis","6","1","2","21 May 2016"," The movie of Salieri's life
","The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.<br/><br/>The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.<br/><br/>As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions."

","It's been years since I watched this movie and I forgot just how spectacular it is. There are few films that leave you pondering at the end, just taking in what you've seen after the credits roll.<br/><br/>The direction, the acting, the sets, costumes, all fabulous and larger than life. And of course, the music, oh the heavenly music! Utterly captivated throughout the entire film, watching F. Murray's Abraham's portrayal of Antonio Salieri was quite simply, beautiful as it was cruel. You felt his pain, his anguish, he despised and revered Mozart as he despised and revered God for his predicament. Watching Salieri battle his own personal demons, his sincere longing to be known as a great composer, his frustration at his mediocrity and honest recognition of it, yet whilst he loathed Mozart, he loved him, rather was in complete awe of him and was the only one who truly understood the sheer magnificence of his work. <br/><br/>The scene where he picks up Mozart's work, seeing the realization on his face as each time he delves deeper it becomes ever more apparent what a genius Mozart was, no corrections, no revisions, 'as if he had just written was what dictated.' The direction, hearing the music piece by piece as it is composed, I felt like Salieri, a mediocrity witnessing the sublime, heavenly talent of an evolving prodigy. <br/><br/>There are few films that leave such an impression on you, this movie was a journey, an education, I gained a new found appreciation for classical music that I never had before because I was too naive. <br/><br/>This masterpiece was breathtaking."

","His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. <br/><br/>So declared Antonio Salieri, ""Patron Saint of All Mediocrities,"" friend of Mozart and mutual enemy of God in the impassioned and penetrating Amadeus. Milos Forman's Amadeus film version of a Peter Shaffer play of the same name based on a novel take on a rumor originating from the life of Mozart shook the world and nabbed eight Oscars the following year, including Best Picture. After being reproduced in many forms, could it even portray Mozart as truthful and powerful as the man really was? Frankly, no. No retelling of this genius' life can ever surpass the depth and power of Mozart's original story and life, but Amadeus gets awfully close to it. After reading the stage play and the film's screenplay, I felt that this movie was simply the luckiest achievement in film ever. The music, one of the best aspects of Amadeus (supplied entirely from Mozart's own compositions and performed by the prolific St. Martin in the Fields with conductor Sir Neville Marriner), creates a perfect dramatic effect while sampling a conception of Mozart's genius. Now, after viewing Forman's film, I visualize Mozart's music – the drama, the context, and the inspiration behind the music. Listening to Mozart's music now, each note and phrase triggers a memory of certain shots and emotions from the amazing insight Forman and Shaffer gave in Amadeus. <br/><br/>Retelling his story to a priest, Salieri recounted his conceited boyish prayer with God: ""Lord, make me a great composer. Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen."" Years later, Salieri, now an Austrian court composer in the service of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), saw with sense of betrayal God's creation of Mozart. He knew Mozart's music was great, and his own was not. This fact alone did not worry him; it was the fact that Mozart was a coarse and vulgar boy. Often, he had talked and prayed to a cross hanging on his wall, but once his contempt overflowed, he gave it one last prayer and gazed at it once last time – ablaze in his fireplace: <br/><br/>Because You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation."" <br/><br/>Ironically, although Salieri named himself virtuous and worthy of being God's ""Incarnation,"" the vulgar Mozart held a closer relationship to God -- even having a certain fear and respect of Him, of which Salieri had none. But taking on the action he had sworn to do, he held Mozart in his deadly grasp, gradually sucking away his money, sanity, life, and finally, his music.<br/><br/>With a perfect balance of words, Shaffer crafted the infamous Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham played with intensity, and surprised us with his remarkable transition between a bitter, yet free, elderly Salieri and a quiet and calculating, thickly accented younger Salieri. No one -- not even I -- would have thought the two Salieris were played by the same actor. Abraham speaks Shaffer's words with such resonance and a sense of illustriousness that they stand out in our minds, seeming as though his words alone had an impact on history. <br/><br/>Never before or after Amadeus had a movie effectively portray an iconic classical music figure without ruining the drama and comedy. Most of us view Mozart as an indomitable demigod-like music figure -- even if we know as a fact that Mozart was crude, barmy and ill-mannered -- but we could never comprehend that Mozart was an actual living vulgarity. Indifferently, Forman and Shaffer tore to shreds the demi-god character of Mozart and gave room for him to shine his crudity. Many have complained about the historical inaccuracies of Amadeus, especially the ending scene where Salieri takes a dictation from Mozart for his Requiem. However, as Shaffer explained in the introduction of his stage play, he changed the ending for dramatic effects. Amadeus is not a biopic; it is a historical-fiction exploring the realms of humanity, hatred and God. <br/><br/>Forman and Shaffer left many varied and clear-cut messages in Amadeus. Some say Salieri's downfall was caused by either his jealousy or the haughty demand in his childhood prayer, explaining why God attempted to destroy Salieri – both great points and interpretations. But I believe that the explanation of God's wrath on Salieri is more objective. In his childhood prayer, he prayed for talent, and ""In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life"" But as none of those qualities were evident in the film, he earned that punishment. But wasn't Salieri's request for a righteous man to have the musical talent an honorable request? Perhaps. And perhaps God did fulfill that request, just through a different, yet pious and talented, Austrian: Franz Joseph Haydn."

","Peter Shaffer's masterpiece projected on film in the best way possible by the extremely talented director Milos Forman. I've never felt like this for any movie before. It's indescribable. F. Murray Abraham brings an astonishing performance, and so does Tom Hulce. The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas.

","This is one of the rare times when the Academy truly got it right because this film, unlike 'Gandhi' for instance, is truly deserving of every award it got and it is a biographical movie done right. The story is such a fascinating one and it was truly engaging and informative for me because I knew so little about the subject matter and the movie really made use of its themes and setting creating an enriching world and wonderful characters Due to incredible attention to detail, wonderful interior and costume design, fantastic and informative story, truly powerful finale and a remarkable performance from F. Murray Abraham, Amadeus is truly a special movie and although it has many drawn out sequences mainly with musical pieces and opera performances, it is otherwise a remarkable film that benefits from terrific character development and a wonderful exploration of some truly amazing themes and relationships.

"lucasversantvoort","10","1","2","5 May 2015"," The best introduction to the world of classical music
","""It seemed to me that I was hearing the very voice of God."" —Antonio Salieri<br/><br/>Amadeus is an incredible film, both in terms of its place in film history and for me personally. I'll get to its place in history in a minute, but first I'll say that for me this film is kind of a big deal since it introduced me to the world of classical music, a world that's becoming increasingly hard to convey to today's youths. Anyway, this film was my entry point into classical music and I haven't looked back since.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Amadeus is about Mozart, more or less. It's about Mozart as seen through the eyes of another composer, Antonio Salieri. We see Salieri as an old man in an insane asylum when a priest comes to visit him. Salieri then recounts his life, how he met Mozart, etc. He tells the priest that, through a fortunate turn of events (including his father's death), he was able to travel to Vienna, 'city of musicians'. He was successful there, wanting to create music in service to God. All was well until he met Mozart. Salieri was confronted with a composer who far exceeded his abilities. Salieri believed God was talking through Mozart's music and Salieri realized his own music paled in comparison. This was a shock to Salieri which was only amplified by the fact that Mozart was a 'sensual' man, a lover of sex and wine, etc. Why, Salieri asked himself, had God made this 'monkey' his instrument instead of me? The rest of the film shows Salieri and Mozart conversing and trying to get through their careers and lives, with Salieri desperately trying to conceal not only his passion for Mozart's music, but also his hatred for the man.<br/><br/>I could spend several paragraphs swooning over the film's technical achievements (which are vast) and the quality of the acting (which is great), but I'd rather discuss something else, something I believe is the key to this film's success. What I find the most intriguing thing about Amadeus is the fact that it was still massively successful (winning 8 Oscars) despite not being historically accurate at all. Granted, not all historical films need to follow the history books to the letter to be successful, but the amount of changes that were made in Amadeus were pretty substantial. You can look up various articles detailing the differences. I'll name one: Mozart's laugh which, as you may recall, was kind of funnyor annoyingyour mileage may vary. As seen in the trivia section on IMDb, 'there are claims that the laugh was taken from ""references in letters written about him""'. A quote by Robert L. Marshall follows stating there is no historical evidence that Mozart had such a laugh. Its use in the film is purely dramatic, because Salieri sees it as the gods mocking him.<br/><br/>So yeah, the film deviates quite a lot from reality, but I think these deviations and the way Amadeus turned out are precisely the reason why the film was so impactful at the time, as it was for me when I saw it in my early teens. The reason it was so successful (and still is) despite all the historical errors is because in the end it isn't really a biographical film, but a film about the people behind the music. It doesn't merely throw classical music at you and telling you to like it, but it shows Salieri obsessed with the transcendent nature of music and his frustration when he realizes he doesn't have what Mozart has. The film conveys the notion of music being capable of expressing the inexpressible. This is why scenes like Salieri salivating over Mozart's 'originals' have endured the test of time, because it's not just about the music. It's about the people behind it. This is where I think a documentary would have failed. Sure, it would have painted a more historically accurate portrait of Salieri and Mozart, but film is more easily capable of delivering an emotional impact. Instead of merely showing the lives of Salieri and Mozart, the central focus is their (particularly Salier's) obsession with (Mozart's) music. By telling the story through Salieri, we see Mozart through his eyes and we too are baffled and amazed by Mozart's genius. This is what Amadeus does right more than anything: introduce audiences to classical music in a way that captures the imagination. That's what it did for me. Like I said, this was my entry to classical music. In a spur of the moment, I told my parents I was going to compose a requiem like Mozart did. Naturally, I never did. I know little music theory and never seriously composed anything. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the important thing was that Amadeus made me that excited about classical music. I too wanted to experience the level of excitement and transcendence that Salieri experienced through Mozart's music.<br/><br/>This all reminds me of Leonard Bernstein. He's of course considered to be one of the great conductors, but what I think proves that claim more than anything was his ability to convey his passion to the audience. Just watching him conduct is an experience in and of itself. Again it's not necessarily the music itself that excites, but the people who bring it to life and it's this major achievement of Amadeus that makes it a classic and a must-watch. Wellthere it is."

","this review may also contain spoiler for "" The Elephant Man "" so .........<br/><br/>I think i was lucky to watch these two movies respectively :"" The elephant man "" & "" Amadeus "" <br/><br/>First, "" The Elephant Man "" which seems to anyone who reads it that it's not such a pleasant nickname to have , unless you're a very big and strong fellow.But the elephant man wasn't even that strong to defend himself or even walk well. His only weapon was his ugliness. This also didn't stop all people from using him like a performing monkey. He was homeless and ugly, still satisfied with how he looked like and created excuses for his mother who left him as a baby monster. He was also proud that she was beautiful unlike him showing her picture to anyone he liked. He was poor and lived most of his life in the slums, also a man of fine taste and talent.<br/><br/>Then, there's "" Amadeus "" it's mozart's middle name and it means god's beloved and we can say it's a reason for salieri to envy mozart whenever he says his name. Where we can see salieri drowning in his own sea of envy and hatred wondering why god chose mozart to have this great gift and to be his instrument. Wondering if god denied him the talent why he gave him the longing. He justified that he just wanted to praise god with music of his own even if it was just one piece of true music. But what if god just don't want to be praised by you. If god denies you a talent, it's never a reason for you to envy and hate all the talented people. God gave him a lot. Why did he insist on this one thing? Look at what salieri had. He became the emperor's court composer. He had fine wealth and servants. He was loved by most people as he said until mozart came and took their love. <br/><br/>What i want to say is there are lots of people living among us are like the elephant man and salieri. We mustn't judge none of them by their looks. And of course the elephant man kind of people doesn't always has to mean only ugliness, there are more than ugliness that isolate them from the society. We all know these people whom we call freaks, nerds or schmucks. Well, most of them are freaks but sometimes if we knew them quite good, the truth would be a lot different. And for you, so you never can turn to be a salieri person, you must remind yourself every time you wake up in the morning with what gifts god gave you. Instead of forgetting all these gifts praying for one that will never come."

","it is my first time to watch a movie about music (not musical). this movie more likely a combination of drama-biography with music aroma. i didn't know too much about Mozart, all i know he was a rare-borned human whose can see the world as a ""tone language"". but i really enjoy this movie, and this movie was one kind of movie (ex: 2001:ASO) that i can re-watch it over and over without losing my interest even a small piece.<br/><br/>the first scene not attract me too much. it starts with a dark screenplay style, a confession of a man who killed Mozart, then he turns out crazy. i just said ""wow, not bad at all, this movie has a flow-back-and-forth plot, i some kind like that plot anyway"". then, in the prison (for mental-sickness) the story untold, and a long journey of our music-legend man has began !<br/><br/>the storyline really interesting, not losing it's grip until the end, it is light but entertaining also casual. these what make this movie great. this movie also enjoyable to any age-range and have a rich story. i personally tough this movie is the best in it's genre (biography) by far.<br/><br/>Mozart character played really good, i mean near the highest potential and of course im not saying the act was bad, but not the greatest. i even mesmerized by Mozart character. it is amaze me, it's like im get into the movie to witness it. i don't know if this really true from the historical aspect or not, but as far i can say, Mozart is a unique character and it's like i can also feel the envy that coming to the Salieri. this movie mesmerizing.<br/><br/>the set also beyond average. decoration is beautiful. it is old- kingdom and old-fashion set but interesting in the eye. the castle, Mozart's house, inside the kingdom, and the environment of Vienna. it show us Vienna in 19th century really convincing and i wanna sucked into the movie to witness and enjoy it. the decoration-set as i know, was the best two of all movies i watch (right below once upon a time in America).the costume-design really supports the greatness of it's decoration.<br/><br/>all i can say for who read this, this movie is excellent. maybe not have a good cinematography as citizen kane or apocalypse now, but it is very entertaining from the other aspects. one of my 25 favorites. 10/10 thanks for the readers"
"evandewangga97","9","1","2","13 January 2015"," Closest Way to Define Ingenuity
","Just like my several previous reviews, personally I am very sensitive with humanity. All I see and absorb is in human's view. Again, human as a truly human. Not just the physical appearance, a bunch of talent, or even the incapability. Human is indeed the conscience itself, the feeling of empathy, or we can say the very soul of human. It is connected with characterization of the movie. The more ""human"" the character is, it indicates the rate of the movie. But, that's technical. In addition, the biography-movie must have very strong character and improvisation. And, ""Amadeus"" drives away the human value in a delightful way.<br/><br/>Of course, nobody will not expect what a vulgar man Mozart would be. We just live in a different era with him. The movie just capture the reflection of Mozart by his letter, so we can enjoy Mozart that has peculiar personality. I give applause for Tom Hulce, he gave his best for this monumental role. A strong protagonist combined with the stronger antagonist, just make the complication feels so perfect. How wonderful F. Murray Abraham act for this cinema. He deserved the Oscar, without a doubt. The feature simply about two sides of the paradigm, we can understand how Mozart and his rival, Salieri, defines how they walk their life. You know, it's just make me realized, that even the talented man like Mozart, still had so many classic problems, like family, economics, or relationship. Meanwhile, Forman crafted the act well with the other elements of movies. Such as, the music. Of course it's about a musician, you must make the great play-list in the movie-sequence. So do the make- up-artist and the setting-maker, great work for them. At least, you can really feel the atmosphere of Vienna in that century by watching it. At last, the scenario is just a breakthrough of the biopic- movie. In my opinion, the historical correct is the best way to define each person. Yes, I know some of the part is incorrect, but the personality of each role is nearly perfect. A history-adviser accompanied Forman to make this movie. Of course, Forman can't follow all the historical-advice, he is more concerns with the entertaining way to provide that history. And he did it awesomely. It's very complex, but the world admitted the achievement of Forman.<br/><br/>From the technical, let's jump to the value and idea. I just love the fresh value and idea. The idea, is just like another great film, really unique yet brilliant. Story-telling-movie from the man who is jealous with Mozart. Yes, the hater of Mozart, in front of clergyman. A smart way to define someone. More than that, I just can see the talent of a Mozart, very real-visualized. But, humanity is met the struggle of the world, you know like foods, money, and fame. Even the genius man can reach all of that when he ignore the basic lesson of how to live in his era. People just admire, and it's not the guarantee that you will be helped by them. Unfortunately, Mozart didn't master it. He is genius in one way, but idiot in another way. ""Amadeus"" brought all that value in a very emotional way. It's 3 hours though, but you won't regret it. There are always reasons why someone make this movie this long.<br/><br/>So, that's all I need to say. I give nine out of ten for all those aspects and value. Let's add another deep message and I'll give it ten. But, after all, ""Amadeus"" is splendid."
"SnoopyStyle","9","1","2","6 December 2014"," Great F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce's laugh
","The movie opens with an elderly Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confessing to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). He used to be one of the great composers of Europe but has since been forgotten. As a boy, he was jealous of Mozart. He was delighted that his boorish father died. He works his way up to being the court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) in Vienna. He is eager to meet Mozart but finds a flamboyant immature sex-fiend. Soon his admiration turns into jealousy of Mozart's Godly gift. Mozart marries Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman injects a lot of energy into a period piece. Tom Hulce's laugh is infectious. However it's F. Murray Abraham that is the true driver of this movie. It's his jealousy and scheming heart that creates the depths for Mozart. His older self gives so much color to his disgust for Mozart. And the music is operatic. It is not just beautiful and grand but it's also hilarious. There's also special mention to Jeffrey Jones."
"squirrel_burst","Null","1","2","26 November 2014"," It's fiction so good that you wish they'd re-write the history books
","""Amadeus"" is fiction so good you wish it was true. The film, based on the stage play of the same name follows a fictional rivalry between Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri, the now largely forgotten composer who was rich and famous in his day. Tom Hulce plays Mozart, a composer whose pieces are now recognized for the genius that they, but he struggled to make ends meet. Unlike the rest of the world, Salieri recognized Mozart for the genius that he was... and it drove him mad. Despite his love for the man's work, we witness Salieri spend his life doing everything in his power to sabotage Mozart, with the young author believing them to be friends.<br/><br/>The film is an astounding period piece, using a mix of authentic locations and perfect re-creations to bring you back to the late 18th century. I found the costumes to be absolutely convincing, from the elaborate ballroom gowns to the crazy opera costumes. This film is set when people wore elaborate powdered wigs and went to masquerades so bizarre, it makes your average Halloween party look a waste of time. If you have any interest in clothing or costumes, and not even on a professional level, this film will blow your mind. If you have some lady friends that don't usually go for movies that you like, lure them in with promises of fantastic wardrobes and costumes. As you might expect, the music is fantastic, but it's not as simple as some of the most memorable parts of Mozart's music playing over characters walking around, or a bit of quiet music playing in the background while characters talk. Sequences where the climax in the orchestra matches the actions of the characters, or a scene taken from one of Mozart's operas and used to indicate exactly what kind of turmoil is going on inside our characters' hearts is what you look forward to seeing in this film. Equally astounding are the performances. Everyone here is absolutely convincing in their role, particularly F. Murray Abraham as a truly tortured soul. Even Tom Hulce, who is slightly annoying as the cackling, buffoonish Mozart is absolutely perfect. You instantly feel the rage and the simultaneous despair that grows inside of Salieri seeing this young guy flaunting his talent while seemingly not taking any of his music seriously.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the standout role is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Talk about a complex character. On the one hand, you feel really bad for this guy. He has spent his entire life dedicated to music. No women, no partying, no fun whatsoever because he promised to God that he would give himself to his music (and to him) if he was gifted with the talent to create beautiful symphonies. That might sound extreme written down like this, but in the context of the film, you believe it. You always hear about artists going mad and being either eccentric or unbearable to work with because of their burning passion and this is a prime example. It's not that this guy is unpleasant; it's that he is so passionate about his music that everything else is an obstacle to him. All he cares about is his music. Then, enter Mozart and the tragedy of it all. Mozart is young, handsome, he doesn't seem to take anything seriously and he effortlessly composes. You know exactly what Salieri feels like, because everyone's been there. The difference is that our main character is a tragic one and decides to do the unthinkable, something even he feels disgusted at by choosing to become Mozart's enemy instead of his friend. That's the fascinating element of this film; Salieri is successful, but realizes that in time, his music will fade away, while Mozart, who has the makings of the greatest musician of all time, is still struggling. These two men could have become friends, maybe even collaborated and become immortals. It breaks your heart to see it play out, and you cannot look away for a second.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is what you wish every movie was like. It's a long movie, sure, but every instant is absolutely gripping. It's tragic, it's comic, it's breathtaking. It's fiction so good you wish it was reality. Every time I think about the story, it simultaneously breaks my heart and it fills me with joy. Dedicate yourself an afternoon to ""Amadeus"" and watch it without any distractions. It's an experience you will never forget, one that will profoundly affect you. (Theatrical version on DVD, August 9, 2013)"

","IMDb Top 250: 82<br/><br/>After you've seen a few, biopic can become fairly repetitive. They show a scene or two about the topic's childhood, the show a few moments that craft the subject's character, show the breakthrough, optional fall from grace, and death. The film is linear, well made and wins some Oscars..<br/><br/>But here's Amadeus, a film that could've easily dropped the more interesting aspects of the play and done a linear narrative. But it keeps the perspective of Salieri, long after the action takes place, in the asylum. That adds a whole layer to the film. Also, not having the camera follows Mozart's every move shows that even in his prime, a composer isn't the center of the world. <br/><br/>Amadeus is an impossibly lavish film: like the similarly timed- Barry Lyndon, costumes and makeup are luscious, and the sets and decorations are grand. The opera scenes are incredible. Visually and technically, the film is marvellous.<br/><br/>Then we get into the characters. The film focuses on the one-sided clash between jealous Salieri and childish Mozart. It makes the film more interesting than simply showing Mozart's life. I found the clash relateable: there's always someone who's better than you at anything, though they may not be the eccentric Mozart is.<br/><br/>I found it wrong that everyone speaks in a plain English accent, while making reference to ""our language, German"". Also the film runs long, longer than it could have. And lastly, I don't know what to get out of it. The end is quite nihilistic. Mediocrity. You lose.

","Quite simply, a perfect film - the only one (of many hundreds I have seen) that I would rate10/10. Characterisation and plot are superb; casting and acting are excellent. The film has been brilliantly adapted from an exceptionally good stage play. The plot is gripping, building up to one of the most moving finales one is likely to see. And on top of this there is the music, and the sets. Having just visited Prague for the first time, I was delighted to find that it is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be (after watching Amadeus). The Director captures the city perfectly, and it becomes a major player (rather like the Nostromo in Alien). It is hard to imagine how Amadeus could have been improved (and I don't think the 'Director's cut' is better than the film as it was originally released)."
"zgamer-1","10","1","2","29 August 2012"," The Crowning Jewel of Milos Forman's Career
","As well done as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is, my pick for Milos Forman's best movie and my personal favorite movie to date is ""Amadeus."" Yes it is not historically accurate. Yes it is Americans and British actors playing foreign roles with no accents. Yes it is a ""stuffy period piece."" You know what? It is also an absolute masterpiece of a movie! The story manages to work on multiple levels. Yes the surface message deals with the ""price of revenge,"" but it is so much more personal than that. We see that Sallieri has become his own worst enemy purely because he cannot let go of his jealousy. He cannot just accept the skills of others and move on with his own already successful career. This is also paralleled in the life of Mozart, shown here as a childish genius who is trapped in his own prison of inflated ego in no small part because of his father. The film covers topics of faith, the fear of failure, the dark side of entertainment, the way class and talents are not in stone and more. It works organically and manages to be incredibly captivating.<br/><br/>Forman manages to keep the story entertaining by running his characters through plenty of emotional gamuts. At times the movie is very dramatic. Then there will be incredibly funny moments. Then there will be incredibly thoughtful moments. There is never one monotonous tone and it keeps you on your toes to see how a scene will play out. He also manages to keep an optimistic tone in spite of the darker elements. This is not just a tragic and depressing look at the decline of Mozart's career. It is a celebration of the man and the time period, with all of their faults. We know Mozart's memory still thrives through his music so why just be sad about it.<br/><br/>A lot of credit must be given to Tom Hulce as Mozart for that. Portraying Mozart as a boorish delinquent with a brilliant talent is not only pretty accurate (We know these people in real life), but the right counterbalance to the drama. Even as he drifts into insanity and ill health, Mozart is shown as a sympathetic character who has a consistent love for creating great music if not much else.<br/><br/>We cannot forget F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Sallieri though. The heart of the movie, Abraham brings emotional weight and human traits to a character who could simply be a typical envious character. his character also has pure intentions for making music, but he never learned how to accept humility for other talented people. Sallieri is a controlled and calculating force of envy and self-loathing and we see it all on Abraham's face and through his line delivery. Also the fact he can effortlessly pull off playing both the young and old Sallieri is an admirable feat.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast works excellently in the film, but it is Jeffrey Jones playing Emperor Joseph II that steals the show. Though not nearly in the film enough, he carries a presence both as a royal figure and being a general music illiterate. He also works as a great foil for Hulce's more comedic scenes.<br/><br/>There is so much more that can be said about this film. The cinematography is eye popping, the sets are lavishly ornate, the costumes are all precise designed, the editing moves at a comfortable clip, the make-up work is spot-on and the performances of Mozart's classics are first rate.<br/><br/>I just could go on, but needless to say I wholeheartedly recommend this film. It is a stunning piece of work and well worth the time of any film buff or Mozart fan!"

","From the most important contemporary Czech director Milos Forman, whose sole work I have watched before is THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT (1996, an 8/10) and he has gotten hold of two Oscar wins for BEST DIRECTOR, one for this film and another one for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST (1975), which seems to stay in my must-see list forever. <br/><br/>Being illiterate to classic music, my ignorance surprisingly doesn't spoil my appreciation of this biographic masterpiece about Mozart and Antonio Salieri, a one-sided chicanery between the innocent genius and the jealousy-driven lesser-known. Scrupulously structuring, with a cut- back opening starts in the asylum, a lunatic Salieri recounts his rivalry with Mozart to a young priest who hopes to receive his confession. The story is told with intermittent elucidations from Salieri (facing the priest), to stress on the contexts of his love-and-hate battle with Mozart, whom he reckons sent by God to test his devotion and loyalty, and when he has been continuously humiliated and eclipsed by Mozart's unparalleled talent, his feeble mental state commences twisting the God's will and scheming to destroy Mozart covertly, which he has finally succeeded, but also boomeranged on himself, what's more impressively done is Mozart, even till his eternal rest, is still unaware of Salieri's shenanigans and ironically believes him as his best friend.<br/><br/>Accompanying by Mozart's canon, the film is pristinely remarkable in almost every facet in spite of its 28 annual rings, screenwriter Peter Shaffer concocts an intriguingly dexterous storyline without confining his two protagonists into a stereotypical mire of good and evil, which are exemplified in both characters with an intelligent instillation. The two leading actors, the Oscar- winning F. Murray Abraham (whose trashy post-Oscar career is a mystery to me) and his fellow co-nominee Tom Hulce (whose ebbing post-Oscar nomination career is another case here) are beamingly satisfying to watch on screen, Abraham has more angles to show off Salieri's manifold flaws and inward confrontations; while Hulce's droll invention of an eccentric nonconformist prodigy requires more grit and artistry in my opinion (now my mind is clogged up with Mozart's squeaky and hysterical laughter). A baby-face Elizabeth Berridge and a restrained Jeffrey Jones (who could have thought he was quite handsome in his youth) have done their best bit to be the foils as Mozart's money-seeking wife and a congenial Emperor Joseph II with a meretricious taste in music respectively.<br/><br/>Since now most biopics are in a stasis of narrative sterility and vapid resources, this film could be used as a textbook reference, picking a different position, leaving more room to let audience to do the assessment, or simply finding a more contradictory pair of a legend and his/her antagonist."

","For some reason I never imagined that an almost three hour movie about famed composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart could be that good. Well I was incredibly wrong. Unimaginably, unfathomably wrong was I. Milos Forman's 1984 Best Picture winning film is a masterpiece. It tells the story of, obviously, Wolfang Amadeus Mozart and his life in Vienna as the drunk babbling genius whose fame and talent drove him mad. Subsequently, it's also the story of Vienna's royal court composer Antonio Salieri who is driven mad with jealousy for Mozart and his God-like composing talents that Salieri has prayed for his whole life. The film is an incredibly tale of greed and jealousy, as well as a sweeping epic that celebrates the work of Mozart on a grand scale. Even if you're not a fan of classical music, which I am not, you should still love this film for the genius that it possesses.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a film wrought with ingenious subtleties to its plot and characters that make it incredibly impressive and fantastic to watch. The character of Mozart is portrayed so perfectly by Tom Hulce and it's one of the most well written characters I've ever seen on screen. The character goes through three phases through the film's three acts. In the first act he is the artist just trying to get recognized for the immense talent he knows he possesses. In the second act his talent becomes solidified throughout Europe, and he begins to push the limits of artistic expression. Much of the second act is spent with Mozart disobeying the royal court so that he can express the most artistic freedom he can. He becomes the embodiment of what every progressive artist wants to be. His character speaks volumes to anybody with a creative streak, and it absolutely floored me. The second act ends with Mozart conducting a performance of Don Giovanni and it is, without a doubt, one of the most moving and incredible things I've ever seen in a film.<br/><br/>And then we reach the third act where the expressionism and talent comes crashing down on Mozart as he drives himself mad and digs his own grave for himself. We see the fall of this epic character and it is brutal. We all see it coming, but as Mozart begins to slip away from reality it is absolutely tragic and we feel a part of ourselves die with Mozart as he crumbles away in his misery.<br/><br/>But then we have F. Murray Abraham's Oscar winning performance as Antonio Salieri which is spectacular and was just another element of the film that absolutely blew me away. His performance is damn near perfect and, once again, the character is written so incredibly well and the relationship that develops between the jealous Salieri and the oblivious Mozart is fantastic. There are scenes in the film where Mozart and Salieri are talking and Salieri is doing his absolute best to hide his seething hatred for Mozart. I can't adequately describe the excellence with which these exchanges are pulled off. You really just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Amadeus is an absolute must see. I mean it with every fiber of my being when I say that this film is a masterpiece. It's superbly directed, ridiculously well written, and stunningly acted by every member of the cast. Amadeus is truly what I would call a near perfect film."
"spikey_jap","9","1","2","7 June 2012"," A Tale of Envy with Mozart
","What made this film work for me was to use a man who is not a well known classical composer (Salieri) and to create a fictional tale of jealousy toward a musical genius (Mozart). Not only does this film works well on telling a fictional biography, but captures the hate and jealousy that Salieri had toward Mozart very well without going offtrack. You see why he hates Mozart, you see his anger and he does what he can to end his career and to take out his competition. The storyline is great as it is; telling the story using flashbacks and partially going back to the present, portraying Salieli as an old man, looking back at his life, narrating his ambition and his emotions at throughout the flashbacks.<br/><br/>There were a few moments that I thought were creative. One was the music; unless you have a passion for music or are a music teacher, you will be in the same situation as I am when it comes to actually reading musical sheets. However, what worked was as you see Salieri look through Mozart's music or Mozart is focused on writing his masterpiece, you hear the music that is being read or written. Instead of having the audience wonder what the score of the music was, the film plays the music so we audiences can hear the music ourselves. Another thing that was pretty creative was the mystery. At the beginning, Salieri confessed that he killed Mozart, his plot and how he killed Mozart remains a mystery until a tragedy occurs in Mozart's life. Another good thing about this film was the fact of despite having the colorful clothing and wigs, the film gave the feeling that the film was set during the time period. <br/><br/>The acting was pretty great in this film; really liked the actors who portrayed the characters. Tom Hulce as the childish, but musically talented Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and F. Murray Abraham as the jealous and less-known composer Antonio Salieri. The other cast members portrayed their characters well and were neither a loose end. In a way, you will feel sorry for Salieri seeing how outclass and how mediocre he is compared to Mozart. As you see Salieri and Mozart in the same room for the first time, you see the Emperor playing a piece that Salieri worked hard and diligently on. As Mozart listens to the music and talks to the Emperor, he plays the piece, without the musical sheet and improves the music as he plays it. No matter how childish and talented Mozart is and how jealous and malevolent Salieri becomes, you just can't hate these two characters. Mozart is simply just Mozart and that is his nature to have the talent and you feel only sorry for Salieri.<br/><br/>This film deserves to be called a classic, with a well-paced strolling about jealousy, great acting, and a fictional tale that involves a lesser-known composer against a musical genius. The film is long, but doesn't give that feeling of a long movie; actually felt shorter than the actual time length. If you like these takes of a fictional tale involving historical figures, then this film is for you."

","The film is filled with music. At first thought this thing could resist people to watch the film. But it is unbelievable that opera can be so much beautiful. The film is a must watch for everyone or I would say an important film. Because it is about Mozart, the name that we all have heard since childhood. The length of the film is long. I watched the director's cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.). Then at some point of times you will find opera shown at length and the interesting fact is that you will like it. I must say it was 3 hours well spent.<br/><br/>""A must watch for each and everyone."""

","The story of what music meant to an aging ""Patron Saint of Mediocrity"" told to a young priest by our afflicted Soliere after being committed to a sanitarium.

The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F.

"Desertman84","10","1","2","6 March 2012"," A Great Film About Mozart
","Amadeus is a period drama film directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer. Adapted from Shaffer's stage play Amadeus, the story is a variation of Alexandr Pushkin's play Mozart i Salieri, in which the composer Antonio Salieri recognizes the genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but thwarts him out of envy. The story is set in Vienna, Austria, during the latter half of the 18th century.<br/><br/>Amadeus is an expansion of a Viennese ""urban legend"" concerning the death of 18th century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the vantage point of an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart first gained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II. Salieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young snipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieri -- so disciplined, so devoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiors -- not touched by God? Unable to match Mozart's talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstart's career. Disguising himself as a mysterious benefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking Requiem, which eventually costs Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the film's many pearls of dialogue, the best line goes to the emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition on the grounds that it has ""too many notes.""<br/><br/>It is arguably the best motion picture ever made about the process of creation and the creator.On a production level and as an evocation of a time and place, Amadeus is loaded with pleasures for Reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty. As Mozart, Tom Hulce, though extremely American in looks and voice, gets better and better as the drama progresses.Overall,it was a lavish, entertaining, powerful film about the life and influence, both positive and negative, of one of Western culture's great artists."

","So I watched this movie more than ten times. I never felt enough and somehow I always end up crying.<br/><br/>Now seriously Milos Forman did an amazing job. It keeps impressing me when Salieri takes original sheets how we see the projection of what he sees and of what's written on the paper. How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere. <br/><br/>Also, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it. <br/><br/>The hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time. And instead of Salieri's expectations of his funeral- a big cathedral, music playing, many people, we see how he's thrown into a hole with the rest of poor people who didn't have money to afford a decent funeral. It makes you ask yourself: Doesn't he deserve more? Now we don't even have a stone to call his grave, we know there was no difference of the final resting place of one of a kind music genius and any ordinary man who made no difference in this world. But we still have his music.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce and F.Murrey Abraham acted wonderfully, the movie became so real that it touched me even more with every passing minute. Lines are fantastic too, true, straight, touching, you can apply them on your real life. <br/><br/>One of the best movies I've ever watched."

","If there's one thing about Amadeus that I'm glad for, it is the fact that this does not look like it was made in the eighties. And thank God, because if it was anything like that, I don't think this movie could work.<br/><br/>You would think a movie about Mozart—you would think its greatest asset were the man who played Mozart, but no. Yes, okay, Tom Hulce puts in one of the most memorable performances in cinematic history, no doubt. After having watched this movie, can anybody ever really think Mozart and not hear that laugh ringing in your head?<br/><br/>True, this flick takes a huge dramatic license as every possibility presents itself (For one thing, Joseph II was not the brainless oaf that the movie makes him out to be—Sorry, had to say it.), but even then, were it not for the degree of which that dramatic license takes, we would not have the even more memorable character of Antonio Salieri, a part for which F. Murray Abraham received his jinxed Oscar. Granted, he hasn't made anything of note in the past I don't know eleven years? But let's take a quick look at his resumé: here you shall find Amadeus, m'kay; (2) Scarface, m'kay, a bit overrated and whatnot but still an excellent, albeit brief, performance by F.M.A.; and (3) Finding Forrester, wherein you will, if you ask me, find F.M.A.'s best work yet. Still, it is the fake Salieri plot-line that really makes Amadeus tick.<br/><br/>I have never in my life seen anybody on-screen so goddamn nefariously vindictive, and yet so sympathetic at the same time?

I know it was based on a play. I have to say that the title Amadeus was brilliant. It is a rather cool sounding name, more so than ""Mozart."" Especially for those who don't know that it was the composer's middle name, those people wouldn't know the movie was about Mozart! Tom Hulce's laugh is memorable and helps make the movie both interesting and amusing. Of course it is mostly a drama, but one thing it isn't is boring! The villainy of F. Murray Abraham's Antonio Salieri was spellbinding. He also plays villains in Thirteen Ghosts and Finding Forrester.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Jones was great to see as the Emperor. I'm glad he was able to add his presence to this classic film. The music, of course, is also a main highlight of the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Mozart's comical impression of Salieri during the party! You know what I'm talking about! Also another highlight is Mozart dictating part of his final Requiem to Salieri near the end of the movie. I heard this never really happened in reality, but for the film it adds quite a dramatic and inspiring punch to the movie.<br/><br/>Enjoyable!"
"classicsoncall","9","1","2","8 May 2011"," ""He had simply written down music already finished in his head"".
","My disadvantage watching this film is that I don't know a lot about the life of Mozart. Therefore I was put off by Tom Hulce's fey portrayal of the legendary composer, and struggled to accept the characterization offered here. However the picture seems to have more to say about Austrian court composer Antonio Salieri, and the relationship he developed with Mozart upon learning how unprincipled and downright vulgar the man was. Repressing his own personal desires, Salieri comes to realize he will never be as masterful a musician as the much younger Mozart, at once blaming himself and God for the talent he can never hope to acquire. This was skillfully conveyed when he read Mozart's musical notes for a particularly important piece, and marveled that there were no corrections or erasures on the finished product. That moment led to the comment in my summary line above, an observation that described Mozart's talent as an almost matter of fact skill rather than the product of some long and laborious process of creation. This was given further support by Mozart himself when he objected to Emperor Joseph's request to rewrite one of his operas - ""I can't rewrite what's perfect"" was the composer's response"" - a comment that would challenge the Emperor to accept all or nothing, such was Mozart's supreme confidence in his own ability.<br/><br/>I've always wondered why the theatrical poster for this film looked so odd, with the black caped masked figure, and the question was answered with Salieri's disguise, commissioning Mozart to write a majestic funeral composition. The mask was two faced, one presenting a smiling, contented face, the other one of bitter scorn, perhaps the best expression of Salieri's dual nature in regards to his relationship with Mozart. Although truth be told, Salieri never appeared to have an outwardly happy demeanor in his quest to leave a musical legacy.<br/><br/>So I have mixed feelings about the picture. On an artistic level, it certainly deserves it's string of Oscars honoring Art Direction, Costume Design and Makeup. However the way Mozart's character is portrayed leaves me strangely perplexed, notwithstanding his creative genius. It didn't help that actor Hulce developed that irritating laugh to go with the vulgar outlook that his character carried into personal relationships. Still, I'd recommend it for cinema fans who enjoy classical music, as a wonderful sampling of Mozart's best work is ever present throughout the story."
"dmenfield","10","1","2","22 February 2011"," Best of class, and worthy
","It should be noted that the playwright Peter Shaffer titled Amadeus a ""fantasy"". In fact, it is just that. It becomes a Man vs. God morality play, where in order to make the dialectic work, Salieri must be portrayed as an admirable person, and Mozart as a cretin, albeit a genius. That is the fantasy. Nothing we know about either Salieri or Mozart supports such characterizations, other than Mozart's undeniable genius. In fact, once past his striking normality (so much for the theory that madness and genius always walkhand-in-hand), we know that Mozart was a clear eyed judge of musical worth, and one of the best friends one could ever have). Moreover, we know this: Mozart was probably the greatest musical genius that ever lived, and Salieri was a routine 18th Century musician chiefly known through Pushkin's play and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera as the man who poisoned Mozart (a contention generally dismissed as false).<br/><br/>That said, this is the finest film of its genre ever produced. Get past the characterizations, and focus on the events, as they are mostly faithful to the truth, and thus lend an essentially worthy character to the film. Those familiar with the circumstances surrounding Mozart's death, for example, and more significantly his funeral and burial, will find their treatment in this film almost supernaturally accurate. Milos Forman was either a true Mozartean, or else he really did his homework. In this film, it is as it was.<br/><br/>The fantasy is worthy and well done, but it is essentially faux. The events depicted, however, are mostly dead-on, and they reveal not only a fascinating and compelling portrait of the age of the Viennese Enlightenment, but also the stunning appearance on that scene of the man that Goethe believed to be the greatest genius that has ever lived. It is almost uncanny how this movie captures the flavor of life in the musical firmament that traces its global humanist phenomenology to Mozart, the first free-lance composer that ever lived.<br/><br/>But at its soul, this film is gorgeous, and magnificently captures the astonishing, unmatchable glory and humanity of the music of Mozart, which has done more to elevate the spirit of those who hear it than the works of any other man that ever lived."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","7 February 2011"," In the Name of God, Mozart, and the Holy Music ...
","""Amadeus"", is a powerful portrayal of jealousy's poisoning effect in the heart of the envious. F. Murray Abraham turns his performance as Salieri, the unsung hero of the classical music Golden Age into the unforgettable fictional villain who killed Mozart, after he murdered his own soul, by making God his enemy. The title holds therefore a particularly ironic meaning if you think of Salieri's relationship with God. Amadeus is not just Mozart's middle name but means also ""beloved by God"", which obviously contradicts Salieri's personal sentiment before guiding all his vengeful actions  not against Mozart, but against God. Salieri is the personification of the inferiority complex which, when dangerously mixed with frustration, gives birth to evil. However, Salieri is probably one of the most sympathetic cinematic villains, because despite our reluctance to admit it, we can relate to his feelings. In this world, there are and have been more Salieris than Mozarts, this is God's implacable will, God who inspired Salieri a burning desire of revenge. <br/><br/>And Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce is the tool of Salieri's revenge. Salieri is a man who loves music, whose personal dream is to become famous and forever celebrated. He made a pact with God. He secretly gave him all his chastity, his humility for an extreme devotion to music, to be blessed by a musical talent that'll make him remembered as one of the greats. It's not surprising that Salieri was so eager to sacrifice all life's pleasures to achieve his goal. Salieri dreams of being celebrated, loved, through ages, and never to sink into oblivion, he'll never witness his dreams being fulfilled, but that doesn't matter, it's all about a mystical devotion to God for a posthumous rewarding. Unfortunately, God made other plans and all the musical grace Salieri dreamed of, was dedicated to another soul.<br/><br/>And this is how Tom Hulce's interpretation of the titular role, as the second lead character of the movie plays a significant part. He's goofy, immature, has a unique giggle flirting with craziness, as to suggest the idea that genius is most often combined with insanity. After all, when Salieri tried to guess how this genius who wrote a concerto at 4, a symphony at 7, and an Opera at 12, would look like, he knew God wouldn't choose any human being to translate his divine beauty into music. And when he realizes this little, vulgar, constantly joking creature is the ""chosen one"", his deception is so big his grief directly targets God, as he understands his tragically ironic fate : enough musical ear to be touched by Mozart's divine light, but not enough talent to reach it. In the crucial scene where he composes the little March for Mozart, he thanks God for inspiring him, with eyes filled of gratitude. When after one hearing, Mozart plays the exact melody with some humiliating improvements, Salieri thanks God again with a more ironic tone in his voice. The second humiliation occurs when Salieri finds out how Mozart's talent allowed him to ""possess"" the Opera singer he's always jealously protected. Salieri has been stepped over two times with God as an accomplice. It became personal.<br/><br/>We all had this feeling whether we believe in God or not, that everything is playing against us, whatever we try. God, luck, hazard, everything we lack is owned by one undeserving ungrateful person. This is the cardinal sin of envy, instead of being happy for someone, we're consumed by a constant desire to see this person lose everything. This attitude is due to one personal grief Salieri has against God, if he had plans for Mozart, why did he give him the musical conscience to realize his weakness, and more than that, why did he fill his heart with so much passion, and desire to create and to be remembered. <br/><br/>The movie is told in flash-back, as a confession to a priest believing all men are created equal. ""Are they?"" replies a skeptical older Salieri. Salieri knows about music, more than maybe any other character in this film and this sure helps the narrative to transcend the whole Salieri-Mozart rivalry. Never had music been so beautifully described in a film, hearing Salieri talking about Mozart's music is like floating in an ocean of notes where symphonic waves graciously swing under an air of emotions. It's like Mozart's music piercing the deepest part of our soul. After all, this is a movie about music, and music is like the fourth character of Forman's ""Amadeus"". With God as the third lead character. It's like a Holy Trinity haunting this film, with God, Mozart and the Holy Music, and poor Salieri as a pathetic but powerful Devil drown in the bitter lake of jealousy. God, has never been so omnipresent in a film, you hear him through the glorious finale of ""The Abduction of the Seraglio"", to the enchantment of a ""Magic Flute"" and the impressive solemnity of the ""Requiems"", he never ceased to inhabit Mozart's music. But God was elsewhere, in Salieri's flaming eyes devoured by jealousy, where every drop of acid corroding Salieri's humanity was a tear to mourn his loss of faith.<br/><br/>God appears through the two characters. Salieri even acts like a Biblical character elaborating a complicated but devious plan to kill God's divine creature. But as a protagonist of the film, God puts a term to Salieri's malicious scheme by killing his divine protégé and letting Salieri alive witnessing his creations falling in the abyss of memories. This is how Salieri felt things, but this is Salieri's film, and as viewers, we can't help but feel for Salieri's weaknesses. Mozart was his idol, and only he knew he was the greatest composer who ever lived, and he couldn't even share a part of his divine light, this was his doom."

"moviesleuth2","9","1","2","29 March 2010"," As big and dramatic as anything Mozart ever came up with
","Music, especially that of the classical variety, is capable of both great bombast and startling subtlety. So is ""Amadeus."" The film has such a grandiose scale that it is surprising to find that director Milos Forman has time to bring out the subtle nuances in the story. It's not quite perfect, and maybe a tad long (at least the director's cut is), but ""Amadeus"" is a wonderful film.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a pious composer with minimal talent, is a huge fan of the hottest thing in 18th century music: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri loves the music, and is eager to meet the new genius...that is, until he meets him. Meeting Mozart is the ultimate slap in the face. Mozart is like the modern day celebrity stereotype: a hard partying, hard drinking, conceited jerk who chases anything in a dress. Salieri is so enraged that a man like this was blessed with so much talent, while he, a man who is making music for God, has so little. So Salieri begins orchestrating Mozart's downfall...<br/><br/>This is not a true story, and it wisely never claims to be. Playwright Peter Schaffer took a rumor whose credibility is, at best, tenuous, and created a whole new story with characters that indeed lived. The filmmakers have taken the mantra, ""never let the facts get in the way of a good story"" to heart.<br/><br/>The film is splendidly acted. F. Murray Abraham is nothing short of brilliant as the tortured Salieri. Here is a man who has given everything to write music in praise of God, only to have the promised talent go to a man who is so spoiled and crude. That would drive anyone mad. For his part, Tom Hulce makes a cartoonish character into a surprisingly three-dimensional individual, to the point where he becomes...dare I say it? Sympathetic. Elizabeth Berridge is also good as Constanze, Mozart's wife. She loves her husband, although she has a greater intuition about who his friends and enemies are. Jeffrey Jones is surprisingly good as Emperor Joseph II, the idiot king of Austria (he criticizes one of Mozart's operas for ""having too many notes"").<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman is a terrific director. I liked ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" and based on this, I'm going to forgive him for ""Goya's Ghosts."" Forman has an eye for period detail, and we are fully transported back into the time of Mozart. It's not just how everything looks, but how people act. Sitting in chairs in the opera house, fire swallowers on the streets, etc. The only flaw is that Mozart's madness is told, but why it happens is not adequately explained.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is a wonderful film, plain and simple.<br/><br/>My rating: PG for brief nudity."
"ellieforpeace","10","1","2","13 July 2009"," A perfect piece of cinema
","I wouldn't stop myself saying that Amadeus is one of the finest movies ever made. It is perfect in every way.<br/><br/>Part of it is the subject matter. It is about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the famous composer. Of course, it lends itself to be the vessel of some of the finest music ever written. Mozart was a genius, but, much like his music, his entire career was filled with superfluities. For every Don Giovanni, there is a piece that should have been forgotten. But the movie is only three hours, so it showcases only the best of Mozart.<br/><br/>It is a very fictional movie, one in which a mediocre composer, Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), fawns over Mozart (Tom Hulce), envies his talent and plots his downfall and death. The academy loved the 1984 movie, giving it 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role for F. Murray Abraham (though I believe Tom Hulce deserves it more), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay from the play of the same name. The reason I say that Tom Hulce deserves the Oscar over F. Murray Abraham is not because Abraham didn't give a brilliant and nuanced performance, it's that Hulce simply is Mozart. Like Ben Kingsley is forevermore the face of Gandhi and Sean Penn is Harvey Milk. There are some roles people will always be, and that is the way it is. When people think of these real people, they see these actors instead. And also, this, of course, is a period piece. But it is arguably the most interesting you will ever see. It is light, it is dark, dramatic, romantic, beautiful and human. It is balanced, and that is really what makes a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Each piece of this film is vital. All three hours. Every second is perfect. Every note is in place. The editing is tight, genius. Each element lends itself to the whole, and to the detail. Look at the movie for pleasure, and you'll be rewarded. Scrutinize it and you'll be amazed even more. There's nothing not to love about this movie. When you sit there, after three long hours, and want even more, there's something very, very special about the movie.<br/><br/>This is a perfect piece of cinema."
"madir-2","Null","1","2","20 May 2009"," Amadeus: A Simply Fantastic Masterpiece
","Amadeus:A Simply Fantastic Masterpiece<br/><br/>The film Amadeus is an amazingly well written story that summarizes the life of the talented Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told by his admirer-rival Antonio Salieri. It is definitely a very rich film that perfectly combines a comedy and a tragedy. For those that know little or nothing about Mozart, and also for those that can appreciate a great music, this is a highly recommended movie. The film not only gives relevant details about the greatness of Mozart, his music and his messy life; but also makes you feel like you are right there in the middle of one of his concerts. You can feel the music so deeply, and at the same time, you will be amazed by seeing him composing one symphony after another with minimum efforts.<br/><br/>Antonio Salieri was a mediocre composer that always loved and admired the music of Mozart; however he fought himself to remain indifferent to it. Salieri hated Mozart with all his heart, but he recognized his inferiority as well as he recognized Mozart's brilliant talent for music. We can perceive through the movie how Mozart's success affected Salieri, who blamed God his entire life for not giving him the musical talent that was given to his rival. Long after Mozart's death, this old man in a wheelchair is still affected by jealousy and hatred, and being asked by a priest to confess his sins, he starts telling the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical talent. On the other hand, Mozart was leaving mouths open with his natural musical skills. His biggest passion was music. It was a real shame that Mozart also liked to drink, party and gamble excessively, often spending lots of money. He married a woman that did not handle their finances very well, but that in a certain way, cared for him. It was a very sad moment the tragic death of Mozart; but even from his deathbed he could not stop making music.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a perfect combination of picture, acting and music. Opera is the dominant genre on the movie, and it is absolutely delightful. Customs are also majestic with all the dresses and hair styles. The architecture, as well as light and colors were perfectly used. Actors played their roles with magnificence. Tom Hulce did a wonderful job playing Mozart. I enjoyed even the simple detail of his annoying laugh. Two thumbs up also for F. Murray Abraham who performed Antonio Salieri and, in my opinion he was the best. His performance was excellent.<br/><br/>The scene that I liked the most was the saddest one, when Mozart was dying on his deathbed and he could not quit making music. Salieri , his rival, stayed by him side on his finals hours. Mozart was giving him the musical dictation of his last work, the Requiem. Salieri himself could not keep up with Mozart, and once more was amazed by this little man's talent. I think the film was hilarious in his totality. It is entertaining from start to end. I would give Amadeus a rating of ten out of ten. Do not miss the opportunity to see a ""simply fantastic masterpiece""."
"evasquez2","Null","1","2","19 May 2009"," The Love of God: A Gift and Tragedy
","The film Amadeus is truly an epic film directed by Milos Foreman based on the stage play by Peter Shaffer, by the same name. Worthy of all eleven Academy Award nominations, and definitely deserving of the eight won, Amadeus is a dramatic telling of the life and death of the eighteenth's century greatest composer , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. <br/><br/>The film begins with an old and delusional Antonio Salieri, once a respected composer of the court, now in a lunatic asylum meeting with a young priest. The purpose of their meeting is so that Salieri may seek peace through confession for allegedly being involved in Mozart's death. Salieri tells the events of his life dealing with his jealousy over Mozart through flashbacks of the years leading up towards the event. F. Murray Abraham gives an Oscar winning performance as the conniving antagonist Salieri who once a devoted religious man, decided he will become God's enemy whom he believes had cheated him by making him the mediocre composer. Upon seeing Mozart for the first time, Salieri believes to have been mocked by God who has blessed Mozart with an enormous talent and genius towards music. Salieri sees Mozart as an undeserving, vulgar opponent whom he must destroy in order to defeat God. <br/><br/>Tom Hulce also delivers a credible portrayal of the late Mozart as an arrogant musical genius with a unique high pitch giggle who is aware of his capability to astonish everyone from the streets of his hometown Salzburg to the royals of Vienna with his musical compositions. Though financially irresponsible and even holding the standards of an alcoholic, Mozart is a hard working composer who puts all his energy into his work and tries his hardest to also be a husband and father throughout his years of musical achievement. Hulce provides the comedic relief to the film in times when even Mozart's wife Constanze Mozart, portrayed by Elizabeth Berridge, cannot seem to break through the ice whether it be through their financial struggles or his father's disapproval of their living conditions. <br/><br/>Though Amadeus lacks some amount of historical accuracy in the telling of Mozart's life, the overall plot holds suspense and unexpected twists that captivate the viewer. The difference between Mozart and Salieri only put aside by their love for music could not have been better portrayed by any other actors, Murray in particular who steals the show with his love and admiration for Mozart's music, yet disgust and hatred for Mozart's self being . We can all relate to Salieri, even develop some sympathy for his devotion and hard work that is out shined by the natural talent bestowed in Mozart. It is an eye opener for those that also believe all composers to be like Salieri, so strict and conservative, whereas Mozart proves to be the exception for he is free willed and always energized and full of joy even at the moment of his death. I was overall impressed by the film and belie anyone with an eye for great acting would be as well."
"bgarcia3","Null","1","2","19 May 2009"," Wolfie Rivalry
","This is a very ""cut to the good parts"" version of a great composer's life. Although this movie was mainly about Mozart's life it was also about Antonio Salieri's life as well. The movie compared each of these two composers and described the apparent rivalry between them. Though I doubt Mozart felt he had any competition. Both actors played the roles effectively; I even started to associate them with the real men of that time. <br/><br/>Also the movie depicts Salieri as a suffered man who loved music but was only an average musician compared to the born musician Mozart. The movie is very effective in persuading people to believe this story, because in reality Salieri really didn't plot to kill Mozart. I must say though that some parts of the movie are very true to Mozart's image, especially the fact that his Requiem became his unfinished piece. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this movie and each scene seemed to fit in perfectly with the music that was being played. The movie flowed very well. I would have liked to see more of Mozart's childhood in this movie because it only shows glimpses of his past performances. I do understand though that the main focus was his adult life and career. I don't think many people notice where the movie took place was not in Austria but in the Czech Republic. I really liked the portrayal of Mozart as a genius yet light-hearted man. I also liked the costumes. The costumes were so elaborate, colorful and elegant made me want to get some of those clothes. <br/><br/>Some scenes are too dark to tell what is happening. In the opening scene I couldn't tell what was happening because it jumped too fast and was there was not enough light.<br/><br/>I really did like the actor Tom Hulce as Mozart. He seems to have studied his part in order to do a great role in the movie. Every time he laughed was very comical and I wonder if he laughed at himself for laughing that way throughout the movie. I really didn't like Salieri, the character, but this was because he was shown as in a bad light. I don't believe he was so hateful and envious of Mozart that he would have tried to ruin him. He is pivotal in getting the point of the story across, so I see his importance. F. Murray Abraham did an amazing job as Salieri I almost did believe he was full of envy. I think that the audience will grow to hate but also understand Salieri.<br/><br/>I was most captivated by this movie through the music. I would have liked to have seen this movie before actually visiting Salzburg, Austria. Salzburg was the birthplace of Mozart, as I found out while being there. I even went to his birth home and childhood home, not actually knowing all of his life's details or even seeing this movie. Now I want to visit Salzburg again because I feel that after watching this movie I better understand my view of Mozart's music and life. While I was in Salzburg I knew very little of this man. I know that this is just a movie but it really made me research and learn more about this brilliant man and his rival."
"Cmagilewski","10","1","2","19 May 2009"," Amadeus' Music & Mysterious Life
","Amadeus was a precise and basic film that portrayed Mozart's life. The film overall was a historical view on Mozart's music and also personnel life. It had a remarkably outstanding cast as well as the setting and costumes. The film accurately showed what Mozart's life was about and how his music was truly genius. However, the story involved not just Mozart, but also his family, friends, and colleagues which gave a vast outlook and opinion about his life. The story was told from Antonio Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham), who told the story from what he felt or believed. The story gave flashbacks from Salieri's point of view on Mozart. This could be inaccurate due to Salieri's feelings or bias toward Mozart. Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) played an extraordinary role as a frail and silly musician. His characterization and role proved to be extremely realistic. His facial gestures, movement, and humor contributed tremendously to the film. Amadeus had many speculations concerning if Mozart was really the way he was as the film. Or if Mozart and his father really had a close relationship. It is very difficult to tell, yet the film had a phenomenal way of portraying an idea of what it could really have been. The environment and atmosphere made the film to become very credible. The costumes and makeup/hair design was very traditional to the people of that colonial era. Amadeus is a very moving film that clearly illustrates the dramatic life of Mozart. This film is an inspiring and breathtaking work of art that has won eight Oscars and many other awards. In recognition of its terrific performance, Amadeus has become one of the most original movies of all time. It has wonderful twist with different characterizations that make it an impeccable five –star movie!"
"tlmcduffie","9","1","2","19 May 2009"," Existence of a Madman..
","Amadeus is a movie about the life of Amadeus Mozart. The film depicts the troubled life that Mozart led and the people who affected his career most significantly. I thought the movie was put together well, with quite a few comedic moments which helped to soften the movie's heavy plot.<br/><br/>The movie is constructed in a flashback method from Salieri's perspective. Mozart believed Saliari to be a trusted friend. It tells of the life of Mozart and how his brilliance often hindered his ability to have social relationships with his peers. Don't be scared yet though. The movie is not a dry documentary on the life of Mozart. It is a story about his life. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie. The costume design was fantastic. The wigs and costumes were very elaborate and set the mood for the movie. The humorous parts of the movie were well placed. They sustained the movie through its dark parts. <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like about the movie was the opening scene. I do think that the scene with Salieri trying to commit suicide could have been more detailed. I felt as though I had to piece together the beginning instead of just enjoying it. <br/><br/>My favorite character in the movie was Constanze Mozart, played by Elizabeth Berredge. I thought she did a great job of portraying the relationship between herself and Amadeus as sincere. During most of the movie, when their relationship seemed to be teetering on the edge of destruction, they continued to have a deep understanding of one another. I especially felt as though I could relate to her character, because it was realistic. Often times in films, relationships are characterized as always having a happy ending. It was refreshing to see a role where the relationship between two people is so troubled and yet we sense a feeling of acceptance between them.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie I definitely would recommend it. It gives a new twist to the story of Mozart's life. It is certainly not boring and mundane, as some films about historical figures may be. It has dramatic parts and very funny parts which combine to create a movie that almost anyone (with taste!) would enjoy. ********* nine out of ten stars!!!! <br/><br/>""Looks and talent don't always go together, Katerina"" (Salieri speaking to Katerina, the woman he is attracted to about Mozart)"
"krcoe","9","1","2","19 May 2009"," A Genius in Music
","This film 'Amadeus' was not all about Mozart. It is actually about Salieri and his obsession with the great composer. But why this film is called 'Amadeus'? In fact the word Amadeus in Latin means 'Loved by God' which is Mozart's middle name. It is a perfect title because Mozart has so much talent that one would believe that he is loved by God so much.<br/><br/>When Salieri first wants to meet Mozart, he is looking for a sophisticated young man. Then he finally meets him, he thinks he is crude, rude, out spoken child. During the whole movie Salieri starts to question God and why he does not give him talent, but yet Mozart. Salieri wonders why God loves Mozart and gives him so much talent when he is such an ignorant man. <br/><br/>I loved the film and how Tom Hulce portrayed Mozart. He did a wonderful job and was so out there. I believed him and really thought I was in that time era. Also the music was fantastic and so dramatic that it added to the movie greatly. The setting was amazing and the costumes were so detailed. I loved the fantasy hats!! F. Murray Abraham did an outstanding job at playing the role of Salieri. He did the perfect job at holding back the hate of Mozart, that you would in fact not think he was acting. It was a very inspirational film!!<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the film is that they did not get all the facts about Mozart correct. One of the things was that he had four kids and not just one. Also the fact that Salieri was not much older than Mozart, but in the film was portrayed a lot older. There wasn't much that I did not like. What I did not like about Salieri is he was a very grumpy man. And the fact that he hated Mozart but was yet there for him. Mozart was a fascinating character and a little crazy. maybe a little too crazy. Again Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham did amazing jobs on playing the roles of these two characters. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is inspirational and captivating. The music that Mozart writes in this film is amazing and wonderful on the ears. It is a true story of jealousy and love. I would recommend everyone to see this movie if you like music. I rate this film 9 stars out of 10!!! Word Count: 414"
"lifetimejuli","9","1","2","19 May 2009"," Jealousy of the musical notes
","This drama film "" Amadeus"" is beautifully made, when it comes to costumes, huge wigs and the music. I had nothing more to say than ""WOW!"". Mozart's life is presented in such a dramatic, interesting way, that it makes one hunger for knowing more and more of this genius musician life. But the movie is not a mirror image of his life. When I read his biography I got to the conclusion that the movie is much more entertaining. The film presents Mozart with a playful, weird kind of funny laugh and the personality of a child with a lack of manners that cares greatly about his music. He married and had a child in the movie, but actually, he was a father of four in real life. One of my favorite performance on the movie is the one done by Abroham in the role of Salieri, this strange and obscure actor really does a great job when it comes to explaining his feeling of jealousy and his plan of vengeance against God for denying him the talent that Mozart possess. Salieri always asked God to make of him the greatest musician because of his love for music. But, God denied him that talent and gave it to Mozart. Consequently, Salieri created a plan to steal Mozart work and finish with his life. In the other hand, the film present Tom Hulce in the role of Mozart, a character of poor, immature personality, not much of a talker for being the principal character. He will keep one entertained with his comical laughs, sharp movement during the operas presentation, and finally the deterioration of his health and weaken of his character through the films. Over all, The Producers of these films made the films much more entertaining for the audience by taking you back in time with the elaborate costumes, fashionable wigs, Mozart 's music, and the humorous scenes performed by Wolfy. Definitely, a movie to watch."
"Teaterk","10","1","2","19 May 2009"," Rocked by Amadeus!
","While not completely historically accurate, ""Amadeus"", gives a glimpse into the life and death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The story is told in first person by Antonio Salieri, a popular court composer for the Emperor of the Austrian/ Hungarian Empire at the time. Salieri begins his story as a confession to the death of Mozart to a local priest many years after the fact.<br/><br/>Salieri, portrayed by F. Murray Abroham, recalls his initial meeting of Mozart and how he could not believe that someone of such great musical genius could be so immature. A man of God, Salieri, could not believe that the God would make his chosen child such an ignorant buffoon. The plot thickens as jealousy enrages inside of Salieri for Mozart's incredible talents, and his inability to match them.<br/><br/>I believe the acting by both the lead roles in this film were top notch. Tom Hulce and F. Murry Abroham did an excellent job portraying men that no living generation ever new. The comic relief added to keep the film light I think was an ingenious move, Mozart's laugh, while no one really knows what it sounded like, kept the movie light and not as dramatic as it could have been. The music in this film I think just added to the film, I not only enjoyed the fact that they used actual Mozart compositions, but also that they used the perfect selections at the best points in the film. When the movie was dark and somber they chose a piece that reflected the same, when the film was light and playful the music reflected the mood.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the acting of both leading roles, I believe that Tom Hulce should have at least attempted a German accent as that is where Mozart was from. An American accent only made the movie seem less realistic. While the film's historically inaccuracies added to the drama of this film I would have enjoyed a little bit more accurate portrayal of Mozart's life. He had four children, in the movie they only depict that he had one. Also, Salieri in his own was extremely famous for his time, as was probably more famous than Mozart, at the time. The jealously that is described on screen was most likely never present. Overall, this film is a must see. While most people know the name Mozart, not many know the tragic, short life he lived. This movie does a fantastic job at portraying what kind of man Wolfgang Mozart was and what a musical genius he still is. I would defiantly give this movie 10 stars, the captivating acting in this film by Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abroham make up for the minor historical inaccuracies."
"profdrsutter","9","1","2","14 May 2009"," A Cinema Gem
","Amadeus is a masterpiece for several reasons: the costumes, the music and the creative use of flashbacks (and the odd flash-forward)to name just three.<br/><br/>It is often faulted for taking liberty with historical facts; Saliari was only 6 years older than Mozart, and Mozart trusted him with tutoring his own children in music! The two may have been at odds at times (Saliari was after all Mozart's ""boss"") but this was perhaps a bit overplayed to deepen the plot. For example, Beethoven and Haydn had several personality differences (but who didn't fight with Beethoven at some point?!!!)but the musical world is filled with such events. I find it more likely that Mozart's frail constitution and lifestyle did him in...Oh, and Mozart had another living child at the time of his death...not shown in the film...<br/><br/>I found the second half of the film a ""downer"" as Mozart went into decline, and the film missed a great opportunity to spook the audience with Mozart's involvement in Freemasonry (chilling ceremonies) and how this association related to ""The Magic Flute"".<br/><br/>Rock Me Saliari<br/><br/>Amadeus ended by turning the intended target, Saliari, from villain to star both on the screen and in reality. Although great liberties were taken with the history of music, at least the costumes and mannerisms of the period were introduced to a new generation, a testament to the enduring quality of Mozart's music. The silly thread of jokes and pratfalls saved the film from the serious threat of dryness that plagues many overly-serious productions. The anti-Saliari plot is paper thin; Mozart's self-destructive lifestyle and frail constitution did him in! Abraham deserved the Oscar, but it was sad to see Hulce go empty-handed; both performances carried the film to new heights. I rate it 9 out of ten for overall effect; it transported you into a different world for a few hours, which is what good cinema should do. Highly effective entertainment/education!"

","This film might not be the most historically accurate of all times. We might never know if these things did or didn't occur. But this movie is great nonetheless. I can't remember watching a film as dramatic as this one. Although a little too long, it's still very good and manages to catch our attention.<br/><br/>The story is told by Salieri. He was already a composer by the time Mozart was born. Nevertheless, his work wasn't as popular as the latter's work. That obviously brings envy. And that is the main idea about this film. As we see Mozart in his last ten years (All his work and progress) we also see how Salieri's fascination and admiration turns into hate. With incredible performances by the main characters, this movie shows us the nature of men. How far are we willing to go when we envy someone? A masterpiece that must not be overlooked. Although this movie is not meant for everyone, it's still one of the best movies of all times"

","Why do we watch movies; Some of us watch them to have a little fun off our daily hectic lives, others watch them to learn something in history,music and art..Amadeus does both.<br/><br/>Either you are a fan of Music Genre or not, It is an equally mesmerizing experience.There are only few instances when a great work of literature is transformed into a great movie, this is one of them.Peter Shaffer did a great job in converting a great play into the greatest ever screenplay.These ingredients were wonderfully cooked into a delight by Milos Forman.This movie could have become a wreck if direction,costumes and cinematography would be a little flawed but Forman takes you into Mozart's time and 16th century Vienna within a minute.The costumes,sets,Make up and attire all is perfectly portrayed.When you feel the essence, the magical narration takes you on a ride you will never forget for days after watching this classic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mozart's music lifts the movie to staggering heights but the story telling is so light and tense simultaneously that it takes many viewings before you individually praise expertise in every aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>It has been a great debate which of TOM HULCE or MURRAY ABRAHAM (who won best actor Oscar for his role) were better as both were equally perfect as MOZART & SALIERI respectively but strictly speaking no one can decide.It is rarest of those acting treats when you see not one but 2 actors reaching perfection in art of acting.The rivalry, the childish nature and energetic humor of MOZART and contrasting cold/calm jealousy of SALIERI look so natural and spontaneous that you never can decidedly say who over powered whom.<br/><br/>Many people have criticized the play and the movie for historical inaccuracies but if you read further research into Mozart and Salieri, now we know its not so inaccurate.But even if it is a little,who cares.The movie makes you aware of music of MOZART and gives a great lesson of mediocrity.Not all of us are talented to be world renown,even if we have resources,talent is born within,it cannot be stopped by power nor can it be created in an Emperors palace.This message is conveyed through Salieri and Mozart's story to us to learn and think about it.<br/><br/>There is an interesting twist at the very end which I won't explain but it does best to put an icing on an already very sweet cake.This movie won 8 Oscars and I think no movie ever deserved better.And the lately released Director's Cut makes it a MUST keep for movie library of everyone who is fan of entertainment,music and drama."
"kyle-cruse","10","1","2","4 December 2008"," What a great film
","There simply aren't enough good things to be said about ""Amadeus."" This is an Oscar-winning Best Picture that truly lives up to its reputation, and is a personal favorite as much as a critical one. This film is full of fascinating (and funny) scenes, one of my favorites being Mozart (Tom Hulce) playing Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham) piece from memory after hearing it once and criticizing it somewhat unintentionally. An example of how great the film-making in this movie is involves the scene where Salieri helps Motzart finish his composition as he lies in bed dying. What Salieri learns from this is simply amazing, and it doesn't deserve to be spoiled here. The film is masterfully told in flashback, as Salieri reports the story as an old man in a confession to a priest. The film is not really a true-to-life biography of Motzart's life, and many of the interesting little facts, as well as the whole plot element of Salieri conspiring against Motzart, are more or less implied, speculated, or just plain made up. That's not the point, however. The film takes a true story that would ordinarily bore audiences and turns it into a movie that is highly entertaining, funny, and remarkable. I'm sure many people can relate to Salieri and what he must feel, knowing that in real life, there is always someone better than us. This Oscar-winning role makes the character of Salieri completely believable, allowing us to feel the envy that grows throughout the film and the redemption he feels toward the end. The only drawbacks to this movie are the mediocre acting jobs done by a few of the supporting characters, such as Motzart's wife, which don't really fit with the great acting done by the lead characters. Nevertheless, this does not ruin the movie by any means. This is highly recommended, even to those who don't tend to like biography or history films. Almost perfect.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"
"diac228","10","1","2","30 September 2008"," The best movie of 1984. Among the best films of the 80s. Among the best films of all-time.
","While 1984 box-office-wise was dominated by Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, there is one film that rises above them all in terms of quality by miles upon miles. Amadeus is an excellent and superbly-crafted film that is most likely the greatest stage-to-film translation in the history of film-making. Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul. The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.<br/><br/>Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears onmusic that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.<br/><br/>The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing ""One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest,"" is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the ""Requiem"" scene towards the end.<br/><br/>In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus: One of the shining gems of the 1980s.<br/><br/>P.S. Someone come up with a great Beethoven movie, please, he deserves it."

","I absolutely adore classical music, and Mozart has always drawn me in. I had done the ""cute little book report"" on his biography for seventh grade, deeming him as a genius and giant of his day. One of those big, stuffy composers seated under a wig and a dim light at his piano, ""taking dictation from God."" This film warps that entire image.<br/><br/>My father, too, is big on classical (Masters degree on the piano), and he warned me that this is NOT what the real Mozart was like. More like a Hollywood-ized version of him. Well, authentic or not, this film is hilarious and brilliant, and I would prefer to think that old Wolfgang knew how to let his ""hair hang down"" and giggle in that maniacal way that Tom Hulce seems to enjoy doing over and over in the film.<br/><br/>Never thought I would laugh during a movie about Mozart. Never thought I would care about him beyond his music...or be moved by his personal defeats and triumphs.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham is astonishing. He plays Mozart's jealous-ridden rival, constantly at a war among envy, rage, and reluctant but inevitable admiration for so phenomenal a musician.<br/><br/>This movie is a favorite.

Any and all people interested in the craft, whether as an actor themselves or as a spectator, should see this film for both F. Murray Abraham's beautifully tragic Salieri and Tom Hulce's fascinating Mozart. Both give their all with these roles and it SHOWS. In addition to the brilliant acting, the movie sports a fantastic script that prods deeply into one of the great fears of any artist: fear of mediocrity, of possessing the desire to express one's self but not the talent. An incredible drama. And, yes, an incredible soundtrack as well."
"classicalsteve","10","1","2","25 July 2008"," Amadeus Made Classical Music Hot--Based on One of the Great Rumors of Music History
","In recent decades, classical music has lost much of its appeal in the United States. Its reputation among young people is that it is stodgy, high-brow, and boring. But in the midst of this perceived dormancy, Paul Shaffer and Milos Forman decided on another tactic: using the power of cinema to release the power, drama and excitement of classical music. Their answer was AMADEUS, a semi-fictionalized account of the opera scene in Vienna, Austria, during the late 18th century. Although many of the finer details are fictional, the film captures a larger historical picture of the exhilarating atmosphere of the late 18th-century. At the time, the arts were climbing toward a pinnacle in Europe, and Amadeus shows how music played an unrivaled role in high culture. <br/><br/>At the center of the film are two historical figures who were the most dominant musicians in Vienna in the late 1700's: Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The former was possibly the most popular, the most financially successful, and the most beloved composer of his day. He held the highest positions in music, including the coveted Imperial Kappellmeister, which he held for 36 years. And now most of his accomplishments and compositions are all but forgotten outside of musicological circles. The latter figure was ill-mannered and childish--an alcoholic and a spend thrift. He received only modicum pay for mediocre posts, never attaining the kind of notoriety in his lifetime as Salieri. And he died at the young age of 35. And yet his half-dozen or so operas along with many of his symphonies, concertos, masses, and chamber works are now regarded as some of the greatest music ever composed. His name has become synonymous with music itself, along with Beethoven and Bach.<br/><br/>The play and movie by Schaffer is based on a few sources: a smaller work called ""Mozart and Salieri"" by Alexander Pushkin, the memoirs by Da Ponte, who wrote several Mozart librettos, and a strange legend passed down in musical circles. The legend says that Salieri confessed to Beethoven that he had in fact murdered Mozart.(Beethoven moved to Vienna the year following Mozart's death in 1791 and studied under Haydn and then under Salieri.) There is much dispute among musicologists concerning the validity of the legend, as well as the relationship between Salieri and Mozart. There is evidence that Salieri and Mozart collaborated on several projects. Simultaneously, there were intense rivalries between composers at the time, each trying to win royal favor which would turn into financial support for future projects.<br/><br/>Although the legitimacy of this legend has never been substantiated, the movie is a drama characterizing Salieri as a musician who recognizes and becomes jealous of the genius of Mozart. He blames God that he was denied the talent bequeathed on a much lower order of primate, mainly Mozart. Salieri then tries to thwart Mozart's career, fearing that Mozart's genius will eclipse his own reputation. And then, Salieri conceives a hideous plan...<br/><br/>The entire film is a confessional flashback in which the older Salieri, played with superb subtlety by F. Murray Abraham in an Oscar-winning performance, tells the story of the decade in which he and Mozart premiered their operas in Vienna in the 1780's. His confession is to a priest after a failed suicide attempt, presumably because of his guilt surrounding the death of Mozart. Unlike the coolly refined Salieri, Mozart, played by Tom Hulce in an Oscar-caliber performance, is a giggling undisciplined adolescent who avoids most of his responsibilities, except for his music. But the fact of Mozart's undisciplined attitude toward his life only infuriates Salieri all the more.<br/><br/>As much as the characters, the other star of the show is the music. Amadeus chronicles several of Mozart's most important operas, including The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute. The highlights of the operas alone are well worth the price of admission. There are even moments explaining how Mozart wrote music in which it seems music ""came"" to him, almost dream-like, and he would write it down as if he was taking dictation. And the film also includes a couple of compositions by Salieri.<br/><br/>The movie is an absolute triumph of cinema, combining all the best elements of a bygone era: the costumes, the architecture, the sets, the characters, and the music. As a side-note, the film was shot in Prague where several Mozart operas, particularly Don Giovanni and the Marriage of Figaro were huge triumphs. There has never been a better movie about classical music, but I hope there will be one to at least equal the spectacle that is Amadeus."

Amadeus is beautiful, dramatic and well-built movie. It is not an alternative for ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Look who is talking now"", other category, other time to see. This movie is to choose if you are in the mood to ""truly see a picture"", not just switch-off. I do advice Amadeus if you want to have a movie-evening with a loved one (and really going for the movie, not something else ;) ). This movie has a great soundtrack, and not just because ""it's Mozart"", but it is been preformed astonishingly, I bought a new sound-system after seeing this film, to watch it again. One who knows the life of Mozart might - and will - find mistakes or uncertainties in factuality, but the way this movie just goes on, the way the characters are well built, makes you think ""I'll just check that part later, right now I just don't care; let me enjoy this fantastic movie""."

"blanche-2","10","1","2","29 May 2008"," Beloved of God
","To be born with the love of music and with great ambition and yet have a mediocre talent; to hate passionately one with clearly a heavenly gift - that is the story of Amadeus. Directed by Milos Forman and starring F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Roy Dotrice, Elizabeth Berridge, Jeffrey Jones and Christine Ebersole, this 1984 film is sumptuously produced and made in Prague, certainly one of the most glorious cities in the world.<br/><br/>Amadeus is based on a play by Peter Shaeffer and gets its roots from a Rimsky-Korsakov opera. It is the highly fictionalized story of Wolfgang Mozart and another composer of the time, Salieri, who was jealous of Mozart's talent and vowed to bring him down. In reality, the two men were colleagues, and the story is really a what-if. However, as a friend of mine returning from a concert where Salieri's music was performed said, ""By the way, I can believe Salieri killed Mozart, if this was the best he could come up with."" It certainly would be amazing if other composers alive during that period were not aware of the child prodigy and his prolific compositions. It would be more amazing if they weren't just a little jealous.<br/><br/>The story is told by the institutionalized Salieri (Abraham) to a priest, and we see Mozart (Tom Hulce) from his point of view: as an eccentric, lascivious, ill-behaved young man whose behavior belies his great talent. Salieri attempts to ruin Mozart, even using the influence Mozart's own late father had over him by disguising himself in a huge black cloak as Mozart Sr. wore and commissioning Mozart to write a Requiem.<br/><br/>The performances are exquisite, and one can really feel Salieri's pain as exhibited brilliantly by F. Murray Abraham. One empathizes with his anger toward, jealousy of and contradictory admiration for Mozart. Mozart himself is depicted as an idiot on whom musical talent was randomly bestowed. Tom Hulce's laugh as Mozart is unforgettable, as is his chasing Constanze, who became his wife, under a piano. As the film goes on, much of this wild behavior grows less, and the audience is permitted to see Mozart the genius, with a million notes in his head, dictating from his sick bed, and soberly conducting his music.<br/><br/>The real star of Amadeus is the music, lushly performed, the vocal music ranging from his simple Caro Mio Bene to Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute and the orchestral from symphonies, concertos, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and, of course, his Requiem.<br/><br/>Amadeus is a feast for the eyes and a thrill for the ears. It is a thought-provoking film about genius, mediocrity and immortality."
"jdkraus","10","1","2","6 May 2008"," A Marvelous Motion Picture!
","I never knew much about Mozart, just only his music. Despite the inaccuracies I have heard about this movie, it sheds a unique and brilliant light upon the man. Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart. He's clever, ingenious, funny, eccentric, and even naughty. I'm very surprised that he did not get the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>F Murray Arahams is great in his role as a selfish, envious, competitive, and career driven colleague of Mozart, but I did not find him to be as believable as Hulce. Neither were well-known actors back in Amadeus's release, but it is fair that one of them won. On a side note, I think this movie would not have been good if it had a well-known Hollywood cast.<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman, famous for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", captures the film astonishingly, specifically with the opera sequences that pan back and forth between Mozart conducting and the actors on the stage performing. In addition with the opera sequences, the art direction, costume design, and the work of the cinematography is exquisite to the point that I felt like I was seeing Mozart conducting in the 1700s.<br/><br/>This movie has it all. The Man. The Music. The Madness. The Magic. Marvelous! The Oscars were right on what this film earned. 10/10"
"inviolet_now","10","1","2","26 April 2008"," Amadeus...worthy of its recognition
","Just recently, I have seen this impressive film, and the only words that I could say to describe it are...wonderfully tragic. The film tells the story of a regretful and bitter Antonio Salieri (portrayed by F. Murray Abraham), a man who only wanted to perform music for the joy of it, and to garner critical recognition for his work. Intertwining with Salieri's life, however, is the vulgar, arrogant and vain Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (portrayed by Tom Hulce), in which lies an amazing musical genius beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>As Salieri envies Mozart's musical talent despite his absurd lifestyle (""I am a vulgar man, Your Majesty, but I assure you...my music is not""), he conspires to bring about his rival's ultimate downfall with a plot of murder and plagiarism (claiming Mozart's greatest work, the Requiem Mass in D Minor, as his own). However...God instead destroys his greatest instrument to torture Salieri for the rest of his days. In the end, however...Mozart gets the last laugh, literally. Just before the credits roll, the triumphant voice of Mozart laughing echoes across the ages as ""the patron saint of mediocrity"" smiles.<br/><br/>The only thing about this film that unsettled me was the fact that they didn't bury Mozart in a pauper's grave as they did historically; instead, they dumped him in a mass grave to rot. However, I guess for a man of Mozart's genius and vulgarity, it serves as a form of poetic justice for Salieri...God's instrument of musical genius is laid to rest in a grave fit for Black Plague carriers.<br/><br/>Despite that...Amadeus is a true work of art. Those who cannot see it need to look in the mirror, watch the film again and then, hopefully they'll be able to see it."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","17 April 2008"," A solid period piece
","This movie tells the story of Mozart through the eyes of his rival Salieri. It is a sumptuous period piece that is one of the better films of the eighties (though that is faint praise).<br/><br/>Milos Forman's direction perfectly captures the grandiose, larger than life figure of Mozart. Equal strength is shown in representing intimate encounters and grand performances. Thanks to the efforts of the behind-the-scenes crew the film effortlessly transports us to 18th century Vienna. It's no surprise to note that the film won Oscars for Set Decoration & Costumes. Presumably, the fact that the film's score wasn't nominated for an Oscar must have been related to the fact that it was all previously composed. Had it not been, the score would certainly have increased the film's Oscar count to nine.<br/><br/>One of the film's eight Oscars belongs to F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri. His was an excellent performance, certainly worthy of the accolades that it garnered. The other performances are good though it's a bit odd to see Larry 'Pinto' Kroger from ""Animal House"" as Mozart. Kind of like if Jason Biggs (of ""American Pie"" fame) were to play Bach.<br/><br/>If there's one area that I think could use improvement it's the script. The film is a little long and tends to drag a bit, particularly if you're not much of a fan of opera. The personal stories are fairly satisfying though I felt that there was some indefinable 'spark' missing that would've propelled the plot into greatness.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles aside, the movie earns high marks for its excellent production values and memorable performances."
"Rufus-T","10","1","2","30 August 2007"," Celebration of art at the highest level
","Those Salier's description of Mozarts' music, it was a blissful moment for me as I was glad I saw this movie in the cinema. I had mild interest in classical music until this movie showed me the great appreciation. I hated Opera until this movie came along. What about the setting? So beautiful. Each scene is like a painting itself. One very haunting and sad yet beautiful scene at the same time I thought was a transition from Leopold crumbling of the letter to the scrambling frighten deers.<br/><br/>Abraham & Hulce gave those two musicians forceful identities. Abraham's performance is so passionate. Though I haven't seen the play, I doubt anyone can imitate Hulce's laugh so wickedly. Wonderful direction was done by Milos Forman. Peter Schaffer's writing is purely great theater, mixed with comedy and great imagination. Who cares if much of it is fiction. Also kudos needs to be given to the stage choreography Twyla Tharp who is known in the Broadway world.<br/><br/>The only drawback was that I was so spoiled by the near perfection of the theatrical version, I became so nitpick on the editing in the director's cut. I felt a bliss just thinking about the movie. I know it had a great influence on many people. It was a shame that AFI dropped it off the recently revamped top 100 movies list. Nevertheless, Amadeus is a celebration of art in film at the highest level."
"jackalchow","8","1","2","29 August 2007"," Life as a drama
","The historical record showed no supports for the murder of Mozart by Salieri. The addition of dramatic elements always make the artistic goods more controversial but tremendous. There should be a less implication without them.<br/><br/>The adaptation of a noted musician raised 3 aspects as Humanity, Society and Ethical (or Philosophy) respectively. After the completion of narration, the ending appeared as various subjective views of Salieri, showing the non-talents kept alive, but did nothing in their survival. This implication about the long lasting but meaningless live is a critical master mind in this movie.<br/><br/>Before the discussion of philosophical argument, just see the most apparent human nature first. The 2 main characters: Amadeus and Salieri, reflected the human weakness of arrogance, jealously and avarice respectively. It seems that a tragedy was a must when 2 genius met but possessing an extreme opposite personality. However, there was no point that Salieri to destroy Amadeus completely who started losing his flash and becoming a frustrating live. Salieri should not been jealous anymore after the Emperor Joseph II have felt bored of Mozart's creations (loving fresh is also an ugliness of human being). His persistence to kill Mozart was that he needed himself to be unique in the field of music; title about ""the best"" was so powerful for us to ignore all morality. <br/><br/>For social issue, an inevitable concern about money for Mozart's family was encountered. Constanze played an incredible role of the supporting women behind a successful/strange man. The only thing which she couldn't stand on the same side of her husband was economical issue. Some stuff jobs were still to be accepted even Mozart was unwilling to do it. Anyway, Constanze had made the most appropriate balance between ideal and realistic world. On the other hand, the conflict between political views with artistic idealism was much stronger and hard to be comprised. Joseph II couldn't endure the trend of his territory being dominated by aesthetic and art, instead of the ideology created by his' government. The trend of the society should be led by the utilitarianism. Joseph decided to sacrifice the unique artistic innovation made by Amadeus; even he regarded himself as full of passion in art and culture.<br/><br/>This movie tries to let audience realize that taking revenge was equal to demolish ourselves, like the destiny of Salieri: killing his musical talent, confidence and live meaning. What he did so much and spend just get nothing at the end (an idea of Nihilism). On the contrary, Amadeus was dead in peace with a beautiful trap held by Salleri (as Amadeus still believed that Salieri was his soul mate, he would be dead in upset and anger if he found the truth). <br/><br/>In the view of religion, was believed in God get the permanent flash? Salieri rejected him and spent for the rest of his live as a fool. If he trusted him, why does a temptations of various kinds of desire be granted to him, so as to let him suffered from it, and finally let him (even all human) have a chance to leave God's embrace. It seems to be a joke with extreme paradox: Is it possible for us with totally pure heart while taking active role for world contribution? If yes, desire is a must (but chasing it cause serious tragedy). If vice versa, it seems that escaping form sin is the only mission for human. Is such kind of live meaningful and funny? So passive!<br/><br/>Finally, some production style is interesting in the film. First, the handling of the scene of live operas was standardized with 2 kinds of shooting view: wide shot for the whole stage performance, while using close-up/middle shots for specific audience. Such arrangement clearly showed the dignity of the opera scene, and the feeling of different characters (especially for Salieri and Joseph). The low angle shooting of Mozart monitoring the orchestra, together the real soundtrack of him, also expressed the imposing art very much."
"marcin_kukuczka","8","1","2","25 February 2007"," What sublimity, what depth, what passion in the music! How about the movie...?
","Biopics, either of artists or of popular historic figures, usually tend towards chronology. And what results is lack of creativity. This, however, cannot be said about AMADEUS by Milos Forman since it's a movie built upon flashbacks, being at the same time, not exactly a biopic of Mozart (as the title should suggest). So then about whom? <br/><br/>After the first 10 minutes of the film, a viewer may get an impression that the leading character is the composer Antonio Salieri. Yet, later, you realize that it's neither Salieri's biopic but rather an insight into his mind tortured by the ""Voice of God"" he met in count Colloredo's palace and which haunted him throughout the whole of his life. Milos Forman's AMADEUS, based on Peter Shaffer's work, is a universal film about rivalry, jealousy, emotions, dreams, revenge, and confession...something that we experience in our lives. What happens together with the characters is just a background, a shadow of past memories. It is only a look at Mozart, probably the most famous and the best classical composer of all time. All from the point of view of his ""admirer"" but ""envious enemy"" - Antonio Salieri.<br/><br/>This aspect of the film makes it an extremely interesting movie, not so much from the historical point of view but from the psychological one, since we are supplied with controversial side of human nature, with Salieri's contradictory life of innate emotions and feelings. Therefore, most viewers will probably identify with him though not necessarily liking him that much. He tells a priest his life story, the life that was in the absolute shadow of his rival. He deeply analyzes Mozart's music in anger and admiration. But this makes it very emotional and vivid. Yet, the problem is with Mozart. Here lies the entire gist? Is he presented objectively, faithfully as he really was or is it all a travesty as some critics call AMADEUS? In my opinion, it is just tremendously difficult to give an answer to this question at once. The director left it to all of us. Do you like Mozart from this movie? Would you feel the same as Salieri felt being let down before the emperor for the composition? Truly, Mozart is the genius of music, he is the one whose music resembles a perfect harmony. No single note has been changed here. I can't imagine being it otherwise. Mozart was ""a masterpiece of composer""; yet, in the movie, he does not appear to be ""a masterpiece of man."" He is sometimes ridiculous when laughing out loud like a monkey and sometimes even appears to be vulgar (consider the moment: say it backwards). That must be a travesty but that certainly is not what Mozart was really like. That is what Salieri thought of him, how he personally perceived Mozart.<br/><br/>The movie, besides the aspect of an interesting content, is truly artistic. I think that it is the factor which makes so many people love it. It's throughout a pearl of visual beauty. There are really powerful scenes which stand out in gentleness of picture, harmony of colors and splendor of decorations. In the background, we get the music, the marvelous pieces of the immortal composer. For instance, pay attention to the final sequence when Mozart is composing REQUIEM. What appears in the atmosphere is mourning, fear, but at the same time what bursts out is the pure genius and trance of an uplifted state of mind. It's truly a tribute to the immortal genius of magnificence.<br/><br/>The performances are good; however they are left to two main characters mostly. F Murray Abraham is a perfect choice for Salieri. He is remarkable in expressing two personalities within one character. Young Salieri striving for success and still full of dreams in spite of being ""kicked"" by life and old disappointed Salieri already killed by jealousy and poisoned by past memories. Tom Hulce... with him the problem is as I mentioned before. Is he an appealing Mozart? He does a good job as a wonderful actor but it stays at controversy if he is accurate in the role. But acting is indeed mesmerizing! The best scene is, I think, Mozart composing CONFUTATIS from REQUIEM and dictating the notes to Salieri. I will never forget the power of this moment. One of the very best scenes of cinema!<br/><br/>Finally, I have to address the most important theme of the movie but at the same time very controversial. It is an aspect which does not fit people's tastes very often or even sometimes offends them. The movie seems to present human complaints to God. Salieri considers Mozart ""Ama Deus"" (beloved by God) and wants to defeat him, first defeat Mozart but, meanwhile, defeat God. He is angry with God for not having listened to his prayer ""Lord make me famous..."" He is angry with God because he has used Mozart for celebrating His Glory through music. Yet, there is nothing Salieri can do. This aspect is presented through a number of controversial, sometimes even shocking scenes like burning a crucifix or the final moment when Salieri calls the priest together with patients of the hospital ""mediocrities of the world"". By quarreling with a priest, he quarrels with God. The end of the movie seems to prove that even more strongly: Salieri fights with God and, symbolically, does not show submission to His Will. ""I will speak for all mediocrities"" being their ""patron saint."" and the one who absolves them all. Hidden meanings left to single individuals and their interpretations; perhaps confusing at certain moments but truly clever...<br/><br/>In conclusion, AMADEUS is definitely is a true classic, a very interesting film about the marvel of human talent. It has much to offer to viewers who love ambitious cinema. Although there certainly isn't such sublimity, depth and passion in the film as there is in Mozart's music, AMADEUS is truly worth seeing. 8/10"

He respects Mozart, but he secretly pretends to kill Mozart. The fact of Mozart's death is various;assassination, disease, and so on. This is based on the assassination. It describes Salieri's evil mind which is not satisfy. The actor 'Mozart' was great. The son who is tied by his father. He actually this expression as a madness and Mozart's fall down. The movie expressed Salieri's madness and Mozart's madness by using Mozart's music that Salieri admired. In this movie, Salieri cursed himself and God. In other words, it is about the Christian movie which teaches wrong faith for God. But, besides, there is more important thing to know. That is the many scenes which combinates well with musics. Maybe, it is the easiest to fit the music with scenes as if musician's life. Probably, it is the simplest way to describe director's expressions."
"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","31 July 2006"," Riveting and visually stunning biopic.
","The first time I heard of this movie was in an episode of The Simpsons. In one scene, Marge tells her kids about Mozart's life, only to be criticized by Lisa for using Milos Forman's Amadeus as a source, since said film supposedly contains few true things. That may be the case, but as long as Amadeus remains one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen, why should I care?<br/><br/>Amadeus is a beautiful film, which deservedly won the Best Picture and Director Oscars for 1984. Most of its genius is to be found in Milos Forman's ability not to be distracted by the vastness and splendor of the production design and the costumes and focus on the intriguing plot and well constructed characters.<br/><br/>This is obvious already in the beginning, which is one of the best ever filmed. We see a priest enter an asylum to speak to Antonio Salieri (Academy Award-winner F. Murray Abraham), once a famous composer, now a disgraced and abandoned madman. When the two meet, Salieri starts playing the piano to test the priest's musical knowledge. After two failed attempts, he finally finds something the churchman recognizes, as the latter eagerly says: ""Oh, that's charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote it"". Salieri's answer? ""I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang... Amadeus... Mozart..."". And so the story begins, told in flashback by the Italian composer.<br/><br/>Mozart himself doesn't actually appear until about 17 minutes into the film. In fact, the strings are constantly pulled by Salieri, who starts his narration by recalling his difficult childhood and his prayer to God that he be allowed to spread His will through music. Naturally, such a thing doesn't happen. That privilege is awarded to young Mozart (Tom Hulce), who's in Vienna to perform for the Emperor (Jeffrey Jones). Imagine Salieri's surprise when he discovers that such talent can be found in a kid. Imagine his total astonishment when he realizes the ""enfant prodige"" from Salzburg is in reality a foul-mouthed, rude womanizer. The shock is too much for the envious Italian who, despite recognizing and admiring the perfection and superiority of the rival's work, vows to destroy him by any means necessary.<br/><br/>The movie was shot almost entirely on location in Forman's home-town Prague, which perfectly captures the magic, but also the low points, of Mozart's life: from marvelous palaces and theaters to distasteful ""night-clubs"", Amadeus is a visual roller-coaster, never letting the eye rest amidst the settings of many fascinating (and shocking) events, events that form a haunting tale of jealousy and bitterness, masterfully incarnated by Abraham, a very talented actor who has sadly been confined to supporting parts ever since (his best post-Amadeus work? The Inquisitor in The Name of the Rose). Shame, because he has all the right qualities to carry an entire film. Also unjustly forgotten after this movie is Tom Hulce, who succeeds in making the great Austrian musician look like an annoying, occasionally drunk, constantly laughing (oh, that laughter is terrible) brat.<br/><br/>Few films, particularly biopics, manage to stay interesting for all their running time. Luckily Amadeus is such a film: at almost three hours, it's consistently captivating, inspired and inspiring."

","This is a beautifully made movie. I wasn't expecting a movie like this to be funny and powerful at the same time. F.Murray Abraham is excellent as Antonio salieri. You can truly understand how jealous he feels towards Mozart. Basically, Salieri is the top composer in vienna, but when Mozart comes along, he feels angry that Mozart has a much better gift for music than he. Salieri is then determined to destroy Mozart. The music used for the movie also plays a big part. There is also a lot to do with god as well. Salieri is angry at god for blessing Mozart(who is very big-headed and annoying) with such devine gifts that he so desperately wants for himself. Even though Salieri may sound like a bad person, you actually feel sorry for him. When he first meets Mozart, he tries his best to welcome him by writing a piece of music for him, but Mozart, not exactly meaning to, sort of critices Salieri's music for being repetitive, so makes his own changes to it.<br/><br/>So really this is a very powerful film with great performances from F. Murray Abraham and Tom hulas, who plays Mozart. You must see this."

But then someone is disturbed by something lying in the undescribable. Suddenly envy starts to take control. It seems to be the fate of the outstanding persons that they don't have much time left. The mediocres can't endure the outstanding and so they do everything to damage them. It's as Mr. Tyrell says to Roy Batty : ""A candle that burns twice as bright, burns half as long."" And Mozart burned the whole musical universe in his 35 Years. It is important that this film shows Mozart's genius and that his music is still an immortal touch to heaven. I heard that Salieri is underrated as a composer and don't believe that he envied Mozart so much. But to me that's not important. It's a movie (and what a wonderful one). It shows (as Mozart's music) something beyond small-mindedness. A general statement of human psyche. And how the film shows it. Every second is something special. We come to see the heartbreaking downfall of a real gift to mankind and as Salieri is revited to Don Giovanni we have to witness every moment of it. In a sad way it's wonderful. Ah, yes; F. Murray Abraham is brilliant (and got an Oscar, right so), the same with Tom Hulce and the rest of the actors. Here everything is brilliant.

Any learned music scholar will tell you that Salieri never killed Mozart nor was insanely jealous the way he is in this movie. Mozart is portrayed as a flamboyant man-child, an excessive hedonist and a vulgar, smart-aleck rebel. He may not have been this wild in real life. He did in fact drink and party too much and his alcohol problem gave way to his liver complications which resulted in death. His musical genius is never in question, though and that part is at least accurate. Emperor Joseph (played by Jeffrey Jones) was indeed a great patron of his music. Small-theater manager Emmanuel Schikaneder (played by Simon Callow) was a friend of Mozart and collaborated in the production of ""The Magic Flute"", even acting and singing the part of Papageno, as shown in the film. There are some truths to the film concerning Mozart's childhood and his constant hand-to-mouth lifestyle and the fact his father Leopold never approved of him as an adult. There are genuine moments of humor and brilliant screen writing, such as the scene in which his wife Constanza shows Salieri a sample of Mozart's music, and Salieri is in awe at the music. Other great scenes include Salieri burning a cross and giving up his Catholic faith, believing God has abandoned him, a dying Mozart composing the Requiem with the help of Salieri, who is only there to see he dies. The opening scene, in which Salieri attempts suicide, is also quite powerful, and opens the film rather well. Salieri's final monologue at the asylum, in which he proclaims himself the patron saint of mediocrities everywhere is also poignant. Pathetic he is, but somehow it's rather sad to see him fall to pieces that way. The music is what makes this film especially good, at least for me. The soundtrack is unbeatable, full of a plethora of Mozart's piano concerti, operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Magic Flute) chamber works and of course the final piece - the Requiem. The movie is rather dark in that Salieri seems to give up his humanity for the sake of extracting revenge, consumed by jealousy and envy of a man he felt superior to him musically. This is a well-made DRAMA, but not a history lesson in music. But as a drama, one must admit it's wonderful. I, for one, was on the side of Mozart, Constanza and their son, and absolutely disliked the stuffy, snobbish Court at Vienna. The late 18th century period, from horse-drawn carriages, to the way operas were performed, to the interior of the homes, is all remarkably real. It remains a great film and justly deserved its Oscar."

","It had been a few years since I had seen this picture, but a sudden longing to learn to play piano, a sudden need to listen to Beethoven, Chopin, Bach, and Mozart, lead me to dig through my dusty VHS tapes and to bring out a film I thought I would never watch again: Amadeus.<br/><br/>I could not believe how quickly I was to forget such greatness of film making. At a little over two and a half hours long, there is not a minute that goes by where I am left feeling bored, uneasy, or figgity. On the contrary, the absolutely marvelous acting, dialogue, sets, and scope of this film made me realize that it had been quite some time since I had seen a film of this magnitude grace theatre screens in a while.<br/><br/>F Murray Abraham is a revolutionary actor in his role as Salieri, a man who only wished to devote his love for God through music. So grand was this love and lust for music that he prayed earnestly for the opportunity to show his love for life by music. Yet, even from a young age, Salieri had been one upped by child prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one he would come to love, admire, hate, and loathe throughout his life. I could not keep my eyes away from Abraham. He is able to carry such scenes with laughter, mockery, jealousy, contempt, all together in a scene. As a viewer of this madness, one can't help but feel conflicting emotions of hate and happiness for this man who only wanted to show his love for God. And to have it mocked by Mozart, a young, arrogant, and supremely talented man seem like a slap to the face of Salieri. Abraham fully deserved his Oscar win for this performance, which is quite possibly one of the best in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>What I find the most admirable of Amadeus is the tone of the film. It is not a film about the tortured soul of a boy wonder musician, but one of childlike play. Mozart is portrayed as a young man who knows he's a great musician, yet does not know his words of confidence mock the work of musicians who pale in comparison to his. Tom Hulce, in a role he has embodied and will be remembered for, was able to, in the course of a few hours, bring Mozart from the cocky, self absorbed young man to a man struck by the tragic loss of his father, and large debts. That laugh, even thinking about it brings a smile to my face.<br/><br/>Milos Foreman did amazing work in the production of this film. His use of telling Mozart's story is a series of flashbacks was amazing to say the least. The sets and extravagant and true. I especially loved how Foreman handled the opera scenes scattered throughout the film. Music fills the screen, with Salieri's interpretations of Mozart's music for better understanding of the operas themselves. Watch how Foreman edits these sequences. It amazes me to no end.<br/><br/>And, of course, the music. It is as Salieri says throughout the entire film, music embodies Mozart in ways you never though possible. Lovers of classical pieces will be brought to tears hearing these beautiful sounds, while non lovers can at least admire the influence Mozart has had on composers who came after him.<br/><br/>Amadeus is one of the greatest films to come out of the 1980's, one filled with a grand scope of imagery, score, music, sublime characters, powerful direction, and perfect dialogue. It is my wish to someday see this magnificent piece of film making as it was intended to be seen: on the big screen, surround sound blaring. It is a film that may never leave you.<br/><br/>HIGHLY Recommended."

","Milos Forman directs this enticingly unique Oscar-winning biopic derived from Peter Shaffer's profitable play. AMADEUS focuses on a composer, Antonio Sarelli whose music rarely outranks mediocrity and his envy toward juvenile genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.<br/><br/>The story is told entirely in flashback with an elderly Sarelli (F. Murray Abraham) confined in an insane asylum. He opens up to a young cleric about his angst-ridden relationship towards prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce). Sarelli was a special music devotee and the court composer of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffery Jones). Initially enthusiastic about meeting the renowned composer Mozart, Sarelli's fervor soon subsided when he encounters an ardent immature man who turns out to be the famous musician. Sarelli is shocked at first, but upon discovering Amadeus' effortless strokes in creating unspeakably beautiful music, he is infuriated. Once Mozart captivates the emperor with his music, Sarelli is determined to do everything in his power as a court composer to keep Mozart away from the glory and recognition he deserves.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham deservingly won an Academy Award as the fittingly bitter Antonio Sarelli. Abraham gives the right pungent misery and covetousness to his role. Sarelli, having an ear of a music lover and not that of a composer, only thinks of everything concerning Mozart and Mozart's music. His character's analogy between Mozart and his music proves intriguing. Sarelli absolutely despises him yet he cannot even survive without the beauty of Amadeus' music. Sarelli cannot comprehend how such talent could be manifested in such a seemingly infantile self-indulgent fool.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce adds his modern, eccentric flavor to his role as society's most celebrated intellectual, Mozart. He frolics and clowns around magnificent sets ratifying his devil-may-care attitude. He effectively makes Wolfgang seem like a womanizing idiot who can produce divine music at the top of his head. His displays vulgarity and crudeness in soirée's while blurting out his trademark high-pitched laughs (the most significant in all of cinema). However, the strangest of all, he considers Sarelli as one of his closest friends despite Sarelli secretly taunting him and mocking Mozart's dead father (Roy Dotrice).<br/><br/>Meticulously authentic to be set in the 17th century, the film amplifies every visual detail. Theodore Pistek's custom-made dresses, wigs, costumes and masks are astonishing representations of Bohemia and long-forgotten Europe. Patrizia Von Brandenstein and Karel Cerny's art direction establish credibility in every set from start to finish. The camera work is superb and the original score is a reminiscent of the classics.<br/><br/>Everything about Milos Forman's direction is nothing short of flawless. The acting by the two male leads and supporting cast are excellent and the entire feature is a banquet for the eyes and ears. AMADEUS still remains the champion as the unrivaled king of biography movies. Any follower of brilliance deserves to watch this film.<br/><br/>There are remarkable performances by Jeffery Jones as Emperor Joseph II and Roy Dotrice as Mozart's father."

","Does it really matter that it's not entirely historically accurate? For one thing, this movie isn't about history- it's about passion and genius. For another, I saw this movie knowing that it wasn't completely true to life, but I loved it anyway. Because what really matters is how Hulce and Abraham draw you into their characters, not permitting your eyes to leave the screen. What really matters is the fact that the movie is very entertaining in its own right- with its humor, both dark and light (I laughed every time Mozart laughed, and then even at Mozart's dad's mask), along with a witty and quotable screenplay (""I may be a vulgar man, but I assure you my music is not""). What really matters is how Forman combines everything to really show us the passion Mozart had for his music and how Mozart was a touch above Salieri when it came to music- Salieri could recognize how extraordinary Mozart's music was but could not create it himself. My favorite scene is when Salieri helps Mozart write the end of his mass. Forman wisely does not distract with anything extra and simply shifts back and forth between the two characters, allowing the actors to do their work with their faces. When I was watching this movie again for the second time, I had forgotten about that scene, and watching it again, I could not take my eyes off the TV. In fact, I think I had that problem for most of the movie."

","Although this is possibly one of the best films ever made, I feel that its title is inappropriate. Perhaps instead of Amadeus, it should be called Salieri, because that Patron Saint of Mediocrities is really the star of the show. There is no bad acting in Amadeus, but F. Murray Abraham truly steals the show. From his first anguished cry of ""Mozart, I killed you!"" to his final absolution of the mediocrities of the world, Abraham gives one of the best performances not only of his career, but in all American film. <br/><br/>Abraham captures with consummate grace and skill the final musings of a tortured soul, having wasted away, chewing on his own guilt for thirty years, bitter at what Mozart was and he could never be, but in his lonely sadness, alone of his contemporaries realizing Mozart's genius.<br/><br/>The story is told by Salieri as an old man, after he is confined to an institution because of a suicide attempt. He tells his story to a priest, following his interactions with Mozart, from the first time he saw him as a young man, to his scheming against him in Vienna, to Mozart's final resting place in a pauper's grave. <br/><br/>Although the portrayal of Mozart's life is interesting, especially through Salieri's viewpoint, the true poignancy of the film comes from Salieri's feelings, and their exploration of what it is to be a mediocrity -- always second to somebody better than you. And in the final moments of the movie, as the viewer returns to Saleri's present, having just witnessed Mozart's burial, Salieri addresses the teary eyed priest who was taking his confession. He says ""I will speak for you. I will speak for all mediocrities. I am the patron saint of mediocrities."" As he is wheeled through the hallways of the asylum, he spreads his hands in benediction and crys to the madmen ""You are absolved! You are absolved! You are absolved! You are absolved!"" Truly, they are, and perhaps, so, even, is Salieri."

","Amadeus is complex as it is comic at times. This movie is an incredible illustration of the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. While at the same time it demonstrates jealousy and greed on the other end of the spectrum. Milos Foreman is unique and creative in the way he brings the story of Wolfgang A. Mozart to the screen. Mozart in the movie is portrayed as this naive but celestial sent prodigy. Whose genius is sometimes out shadowed by his pranks, and ""infintile boy"" behavior. But do not think that his music is comic, it is anything but that! In his music and in the film is portrayed with such seriousness, grandeur, and humility that it was quite the opposite of Mozart himself. Saleri is methodical in his story explaining by a confessional account of how he loved and hated Mozart. But most of all, the music is beyond imagination, each segment in the movie shows and tells how Mozart develops these mercurial and mysterious pieces that capitulates us how he truly was a genius at his work. All the actors did an incredible job in portraying the people that were more or less in Mozart's life. To see this movie is a must, it will move you and make you laugh at the same time. But it will not make you laugh at the person portrayed in the movie, rather, it will make you appreciate how much he loved to live life and expressing it with music. Mozart's music in one way is a celebration of life; love, joy, hate, jealousy, immortality, death, and forgiveness. The list is not exhaustive but it does portray the inner subconscious feelings that we practice everyday. This movie explains this and it does with such accuracy that in Mozart's words are perfect, no more no less than I require! This movie will go down as timeless and sublime in movie history. Check it out."

"esteban1747","8","1","2","26 January 2005"," Mozart, simply a genius
","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most skilled composer and musician of all time. When he was only six years old he played for the Austrian Empress, later being still a child he played for the French and English royal families, and wrote his first symphonies. He had such an ear that he could remember any piece just listening once. In addition, Mozart's life was a real disorder, although his incomes were high he usually spent more than what he earned, he was also a heavy drunkard and liked to have fun with women other than his wife. I think that Mozart was a child who never matured. All these aspects of Mozart's life are well described in the film of the Czech director Milos Forman. Unfortunately the film concentrated more on Mozart's deeds in Vienna, and nothing was shown about his travel to Italy, where he wrote two operas. The unproven legend that Mozart was killed by Antonio Salieri was shown with some thoughts and ideas of the director and writer of the film. Up to date nobody can really assert that Salieri really poisoned Mozart, the only thing one may accept is that Salieri was really jealous of the extraordinary Mozart's skills, but to kill him is another story, a bit strange. The most shocking fact in the film, probably it is true, is that Mozart was buried in a common hole without any grave for him. Although with his disordered life he contributed to his poverty, such a genius just put in that hole is to me an injustice. The film has some polemic issues, but one must acknowledge that it is a sound work and an important contribution to make Mozart's life known."
"oozkan","10","1","2","22 July 2003"," An excellent genius work...
","One of the best films ever! Amadeus presents stunning performance blending with an unfamiliar tale of the genius musical mind,  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. I find myself lucky that I got insight about the life of Mozart, his great story and how he gave shape and definition to his music. I think the power of film comes from the creativity of the director. Other than presenting an ordinary story, Amadeus is told from the point of view of his rival, Antonio Salieri. Thanks to Forman, this view made Amadeus fascinating and unforgettable. In the film, we see two greatly complex and conflicted men (Mozart and Salieri) as they compete directly and indirectly for recognition and appreciation. Of course we should not ignore outstanding performance of F. Murray Abraham who got both the Oscar in Best Actor and Golden Globe in Best Performance Awards in 1985 for his performance in Amadeus. With one sentence, Amadeus is a true masterpiece and a must-see for anyone!"

","Now I never been a big fan of classical music.  However, that didn't stop me from liking this film.  I'm the kind of person who will adjust to almost any kind of music--except for maybe country--as long as it fits the tone.  I love the use of Beethoven's symphony in ""A Clockwork Orange.""  It went beautifully with the whole hypnotic tone and mood of the film.  I can say the same thing about the music in this film.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is not just an arthouse film, aimed squarely at ""arthouse geeks."" It is as artistic as it is entertaining.  Hulce gives an amusing, yet brilliant portrayal of the great composer.  My Dad feels his portrayal, giving Mozart an ""idiotic"" persona, was completely innacurate.  But I never knew Mozart.  So I can't judge.  I also thought F. Murray Abraham, who so rightfully picked up an Oscar, was great as Antoine Soleiri.  However, I felt they overdid the makeup in those scenes of his later years.  He looked like something out of a horror movie.  <br/><br/>""Amadeus"" gives great insight into the composer's life, contains beautiful art direction and costume design and music just envelops you.  Milos Forman gives us this picturesque atmosphere that couldn't be captured any better. And I also admired its many moments of comic relief.  So this should be an enjoyable film for virtually all audiences.  My only protest is its overlength.  It starts to lag during the third act, and my interest gradually slipped away.  So I still regard ""Amadeus"" as a hugely impressive piece of motion picture magic; a few more minutes in the editing room and this could've been perfect."

I resisted seeing the movie in the theater when I was a child, because I thought that I would be bored to tears.  Finally, many years later, it was on television and I decided to watch it as I worked a jigsaw puzzle.  I got maybe four or five pieces put together....and then I was enraptured in this tale of lust, love, jealousy, murder and music.  I have seen this film over 100 times and undoubtedly know all the lines by heart. I never tire of it or the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film portrays the ""hero"" as an absolute jerk, which most historians agree that Motzart was, or was at least percieved that way.  It is a film about a man who was at the top of his craft, but lacking in almost all other areas.  Enter into the fray a humble man, Antoni Soliari, who wants nothing more than to ""sing to God"" -- if only He would bless him with great talent. For Soliari, the frustration of watching such a ""creature"" be so succesful while he tires away and receives less praise from his peers is more than he can stand.  He feels resigned to be a ""mediocrity""<br/><br/>The movie never really says whether or not Soliari kills Motzart or not -- and that is to the films credit.  Perhaps the most memorable part of the movie (other than the great laugh of Tom Hulce/Motzart) is the last line of the movie, when Soliari is being wheeled away from the priest whom he just confessed to.  He say, ""I will speak for all mediocrities.  I am their patron-saint"".<br/><br/>Very few films have risen to the level of this achievement -- but NONE have surpassed it.  10 out of 10."

How could a man as famous as Mozart have been buried in a mass grave? Does anybody know if this is true? <br/><br/>To me,the movie was enjoyable even when it wasn't all that interesting because of the quality of the acting from all involved (not just the stars),and because of the scenery. I am not very knowledgeable about classic music,and think most of what I hear on classical radio stations is about as exciting as watching grass grow. Yeah,I like certain Mozart,Beethoven,Bach,and especially violin pieces out of eastern Europe that I have heard played,but most of what they wrote is like Scotch whiskey or rap ""music"",a acquired taste.<br/><br/>This is related to the only parts of the movie I hated,and that was the opera scenes. If your idea of good music is some woman singer shrieking at a pitch that makes dogs ears bleed,you may love it. If you don't like opera,this will definitely take away from your movie enjoyment. In fact,I suspect the reason this average movie got such high ratings is because of all the opera fans taking it as their own. The rest of the music is tolerable,and my biggest complaint about it is the rare times something popular is being played they only play a few notes of it.

There's nothing wrong with long movies, but only if the story is engaging and interesting. Amadeus was just slow and boring. In my opinion, there was no reason for this film to be 3 hours long. No matter how impressive and extravagant costumes and backdrops are, it does not make a movie exciting. This is a problem I've seen in quite a few big-budget films. About two hours into the film, I got very, very sleepy and I could barely keep my eyes open (okay, this might have been because I was watching the movie at 11pm). <br/><br/>The good things:<br/><br/>F.

","It's been a few years since I've seen the film but that is unimportant as I know it like the back of my hand as I do the life and music of Mozart. The movie came first, however. The first piece that I ever played on the piano was the andante middle movement of Mozart's first piano sonata, a piece that doesn't feature in the film but the movie drove me out of my status as a musical dilettante and into the ranks of musicians—granted, a crappy musician but a musician nonetheless. I wonder how many other viewers were so heavily influenced my Amadeus.<br/><br/>As good as the performances are in Amadeus (and they are all superb) the real star is the music of Mozart. For many people I am quite certain that the movie was their introduction to the greatest composer who has ever handed down music. It isn't the music alone that makes this joining of music and film so successful but the way in which we are presented with the music, the way Milos Forman deconstructs Mozart's genius for the benefit of those of us without the benefit of a lifetime of musical training. This is especially highlighted in the scene in which Salieri views the young composer's work as he reads it on the music stand (K 361 Gran Partita).<br/><br/>""He's taking the conventions but slightly rearranging them to produce an effect of surprise but he's not rearranging them to such an extreme extent that he loses contact with his audience and this is really, absolutely at the essence of Mozart."" This is an unattributed quote from a documentary on the composer which wonderfully describes his music in a single sentence. Amadeus is two hours and 40 minutes but it also precisely defines just what it is about Mozart that made him exactly what he was, is, has become, and will always be for everyone who appreciates music."

If the schools watch it they should stick to the theatrical edition. Even though the theatrical edition is rated PG, it really is more deserving of PG-13. It has sensuality and a lot of drinking. Mozart gets drunk in the movie. Overall it's a great film. Mozart was a great composer and I show big respect and remembrance for him on Memorial day and his birthday. I recommend that kids watch this movie because it gives them a great history lesson. I think they will enjoy it."

","At its core, Milos Forman's multi-award winning adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play 'Amadeus' is really just a soap opera with extremely lush production values.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham is captivating in his Golden Globe and Oscar winning role of a man driven mad by jealousy. Relating the tale to the audience via a young priest, it creates an intimacy that helps to pull the audience in. Tom Hulce feels a bit too ""I want my MTV"" era contemporary as Mozart, but he brings a giddy energy to the role that works as a great counterbalance to Abraham. <br/><br/>In the end 'Amadeus' isn't good history, but it is a good soapy tragicomedy."

","Amadeus. A twisted story of the prodigy and genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most brilliant composer of all time who according to this film was a young rock star who somehow wrote boozed up masterpieces all day while dealing with a persistent fever. <br/><br/>Set in the late 1700s, Amadeus is a classical biopic directed by Milos Forman who seems to have given the musical genius some annoying habits like an ugly boring wife and a ridiculous laugh that he insists on delivering time after time. <br/><br/>Mozart's supposed secret rival, Antonio Salieri, a sleazy jealous wog, who years later finds himself in an insane asylum on a confessing bender to a priest tells the story of Mozart with help from a harmonious soundtrack.<br/><br/>This movie won Oscars, eight of them, so it can be a bit boring. This 1984 cast has reserved Mozart for most annoying character who is aptly played by Tom Dulce. The god crazy rival, Salieri, whom begins the movie by trying to kill himself is fine tuned by F. Murray Abraham.<br/><br/>God is referenced repeatedly (even the title) and is the motive behind the frustrated Salieri. Beginning his confession from youth, Antonio Salieri describes his love of god/music and hate of Mozart the tramp leading to his downfall, the confession bender.<br/><br/>The opera and classical performances scattered within this film are thoroughly enjoyable and authentic being filmed in the original theatre Mozart performed them in Prague. Important to note, the film isn't historically accurate though which is great for catching douche bags at parties as a conversation trap.<br/><br/>The extras of the eighties deserve extra credit for their ability to outperform their contemporary counterparts (and most actors of the eighties) in something that should be straightforward, but never is now. No characters demand more screen time than the tormentor and tormented which the story revolves around.<br/><br/>As the film progresses and Mozart's talent, Salieri's character evolves from praising god to hating him whilst using everything in his power to secretly ruin his rival. As Wolfgang degenerates into a sickly mess he leaves his house less frequently providing...<br/><br/>The most horrific scenes of the film. They always occur when anyone attempts to contact Mozart via knocking on his door. The repeating drone of the door being loudly hit shatters what precious mood you've managed to absorb from the costumed lineup.<br/><br/>The failure of Salieri's plan is evident with his decayed elderly form juxtaposed regularly with his retelling. Well worth watching if you have any respect or passion for music.<br/><br/>Everything in moderation, even god. I give this two and a half joints.<br/><br/>By Travis Lipshus for more reviews goto http://travislipshus.blogspot.com.au/"
"Jerique","10","1","3","1 March 2010"," Best movie from the 1980's!
","Every decade punches out one movie that stands out from all the rest, it's no surprise that the 1990's had Titanic do just that with the 11 Oscars it took home. I believe Avatar will go down in history as the best movie to come out of the 2010 decade with The Dark Knight being the best 2000's movie. That being said, it's quite clear, at least to me, Amadeus is the best movie from the 1980's.<br/><br/>What makes Amadeus so great? A great many things make this movie loved and incredible to watch. Fans of musicals will love this simply for all the music involved. During the 180 minutes of film, you hear some form of musical score. What's better is that the music is written and adapted from works of Mozart or Salieri. Quite exquisite music with such grace and elegance.<br/><br/>Amadeus is such a masterpiece of fiction work and gives a memorable story-telling of Mozart's career and personal life while also briefly explaining the same of Salieri. Amongst the cast, F. Murray Abraham definitely steals the show away. Whether or not he's in his old-age makeup or he's playing his young self in flashbacks, Abraham penetrates your soul and touches the viewer's inner being.<br/><br/>Every scene brings a warmth to my heart. Every piece of music in the film is something to behold and listened to for hours on end. Amadeus is the type of film to make you long for the old times and make you wish to go to an opera like ""Marriage of Figaro."" It's not just the music, acting and plot that can captivate you but the art direction, cinematography, makeup effects, direction, and visual effects are some of the best you'll ever see. Amadeus is one of few films that you can give a perfect ten and feel satisfied knowing that people will agree. I certainly know that it's one of five films for me that can achieve a perfect ten rating. Highly recommended."

","Well, so much has already written about this movie, adding to the same format doesn't make sense. As a critic of period movie I watched the whole movie few times just to find out any flaw and loose ends anything that make this movie less than perfect but alas after watching several times, every time I end up lost at one or the other part of the movie, what would I say about the acting, both deserve Oscar and both did justify their roles, more than any one else it was F. Murray Abraham movie and wow he did so brilliantly the hatred towards Mozart, the jealousy, the secret admiration, the acknowledgment of his work and face expressions after listening to his music. The way he possessed hatred towards GOD, that GOD has given him obsession but lacks the talent that Mozart posses.<br/><br/>Though I am not very much into opera and Mozart or Beethoven kind of music but after watching this movie I got so much interested bought all the records of Mozart just to pay tribute to the genius which of course born once in thousands years, yet he lived so little just 35 years, imagine if he has lived till 60 or 70 years then we wouldn't have look for another Mozart or we wouldn't have appreciate Beethoven?<br/><br/>Bottom line this kind of movies are neither everyday affair nor we expect this kind of movies to made very often, that makes them rate gem.

","Adapted from Peter Shaffer's stage play with the same name, Milo Forman's celluloid version of 'Amadeus' comes up as one of the finest Hollywood films ever.<br/><br/>While watching 'Aamdeus' the only question going on in my mind, was that can films be so good and gripping? Can they be so so neat, that even it's 120 minutes running time seems like nothing. If your a REAL Cinema fan, then watching 'Amadeus' is not a must, but a rule for every Cinema lover. <br/><br/>Loosely based on the lives of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart & Antonio Salieri, this tale of success, jealousy, death and guilt unfolds so well, that you truly hate Salieri for his demon side. The climax is simply spell-binding, with Salieri and Amadeus seeing each other eye to eye. The death of Amadeus, and the guilt that Saileri carries teaches you a lesson to never ever ruin someone's life for your own meanings.<br/><br/>Performance Wise: F. Murray Abraham as Salieri deserved each and every bit of that Oscar he got. He's superb in his middle-age, but simply Fantastic in his old-age portions. Tom Hulce is excellent as Amadeus. Elizabeth Berridge looked so cute then, and her performance is natural to core. Note her expressions in Amadeus's death scene, you'll get goosebumps. A really young Cynthia Nixon delivers a first-rate performance as Amadeus's maid. Others are proficient.<br/><br/>On the whole 'Amadeus' is a True Masterpiece from Hollywood. Two Big Thumbs Up!"

The odd thing is, neither character is inherently likable. Mozart is a disgusting slacker and Salieri is a whiny, jealous outcast. What makes the film entertaining is that precise fact... and the great portrayals by Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham, respectively.<br/><br/>Also astounding is the look of the film, shot in Prague (you'd never know it wasn't really Vienna) with design by Patrizia von Brandenstein and Josef Svoboda. No backlot shoots for ""Amadeus,"" thank you very much.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on about the great performances (even by bewildering faces, like Jeffrey ""Principal Rooney"" Jones and Christine Ebersole), beautiful music adaptation, and incomparable dialogue, but they speak for themselves.

"mahmutali2002","10","1","3","8 April 2008"," Masterpiece
","I have seen this movie several times and each time I shocked with the sound of music. The character Salieri was perfectly created. Scenario is well covered and played. But the key point is correlation between opera scenes and story itself. Evething takes place masterfully. <br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is the most wonderful movie on the subject of music ever made, a colorful costume drama with stunning music and performances, particularly by F. Murray Abraham (which won him the Oscar for 1984), by Tom Hulce in the title role (garnering for him an Oscar nomination) and in a supporting role by Jeffrey Jones, still known to movie fans principally as the dean of students in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" I said it '84 and nothing has changed since to alter this view. Were my high-school students of that opinion? I took a class to the film eighteen years ago, but the consensus among the teens was ""there's no beat."" I suppose that quote is comparable to the one made by Emperor Joseph's adviser's ""Too many notes."" The adviser was telling his boss what the latter wanted to hear that Mozart's compositions were inferior to Salieri's because of their complexity."

","When the servant girl shows Salieri into the Mozart residence in the latter's' absence in conformance to Salieri's instructions, a picture (the lower of the two)of fellow Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn, for whom each held genuine affection and friendship, is shown on the entry hall wall to the left, easily seen as Salieri stands at the entryway about to come in. Since this scene is happening sometime in the early-to-mid 1780's, Haydn, born in 1732, would not have aged to the extent shown in the portrait, and in fact, it appears to be a copy of the one painted by John Hoppner, dating from 1791, substantially later than the time of the scene."
"shekhoosraja","9","1","3","2 April 2008"," A stunning biographical depiction
","The film revolves around the rivalry between two contemporary composers, Mozart and Saliery. Actually, there was once a rumor that it was Saliery who killed Mozart out of envy. However, this was proved to be false later and the film also depicts the same. Presented as a flashback narration by an aged Saliery, this movie follows his point of view. Saliery, the court composer in the royal court of Vienna. He lived a happy life until one day the king invites Mozart to his court. Once there, Saliery sees Mozart as the 'Creature', who is hopelessly careless, obnoxious, easy going and socially ignorant person. However, his talents are prodigal and effortlessly creating divinely beautiful music is natural for him. Due to this, Saliery feels great envy as well as admiration for him. However, even after being immensely gifted, Mozart fails as a son, husband and professional due to his impractical ways. e slips in to poverty, falls prey to illness, dies and is buried as an insignificant commoner. Saliery, out of pity and admiration stays with him at the end and drafts Mozart's final composition on his dictation. The execution of this film is lovely and gives an accurate feel. A must watch for lovers of Mozart and music."
"evanston_dad","9","1","3","17 March 2008"," Rock Me, Amadeus
","Milos Forman serves up a deliciously macabre film based on the Peter Schaffer play about brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and lesser composer and Mozart arch rival Antonio Salieri. This is Salieri's story much more than it is Mozart's. More than anything, the film is a study of the devouring envy one artist can have for the talents of another.<br/><br/>F. Murray Abraham is good as Salieri; he has never since gotten as juicy a film role as this. But he's upstaged by Tom Hulce's Mozart, played as a giggling, flamboyant showman who's absolutely oblivious to Salieri's mounting hatred. Indeed, one of the aspects of the rivalry that is most heartbreaking, and which adds fuel to Salieri's fire, is the degree to which Mozart doesn't even recognize Salieri as a rival. <br/><br/>Though the movie is meticulous in its period detail, the screenplay is peppered with modern, slangy American dialogue that frees it from the museum piece stuffiness that so often infects other period films.<br/><br/>Bravo.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"JoeB131","10","1","3","14 March 2008"," The Director's Cut
","I don't have a lot to add to the movie that hasn't already been said, it is a truly awesome accomplishment.<br/><br/>I do want to make some comments on the Director's cut. I think that the scenes were well performed and shot, but I'm not sure if they added anything to the movie. The whole scene in Madame Caliveri's dressing room was unnecessary. When she pummeled Mozart with the flowers, we had already gotten the point. Five more minutes of exposition on the point just made Salieri look dense.<br/><br/>The scene with his ham-handed attempt to coerce Constanza into sex was questionable (Probably would have gotten the film an R rating if not cut). The fact that he could help and wouldn't was good enough. Then again, it does explain her open hostility to the guy in the death scene at the end.<br/><br/>The canine concert was funny, but was completely unneeded.<br/><br/>Another point, I usually hate historic films because they usually get so much wrong. Amadeus is a film I can forgive, partially because they repeat falsehoods that have been around for hundreds of years, and partially because it is such a well-made film. Still, I think it is fair to say the historic Antonio Salieri was a much better person than this film makes out."
"Spinetinglers","10","1","3","27 February 2008"," Mediocrity vs. Genius
","Everyone in their life will encounter someone who is brilliant at doing something. Pangs of jealously will ensue, and we will examine their behaviour, probably thinking to ourselves that they do not deserve to have this great gift, that they do not deserve to have a talent that we lack. All through life, all through history, the talentless have always been jealous of the talented. The fact that we are not created equal and some of us will have to work very hard at things that come so easily to others is the theme that runs through Amadeus  Salieri is so jealous of Mozart's talent that he conspires to let as few people as possible hear Mozart's music, and ultimately tries to kill him by sending him mad.<br/><br/>The movie opens when Salieri is an old man who wants to confess his crimes before he dies. He wants tell the world what he did to Mozart. A priest comes to hear his confession and Salieri plays him some of his own music. Although the priest states that he studied music, he does not recognise any of Salieri's compositions. Then Salieri plays a few notes of one of Mozart's pieces and the priest immediately recognises it. In this instant, Salieri realises that despite of his all his efforts, the world is still filled with Mozart's music. What follows is Salieri's story. He tells us of how he was touched by genius and instead of being inspired by it, genius corrupted him turning him from a good man into a jealous, vengeful and malicious person.<br/><br/>This film is a work of great merit and won a well-deserved Best Picture Oscar. Despite its dark theme, the story is told with humour and beauty and Mozart's music resonates throughout practically every scene, giving its audience chills and helping the audience understand why Salieri was so in awe of Mozart and yet so threatened by him. Of course, the history buffs will complain that it is not a historically accurate film, but leave them to their textbooks. Wonderful stories are never historically accurate; usually a brilliant story is borne from a brilliant lie because the truth is not that interesting.<br/><br/>To conclude, a small note to all of those other talentless hacks out there. The geniuses of the world never die happy; their lives will not be filled with happy family Christmases or contented home lives. They usually die young, burnt out and alone as they can never be truly be satisfied. So, when you take this in consideration, perhaps mediocrity ain't that bad. Perhaps, it is better to be a Salieri than a Mozart!"

","Milos Forman's ""Amadeus"" will most likely remain the greatest achievement in the world of cinema for at least another fifty years. I say this because there are a number of things that contribute to a film being great, and Amadeus achieves perfection in every single area. When the film starts, and while the screen is still black you hear the thunderous, dramatic opening to Mozart's ""Don Giovanni,"" you know you're in for something special. The opening credits sequence, scored by Mozart's Symphony No. 25 in G minor, carries us into a film that from beginning to end, holds up to the expectations set by the precise, gripping introduction.<br/><br/>Sequences of masterful acting, gorgeous cinematography, and flawless, natural directing, are complimented by Mozart's heavenly music, rising here to accentuate the emotion is someone's words, falling there to segue us into the next gripping scene. Throughout the film, the music often starts very suddenly on the beat of a door closing, or a cut into a new scene, and this adds even more perfection to what already feels like a precise visual poem.<br/><br/>This film achieves everything that anyone tries to achieve when making a film. It is the pinnacle of cinema. From beginning to end, it defines ""perfection"" in the art of film making. This achievement will not soon be reached by any other film maker, and I wouldn't be surprised if this masterful, perfect piece of art were never bested by another film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Amadeus, you don't know the true meaning of the word ""Cinema.""<br/><br/>11/10."

","""Amadeus"" is based on the play of the same name by Peter Shaffer. It portrays a fictionalized account of the life of famous classical composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, emphasizing an intense rivalry between him and composer Antonio Salieri. The film creates a great sense of period with lavish sets and elegant costumes.<br/><br/>Tom Hulce leads the cast as Mozart with great energy and he creates a memorable character. Mozart is portrayed as a man whose vices and juvenile conduct are only exceeded by his genius in creating music. My favorite performance of the film, however, is F. Murray Abraham's skillful performance as Mozart's rival, Antonio Salieri. He convincingly creates a Salieri that narrates the story as a conniving and bitter man, but manages to elicit sympathy when he laments that he can never be as prolific or well-known as Mozart. There are excellent supporting performances in the film, too, including Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's patient wife Constanze and Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II with a matter-of-fact manner.<br/><br/>The rivalry between Mozart and Salieri is well-developed and the film never becomes tiresome despite its length. In addition to the characterizations, the film appropriately includes dazzling segments of classical music and representations of staged operas. The end narration of Salieri is very well-written and touching. Truly F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is a champion for mediocrity."

He was his benefactor and his nursemaid. He was his scribe. The rest is spoilage. But my point? They would have called it Salieri, but no one would have come.

","What I'd thought would be just another biopic about somebody we all know turned out to be a deeply amazing piece of cinema. ""Amadeus"" tells the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in a series of flashbacks told by the now insane rival composer Salieri (Abraham). As the story begins, we see that Salieri is now troubled by his past and in complete hostility towards Mozart, who was a far more talented musician than Salieri. In an attempt to ridicule Mozart, Salieri finds his music overwhelmingly beautiful and ironically inspirational, bringing out an even stronger rage towards the legend.<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman proved yet again that he is one of the most talented directors. After his seemingly unbeatable masterpiece ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"", Forman creatively finds a way to adapt a fascinating play on to the screen in a flawless manner. The beautiful set design to the incredible make-up and costume design wows the audience and in every way possible makes them feel like they really are in that time period. The camera-work is brilliant, capturing key moments in a vastly visual way.<br/><br/>Although the directing is painfully beautiful, the screenplay is without a doubt the best thing about the movie. Changing between time periods and geniusly keying in scenes together, ""Amadeus"" goes beyond the expectations of film-making. Most of the scenes are edited so they fit in with the actual music of Mozart, which so wonderfully creates a powerful emotion almost unseen before.<br/><br/>The acting is without a doubt superb. F. Murray Abraham as the psychotic Salieri shines in his Oscar-winning performance. His vision of Salieri's pain and suffering and resistance towards God is painfully depicted in both his portrayal of a jealous, hostile composer and an old psychotic washed out musician. Tom Hulce plays Mozart so brilliantly and so comically that you can't help but keep your eyes on him. His unforgettable laughter helps him join a much memorable list of performances in the history of cinema. Hulce portrays Amadeus creatively, both an immature playboy and a musical genius. He reportedly also had to learn to play the piano as well as Mozart's signature move: playing the piano upside down with his hands crossed. The rest of the cast also shines as they portray almost flawlessly the culture and society in the time of Mozart.<br/><br/>""Amadeus"" is a masterpiece. Everything from the screenplay, to the incredible set decoration and costume design is so vastly memorable and genius. The depth of the story is intense, creating a sense of madness and anger. Truly a movie to be seen more than just once, ""Amadeus"" goes beyond film-making, showing us that movies can be made in the 18th century and still be entertaining."

When he does he learns the truth about Mozart. That he is a bumbling sex obsessed twenty year old teenager, who is far more talented that Salieri. He of course doesn't like this very much and plots to kill Mozart, while never wanting to stop listening to his music. The performances are completely brilliant. F.

"phattdirty","9","1","3","26 September 2005"," Enthralling, flamboyant, extravagant, operatic epic
","Review: Flamboyant and extravagant would be the best way to sum up this masterwork by Milos Forman. The obvious American accents of Tom Hulce (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) and Elizabeth Berridge (his wife Constanze) are somewhat misplaced in the setting of 18th century Vienna as is the use of 'mom' and some swearing which seem a bit juxtaposed with what is otherwise a stunning recreation of the period. It could also be argued that German and Italian would have seemed more authentic and appropriate for the language but if one can get over these small quibbles, then overall this is a very entertaining movie with some brilliant performances from the two male leads. <br/><br/>The mesmerising performance of F. Murray Abraham as the downright nasty Antonio Salieri is the obvious highlight of this film but Tom Hulce really brings Amadeus himself to the screen. His depiction of the great composer is, like the film, flamboyant and extravagant혰almost childlike in places혰which indicate a young man robbed of his childhood by his overbearing father; a theme which constantly reoccurs in the movie. Hulce's over the top laugh at the most inappropriate moments adds perfect comic relief to the proceedings which are at times quite dark. Both Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham were nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards; Abraham eventually beating his co-star to the coveted prize. Elizabeth Berridge - albeit with her American accent - is very good as Mozart's somewhat neglected wife; she often comes second to Mozart's work and his affairs with other women. She plays the character well and interacts excellently with Hulce. Jeffrey Jones is in amusing form as Emperor Joseph and the rest of the supporting actors do a competent job.<br/><br/>The cinematography is sumptuous and lush with the vibrant colours and beautiful photography making it very pleasing to the eye. The costume design and stunning set and art decoration recreate an authentic looking 18th century Vienna; the palace of the emperor, the streets and opera halls all look meticulously produced and realistic. And then we come to the music. A faithful and wonderful recreation of Mozart's music is present throughout this film혰it is essentially the lifeblood that runs through the whole piece. The opera scenes are visually very impressive and sound magnificent; these are also the scenes where we see Salieri most at awe of Mozart whom he admires and despises with equal measure. One of the most noticeable things about the music in this film is how it's linked very much with what we see on screen; Salieri reads Mozart's sheets of music and the same music swells in the background혰offering the audience an insight into just what Salieri sees and hears when he reads the sheets. Likewise the penultimate scene of the film where Salieri is helping Mozart to complete his Requiem Mass is stunning. The interaction of the two actors is brilliant and the music playing in the background to complement their descriptions of the beats and instruments is quite beautiful to watch. Milos Forman's inextricable linking of Mozart's death with the Requiem Mass shows a man who was so passionate about his music that ultimately it contributed to his death. <br/><br/>Forman's direction once again proves that he is one of the very best of his generation and explains why he has been able to cross over and have commercial success in the same way as other European directors such as Roman Polanski and Jean-Pierre Jeunet."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","4","2 September 2013"," That was not Mozart laughing, Father... that was God.
","Almost 10 years after Cuckoo's Nest, Milos Forman takes us on another travel down the abyss of the human psyche.<br/><br/>In the center of it all: Antonio Salieri. Old and haggard, he recounts those years of his time as Hofkapellmeister to Emperor Joseph II in which his path crossed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's. He, Salieri, the methodical worker, well-respected in the upper crust, but devoid of any lightness of being. In contrast: fidgety wunderkind Mozart, unaccustomed and without etiquette, oil in the water of a society with extremely limited capability of understanding his talent.<br/><br/>The actions by and conflict between these two characters are the poignant essence of this film. Already their very first encounter is symptomatic of the rest of the movie. Salieri operates exclusively in the shadows while Mozart's and his bride-to-be's improper behavior results in his late arrival to a presentation to the Emperor. When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism. Into the intention of publishing Mozart's work as his in order to escape mediocrity and irrelevance to future generations. And into worse.<br/><br/>Yet Mozart's biggest rival is the only one to really recognize his abilities. While his complex works keep coming up against brick walls, partially induced by Salieri's cabals, Mozart has to witness how the people enthusiastically celebrate presentations which he deems no more than mindless amusement for his little boy.<br/><br/>In the final act, magically attracted, yet massively repulsed, Salieri schemes Mozart into letting him be an assistant in the mastermind's creative process. Imperfection becomes more visible than ever. Disaster takes its course."
"drake blueskull","10","1","4","16 July 2003"," Spectacular period drama!
","Set in Vienna in the late 18th century, Amadeus is an outstanding ode to the genius of a great musician. As a movie experience, it is entertaining and rewarding at the same time. Considering that Milos Forman was at the helm of its creation, one has a lot of expectations of the film and believe me they are well founded. He fills the movie with such grandeur and depth that you are easily overwhelmed. The length of the movie could scare the most avid movie buff, but frankly i didn't find it a drag. And in case you find yourself wondering if you'd like it despite the fact that you don't know the first thing about Mozart or his music, the answer is an emphatic no.<br/><br/>The movie traces the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of Antonio Salieri, the court composer of Emperor Joseph II. Salieri, eager to meet Mozart on his arrival to Vienna, is stunned to find that an extraordinary musical talent has been bestowed on an utterly despicable, vulgar and frivolous man. The irony is beyond Salieri's tolerance, filling him with rage and envy. Soon, he schemes to drive Mozart into his destruction and the movie inches closer to Mozart's death in the background of lilting music.<br/><br/>Amadeus combines music and drama effortlessly. It seems that Peter Shaffer's play has all the elements of human nature in generous doses to engage the audience and then of course there is the music. No part of the movie is less entertaining or watchable than the other. The performances are stellar and both Abraham and Hulce are impressive. There are very few modern day classics but Amadeus fits the bill perfectly. Watch it for the drama and the music and you wouldn't be disappointed. For this movie deserved every one of those 8 oscars which it got.<br/><br/>9/10"

","But this film displays fine European culture. A culture that Americans have never had. Even though I love this movie, the language should have been German (or, actually, Austrian) which would have given it an even more realistic feel to it. Still - to get 8 Oscars - I'm guessing that most Americans forgot, that Mozart was not American. And that none of the contents of this movie relates to USA. The references to the geography should have been more explicit. However I'm somewhat satisfied with the fact, that no attempts are made to make the movie ""puritan"" or cut down on Mozarts blatant behaviour. Americans are known to be hypocrits."

In general, the movie is a true amusement whether you like Mozart or not. I couldn't find anything which disturbed me during watching it.

The portrayal of the shaky relationship between Mozart and Salieri and Salieri's bitterness and jealousy is so well-done that you can almost feel the tension in the air. Hulce and Abraham do an excellent job of bringing a lot of poignancy and emotional depth to the psychologically self-destructive qualities of these two characters. You really feel what they're going through in this film. It is a film that is both tragic and stunningly beautiful.

The film isn't bad, but it's VERY long!  Oh...and I have to complain about Mozart's (Tom Hulce) laugh.  Could it have been any more annoying?  I'm sure that's what Milos Forman was going for, but a little too annoying if you ask me.<br/><br/>I must admit that I'm a bit surprised this film won an Oscar for Best Picture, sure it was good, but Best Picture?

","I knew that this film was about a music composer, I had heard heard things about what the plot line might involve, and I knew it was Oscar and Golden Globe winning director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest). I have to say, I would have watched this film even if I hadn't heard all these things, about the awards and success, especially as it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, it is the 18th Century, old and retired former composer Antonio Salieri (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated F. Murray Abraham) has attempted suicide, and a priest is listening to him recount his past. Salieri tells him the story of his encounters with eccentric music composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Tom Hulce), he adores his music, but his personality is a little less likable for him. Salieri wished to God that he could become the most successful composer, possibly of all time, but he believes his Lord is praising Mozart with this great gift for music, so he is madly jealous. He renounces God and tries to think of ways to stop the run of success for Mozart, but this is hard to do when Emperor Joseph II (Golden Globe nominated Jeffrey Jones) and other connoisseurs are in the way. It is when Mozart goes into frowned upon material for opera that he may be lowering his success rate, e.g. the wrong languages for a certain language story, and less shows and people are watching and listening, it's not that their bad, it's that they are possibly too good. There is finally the point where Mozart collapses with so much stress on his mind making the music and keeping his wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) happy, so Salieri is more than happy to ""help"" Mozart finish his possible final piece. In the end, Mozart dies (most likely of fever), and you are left with the idea that it was Salieri praying to his God that killed him, but he was certainly mad enough to be a villain. Also starring Simon Callow as Emanuel Schikaneder, Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart, Christine Ebersole as Katerina Cavalieri, Charles Kay as Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Star Wars' Kenny Baker as Parody Commendatore. Abraham is certainly a great villain worthy of awards, and Hulce even though he didn't win is a great counterpart, the supporting cast all have their moments too. I think the main reason I rate it really highly, besides a great cast and story, was the magnificent music, Mozart was definitely the finest music composer of his time, and seeing a biographic drama about him is brilliant. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Outstanding!"

","I guess that it's fitting that since I share a birthday with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, that the movie about him should win Best Picture for the year in which I was born. And is it a great movie! More than simply focusing on the famous composer's life, it shows how rival composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) envied Mozart (Tom Hulce) and tried to get revenge on him.<br/><br/>Director Milos Forman brings to ""Amadeus"" the same eye-popping realism that he brought to his other Best Picture winner, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and also to ""Ragtime"".

","Milos Formans, ""Amadeus"" is a film that for me could have had the potential to be either a fascinating insight into how a pointless rivalry destroyed the lives of two good men or an overlong bore that failed to intrigue me as I have got literally zero interest in music but I found that this film fell into the former category and found it to be fantastic. This film doesn't really have one good character to get behind, everyone has hopes and loses that you all feel, everyone is flawed and down to earth, I found myself never being able to ultimately pick one side in the film. Both characters are developed perfectly You understand just how much their music means to both of them and why they need to hold on to it, it gives a fantastic insight into there mind sets and makes them more investing as well as interesting characters. Every thing in this film production wise is fantastic all the eccentric costumes, palaces and gutters look perfect. F Murray Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance in this film and I've seen few performances more deserving he is so convincing as a conflicted man shamed with his inability to advance beyond mediocrity, he's perfect at balancing both the young idealistic and older fragile versions of his character, he always had me engaged and he was truly amazing in this movie. Tom Hulce who I have seen literally nothing else from is fantastic in this movie, he's over the top laugh, excitable tendencies yet committed nature made him an entertaining character to watch and was the perfect opposition for Abraham. It's also a very dark film to watch at times, the way in which these two men's lives begin to fall apart isn't truly heartbreaking as ,like is said, they are developed perfectly so you understand the stakes of their rivalry. But I loved that they didn't necessarily hate each other but were really jealous of each other and their eventual bond towards the end of the film made for an extremely satisfying conclusion to their arc. One of my only real issues with this movie is the love story between Mozart and his wife, it gets extremely repetitive and dull after a while and his wife was completely unlikable to I ultimately just ended up not caring at anything of her turmoil. Another issue was the present day story line with the mental asylum it was mainly he Actor who played the priest who gave a fairly bad performance, just relying on the same facial expressions to carry his portrayal and got on my nerves after a while. <br/><br/>Amadeus is a fantastic film, it's got no one side or character to route for, everyone is perfect developed, it looks stunning in every aspect it was just the love story and some aspects of the present day story line that began to bother me at times which are only minor issues in a much more impressive picture. <br/><br/>88%/A-"

","Everyone else quite rightly focuses on the music and there is no doubt it is great. Neville Mariner and his orchestra are the epitome of Mozart experts.<br/><br/>But I would open the discussion up and ask viewers to see something else here. The politics of Music. Salieri passes through his active phase as composer and has moved into the realm of politics. There is no doubt Salieri is an expert in that field, sensitive to the political motives of his financial supporter, and able to conflate the issues of German or Italian language for the first Mozart opera in Vienna. Able to manipulate the levers of power within the court to get whatever he wants. A simple word from him can cut the run of Mozart's opera down to the bare essentials.<br/><br/>But politics never satisfies Salieri, he has made his choice and cannot live with it any more. By the time Mozart shows up his skill as musician has faded and all he is left with are clunky, and mediocre products. But this movie simply leaves most of the music Salieri has already done in the past never to be brought up again, there must have been some significant quality that brought him up to the level of Maestro, to the respect of the power elite. You simply do not become court composer with mediocrity.<br/><br/>The character of Mozart that Salieri hates most is his naivetÃ©, a sort of innocence. As a wielder of power there in Vienna, Salieri chooses to use it to kill off this wild child, to destroy the innocent since he is stuck living the life of cynicism and political correctness.

","The great epic biopic, about the great epic artist himself. What's so fascinating about it, is it's style. It's refusal to be pretentious. If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for. While I don't think it's Milos Forman's best film, it's a magnificent achievement, and for the grand majority of it's 3 hours, it's engrossing."

","The movie successfully surprised me with its depiction of Mozart's character and of how he lived his life. But the movie also did very well in depicting the genius of Mozart. I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter."

","Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say). <br/><br/>Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety. From Salieri's outlandish dreams to royal career, Mozart's ingenuity eluded him and he could never quite figure out ""how?""<br/><br/>For such an eventful and studied life, Mozart certainly endured a lot despite having all the talent in the world. Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day. <br/><br/>But maybe perfection is never truly the goal. <br/><br/>This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come. Whether for the great score, pleasant acting or overall story that will live forever, Amadeus is certainly a tale to tell."

","I'm not sure why directors are not the best judges of what should be kept and what cut from the final versions of their movies, but the director's cut of this movie, like so many others, shows that they often are not. Perhaps it is because they are too involved in the work to see it objectively? <br/><br/>When this movie first came out in 1984, I saw it in the theater 20-30 times. Each time I marveled at how well it was made.<br/><br/>Until tonight, I had not seen it since 1984, as I didn't have any desire to see it on TV. It was run on PBS tonight, however, and to be social, I watched it with my sister. I was also curious to see the director's cut, which is evidently 20 minutes longer.<br/><br/>It was easy for me to spot those extra 20 minutes, the only scenes I did not recognize. They were, primarily, the two scenes dealing with Salieri's suggestion to Costanza that she return later and spend the night with him if she wants him to see that Mozart gets the appointment as music teacher to the princess, and the two scenes dealing with the wealthy noble with the noisy dogs who is looking for a music teacher for his shy daughter. The second pair of scenes really adds nothing to the movie. The first two cast Salieri in even a more negative light. None of them is in any way necessary, and the two scenes in the country do slow the movie down. At 160 minutes, the movie never dragged for me. At 180, with those extra 20 minutes, it did sometimes seem to dawdle.<br/><br/>The 160 minute theatrical release is a true masterpiece. The 180 minute director's cut isn't terrible, but I can think of no reason to recommend it for a first viewing."

","Insanity has taken over the envious Salieri, the aged former musical adviser to the Emperor of Austria, and that leads the Ben Franklin look-alike into slicing his throat, claiming that he is being haunted by the ghost of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart whom he claims to have murdered. F. Murray Abraham gives a brilliant portrayal of a brilliant man who let his own insecurities drive him into hating the gifted composer who became a legend in death while his own legacy was pretty much dissolved thanks to Mozart's rise to immortality.<br/><br/>The life of Mozart (the wonderful Tom Hulce), as seen through Salieri's eyes, is one of ""why is this crude man so talented while I can't even get my own operas revived?"" In his lifetime, Mozart was praised yet had difficulties sustaining his livelihood, but Salieri had great financial success. Even that didn't appease him, so what does one artist do to another to ensure that they don't succeed? Drive them to death, of course! In a plot twist straight out of the classic Gothic horror, Salieri disguises himself in an evil looking masked cape which Mozart's own deceased father had worn, and hires Mozart to write a requiem. The twist of Salieri's scheme? He intends to take claim for writing the requiem-for Mozart's own funeral! <br/><br/>On the surface, Salieri is not an evil man. He's actually pretty decent all around, but when this young upstart comes into the midst of the royal court he works in, Salieri and the other members of Emperor Joseph's court are livid. The madness takes over when Mozart has an affair with the star of his Turkish opera whom Salieri loved. On the opening night, Mozart's engagement to another young lady (Elizabeth Berridge) is announced, which upsets diva Christine Ebersole and alerts Salieri to their affair. Pretending to be Mozart's only friend in the court, Salieri becomes amazed, impressed and even touched as he watches him work. But the evil of envy is a stronger emotion and this leads to the deed that threatens to destroy Salieri's soul.<br/><br/>Eccentric Mozart is presented here as a sort of punk rock Mozart, seeing something in opera besides fat women chewing up the scenery with their sometimes shrill voices. Indeed, his operas are very touching, and are staged with the opulence of the most magnificent musical theater. These shows are fully staged musical dramas which happen to be totally sung through, making the old fashioned style of opera seem totally pretentious. His operas like ""The Marriage of Figaro"", ""Don Giovanni"" and ""The Magic Flute"" are all lavish fantasies or tragedies, and are brilliantly recreated here with the Academy of St Martin in The Fields. Mozart didn't just appeal to the royals or aristocracy, but the gallery as well, poor people who desperately wanted escape. Escape is what you get here, especially with a shot of some genuine Vienese pastries. <br/><br/>Elegant, funny, sad, touching and profound, this adaption of the hit Broadway play is probably the most deserving Best Picture Oscar Winner of the past 40 years. Even at over 2 1/2 hours long, it moves at a fast pace, taking the viewer into a visual eyefest of what life during the pre-days of the French Revolution was like in Europe. In fact, King Joseph (Jeffrey Jones) happened to be Marie Antoniette's brother, and mentions briefly the issues going on with the French people. Poor Mozart isn't some obnoxious show-off fool; He's given many different dimensions that make him truly likable and interesting. Salieri isn't a one dimensional villain, either. His motivations are totally identifiable even if his actions aren't. Not bad for a stage actor whose most remembered film role prior to this was as an effeminate gay bath house customer in ""The Ritz""."

","As breathtaking as Amadeus is, not everyone will like it. Everybody will agree the acting as a whole, and by Abraham and Hulce alone, are top notch but there are some people that hate opera, can't stand classical music and will laugh too hard at the outfits. Luckily, I am not one of those people. The acting is always the one thing I pay attention to the most, all other film aspects follow soon after. But with this, the sets and costumes are so good, you can't take your eyes off the screen. You are suckered into seeing a cast of fine actors, with two underrated actors named F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce leading the group. Even if people don't like classic or opera, the way that they are placed in this is sure to blow the viewer away. There is one scene where Salieri (Abraham) plays a fine composition then gives Mozart (Hulce) to critique. Mozart likes it, but makes it even a better piece in an instant. No matter the viewer, they will find that bit really cool.<br/><br/>Amadeus tells the fictional story of talented composer, Antonio Salieri in an insane asylum who claims to have killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When they were kids, Salieri always liked Mozart's music and has always been jealous of him. His envy grows the older they get and swears revenge, not knowing Mozart already has a lot on his plate. Salieri attempts to destroy Mozart by any means necessary.<br/><br/>In classic take of jealousy and revenge, Abraham gives a white-knuckling performance as one of the the screen's evilest and craziest villains. Tom Hulce's portrayal as Mozart is comical and haunting, funny one minute and serious the next. Not sure if Mozart really was like this, but Hulce gives one of those few instances where a comical character can be serious and Oscar- worthy. The music, sets, and costumes do fabulous jobs in enhancing an already fine movie experience.<br/><br/>4/4"
"atlasmb","10","0","2","3 October 2014"," A Great Film
","""Amadeus"" is one of the great films of all time. It is a fictionalization of the later years of Mozart's life, though it does contain many actual happenings from his life.<br/><br/>Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a musical genius who possesses some juvenile qualities. He is impetuous, immature, naïve, given to fanciful behavior. At the same time, he is a gifted musician and a driven composer. His marries a young woman named Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), who proves to be dedicated to her husband. <br/><br/>Wolfgang lives in the shadow of his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), who groomed him from an early age for musical success, escorting him throughout Europe where he performed for crowned heads and ecclesiastics. Mozart's devotion and desire for the approval of his father never waivers, even after Leopold's death.<br/><br/>The story of the film is told--primarily in flashback--by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), another composer in Vienna, a man who both worshipped and despised Mozart. This duality of feeling is the focus of the film. Salieri--more than anyone else--recognizes the genius of Mozart's work, but finds Mozart the man to be a repudiation from God, to whom he had dedicated his life. Mozart's vulgarity offends Salieri, causing him to vow enmity toward God.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is superior: the music (naturally), the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the costuming, the makeup, the lighting, etc. The performance of Tom Hulce is brave. Jeffrey Jones, who plays Emperor Joseph II, shows why he may be the most underrated actor in Hollywood. F. Murray Abraham's performance is inspired.<br/><br/>In at least three scenes, Abraham as Salieri describes Mozart's music with an adoration that is palpable, blessing the viewer with a rarefied experience. Through him, we experience the bliss that Mozart's genius permits. Mozart and Salieri have a complex relationship that ""Amadeus"" explores beautifully. It certainly deserved the Oscar for Best Film."

","While browsing through the INTK board, I came across a thread from two days ago, where someone had a query about a show about three pandas. It turned out to be ""Pandamonium"", a show I have never watched. But I was reminded by another show, that I did watch back in the 90s (and I suppose it was new back then). It too was about three pandas. They were two males and one female, who went on missions around the world. I remember that one of the males was big and the other was small, and I guess they followed the usual cartoon dynamic of the big, stupid guy and the smaller but snarter guy. I also think that the show had an environmental message, just like many others shows back then. I don't remember the plot of any episode, except that one took place in Norway (I come from Sweden, and it was the closest this show came to do an episode about my country) and it ended with the main trio looking at northern lights. <br/><br/>ETA: The big male was a ""real"" panda a k a giant panda, while the smaller male was a so called ""red panda"" or cat-bear, thus not actually a panda at all. I don't remember what the female looked like, but she was closer to the smaller male in size. It's possible that she too was a ""red panda"" a k a cat-bear. I have no idea in what country this cartoon was made. The main characters probably came from Asia though, since their species are native to that very region."

"david-meldrum","10","0","2","15 July 2014"," A masterpiece about a creator of masterpieces
","I don't speak the language of classical music. Not because I don't like it, not because I can't recognise it as beautiful or brilliant, not out of some sort of inverted snobbery. It's simply that it takes much work for me, like a very alien language. I don't have the time or energy for another language in my life, so I leave well alone. <br/><br/>As proof that this is the case, not dislike or ignorance or whatever else people have opined to me as the reason, I offer consistently one of my favourite films. Amadeus was released in 1984, the year of my eleventh birthday. I can't recall when I first saw the film - I suspect about 3 years later on its television premiere - but it made a huge impact on me. In the year of forty-first birthday that impact hasn't diminished. <br/><br/>It's directed by Milos Forman (most famous for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and adapted by the great Peter Shaffer from his own stage play. It tells the story of Mozart's professional life through the lens of court composer Antonio Salieri, a man tormented by his own relative mediocrity. It opens with an elderly Salieri in some kind institution for the mentally ill, claiming he killed Mozart and unburdening himself to a priest. Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death. <br/><br/>It's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other. <br/><br/>Most of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existential torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.<br/><br/>Based in truth as it is (though how true it actually is, I don't know), the film achieves a kind of truth much more true than mere facts, uncovering the deeper realities of limited humanity's quest for transcendence. That's why, for instance, the American accents the actors keep throughout the film don't bother me one jot. The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations. <br/><br/>It's a film which teaches me about beauty, hope, work, creativity and the freedom to take all my prayers - not just the safe, nice ones - to God and leave theme there. In my life as I live it, it's unmatched, unique and irreplaceable. I can't imagine my life without it; and I don't own a single note of Mozart's music."

","The modern has to be reminded that at the time of Mozart's death--at age 36--Mozart would have been regarded as something of a failure. Only a handful of his work had ever been performed in his lifetime. He did die impoverished, he did have a pauper's funeral in a common pauper's grave. He was a vulgar person, given to scatological humor, he was given to drink--and for a small person, alcohol would be more disastrous than for a larger person. (These details are well documented.)<br/><br/>Salieri, on the other hand, was highly successful, acclaimed, and honored by the court for his musical talent.<br/><br/>The canard about Salieri poisoning Mozart has been around since Mozart died.<br/><br/>Salieri asks the question: How could God give someone as vulgar as Mozart genius while he, Salieri, dedicated his life to pious living in thanks for the musical talent God had given him. The viewer starts the movie towards the end of his life and he confesses that he murdered Mozart and as the film unfolds, it turns out that Salieri thinks he killed Mozart by overworking him on ""The Requium."" (This despite, in reality, Salieri had no hand in Mozart's production of ""The Requium""--that is a piece of liberty with reality.) Salieri could not be a genius but he could nurture a genius--or so he thinks in his last delusional days in an insane asylum. And Salieri--in the movie--is aware of the irony that Mozart is a genius lacking in the external trappings of genius, while he--Salieri--is a mediocrity but honored with the trappings of genius.<br/><br/>I thought the movie excellent and worth having in one's private collection. Performances were first rate, theatrical renderings of the Mozart pieces were interesting. To ask whether the details of the film accurately reflect reality is to miss the symbolic and anagogic import the movie asks regarding the nature of creativity."

","F. Murray Abraham and Thomas Hulce star as Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, respectively, in this lavish period piece. I say ""lavish"" because among the film's greatest strengths is its visual style, including the sets, the costumes and the cinematography.<br/><br/>The film is a slow-burning drama that focuses on character emotion and its connection with the music of the composers in the film. We are always peering deep into the souls of Salieri and Mozart as they live with their passion for music. Salieri is particularly fascinating because of his deep admiration, hatred and jealousy of Mozart all at once; he speaks of his music with great reverence, yet bears a deep grudge against God for making the composer of such music a man as arrogant and childish as Mozart, though Salieri himself needs to look in the mirror.<br/><br/>The music is integrated beautifully with the film, either as simply its score, or to correspond with a character reading or imagining certain musical pieces. It's a consistently beautiful film, but it can drag on when it takes its time with a scene; the drama isn't tense so much as it is in a constant state of rising and falling emotion, much like the music itself.<br/><br/>It's a very good film, but if I had to, I'd say that watching it must be similar to going to the opera, an activity that I can only speculate upon, since I've never been; kind of boring, but beautiful and meaningful all the same."

","That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. <br/><br/>Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice.<br/><br/>We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man.<br/><br/>Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve.<br/><br/>A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition.<br/><br/>Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means ""Loved by God"" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music."

","As a student of art history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across on screen. Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation). When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas. And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri. And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway). Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity ""Shakespeare in Love"", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar! There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and clichés about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see ""Amadeus"" instead!"

This movie is different....your expectations can ruin (or alternatively, surprise you) of watch you see (and hear). The music is as much a star in this movie as the actors. I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but that doesn't matter. Salieri is furious at God...how could HE possibly have this (what he considers to be a vulgar and moronic boy) produce such beautiful, transfixing music???? His envy, and his fury at God ruin the rest of his life (which is another aspect of this movie that is worth thinking about). I highly recommend this movie. Your time will have been well spent."

","The life story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart told retrospectively from the perspective of his contemporary and rival, the imperial composer Antonio Salieri, who at the end of his life is confessing to a priest in a believe that he is responsible for Mozarts death. Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes. This is one of the titles that absolutely no one should miss, but either before or after viewing, it may be good to read historically accurate story."

","Why would any actor perform to the best of their amazing abilities in a fabulous, moving movie just to then perform in mainly mediocre movies later on then retire from the world stage? Ending on a good note is good for a mediocre actor (cue Kristen Stewart, Please!!!) but I felt that Tom Hulce had so much more to give.<br/><br/>With Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) giving us the prologue, the story is based on Salieri's jealousy and envy for Mozart. Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3). Every actor is brilliant and as I mentioned Tom Hulce is amazing and I can't understand why he retired so soon. In short this movie is well worth seeing time and time again. I love this movie purely for the beauty and musical passion that goes into every scene.<br/><br/>Amadeus will always be renowned as a classic and I am telling you to see it to truly appreciate it's amazement.

Everything in this film stood out to me whether it was the glorious acting, the wonderful costume design, or just the symphonies of Mozart themselves.<br/><br/>This film is essentially about the last ten years of Mozart's life. This movie goes in detail about how an ordinary composer Salieri who is looking for greatness does not like Mozart simply because he longs for greatness.<br/><br/>The acting is just wonderful. The relatively unknowns F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce were very good in the roles. I could feel their emotions, their pain just by watching the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserves nothing but the highest praise.

","This lengthy biopic of one of the most renowned musician is filled with sad, depressing, exciting and touching moments but not a single dull one. Hell, I neither have a fascination nor knowledge on operas which constitute the majority of runtime. Every aspect of the movie has something exciting about it, be it the point of view, energy levels, actors I had no idea about etc, etc. <br/><br/>Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the life, times and his troubled relationship with a prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) he couldn't compete with and resorted to destroy him. Mozart's passion and pure genius is identified by his father Leopold (Roy Dotrice) at a very young age and prepares him for greatness, but the tremendous expectations, his poor business and social skills leads to gambling and alcohol addiction also taking his supporting wife Constance (Elizabeth Berridge) down with him.<br/><br/>The best part about the movie is the point of view that of Salieri who alone saw Mozart's true potential and genius and was the most affected by him. The way Abraham explains to the priest about beauty of Mozart's music, how he was never able to compete and how a God fearing just man like him resorted to low politics and scheming is one of the best performances you could come across. While featuring medleys of Mozart's popular compositions, the background score stays competent enough to make a mark of its own. The screenplay is energetic pushing an incredible number of heartfelt moments perfectly justifying Salieri's actions at the same time making you feel for Mozart. <br/><br/>Just like Mozart's music, this movie is a joy for everyone."

","When it was suggested to Milos Forman to make a film about Mozart, one of the most famous classical composers, he was, well, reluctant. A period biopic with wigs and music of the 18th century didn't seem to be the right choice for him nor for a larger audience. Only when he saw Peter Shaffer's play, a highly fictionalized account of the rivalry of Mozart and the Viennese court composer Antonio Salieri, he immediately understood its potential - and turned it into a masterpiece. Strangely enough, the period biopic with wigs and decades old music became a box office hit as well...<br/><br/>The reasons why ""Amadeus"" succeeds, simply put: Shaffer knows how to write a dramatic story and Forman how to film it. The inaccuracies are easily forgiven and we soon accept Mozart as the ingenious but always broke goofball and Salieri as the scheming man in the background, driven by his simmering jealousy. Both of the leads, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart, portray their characters with dedication, passion and unrelenting fervor when the script demands it - after ""Amadeus"" they will always be remembered for those two roles. But a perfect production is more than the cast: Mozart's music of course stars prominently in the picture, placed in highly effective conjunction with cinematographic delicacies Forman serves one after the other sculpting Mozart's fragmented life into a magical whole. While plentifully used the composer's pieces are never repeated thematically, so that the viewer really gets a glimpse into the complete array of the genius' mind, into the playfulness, the love for his craft, the commitment he exudes, all assets on which his secret opponent eventually will break. ""Amadeus"" might be a biopic paired with wild speculation, but it is highly dramatic yet entertaining, elevating and tragic. And high art - cinematographically, story-wise and musically divine."

","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as depicted in Peter Shaffer's abundantly successful Amadeus, has father issues. Although he enabled his son's musical career by parading his freakish talents across Europe like a circus sideshow (and profiting from his displays of precocious virtuosity), Leopold Mozart won't indulge Amadeus a bit of irreverent fun, and disapproves of his financial recklessness and his wife's inability to keep a clean house. Mozart rebels after his father's death by summoning his militaristic ghost through a very serious-sounding opera. Antonio Salieri, who rejoiced at the death of his non-musical, biological father, rebels on a much grander scale against his spiritual father for having created Salieri with a burning desire to create music, but lacking the talent to excel, while imbuing Mozart, a vulgar creature, with musical genius. Salieri's revenge materializes in an extremely indirect scheme in which he anonymously commissions a financially strapped, physically ailing Mozart to compose a requiem mass for his dead father. Tom Hulce, whose superbly entertaining portrayal of Mozart emphasizes the wackiness of his character, cannot, in a convincing way, deliver Mozart's proclamation that the requiem project is killing him. Salieri's suicidal guilt, however, over a murder plot that we cannot recognize as such, is convincing, because if Mozart were not dying from Salieri's disguised insistence on, and overt assistance in, the composition of the requiem, then, in Salieri's mind, there would be no revenge. What Salieri lacks in musical acumen, and will lack in posthumous recognition, he more than compensates with psychological intensity. All of the instances of mockery and one-upmanship directed toward Salieri, though beautifully amusing to us, don't amass to the superiority of Salieri's emotional depth over Mozart's. From beginning to end, Amadeus is more about Salieri (even a highly fabricated version of him) than it is about Mozart. Mozart's primary dilemma in the film—his desire to create popular music loved by all, while still satisfying his artistic inclination toward the avant garde, as well as the predominantly conservative sensibilities of his primary employers—culminates in an ideological confrontation between Mozart and the court of Emperor Joseph II, who has discovered, through a stretch of espionage perpetrated by none other than Salieri, that Mozart has composed an opera based on The Marriage of Figaro, a comic play banned by the Emperor. At first, Mozart tries to appeal to the emperor's love of music by relating the excitingly innovative musical attributes of the piece. Quickly, the argument turns to the source material, which the members of Joseph's court agree is ""vulgar."" This sets Mozart off into a tirade against ""elevated"" art. ""Why must we go on forever writing only about gods and legends?"" he asks the court. ""Because they do,"" explains Baron Van Swieten, ""they go on forever. Or at least what they represent. The eternal in us."" Emperor Joseph quietly considers both sides. Jeffrey Jones' pivotal performance here as the emperor is his best, and one of the best in the film: hilarious and finely crafted. Mozart's dilemma, while reflecting the main theme of the movie, remains academic. Salieri's dilemma, on the other hand—between his unbridled appreciation for Mozart's musical supremacy—a supremacy which Salieri feels that he alone recognizes in its time—and his overwhelming jealousy over his own inescapable inferiority—dramatically courses through every frame of the film like lifeblood through the veins of a madman. Lest we conclude that the multiply revisited dilemma of Salieri is composed of too few notes, an assessment of F. Murray Abraham's intricately brilliant, Oscar-winning triumph proves quite the contrary. Abraham tackles every return to Salieri's venomous quarrel with his imprisoning lot with fresh, specific, passionate, artistic choices—on par with Mozart's legendary choices in the musical realm. Playing both the reflective, embittered, aged incarnation of Salieri, who narrates from within a physical asylum, and the younger Salieri, trapped within the asylum of his mind and situation, Abraham's performance serves the dual purpose of conveying the mad vengeance of Salieri's mediocrity and fleshing out the mad genius of his rival and idol—through infinitely expressive, stirring reactions to Mozart's accomplishments and to Salieri's unraveling defeat. Salieri's dilemma culminates in a climactic scene in which Salieri takes dictation from a dying Mozart, struggling to capture his uncontainable creativity, visibly and vocally admiring his ability, while gently helping him to his early grave. Outstanding performances by Abraham, Hulce, Jones, and the rest of the cast are accompanied by the Oscar-winning direction of Milos Forman and definitive renditions by The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, conducted by Neville Marriner, whose musical recordings Forman weaves into the narrative like an expert artisan crafting a masterful tapestry."

","I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered. Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart. We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy. Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin. He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri. Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak. The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold. In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real. This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement. He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down. He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee. Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy. On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy). The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning. This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away. The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10."

Even though most of the characters' stories are falsified for drama, it unfolds in a very entertaining way to some of the best music you could include in a film. The staging of the characters were brilliant, the acting was superb, and the costumes really look impeccable. They actually used all-natural lighting for the entire shoot, which makes you try and wrap-your-mind around how they achieved some of those shots, especially the lighting of the opera stage.

The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F.

","There's a scene near the beginning when we are first being introduced to the horny and slightly zany Mozart (Hulce), when he enters the court of the Austrian Emperor, surrounded by outlandishly attired royalty, couturiers, chatelains, stewards, Knights of the Round Table, personal trainers, and shoe shine boys. The Court Composer, Salieri (Abraham), admires the twenty-six year old Mozart with a passion and has written a little tune to celebrate his arrival at the court.<br/><br/>Mozart is pleased and flattered. He asks if he can play it at the piano. He sits down and plays the simple ditty. Then, listening intently, he hits one of the chords again and again, and asks, ""That's a little off, don't you think? Shouldn't it go like this?"" Then he rips through the tune, deconstructs it, and does to it what Sonny Rollins did to ""I'm An Old Cowhand"" and Stan Getz did to ""Autumn in New York."" Salieri looks on. His smile slowly fades into a frown. And the plot is set in motion. Salieri has slaved all his life to become a composer, driven by his love of music, in spite of his poor background and a father whose discouragements were strenuous.<br/><br/>And here is this young punk, prodded on by a stern musician father, performing as a child before royalty, a prodigy, giggling maniacally, mocking him, rippling along and making Salieri's tune sound like something children might sing in Kindergarten.<br/><br/>Salieri hates Mozart for being everything that Salieri is not. He plots against him, tries to knee-cap his career, spies on him, makes an attempt to steal his work even when Mozart is on his death bed, expiring in his mid-thirties. Salieri winds up telling the tale in flashback to a priest who visits him in the insane asylum in his old age.<br/><br/>The curious thing is that Mozart really WAS a musical prodigy. He could play the piano when he was tall enough to reach the keys. He learned the violin. He wrote a minuet was he was eight and had his first symphony published as a prepubescent boy. A similar skill in mathematics shows up at a similar age. By the time Mozart was my age, he'd been dead for thirty or forty years. It's a sobering thought. Too sobering. Calls for a bit of single malt neat. Hold on a moment.<br/><br/>There, that's better. Thank you. Those musical skills are obviously something constitutional. The subsequent opportunities to ""learn"" how to do it are adventitious. It's ""curious"" because it makes you wonder, if this ability isn't confined to a single culture, how many Mozarts have been born and died unrecognized among, say, the Australian aborigines. Not only didn't they have a stage father. They didn't know what a piano was. They had no instruments at all that allowed one to control the notes being played.<br/><br/>It's also ""curious"" because neither musical talent nor skill in higher mathematics is measured on any of the usual intelligence tests. Psychologists tend to dismiss these skills as mere ""aptitudes"" or ""talents"", as if calling them by a dismissive name discounts their importance. (The fact is probably that you can't measure them easily with a pencil and paper test.) Anyway, returning to the film, Abraham deserved his Academy Award, for what it's worth. He's quite good. So is Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor with the impenetrable expression and the eyes of a carp. Hulce and Berridge, who plays Mozart's wife Constanze, look the part but sound like two kids from Sherman Oaks. Hulce has the added disadvantage of speaking like Ryan O'Neal. I'm not certain that semi-deranged cackle was necessary -- we get the picture without it -- but okay.<br/><br/>Most of Mozart's music that we see on the screen are excerpts from his operas. I was never a big fan of opera. But I suppose in a big splashy award-winning movie you must fill the screen with colorful display. What's the alternative? Have Mozart sit at the piano and play one of his breathtaking sonatas? Milos Forman must have learned from MTV that you can't even do that with Elton John."

","There is one question that lies in the center of Milos Forman's 1984 Oscar-winning film, ""Amadeus"": Did Antonio Salieri really kill Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart? That question is handled unpredictably well in this splendid, majestic and never dated masterpiece of filmmaking; a morality play and a history lesson all mixed into one.<br/><br/>The film begins when Salieri {F. Murray Abraham, who won an Oscar for this role} is taken to an asylum in late 18th century Vienna for attempting to kill himself. A minister visits him and asks him why he tried to commit suicide. Salieri says that he tried to commit suicide because he thought that he had killed Mozart. He soon tells about his memories of his own life and Mozart's.<br/><br/>When we first meet young Mozart {Tom Hulce}, he acts like a little child. He is then invited to have an audience with Emperor Joseph II. Back then, Salieri was the court composer for the Emperor. When Salieri first listens to Mozart's music, he becomes jealous at him. Later, he realizes that Mozart's music is the voice of God. Salieri calls God an enemy and tries to stop Mozart once and for all.<br/><br/>Forman here turns all the ingredients of making a film into a tasteful and delicious whole. Peter Shaffer's script which he adapted from his play, gives a thoughtful and insightful look at Salieri and Mozart. Miroslaw Ondricek's cameras and Patriza Von Brandenstein's sets helps give old Vienna a realistic look and version.<br/><br/>Abraham and Hulce both deliver strong and unbelievable performances. As Salieri, Abraham gives a stunning portrayal of a man who is torn between the lord and one man. As Mozart, Hulce finds the right balance between comedy and drama. He plays his character with the brain of a child and the heart of a young man with a braying laugh that never gets annoying. The supporting cast including Jeffrey Jones, Roy Dotrice, Elizabeth Berridge and Cynthia Nixon all hold their own roles very well.<br/><br/>The film's final half hour is a striking moment to behold. In there, Mozart talks to Salieri about their music as Mozart becomes ill. This is a great narrative gem of a film that will put a smile and maybe a tear on both lovers and non lovers of classical music alike.<br/><br/>FYI: This is the director's cut version of the film.

Theoretically that is, of course, true, but try telling that to Antonio Salieri, a leading musician of his time who has reached the highest heights only to run across Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who, as far as Salieri is concerned, is composing music on another plane, one inaccessible to mere mortals, in short Salieri felt a little like Bing Crosby when Frank Sinatra appeared on the popular music scene. Foreman's film, which is sumptuous and chock full of music, is really about Salieri rather than Mozart and F. Murray Abraham manages to inhabit the embittered Italian admirably whilst Tom Hulce offers light relief as a Mozart who is portrayed as immature at all times except when actually composing.

","The oldest known play in the history of drama is ""The Persians"" by Aeschylus. He wants to celebrate the Greek victory in the persian wars and in order to make his point more effective instead of writing about his victorious countrymen he writes about the defeated side. Peter Shaffer uses essentially the same dramatic trick. He shows genius through the eyes of mediocrity. Not just any mediocrity : a mediocrity capable of recognizing genius, which makes it still more tragic. This film is a masterpiece, and the script is one of the main reasons. If you are interested in more insight into the characters do yourself a favor and read the original play. Apart from many parts missing in the film, such as Mozart's relation with the masons, his views on opera etc, you may find that the lack of visual distraction helps build a more balanced picture of Mozart in your mind."

Murray Abraham) is perplexed because as he sees it,a talent for music is a gift from God,and he cannot for the life of him understand why such a gift is given to what he describes as a crass,crude,vulgar creature such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(Tom Hulce,and gives him,a more respectful and God fearing man,next to nothing in return.It is obvious from start to finish that all involved worked very hard to make this a great film.The hard work paid off in leaps and bounds.Great film!"
"andrewbareham","10","0","1","29 January 2011"," One of the greatest films of all time.
","Based on my experience, no film has provided the audience with a more accurate portrayal of arrogance, jealousy, hatred, and madness.<br/><br/>You witness F. Murray Abraham gradually slip into insanity as his desire to be better than Mozart engulfs him. Tom Hulce is brilliant in this film as you watch his work take over and destroy his life. The film has an overtone of irony and atheism that comes to fruition with Mozart's unfinished composition followed by his funeral. <br/><br/>This film gives the viewer a realistic look at life: You're born, You do great things, You are unappreciated, You die. If you are religious the last scene will leave you with the question ""If there is a god, why would he torture me like this? What did I do to deserve this?"" Which is a very important question to ask. <br/><br/>If you are an artist, you will be able to relate to these characters better than any other film. This has been my favorite film since I was six years old and I don't foresee any film ever taking it's place."

","In the beginning we see Antonio Salieri attempting a suicide by splitting his throat.He claims he killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791.He tells his story to a young priest in lunatic asylum.Milos Forman has done an excellent job in bringing the stage play of Amadeus to the big screen.The original play is the work of Peter Shaffer, who also wrote the screenplay.He earned an Academy Award nomination.The film won eight of those awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role.The play happened in 1979, the movie happened in 1984.F. Murray Abraham gives an outstanding performance as Salieri.Tom Hulce was nominated for an Oscar, and his portrayal as Mozart is unique.Elizabeth Berridge is amazing as Constanze Mozart.Roy Dotice does brilliant work as the father, Leopold Mozart.Richard Frank is very good as Father Vogler.Christine Ebersole is wonderful as Katerina Cavalieri.Jeffrey Jones does good job as Emperor Joseph II.Charles Kay is great as Count Orsini-Rosenberg.The young Cynthia Nixon makes a good Lorl.The story that is told of Mozart and Salieri is most fascinating, even though it's only loosely based on their lives.It is pretty unbelievable to watch this young genius battling with his final work, the Requiem, which was left unfinished.The music we hear in this motion picture is absolutely amazing.And the way it's used...This is a classic you don't want to miss."

","Milos Forman's epic biopic on arguably the world's most famous classical composer is nothing short of compelling. Peter Shaffer, who wins one of the film's eight Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, adapts his own acclaimed stage play of the same name for the big screen.<br/><br/>The film is set in the late 18th century and is told in a flashback narrated by an aged Antonio Salieri living in a mental asylum. Salieri was a competent court composer who became envious when he realized Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had godlike musical gifts that he had always desired. Soon, Salieri became mad with jealousy and began plotting the downfall of Mozart, even harboring thoughts of murdering him.<br/><br/>History revealed that Mozart was poisoned to death. But was it Salieri who really murdered him? Amadeus explores the myth and dumbfounds us even further by subtly inferring that it may be and may not be Salieri who killed Mozart. The apparent greatness of Forman's film is that it even prompts us to believe that there is a possibility that Mozart may have worked himself to death. The mystery remains unclear.<br/><br/>But Forman's film is not an account of Mozart's death, but rather a celebration of his life and his music and how Salieri's own pales in comparison. The contrast is obvious. Mozart is portrayed as a rude, impish, and womanizing figure while Salieri is religious, shuns alcohol, and has good social manners. Yet God chooses to bestow incredible musical talent on the former.<br/><br/>Stage actor F. Murray Abraham who wins an Oscar for his role as Salieri gives an excellent, nuanced performance. And for a character who barely reveals his emotions to anyone, Abraham manages to accomplish that through the minimal use of facial expressions. He is so skillful that the subtle acting invites us to show sympathy towards his character even though he is portrayed as 'an ambiguous villain' in the film. On the other hand, Tom Hulce's Oscar-nominated turn as Mozart is energetic, vibrant, and he tops it up with a silly but infectious high-pitched laugh that is perhaps what is remembered best by many.<br/><br/>Amadeus not only deals with the rivalry between the two central characters, but Salieri's love-hate relationship with God as well. This creates a triangular tension which brings a more satisfying depth to the film. Forman's decision to film most of the scenes in his native homeland of Czechoslovakia pays off wonderfully, contributing to the film's realism as many of the city's architecture dates back to Mozart's era.<br/><br/>Amadeus is surprisingly engaging despite its subject matter and that it runs close to three hours. The brilliant selection of Mozart's compositions (conducted and supervised by Neville Marriner) that make up the film's heavenly soundtrack is, in my opinion, the defining factor that makes Amadeus such a sumptuous, glorious period epic.<br/><br/>GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","I saw this movie 5 times and I loved it every time. What if it's a historical fiction? Without this movie, Salieri's works would be unknown today to the general public. <br/><br/>The film itself has everything: funny moments, emotional moments, great script, the costumes and settings are a delight to the eye, the acting is perfect. Yes, perfect, and that goes even for the smallest roles. First of all, F.M. Abraham's interpretation is a masterpiece. He plays both Salieri as an adult and as an old man. And he does an exquisite job with both of them. Tom Hulce is a great W.A. Mozart: flamboyant, funny, pantagruelesque, playful and solemn at the same time. All the actors did the best with their parts. I remember the scene where Mozart's maid cries before Salieri...just look at her facial expression. The horror is so real! Or when Salieri reads Mozart's manuscripts: that is the look of a transcended man; Salieri looks like he just had an orgasm. This movie has a lot of strong points, but the acting is the best of them. I have mentioned just a few, but Orsini-Rosenberg, capellmeister Bonno, Emanuel Schikaneder, Katerina Cavalieri were all played masterfully. <br/><br/>This movie is a titan of it's genre. 10 out of 10."
"amitnagpal1985","10","0","1","30 December 2010"," I could not believe my ears or my eyes.
","I was going through all the movies that had won the Oscar for best picture and my streak of having watched most of them ended at 1985. I had not seen Amadeus or even ever heard of it. So i rented this DVD with reservations about watching some preachy drama about the life of Mozart but boy was i surprised after the first 5 minutes, that's how long this movie takes to grip you.. grip you very tightly. I have never experienced this kind of delight at the very beginning of a movie. The acting is great, The director deserved his Oscar many times over and the costumes are just breathtaking but all of it fades in front of the Music, the music that is timeless, the music you probably didn't even know was composed by the great Mozart. This story transcends time and connects to you on a personal level, its a story about jealousy, brilliance, passion, music, mediocrity, selfishness and above all creativity. Some of us have to chisel hard to get out the best of us but some are just born with the perfect composition. This movie gets a perfect 10."
"dgroberts27","10","0","1","18 December 2010"," My favorite film
","I remember seeing this film when I was 17. I had purchased the DVD in Chicago as a gift to my dad, thinking a winner of 8 Oscars was sure to be entertaining to him. I came home one night afterwords and decided to watch it by myself. From the very beginning, with the music, dialog, and action on screen, I felt as though I was taking my first sips of a fine wine. By the end, I was intoxicated. Amadeus is, in my humble opinion, the greatest film ever made. The performances by F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are among the greatest of all time, and both were rightfully nominated for Best Actor. Abraham won, and it seems fitting that he as Salieri would triumph where the character himself could not. Amadeus also has some of the greatest music ever put into a film, not just because of the music itself, but because of how it seems to carry us through all of the jealousy, madness, frivolity, and perfection of the film. It resonates like no other score I've heard in a film, perhaps because it is Mozart's, and it acts like a tribute to his own greatness while at the same time looming over Salieri as a reminder of his futile mediocrity. And then the story itself. To be sure, this is pure legend, but glorious legend all the same. It is an exaggeration of a man's jealousy over someone who was simply better, and who he felt did not deserve to be. The theme is one most, if not all of us can relate to on some level. I watch many films many times over, but this is one I take in only every so often, because I still feel almost drunk with delight every time I watch it. It is one of the few films that I truly see as a pleasure to watch. It is beyond mere entertainment. It is cinema at it's pinnacle. It is, for me, the most perfect film."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","0","1","19 September 2010"," Funny,charming,tragic.
","Tom Hulce delivers magic as Mozart in Amadeus, director Milos Foreman's tragic, funny, and charming best picture winner. Amadeus isn't my favorite of Foreman's films but I was so delighted by it, I wanted to hug it.<br/><br/>The film is told through the eyes of an Italian composer named Salieri(played excellently by F. Murray Abrham in his Oscar winning role), who after trying to commit suicide admits to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(Oscar nominee Tom Hulce). So a priest goes and listens to his confessions.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Salierti, now an old man, tells the story of his relationship with Mozart. It shows his hatred for him, his jealousy, and how Mozart's success was Salierti's failure,and vice versa.<br/><br/>The film is very educational. It taught me things that I didn't know. Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrham are marvelous. It's a shame that they never went on to do that much afterwards. Had Hulce won the Oscar, he might have been a household name.<br/><br/>Like almost all of Foreman's films, it shows real people rise and fall. And I didn't expect to see Mozart fall. And when he does, we feel for him. REally, I felt for both characters. Because you're supposed to choose between Mozart and Salierti. Andf it's a tough choice. Amadeus is tragic and sweet, and for people with brains,to say the least. It's a classic that will live in my heart and charm me forever for the years to come.<br/><br/>4/4"
"paul2001sw-1","9","0","1","2 September 2010"," Triumphantly musical
","Milos Forman's film of the life of Mozart is long, flamboyant, not especially subtle, defiantly unhistorical and above all else, triumphantly musical. It will tell you almost nothing about the real Mozart's life, but it is steeped in his work, which infuses the whole film with vitality and purpose. The only thing I didn't like was the way that Forman sidesteps the problem of making antique dialogue sound both plausible and fresh by having every word uttered in contemporary American, which never completely ceases to jar. Among the cast, I particularly enjoyed Jeffrey Jones (the emperor) and his display of understated stupidity; Muaary Abraham won Oscars as Salieri, but it's a showy role, albeit in a film that is showy, and wonderfully so."

"TBoldOne","10","0","1","20 August 2010"," A Masterpiece of the Human Condition & Music
","This is such a beautiful movie. The movie asks the following question. What would you do if you knew the thing you most loved to do you in this world you were given only mediocre talent for? And as a further curse you are given the ability to recognize true genius in your midst, but you cannot be a genius yourself? How would you react?<br/><br/>The movie is told from the viewpoint of Anthony Solieri, a modest composer of Mozart's era. He is happily earning a living as a composer. Everything is fine until he meets Mozart.Given some musical talent Solieri instinctively recognizes the Mozart is an absolute musical genius. Trouble is, Mozart is a crass obnoxious slob. He can't believe that he, who has played by all the rules, who was a devout person could be cursed. The curse is that he recognizes that he's just a hack, and this bore, Mozart, will be go onto musical immortality. How would you react to that? Could you handle the injustice of it all? The music in the movie is beautiful. The acting and costumes are beautiful. The movie deserved every award it received that year. An absolute classic on the human condition.<br/><br/>Several people have criticized the movie because it's not biographical about Mozart. Ironically with the title of Amadaeus, it's really not supposed to be about Mozart. Mozart just serves as a metaphor on the human condition that this movie so brilliantly illustrates, namely that Life is Not Fair."
"MOscarbradley","8","0","2","8 February 2008"," Great music; just don't expect to be intellectually challenged
","I suppose the intellectual arguments should challenge us more but then what's there to argue about it. Mozart may or may not have behaved like a spoiled child, like an irresponsible rock star of his time, but there is no disputing his genius. Salieri may have fussed and fretted and been pathologically jealous of the younger man but little good it did him, (or us, who must listen to him ranting on for close on three hours). Still, this is a sumptuous, if overlong, entertainment, visually gorgeous and sonically superb. There is a lot of music, and what music, but it is never performed in a manner so po-faced as to put off a mas cinema-going audience. (It didn't; the film was a huge success and won several Oscars including Best Picture). F Murray Abraham is a suitably reptilian Salieri although he hardly deserved the Oscar for Best Actor and Tom Hulce is a likeably gauche Mozart. Just don't expect anything too deep."
"Jace007","10","0","3","30 January 2001"," The Fall Of Salieri
","Putting aside historical facts - this is a great and powerful movie. In my opinion this movie was not only about Mozart, but mainly the fall of Salieri. *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO APPEAR*** Salieri is potrayed brilliantly by F Murray Abraham as a good man, a man of God, until he is driven to destruct something he loves and appreciates with all his heart due to his jealously of the young and uncouth Mozart (Tom Hulce). The movie mainly follows Salieri attempts to first befriend Mozart, then try to become better Mozart and then finally trying to destruct Mozart - all in the name of love of Mozarts magic. The movie also explores Mozarts relationship with his father Leopold, and how through his death, Salieri uses it to his advantage. Yes, the movie is about Mozart - but it is also a movie about falling from grace. Highly Recommended."
