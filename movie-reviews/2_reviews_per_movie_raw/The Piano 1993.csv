"alannarmiller","9","88","117","30 July 2007"," I felt the need to just replace the previous ignorant comment
","The Piano is a beautiful film in many different respects. In terms of cinematography, I've seen few like it. It is dark and beautiful and compelling. The story seems, on paper, as a torrid love story without much originality. But the sensuous portrayal of Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter and the complex acting of a young Anna Paquin allow this story to ring true. I was skeptical upon viewing a film so lauded by critics and film snobs, but found myself both moved and connected to the film that holds strangely relevant themes for modern times. It is rare that I love both a film's visual beauty and it's script as well. This is that rare occasion."
"sworden","10","32","41","13 September 2005"," A woman's idea of seduction, not a man's
","I wonder if an assessment of all the bad reviews of this movie would include almost all men. Although there are certainly men who enjoyed this movie, I can understand why a lot of men would fail to appreciate it, simply because so much of its sensual potency deals with what is inextricably feminine.<br/><br/>I just watched it for the the first time in ten years, and I was as wowed by it as I was the first time. If you told me I would ever find Harvey Keitel sexy, I would have called you crazy...but ooh baby! The man sees her inner passion and is transfixed, then reaches out to her with a graphicness that is somehow also tender, almost reverential. In contrast, Sam Neill is blindly reaching out like he would to a wooden doll, not seeing ""her"" at all. It's a delicious contrast and heightens the beauty of the very real connection that occurs between the lovers. <br/><br/>Ada (Holly Hunter's) response is to be wooed despite herself. She doesn't ""want"" to give herself to this man who is so contrary to her image of a lover, but she recognizes his identification with who she is. Willful as she is, once her heart is given, it becomes impossible for her to do other than to seek him out. This is truly an archetypal dance."
"namaturner","9","102","151","6 February 2001"," Amazing Film Making
","This is one of my all-time favorite films.  It combines masterful scripting, cinematography, performances, and musical score into a disturbing, erotic, and ultimately uplifting piece.  The movie's heroine, wonderfully portrayed by Holly Hunter, is mute (symbolic of the fact that she has no say in her own life), with her daughter (the astonishing Anna Paquin) and her piano as her personal obsessions.  Her conscripted husband, coldly played by Sam Neill, is trying to win her heart and her desire in all the wrong ways, while his crude tribal neighbor, sensually played by Harvey Keitel, understands her needs and ultimately captures her ... physically, intellectually, and romantically.  The film's message and its delivery are extraordinarily  powerful, the cinematic technique is rich ... the sequence shot with Hunt, Pacquin, Keitel and the piano on the beach is one of the best pieces of work I've ever seen.  Lasting impact."

","Director-screenwriter Jane Campion started at the movies in the early 1980s at the Australian School of Film and Television... She clearly emerged from her cultural heritage to become one of the world's premiere female directors...<br/><br/>Campion's films typically have a treacherous terrain of searing emotional intensity... We recognize ourselves in the ways her characters think and behave... Her work signifies a break with the tragic, the Gothic and the sentimental... <br/><br/>Her exquisite film which won three Academy Awards including one for Campion's screenplay, is not about sex, but about passion...<br/><br/>Jane challenges the viewer on many levels... Her film (literary inspired from 'Wuthering Heights') explores new territory in the delicious handling of female sexuality and pleasure with the ecstasy of a loving relationship... <br/><br/>In one scene Ada, with tears of anger, hits Baines hard across the face, as if she has spoken words of love... With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remain locked together, the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed... Only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts... <br/><br/>No woman artist had approached sex in such a direct and liberating manner... Campion's scenes shows Baines' face crumpling with the exquisite pain of his pleasure... Ada moving his head to her chest, and Baines struggling through her dress anxious to touch her skin... <br/><br/>Nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film tells the story of Ada, a strong willful 19th-century Scotswoman who hasn't spoken, since she was six years old... Ada has been set up in an arranged marriage to a British emigrant in New Zealand...<br/><br/>The film opens with Ada who is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen to meet her husband Stewart, a landowner who is without much emotion or real love... Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs... On her head a black bonnet... Around her neck her pad and pen... <br/><br/>Campion manages to chose a cast to suit her purpose and style... Ada is not any easy role and Holly Hunter plays her without vanity... Her face is alight with facial expression, sometimes tender, sometimes sad, sometimes humorous, sometimes soft, while her hands and fingers are quick and neat...<br/><br/>Ada speaks through sign-language translated by her young daughter Flora, and through her beloved piano which happens to be the prime source of her expression... She takes great delight in feeling her fingers on her piano's keys... But in the way she eyes the illiterate, uncultured Baines, there is an insolence and lack of respect... We watch her stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck... <br/><br/>Harvey Kietel plays the lonely neighbor George Baines, a depressive man who is everything Stewart is not... He has never seen a graceful woman behave with so much abandon... Ada moves to the piano... She wants to touch it, but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it... Baines views Ada totally absorbed in her piano music... He seems satisfied to watch... He finds himself edging irresistibly closer, magnetically drawn to the spectacle...<br/><br/>Baines enjoys her fingers moving on the keys and the small details of motion on her face... Twice he closes his eyes and breathes deeply... He is experiencing a strange sense of appreciation and lust... He feels powerless... He is desperate and romantic... He no longer admires her absorption with the piano... He is jealous of it... His attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to the piano... Ada's long white neck proves irresistible... Baines comes across the room, kisses her, and asks: 'Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back.' <br/><br/>Anna Paquin has been proclaimed one of the best child acting roles ever... She gives a subtle and complex performance as the very cute little girl torn between her mother and stepfather... She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped suddenly... She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut... Her venture is one of challenge and curiosity... Her complex portrayal of Flora won her the Best Supporting Actress...<br/><br/>Sam Neill plays the intense, moralistic and very-Victorian husband Alistair Stewart, who never understands his woman's nature... He surveys Baines' hut suspiciously... There are sounds inside which are worrying him... By wondering around the hut, he finds a hole where he can see the two lovers kissing, and undressing... He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again...<br/><br/>Jane Campion creates an unusual film, poetic and lyrical, complimented by a beautiful cinematography of the haunting woods, which by many critics has been named as a masterpiece... She is the first female director to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes..."
"movieman9","Null","79","117","27 June 1999"," Magnificent, symbolic film masterpiece plays beautifully, like a piano.
","There are very few female directors in the film industry that have been given proper acknowledgment or had their works introduced to mainstream filmgoers. Jane Campion is one of these precious few, a director who carefully paces and sculpts her works so that they magnificently flow like a musical interlude. ""The Piano"" is her ultimate masterpiece, a film of such simplicity, described with calm and tense complexity. Holly Hunter received an Oscar for her fascinating performance as Ada, a mute woman who is forced into an arranged marriage with a New Zealand landowner, played convincingly by Sam Neill, a native Australian actor himself. Ada journeys to New Zealand with her young daughter (Anna Paquin, also an Oscar-winner that year), few other possessions, and her treasured piano, a part of her that amplifies her voice that she cannot express through vocal communication.<br/><br/>I believe it would be wrong to assume that any of the characters are martyrs in this tragic story, nor would it be right to think Sam Neill's character a villain. You may think this is crazy, but I think the piano itself serves as both a good and bad omen for all that are involved. I would relate it to a ""Pandora's box"" of sorts, a treasure that exposes all the evil and sin in the world, but which also provides hope as well. The piano is Ada's sounding box, a tool that allows her to escape from a world that does not understand her, but that also threatens her moral compass, removing her from marital conventions and forces her to lose herself.<br/><br/>The performances in ""The Piano"" are particularly good, especially Holly Hunter's. It is interesting to note that all of Hunter's piano playing in the film is actually Hunter herself performing in front of us. You can visually and aurally feel the mood of Hunter's character through the music she plays. We the audience lose ourselves right along with her, lost upon a sea of music. We see why Keitel becomes enamored by her, and why Neill becomes overcome with jealousy and betrayal. Not many films would allow us to enter the emotions of all three main characters, but this film is truly an exception.<br/><br/>Rarely do we witness real beauty captured on film. ""The Piano"" is such a visually stunning film, it's almost intoxicating how its atmosphere sweeps across the screen. This landscape is equaled by the performances, bringing understanding and mystery to this wonder. Sometimes symbolism of this nature can be distracting to an audience. ""The Piano"" dares to follow this symbolic path, and hits a bullseye with full emotional force. Rating: Four stars."
"lib-4","10","49","74","9 November 1998"," The music of the heart
","The Piano is an amazing movie- the cinematography stunning- like the piano on the beach and the sinking piano at the end. There is no praise high enough for Holly Hunter's depiction of Ada. Ana Pacquin and Sam O'Neill also shine.  And Harvey Keitel- having gone native- by marking his body in the native style- gives a truly sympathetic and daring performance. This movie stays with the viewer long after it is over.  At times I actually felt the dampness of the scenery... most of all it explores the regions of the heart- through the innovative music and the body language of Hunter.  A film not to be missed by those who appreciate good story and good filmaking.  Thanks Jane Campion for this classic."
"didi-5","9","56","86","4 March 2004"," A sensual and surprising film
","Jane Campion's Oscar-winning movie follows Ada (played by Holly  Hunter), an immigrant to the New Zealand outback and an arranged  marriage, who has not spoken for years and lives her life through the  sound of her piano. Her husband (played by Sam Neill) is a man without  much understanding, who tries to break the connection between his new  wife and her piano; in contrast to him is the wild illiterate Baines  (played by Harvey Keitel), a tattooed loner, who reaches into Ada's  soul and helps her to regain contact with her emotions and ultimately,  her voice too.  The film is visually compelling, with its muted colours and wide open  spaces, and uses the soundtrack by Michael Nyman in such a way so all  the elements fit together. Keitel and Hunter give excellent  performances within a sensitive and sensual screenplay, while Anna  Paquin is impressive as Ada's wise daughter, always watching and always  aware. Campion managed to make the story touching, involving, and sexy,  and it well deserved the plaudits heaped on it."

","Can someone explain to me why ""The Piano"" ain't in the IMDb top 250 and, for example, movies like ""Sin City"" or ""Crash"" (!!!!!!!!!!) are????????????? This movie,is,by far, one of the most delicate and intelligent ever; it softly touches you, emotionally AND physically, for the filming and the photography are exceptional. Actors in it are troubling, beautiful and so... beautiful(again,i know)! Holly Hunter, who plays a mute piano goddess and manages with her not enough known acting skills to express more with her eyes,her grace and her tiny hands than 100 Gwyneth paltrows put together!!!(no offense,i much enjoyed Shakespeare in love,but,come on...)Harvey Keitel in this broken-hearted warrior/peasant role is more than touching;love embraces him as it embraces us,viewers. Still, Jane Campion avoids the unfortunately fashionable arrogant and tutorial directors touch (oscar for best movie, Crash?????? where the hell are we??????) and lets the viewer flow on his own in this huge ocean of naked and oh so true feelings and respects the pain and/or the anger (Sam Neil,probably the only role in his carrier that shows his great talent) of her clearly beloved characters.Landscapes,seashores,humid forests,mud,rain: nature, as well as human nature, are captured by Campion's eyes and heart in the most sensitive and unartificial way. And, of course, Michael Nyman's score,which, once heard, becomes a part of you. Yes, definitely, the heart asks pleasure first. So treat your hearts and eyes with this unique and sensual Chef d'oeuvre."
"Hitchcoc","9","54","85","9 March 2006"," Acting with the face
","If one wants to see true acting, just watch Hollie Hunter in this film. She does more with her facial expressions than twenty actors can with a thousand words. Her stature, her presence, her determination are so intense. One could feel sorry for her in places. She has been ripped from her world for reasons we cannot fathom. She has been deemed expendable. When she arrives she expects to be treated properly. Anna Paquin as her daughter settles into the new environment and begins to prosper. But it is not without sacrifice. The piano is the symbol of what was left behind. Her affair with the Maori is partly passion, partly payment. We never know how much of each. The performances are stunning across the board and, this time, worthy of Academy Awards. <br/><br/>There are some very sensual scenes and scenes of great danger. There is pain inflicted and selfishness and power. Hollie Hunter rises above it all and makes her way through this quagmire (the rainy muddy jungle in this case), and arises, victorious in her own fashion."

","Ada, A woman chosen to be mute, travels with her daughter and baby grand piano across the seas from England to an exotic land in New Zealand during the Victorian Era.

She meets an exotic Caucasian male who seduces her into a world she can be herself in. She is able to release her oppression through their passion.<br/><br/>A film of intrigue. Why make such a story? It has a touch of magical realism. Jane Campion creates a mythical world and fills it with the human condition. Holly Hunter plays Ada with a fierce and graceful flowing note and deservedly won her awards. She plays woman's independence.<br/><br/>The Piano is a strange film and very effecting on it's story.

"lotus_chief","1","79","157","26 January 2004"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
","***SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>Wow.  To think that The Piano was nominated for 8 Oscars in '94 and won 3 (2 of them big ones) I expected so much more from this movie.  Quite frankly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Holly Hunter won a Best Actress Oscar for this role?  WHY??  She didn't say a word throughout the entire film (except for voice overs at the beginning and end), and does nothing but look sad and withdrawn the whole time.  The first thing I did after seeing this was look at the list of nominees/winners in '94, and saw who SHOULD HAVE won the Best Actress Oscar that year.Angela Bassett!!  Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress.... why?  She was good but not THAT good. Campion winning for Best Screenplay?  The script' was horrible!  It must've been a pretty bad year in Hollywood for this trash to be nominated for so many awards and win 2 big ones.  In no way do I live & swear by popcorn movies', but this was just dreadful.  Anyway, onto the film'.<br/><br/>I now know Jane Campion's M.O.  After seeing the AWFUL In The Cut' last year, The Piano surprisingly has the same inadequacies & fetishes as 'In The Cut' did.  It gives NOTHING of a story; nothing is developed...we're just thrown into these weird occurrences and frankly don't give a damn about anyone.  A mute girl is arranged to marry some guy who lives in the woods somewhere, wants nothing to do with him, is forced to teach his friend, George Baines the piano, who is a perverted sicko (Keitel).... after numerous crude passes and sexual harassment by George, suddenly the feeling is mutual for her, her husband' (Sam Neill) finds out about the affair, cuts off one of her fingers, then finally allows her to leave with George his former friend, who takes care of her.  This is the plot'.  From here, now we're supposed to read into the oh-so-subtle' images that the piano is her voice' (pretty obvious) and, from reading other people's reviews, she's exploring; taking control of, if you will, her sexual qualities due to the suppression of them by society at this time (19th century).  Well, I'm sorry, but I did not get that from the movie.  Tell me:  how was she in control?  She's forced to teach George piano lessons, who only uses these sessions' as an opportunity to fondle, flirt and grope her every chance he gets.  From the looks of things, she's not at all happy with what's happening.  But she does them only to buy' her piano back, which she loves so dearly and is her voice' (I got that).  But it's George that's in control there.  The husband?  I don't know what his story was, because he was the most neglectful spouse he could've possibly been.  What was he supposed to do, rape her?  It was obvious she didn't want him.  So, she doesn't like her husband, wants nothing to do with him, and then suddenly falls for George, who was only degrading & offensive to her the whole time? How did that happen?  WHEN did that happen?  He shows her a little guilt and she switches her feelings?  Was it that easy???  There was NO evidence of her EVER enjoying what he was doing....but then all of a sudden she's in love with him??  SPARE ME!!  Meanwhile the husband sees her committing adultery when it first happens, but doesn't do/say anything until Flora, her DAUGHTER of all people (Anna Paquin) rats on her to him (when Ada goes back to George after being told to stay away).  WHY did Flora do this?  See, this is where we needed to see previous evidence of animosity by the daughter towards her mother (enough at least to warrant this)...but there's nothing of the sort.  I guess Campion wants us to just write this off as pure ignorance/innocence by Flora, always wanting to do right even if it means getting her own mother in trouble.  Give me a break....that act definitely looked malicious to me.  But again, why was this the case when she was truly Ada's only real companion...her DAUGHTER for crying out loud!?!?!  Anyway he finally grows some 'cojones' and punishes her by cutting off one of her fingers with an axe...he must be really good with an axe to only cut off one finger!  LOL please!  It's here in which we get a really bad acting job by Holly Hunter.  I understand she can't scream but come on!  Simply kneeling down on the ground just didn't convince me...I thought she was Supergirl for a second there, she didn't even wince!  Her whole performance was emotionless and dry....I felt NOTHING for her.  The only time I sat up in my seat was when she apparently tries to drown herself; I was practically laughing thinking to myself, yea, kill yourself so this trash could end'. At NO POINT in the film did I feel she was in control of things, except her lame & minimal attempts at showing affection to her husband by rubbing his body, in which he then trusted her again not to see George and remove the barricades from the windows.  Some control she had with her hand was on the chopping block!  <br/><br/>I've seen a pattern with Jane Campion.  She just throws things together and puts you in a place with no background or character/story development (we hardly know where they are!!!), tries to make it artsy and throws a woman in there to try and make a point about her sexuality and sexual self-realization..that's probably her own stance on the issue.  If that's what The Piano was about, I shouldn't have to ASSUME it.  That's the main problem with this movie; it doesn't give the audience anything to take in and appreciate.  It doesn't present anything..it only throws them into a situation, a weird & somewhat illogical one at that, and expects them to buy into it.  I'm sorry, but I have to know where she's from, WHERE SHE IS, why/how she became, either by choice or not, mute (its very hard to believe the daughter's story), what her past relationships with men were like, why she didn't like her assigned husband, why/how/when she falls in love with the sadistic George, why her daughter (her only confidant) rats on her to her husband', etc etc.  The story is extremely weak and fails to explain anything.  One would probably say a film like Memento was artsy' too, but at least Christopher Nolan gave us something of a STORY there.  The fact that this was praised and rewarded as much as it was is a travesty in my opinion.  This was one big waste of time that I will only remember as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.it offers absolutely NOTHING!  And that's the grade I give it...<br/><br/>ZERO out of **** stars."
"clydefrogg","1","76","152","12 December 2000"," In a word: Stupid
","Yes, stupid.  I can't find a single word that more accurately describes this movie.  I was looking forward to seeing it and expected to see a good movie. I do have some spoilers later, so be warned.<br/><br/>There's a woman who refuses to speak, for seemingly no reason at all.  I guess so that a movie can be made about it.  Stupid.  She's forced to leave whatever land she's from because her father has forced her to marry a man who lives in the New Zealand outback, one who she has never met or seen. Stupid.<br/><br/>I guess the biggest problem I had with this movie was that Holly Hunter's character, the heroine, is NOT LIKEABLE!  She is cold and unfeeling, and lacks any personality except when she ""pours her heart"" into her piano. Like that's supposed to be enough to show us any real depth to her personality.  But I went with it.<br/><br/>I actually liked Harvey Keitel's character, but I didn't buy his actions. He becomes enamored with the piano and with Hunter's character, again for seemingly no reason.  Again, probably so they could make a movie about it. She's cold and unfeeling.  She plays a few bars of something or other, and all of the sudden, he's infatuated with her.  <br/><br/>Then, in an effort to impress and sweep his new bride off her feet, Sam Neill's character decides to trade Holly's piano to Keitel for some land. Uh, yeah.  OK.  Like he'd really do that.  Like she says in the movie, IT'S HER PIANO!  HERS!!!  But again, they wouldn't have had a movie unless he did it, so it's OK.  So, to get her piano back, Keitel, who uses the piano as an aphrodisiac for some reason, agrees to trade her keys for ""favors"", which are initially just weird, then turn sexual in nature.  Again, it doesn't make much sense, but I went with it.<br/><br/>Then, Neil's character finds out and gets insanely jealous and angry.  Why? Holly had given him NOTHING.  She has NO PERSONALITY.  What is there to be jealous of?  Throw her out and forget it.  Why does he even care?  I can't believe that he loves her, or even LIKES her.  Stupid.  Then, when she tries to contact Keitel again and Neil finds out, what does he do?  He CUTS HER FINGER OFF.  Actually, he CHOPS IT OFF WITH AN AXE.  This is where the movie reached a new plateau of stupid and ridiculous.  So much so, that I laughed out loud when he chopped off her digit.<br/><br/>Neil then has a remarkable change of heart about the whole thing, again for seemingly no reason, and allows Holly to leave with Keitel.  On the boat ride out, Holly decides she doesn't want the Piano anymore and orders it thrown into the sea.  Now, I understand what's happening here.  She's found love and doesn't feel she needs the piano to express herself anymore. That's fine, but she still loves the piano.  She loves to play it, and she loves that one in particular.  So she just wants to throw it overboard? Again, it's utterly stupid, but I guess they couldn't express the metaphor any other way.  However, the stupidity of throwing the piano overboard just to express that metaphor pales in comparison to the stupidity of what happens as the piano goes over.<br/><br/>Holly's foot gets caught in the rope tying that's tied to the piano, and she gets dragged down towards the sea floor along with the piano.  Wow, what are the odds.  And I knew it was going to happen before they even shoved the piano over.  Again, it was done only because they needed to have a metaphor of Holly truly ""escaping"" the piano, which is what she miraculously does underwater.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie comes to a merciful end with a COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY ""they lived happily ever after"" scene.  This scene is unnecessary whether you liked the movie and bought what it was selling or not.<br/><br/>It's really disappointing to me that this type of high class drivel is made. It's even more disappointing that this drivel is so highly praised.  The only thing redeeming about this movie is the performance of Anna Paquin, who is adorable as Holly's daughter.  Unfortunately, her performance is tainted because her only real purpose in the movie is to serve as a translator when writing and sign language might slow a scene down too much.  I also expected a great score, but thought it was extremely mediocre.  Any actor could have learned to play what was in the movie in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>STUPID.  Grade:  D-"
"Doug-96","1","62","123","31 January 1999"," I have to disagree
","All of my friends think this is a great film, but I find it to be one of the most over-rated films of the 1990's.<br/><br/>'The Piano' is completely lacking in subtlety -- normally a quality a filmmaker wants in a film that is attempting (in this case, committing) symbolism.  It hits the audience over the head with its 'meaning'.<br/><br/>And what does it mean?  That a man wins a woman's love by treating her horribly and exploiting her mercilessly?  That's exactly what happens in this film.  Furthermore, Ada is a thoroughly inscrutable and unlikeable character.<br/><br/>I cheered when she was almost drowned, too bad she was rescued . . but even the beautiful cinematography and good cast can't rescue this over-wrought and over-rated film.<br/><br/>Also:  did anyone notice that Baines is repeatedly depicted as uneducated and illiterate, but yet Ada writes to him (on a piano key of all things). And the annoying music Ada plays on the piano (and we hear over and over on the soundtrack) is out of place in a film set in the nineteenth century."
"moonspinner55","8","27","49","31 March 2002"," Quite vivid
","Jane Campion is a director of quiet unease. I was not a big admirer of her ""Angel At My Table"", which had enormous possibilities but was suffocated under the filmmaker's penchant for what I refer to as 'ugly beauty'. Even the beautiful passages in this film are undermined by either something ghastly, something about to become ghastly, or something borne from ghastliness. A New Zealand woman in the 1800s becomes a mail-order bride for an uninterested working man; she's a self-elected mute and communicates through her wizened little daughter (Oscar-winner Anna Pacquin, a bit over-the-top) and through her passion for playing the piano, which becomes a point of contention in her marriage. Engrossing human drama with a torrid undercurrent of sexuality and violence. Many people I've talked to about this film could not get with it, but perhaps that's the fault of watching movies at home. In the theater, this was a slightly-dazed, rapturous and enveloping brew that held me spellbound until the lights went up. Movies like this don't hold the same spell when butchered up by ads for the CBS comedies. Holly Hunter, Sam Neill and, most especially, Harvey Keitel all do terrific work. Hunter deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar. ***1/2 from ****"

","A vaguely pornographic account of a love triangle between three completely repellent people. The woman hasn't spoken in years, but is absolutely obsessed with her piano, seeming to care more about it than about any living person. Her emotions are expressed in either childish outbursts or soft caresses, depending on what point the filmmakers want to make. The husband himself is clearly SUPPOSED to be repellent. We know this because he combs his hair, because he doesn't hold much stock in Aboriginal superstition, and because . . . well, I don't know, just because the movie needs an annoying white guy so it can argue that it's bad to discriminate against people. The love interest, meanwhile, is downright creepy, lying under the piano and looking up the woman's skirt, but he's apparently supposed to be cool and dashing. And don't get me started on the Aborigines, at once held up as trophies of natural living and made ""exotic"" in a manner that mostly involves making them seem stupid. I confess I cannot figure out what anyone could have liked about this film."

The Piano is rescued from a shipwreck, in perfect tune, and Holly Hunter plays Michael Nyman numbers on it. She can't be bothered to talk for some reason. She inspects Harvey Keitel's bottom. Some Maori girls appear in Victorian costume to show how oppressive the colonisers were. That's most of what I remember and it's too much. It's presumably meant to mean something but it fails. The landscapes were nice, though.<br/><br/>All in all, a model of all that is worst about art cinema and an argument for going to see blockbusters or reading a book or tapping out some hymns on a tinny piano, which is what the Holly Hunter character would have played had this film attempted to connect with reality on any level."

But did anyone notice how often the camera kept focusing specifically on people's ugly naked butts? With the exception of the little girl, just about everyone in this movie dropped their breeches and flashed their unclothed posteriors at the camera at some point. Possibly this is symbolic of some sort of bizarre anal fetish on the part of the director, but in the end, I felt as though I had been mooned by the entire adult cast of this film.

In it, even.<br/><br/>Not this. The 'wealthy landowner' lives in a shoddy timber house in a settlement in the muddiest part of the dankest, jungliest bit of New Zealand and does nothing constructive except chop the odd bit of firewood. He should have stayed in Hampshire and farmed or in Wolverhampton and made chains but nope.<br/><br/>This must be a jolly good piano for despite being left on a stormy beach below the high tide level, it doesn't suffer much. And they leave it there. No case of, ""If we have to leave it, why don't we move it up the beach a bit where it's dry?"" And later it's hauled through the jungle and tipped over into the mud, but - well, well - all it needs is a wee bit of tuning.<br/><br/>The Ada character is about the most sexually unappetising specimen of femininity imaginable. Not only does she not speak, but she doesn't smile, acknowledge other people or exhibit any of the social graces considered mandatory by any Victorian. When she plays the piano, she plays tedious music in a style that never, ever, ever varies throughout the whole movie until you wish that her new husband would take the damned piano and use it for firewood. Not only that but it is contemporary music. Late 20th century contemporary, that is. It's cheap, tinkly-tinkly-tinkly with the left hand and plink-plonk-plink with the right. 'On-hold' music, really. Clearly, she's too advanced for a bit of Mozart, Handel, Bach or even maybe a bit of Scarlatti.<br/><br/>She sells herself implausibly cheap to the rough guy. The husband under-reacts initially then overreacts. What's that all about then? Why does her beloved daughter who's so devoted to her mother dob her in - twice!?

Holly Hunter's heroine's silence is a ludicrously contrived conceit, presumedly invented by Campion to force down her unfortunate audience's throats the notion that the most eloquent form of communication in this film is through music; I think we could have worked that out without it being so unsubtly pinpointed. As for the actual plot - well, it creaks and groans with so many improbabilities, anachronisms and eye-rollingly obvious symbolic gestures that this viewer was left puzzling, mouth agape, that even the most sympathetic critic could consider it anything better than embarrassing.

I'm not against art films per se (I loved Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"", for example), but this opus came across to me as pretentious feminist claptrap (and no, I'm not anti-feminist). It is never explained why the Holly Hunter character is mute, so I suppose we're to understand that her muteness is a great big metaphor for the silencing of woman in a patriarchal world.  She expresses herself on the piano, OK.  But the music she plays is New Age treacle; it made me long to hear Rachmaninoff or even Cecile Chaminade (real romantic music, not muzak). The utter brutality of Sam Neill cutting off her finger is totally unprepared for, but in this oh-so-symbolic film we're not supposed to find any sense or coherence on the realistic level, are we? (compare Dante, who works on both levels). By that point in the movie I was so exasperated by Hunter's utterly self-centered character that I wouldn't have cared if Neill had cut off her head!  Harvey Keitel's native character is merely absurd when he makes love to the hole in her stocking.  But after all, he's the ""noble savage"" who is so much more sensitive than the plebeian white exploiter of the natives that Neill represents. Since the native women mock Keitel as ""old dry-balls,"" I suppose he's been saving himself for a truly western-style romance with Hunter, like something out of an 18th-century sentimental novel. At the film's end, when Hunter is tempted to follow her precious piano to the bottom of the sea, I was really hoping she would. But, of course, she has to AFFIRM LIFE and struggle back up to the surface of the water. To quote Fenimore Cooper's Chingachgook, ""Ugh""!"

","""The Piano"", directed by Jane Campion, is a haunting film about love, passion, betrayal and refusal set in the 19th century. Ada (Holly Hunter), sent to New Zealand on an arranged marriage, arrives with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her precious piano on a stormy gray beach. Her husband Stewart (Sam Neill) leaves her beloved piano on the beach after having decided that it is too heavy to transport it inland. He does not recognize what this means to the mute Ada, who expresses her emotions with the ""voice"" of her piano. Baines (Harvey Keitel), who has taken on Maori ways, is deeply moved by Ada and her ""voice"". He gives Stewart a piece of land in exchange for the piano and offers Ada a deal to earn it back.<br/><br/>Repulsed by Baines' crude appearance, Ada reluctantly accepts the deal to play the piano in his hut while he does ""things"". Submerged erotic desires and passion slowly set free between the unlikely pair during the piano sessions. Both Baines and Stewart become obsessed by Ada's powerful, intensely suggestive form of unuttered communication. Completely bewildered, Stewart asks Baines if had ever heard Ada speak a single word to him, claiming that he could hear her voice in his mind.<br/><br/>The breathtaking, beautiful imagery as well as its stirring music (Michael Nyman) contribute to the romantic, mystifying atmosphere of the film. ""The Piano"" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and Oscars for Best Actress (Holly Hunt), Best Supporting Actress (Anna Paquin), and Campion's screenplay. Holly Hunter's outstanding performance conveys impressively a woman's ability to express herself without words. ""The Piano"" is one of the best films I have seen so far."

We didn't see an evolvement of any of them.  They seemed disjointed in personality and very anemic.<br/><br/>For example, we see Stewart (Sam Neill), carefully taking a comb to his hair prior to meeting, for the first time, his new bride.  This shows an element of care and tenderness to please her.  Just because of his very practical decision to leave the piano behind on the beach because it was too much for his men to carry doesn't make him a bully.  Her obsession with a piano was not something he fully understood just then.  Then, as the story progresses, he turns into a ""Peeping Tom"" and a few scenes later, performs a very shocking and brutal act that was very unbecoming of what we knew him to be at first.<br/><br/>Ada (Holly Hunter) is a rigid, cold-hearted, selfish, unbecoming bride who only knows how to stomp her feet when she doesn't get her way and sell her body for her real true love, the piano.  And how did she become mute?  She never could say.<br/><br/>As for the third member of the bizarre triangle, Baines (Harvey Keitel), neighbor to the newly-weds, and a native tribesman would-be-but-not-quite, is an uncouth, ego-centric male who encourages Ada to prostitute herself out to him in return for her piano, key by key, of course.  But she holds her ground by indicating silently, ""only the black keys"".  ...What a bargain!

"kinetos","Null","13","25","8 July 2004"," A few metaphors found in The Piano
","Spoiler Piano Lessons No Strings Attached<br/><br/>The 'Piano' was a tragedy that crescendos from an entangled web triangle of deceit. The movie is a conglomeration of metaphors. Like pearls on a string, the examples from scene to scene were priceless literary jewels mounted on the cellulose reel. From the beginning we are exposed to the wizardry of cinematography and literature fused in imagery to culminate a plot with a gradually revealed presentiment. The opening credits appear to express the structured pyramidal scheme that was characteristic throughout the movie. All of the title letters were arranged in a condescending order and formed triangles, which resembled stacked building blocks of pyramids. If the intent was there, then they were very subtle. If you look carefully at the following scenes you will know why. The first thing we see is a triangle formed by the fingers of the main character, Ada McGrath as she covers her face. This is followed by the ornate architectural design seen on the bed headrest also containing triangles. Moments later, Ada and her daughter Flora arrived at the coast of New Zealand; the sailing crew formed human pyramids to carry them ashore. It seems to me that the analogous triangle represented the three people that were to form the wrong-angles to a crumbling love affair pyramid. <br/><br/>Another detail that kept reappearing throughout the film was the strings and ropes that were so prevalent until the end. At first I didn't think anything of it, but then it became more obvious, to me anyway, that the pattern of strings, ropes, and even Mangrove roots carried some significance. It began with the skate shoestrings that Flora was wearing and could not remove. Afterwards, we see the mother cutting the laces with scissors. A few scenes later, we see the natives placing a rope on top of the piano and the little girl swiping it off with her hand. More hints of something to come having to do with ropes are shown perhaps symbolizing the entanglement that the main character is going to encounter as the plot develops. She is shown being bound by the laces of the corset. At one point the roots of the mangroves appear to be an entanglement as well. In that scene, the characters appear to be caught in a web, except the roots of the mangroves create the web. During one of the climactic moments of the film, a close-up shot of a spool of sewing string falls and it begins to unwind. This shot was strongly emphasized by the director. It was at this point that I came to realize that there was something significant about the strings. Finally, towards the end of the movie, the rope attached to the piano entangles Ada taking her down into the abysmal waters off the coast of New Zealand. <br/><br/>The meaning behind strings is left to the viewer's speculation. I subscribe to a few possibilities that I deduced. Let us start with the piano. The piano is the complex string instrument that has to be stricken in such a way that the very application of force can designate the instrument to the category of percussion. In which case, the complexity of the character using the piano as her way of choice to express herself, acquiesce her physical punishments for the privilege of projecting her feelings through the instrument. The other possibility is the entanglement of the love triangle between the three adults. There is the bondage that the lady is subjected to through the unwarranted betrothal by her father. Her original husband, the father of the child, is complacent as he encourages the engagement to a strange man, no strings attached. The seductive and passionate neighbor in the forest has a type of relationship with the native women that seem to be another situation of 'no strings attached'. This dark character harbors the piano that eventually becomes the bond between him and his lover. The director deliberately filmed the spool of thread rolling off the table as a metaphor for the unraveling of everything that held the affairs together. <br/><br/>Finally, The main character departs with her lover and her lover wants her to bring the piano. She doesn't want the piano anymore because she realized that she doesn't need it anymore now that she has found love. The piano has to be sacrificed. When the crew untied the piano, a loop of rope wrapped the lady's leg and brought her down to the bottom of the Ocean. She left everything of her past and rose to the top for a rebirth. She was set free and chose to live with no strings attached."

","This has got to be one of the most depressing movies EVER made. The main characters are so self absorbed and mostly devoid of any semblance of decency that it is hard to sympathize, empathize, or relate to any of them, even the long-suffering pianist. One scene of abuse (verbal, emotional, or physical) is merely a lead in to another or frequently an even worse situation. New Zealand was no doubt a harsh place in the last century but this movie took it to the point of overkill. Should all movies have a `Brady Bunch' type of feel or ending? NO!! But this movie went to the equally bad extreme on the other end of the scale. The only thing I found myself caring about was for the movie to end. It was a waste of celluloid. 1993 must have been a poor year for Oscars since this received a best picture nomination. No offense to Hunter and Pacquin who played their roles well, but their Oscars should have gone to others. This movie is ONLY for those that want to become depressed. How do you spell loser?

","The New Zealand sensation 'The Piano' doesn't move very fast but that's because it doesn't have to. Jane Campion's critically-acclaimed film is about a mute woman in the 1800s, Ada (Holly Hunter - Broadcast News) and her young daughter who narrates the film through her mother, Flora (Anna Paquin - X-Men) who journey to a small tribe town in New Zealand where Ada is arranged to marry a wealthy and stern man, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill - Dead Calm). Ada is a shy and sad woman, but the one thing she adores more then everything else is her piano which her new husband forbids. Ada is upset and finds a way to still be able to play her piano with the help of Alisdair's friend George (Harvey Keital - Bad Lieutenant) who begins taking lessons from Ida and ends up in a tangled love affair resulting in a powerful and sad climax. 'The Piano' is a very well-written film, but it is very slow-paced towards the beginning. It's not a wildly entertaining film, but I think the movie appeals to people who find authentic costumes, designs and crafty film-making more engrossing then say car explosions. Holly Hunter is simply amazing in a role he damn well deserved her Oscar for. Anna Paquin is also extremely powerful in her role for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, making her the youngest actress ever to receive an Oscar. Unfortunately the Academy seemed to forget to nominate Harvey Keital for a Supporting Actor Oscar who was absolutely brilliant in every frame he was in. Rounding out the cast, Sam Neill and Kerry Walker are also very good. Jane Campion does an excellent job directing which earned her a 'Best Director' Oscar nomination. 'The Piano' scored eight Academy Award Nominations in 1993 including Best Director, Best Actress - Holly Hunter, Best Supporting Actress - Anna Paquin, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Picture, but was totally out-shadowed by Spielberg's masterpiece 'Schindler's List' which opened that same year. All in all I highly recommend giving 'The Piano' a shot if you appreciate the precision and craft that goes into good film-making. Grade: B+<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #191"
"mentalcritic","3","14","28","28 July 2006"," ""Piano"" must be Maori for ""self indulgent wankery""
","Amidst a storm of publicity and hails as the new ultra-feminist zenith of masterpiece, The Piano hit international cinema like a plague, and suddenly it was ""cool"" to watch the thing, as well as talk everyone else into seeing it, whether the film suited them or not. Contrary to what a previous commentator implies, Anna Paquin deserved her award for this film, and then some, as she acts rings around the adults in the cast. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill play the most utterly despicable men, and given that this is meant to be some post-modern feminist essay, they are also as unidimensional as a piece of paper. Holly Hunter's character could have been at least likable, but the presence of voice-over from what is meant to be her character (but sounds more like Anna's) ruins whatever character she could build through her silence. James Cameron was able to create a character that intimidates the audience despite speaking less than a hundred words in a hundred minutes. Jane Campion as a writer is to James Cameron as a one-cell protozoan is to Professor X.<br/><br/>All the elements for a good story are in place. A mute woman is sent to colonial New Zealand for an arranged marriage. Her one treasured possession in the world is a piano, hence the title. The twist is that her new husband's refusal to help her keep her piano results in her having an affair with one of the locals. In the hands of a director like Paul Verhoeven, Tim Burton, or even Christopher Nolan, this could have become a classic. In Jane Campion's hands, it is overlong, paced like a racehorse with three broken legs, and entirely uncompelling. If you don't believe me about Verhoeven's ability to tell this kind of tale better, then you clearly haven't seen Keetje Tippel or Turks Fruit. That aside, the location scout sure earned their money. Campion knows how to make the best use of the countryside and its natural beauty, I will give her that much, but this does not add up to much in light of the myriad of problems. You can make a good art film, you can make a bad art film, but heaven help you if you make a boring art film.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert takes a long walk off a minuscule credibility pier when he tells us that Campion ""understands better the eroticism of slowness and restraint"". If you want to see slowness and restraint used well in film, rent Michael Mann's 1995 film Heat. Mann gives the audience enough reason to care about every character that he can include an entire minute of footage that features little more than two of his actors staring into a camera, and keep viewers glued to their seat. Heat is literally one of the most languid films to have emerged from an English-speaking country in the past twenty years, yet it is also one of the most compelling. The Piano tries to use slow and languid to seem artful, but in failing to give us characters we want to follow through to their eventual fates, it simply becomes overlong. You could seriously excise at least thirty minutes from The Piano and nobody would know the difference. Hell, when I write, I look back on what I have written and ask ""does this scene contribute anything to the story?"". I have deleted enough words to make a full-length novel from my writings this way, so that Campion can get this rubbish published unasked is offensive.<br/><br/>Of course, people will respond to my previous criticism by telling me that The Piano made money at the box office, and it is true that money speaks a lot louder than artistry. The problem with that defense, however, is that any film film made after 1980 could make a profit on the back of a mere seven million dollar budget. Exactly how Campion was able to enlist such actors as Keitel or Neill and stick to such a budget is a bit of a mystery. Perhaps she was able to convince them, like her audience, that she was making an art film. After seeing both of them in other films, I know they are definitely better actors than Campion deserves or knows what to do with. But to get back to the point, much of The Piano's profit has come as the result of pressure-marketing. The marketeer barks that this is a compulsory film for feminists or art students, and they jump. This is not art or even skillful economics, it is a form of cultural terrorism. The real pity of it is that Campion will have you believe she made a statement, and some will believe her.<br/><br/>The one area in which The Piano can be thanked is the introduction of a young actress named Anna Paquin. As I said earlier, she acts rings around the rest of the cast, giving us the only character who has any illusion of being three-dimensional. Unfortunately, much like later films in her career, she is sadly underutilised, and in another display of femininity according to Campion, is only there when Holly Hunter or someone giving Hunter a good serve needs something to bounce their total blankness off. Had the film been entirely about her, or from her perspective, it would have been a lot more watchable. But then, I could watch Anna reading the phone book for two hours, so I might be just a little biased. Such is the quality of her performances that she has made several write-offs (All The Rage comes to mind) eminently more watchable. Ironically, she continues to act in real art films that are far better than this nonsense, yet receives not even half the recognition.<br/><br/>For that reason, I gave The Piano a three out of ten. Anna earns all three stars. If you are a fan of Anna like I am, this might be worth the two hours. Otherwise, don't bother."

Harvey Keitel, a wonderful actor in certain types of movies, is almost comically miscast here. Holly Hunter, normally a very verbal actress, is called upon to keep her trap shut through the entire movie. Why is she a mute? It seems that Jane Campion is trying to make some sort of feminist point here about the silencing of women--why do feminists feel like they have to make an entire movie in order to bludgeon us with a political cliche? And there is absolutely zero chemistry between Hunter and Keitel, even as they're compelled to grope each other for the cameras.<br/><br/>Then there's the music. What period is this supposed to take place in? I would guess 19th century by the costumes, but Hunter's character plays the piano in a style more appropriate to a New Age street performer in Seattle than anything from that century. And it's truly bad music, adding a tinge of schizophrenia to the overall gray mood. Watching this is a truly dreary experience."

However, Ada's daughter, who possesses a special personality and lives in her own mystical world, left me a unforgettable impression.<br/><br/>Overall, I regret watching this movie.

","I don't understand some of the praise The Piano received. Holly Hunter's acting is not as good as I expected. She mostly keeps the same emotionless face throughout the movie, even in the two scenes where Ada certainly feels incredible pain. I don't see how challenging could it be for an actress to pull that off. <br/><br/>Young Anna Paquin is good, but not as good as I thought she would be. She is adorable and does an accent and all, but not for a moment blew my mind.<br/><br/>Some say this is feminist. Maybe it's because I'm a man and can't fully understand it, but watching the movie I thought my female feminist friends would feel offended by the screenplay. Ada is weak and allows awful things to happen to her - yes, she loves that piano and wants it back (you could never tell by Hunter's expressions), but maybe she should have been more ""vocal"" about it instead of becoming a prostitute. She hardly resists such disgusting proposals, even though she's not supposed to be perceived as a slut.<br/><br/>Some say this is romantic and passionate. To me, it felt like a creepy story about a woman who falls in ""love"" with a disgusting man, and it reminded me of Stockholm syndrome. It worked a lot better in Beauty and the Beast. <br/><br/>The Piano is a very unpleasant movie, and no eye candy could save it."

","I had no idea what this movie was about until my husband I ran across it on our free Showtime sampler. I play the piano and love period films, and after recently seeing the new release of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I felt that the short description offered on the satellite header promised more of the same. Other reviews summarize the plot well enough, so I will not do that. It is of more use to say that this film is not feminist so much as it is feminine. It is also extremely masculine at the same time... thank you Sam Neil and Harvey Keitel. Holly Hunter's character, Ada, expresses the concentrate of her human emotion in her music. That is why it is so important to her. It IS her voice. When the piano is taken away by her new husband, it is impossible for her to feel the love for him that he truly wants and needs. Sam Neil's character is actually a lovely man; he makes fatal mistakes about the piano though. Ultimately, it is not about the piano- but understanding. George gives Ada the understanding and the slow progression of emotional and physical intimacy that she should have received from her husband. He listens to her. That is what women want most. I've never seen that so poignantly displayed in any movie. Another reviewer was correct when she said that the movie flowed like a poem. Alisdair is not so jealous of what he sees through the walls of George's house as he is of the piano key inscribed with the pledge of Ada's heart to George. Yet, Ada is not completely indifferent to Alisdair. Not at all. Ada is looking for strength of will in the men around her, and inevitably in herself. I do understand the polarity in the reactions to the movie as it was exemplified in my own living room. As the credits rolled, my husband said,""That was a weird movie."" I smiled and said, ""That was a beautiful movie."" The comment stands."

","I had hopes for this movie before watching but it turned out to be completely disappointing.<br/><br/>First of all - for a movie about a woman who cannot speak. Speaking and giving an intro at the beginning of the movie completely ruined the effect (if any) that they are trying for.<br/><br/>Then it gets worst, shes forced to teach someone piano who forces her to do more and more sexual acts with more in a very very disturbing manner. This basically ruined the movie for me, I was expecting a movie about love, music, and a time where a woman could not choose her fate, NOT some sexually perverted movie. This include very unnecessary scenes of a man wiping down the piano with his trousers, sniffing the piano, and molesting the woman. It was just plain disgusting and distasteful.<br/><br/>The husband finds out about the affair and what happens? He watches them through a bunch of gaps like some voyeur and we get to witness this entire disturbing scene. Instead of going in and stopping the act (realistically), he watches his wife having sex with another man? Honestly, what is this garbage? Then for no apparent reason she starts ""touching"" her own husband even though she has no feeling for him. She sends a key with writing on it to her illiterate lover (which makes no sense). And her very unlikeable daughter instead of giving it to him, gives it to the husband? Who then chops of her finger. And at the end, we never get an explanation of WHAT happens to the husband. She somehow mysteriously gets to leave with her lover.<br/><br/>There are so many things that are inconsistent, lack of character development (I found the female lead very emotionless and inconsiderate), all the men were perverted and only after one thing, and her daughter was just as unlikeable as the mother, terribly timed songs/scenes (they overplayed the theme song instead of saving it at the right moments).<br/><br/>This movie is such a complete mess I don't think it deserves the 7.5/10 that its currently at. 6/10 would be more suited. I don't understand how anyone can see this twisted mess as beautiful. Pretentious maybe, but definitely NOT beautiful. It was full of perverted disturbing moments which took all the ""beauty"" out of it if there ever was any to begin with.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes of her playing the piano which were done well, but that is about it.<br/><br/>It could truly have been a movie about a woman who could not speak sold/married off to a stranger, and struggles against a man she doesn't love to one who TRULY appreciates music, and their struggle and her road to speaking again, and their love of each other and music... but no, this film is not such a movie."

In the entire movie, everyone gives away things they don't want.<br/><br/>After Ada's father gave her away, Alisdair gave away her piano to George (Harvey Keitel)because it was too heavy to move through the forest and mud to her new home.  Later, George gave it back to Ada, after he became too frustrated with it. And, eventually Alisdair gave Ada and the piano back to George after it became clear that he could never do anything to make his new wife care about him.<br/><br/>Early in the story, George was attracted to this new woman, Ada, and realized that he could get to her through the piano, which she loved to play. That was her voice. Eventually Ada also became attracted to George and professed her love for him.  Since she and Alisdair never consumated their marriage, I suppose it wasn't that scandalous.  However, Alisdair did not take it well at all. First he boarded Ada and Flora in the house. Later, chopped off Ada's right index finger, before he realized he couldn't force her to love him.<br/><br/>In the end, George and Ada and Flora ended up on a boat, settled in a new area, George made Ada a metal forefinger, Ada began to make sounds again, practicing only alone, hoping to speak again. <br/><br/>Holly Hunter, at age 34, gives a brilliant performance. Anna Paquin, at 10 and in her first film, is also remarkable. Keitel, 53, and Sam Neill also give fine performances. Not a mainstream film, requires thought and patience, but overall one of the better films. Incidentally, Hunter is an accomplished pianist and does all her own playing."

I also believe that too many times films can get a little too complex for the viewer but in The Piano's case it's just too simple. A woman goes to, where?...Borneo or someplace to live with her new husband. She doesn't speak which lends itself to the non-original, done in film a hundred times ""Is she touched in the head?"" talk around her new home. Her little girl has to interpret. Hunter shows no emotion whatsoever, neither does Sam Neill, her husband. He basically just leaves her alone.

Harvey Keitel is badly miscast as Hunter's Maori love interest. And we are introduced to several redundant characters, who serve no purpose to the central storyline.<br/><br/>The film would also have benefited from a clearer explanation of the motivations of the main protagonists. While some things can be left unsaid, the near-total lack of clear characterisation means the viewer is left somewhat indifferent to key emotional and plot developments.<br/><br/>Overall, The Piano is worth seeing, particularly for the two Oscar winning performances by Hunter and Paquin.

""The Piano"" for me was a bit like the ""Citizen Kane"" effect. People say how it's absolutely amazing and full of thoughtful symbols but I must be blind because I can never see them. Apart from the in-your-face haunting imagery at the end.<br/><br/>""The Piano"" just felt completely dull and bland for the most part. Very little happens in the way of plot, basically an obnoxious mute woman moves to a barren island to be arranged to be married to Henry Bell (Sam Neill) and she brings her beloved piano with her on a little canoe (as if). Whilst their the stubborn Henry Bell refuses to let Holly hunter bring her lovely piano because it's too big and so the man off Sister Act some how comes to take it (weird actor choice). Annoyed she goes over to his little hut and asks for it back. He makes a bargain with her, she has to come over their and play it for every black key whilst he does increasingly more perverted things to her. Anyway they end up having an affair, Henry bell finds out, chops off her finger and she goes off the island.<br/><br/>Character development is sparse, and as you can tell, the plot is annoyingly thin to make a full two hours out of. The affair is also completely unconvincing. Why would a seemingly posh lady have it off with a rough native from Sister Act? The affair is also completely passionless. There is literally zero chemistry between them and so it's hard to care about them. It also doesn't help that Ada is such an unlikably angry character, who you can't help but dislike. The man from Sister Act is also entirely unlikable because he's just a complete pervert. Henry bell's the most interesting character, but he's also not likable. And as for the girl! My god she's annoying with her pathetic Scottish accent and wailing cries. I know she's only a little girl but, that doesn't stop her from being annoying.<br/><br/>However, ""The Piano"" is nicely shot for the most part, and it did show marvellous potential towards the end when Henry Bell goes mad and chops off Holl Hunter's finger. The last shot is also quite creepy and haunting. But, it's a difficult path getting there. It's two hours but it felt more like two and a half! The performances are OK but they're no one you're bound to fall in love with. ""The Piano"" was a dull and sometimes painfully boring film. I think that it spends too much time doting around with symbols rather than giving us some substance to back up the symbols (I'm thinking ""Black Swan"").

","Since The Piano, writer/director Jane Campion's star has understandably dimmed and it is not hard to see why when viewing this heralded ""success"" from early in her career. Beautifully photographed and bizarre to a fault, The Piano exhibits much of Campion's excesses at their worst. Mute mail order bride Holly Hunter travels with illegitimate daughter Anna Paquin to meet new husband Sam Neill in 1850s New Zealand. They get off on the wrong foot immediately when Neill does not bring enough men to transport the huge and unexpected piano that Hunter brings with her from their disembarking point on the beach. The piano is subsequently claimed by a half-Maori neighbor (Harvey Keitel), with whom Hunter ends up bartering sexually for its return, much to the chagrin of her cuckolded new husband. Campion definitely gets points for originality, but then most of her work is nothing if not original. Incredibly the film was embraced by many as a sort of pseudo-feminist tale, but one really has to stretch it to envision that. Yes, Hunter's Ada exerts her power to deprive her new husband of her favors after the abandonment of her precious piano, but she is also presented as a neglectful mother, a casual whore, self-destructively suicidal, and a rather nasty and obnoxious all-around individual. All things that should make her a fascinating cinematic study, so it is then a mystery as to why she is so dreadfully uninteresting and tedious. We never really get insight into her character and her actions in the final moments with the piano are impenetrable from any standpoint. This leaves a veritable hole right at the center of the film, and we never understand the obsession that the others harbor for her. The film is beautifully shot and scored, and one must applaud Campion for not dulling down the erotic aspects of the film. Keitel (cast against type) and Neill do fairly well, but it would have been interesting to see them switch roles to see if this improved the sluggish chemistry or not. Paquin performs capably as the neglected young daughter prone to wild storytelling. Many have gone overboard in heaping praise on Hunter's work as the mute central character, but I find her quite unappealing and overrated here. Depriving Hunter of her ear-shattering Texas twang actually helps make her performance easier to give as at least vocally she does not have to convince us as a woman of the period. However, the remainder of her performance is basically summed up by many stern looks and a couple of tantrums where she throws things around (while giving further stern looks). Her one-note effort could be a main reason while Ada fails to connect in any meaningful way, at least with this viewer. Incredibly, for a film with a feminist reputation, both the lead character and the film in general are incredibly misogynistic, proving that one need not be male to be sexist. By the time the film crawls to its conclusion, you may well have wished you had not joined Hunter and company on her voyage."

Not only was the<br/><br/>plot weak and unengaging, but the score which I used to love (and<br/><br/>play) became dull and overused. What we have here is the story of<br/><br/>a woman (Ada, played by Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna<br/><br/>Paquin) being married off to a New Zealand gent (why she is<br/><br/>being made to do so and why he accepts her, despite her being a<br/><br/>mute is unconvincing and largely ignored). She plays around with<br/><br/>another man, her husband finds out and quite frankly, it all ends in<br/><br/>tears until she leaves him. The actual message that the story is<br/><br/>delivering is unclear; is it simply telling a story of events? - If so it<br/><br/>does so tediously and without depth. Is it a political exercise in the<br/><br/>role of women in that time? If so it does so poorly, as Ada is clearly<br/><br/>a poor decision maker and both men are certainly mysogenistic.<br/><br/>Ultimately she becomes content with one of them - the one who<br/><br/>initiates their relationship by selling her piano back to her by<br/><br/>requesting  she let him do things to her that she allows - clearly<br/><br/>there is no female empowerment here. Or is it simply a film about<br/><br/>survival - i.e. the survival of Ada against the brutality  and near<br/><br/>denial of her only passion (the piano)? If so, you could simply have<br/><br/>watched the last ten minutes of the film and got the same<br/><br/>message. <br/><br/>Ada was a flawed character, but these flaws were deliberate and<br/><br/>obvious (why didn't she marry her daughter's father?) and also<br/><br/>uninteresting.<br/><br/>I don't remember what the other film competition was that year, but<br/><br/>how this one the amount of awards it did is unbelievable.

Perhaps Jane Campion knew what she wanted to say, but with the distributor failing to hand out liner notes at the box office the rest of the world was left to battle with subliminal cartoons, and schizophrenic characters and their mood swings.  <br/><br/>I desperately wanted to like 'The Piano', and yet, aided by this desperation I still found myself feeling cheated by a Director who was just as desperate to court the critics and, at the same time, carve her signature into her work, all to the detriment of the finished product.<br/><br/>Why do I hate this film so?  Well, it's largest crime is that it is boring. The film is boring not because of it's subject matter, but by the way that subject matter is handled.  None of the characters feel like real people, they all, or almost all, deliver lines and performances (performances gravely influenced by direction) that are at right angles to the actions of real people.<br/><br/>Ignore it's reputation, see the film, and then ask yourself ""What up with that?""."

","I only watched this movie because there was such an incredible amount of hype about it. I cannot fathom why. It is repulsive.<br/><br/>I only continued to watch it to see if there would be some redeeming quality or some point to it. But by the time I got to the end, I felt like I needed to take a shower or rinse my mouth out with mouthwash.<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever despised a character in a movie as much as Holly Hunter's Ada. It was, quite frankly, irritating that she was ""mute"". I wanted to reach through the screen and strangle her. A great ending to the movie would have been if she had drowned. I cannot believe she won an Oscar for that, nor Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>I don't know whether Holly Hunter was told to become anorexic for this role but it was not a pleasant sight, seeing her naked. There is nothing erotic about making love to a skeleton.<br/><br/>What I found so offensive about the film was the overt sexual vulgarity. There was a scene in which the husband (Sam Neill) was watching them having sex. A dog came up to him and started licking his hand. He didn't move his hand away and the dog continued to lick his hand. Beastiality come to mind? Worst of all was when her daughter was watching them have sex. That just made me squirm. Afterwards, she imitated what she saw by graphically humping a tree trunk, the other children then imitating her. At this point in the film I felt sick. Child porn come to mind?<br/><br/>When the finger got cut off and the daughter was forced to ""messenger"" it, I'd had enough.<br/><br/>At no point during writing, filming and production of this abomination, did anyone think they could have turned this into a beautiful period piece instead of the smut that it was?"

","In short, I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Holly Hunter's character and Sam Neill's character both seemed intensely psychotic to me, while Harvey Keitel's character seemed flat and unconvincing. Since this movie is a character drama, the lack of believable characters is, in my opinion, fatal.<br/><br/>Perhaps some people can still enjoy movies even when they can't relate to the characters at all, but I'm not one of those people. I found most of the characters' actions in this movie to be highly arbitrary, which is frustrating.<br/><br/>Some positives: The piano music is nice, and some of the visuals are quite good.<br/><br/>Another negative: I felt that the movie's feminist themes were somewhat heavy-handed."

I understand that there were a lot of issues with repressed sexuality back in the Victorian era...but the movie was not MADE in the Victorian era.  Holly Hunter is depicted as completely helpless, and the men in her life are both complete jerks.  The viewer is supposed to believe that she loves Harvey Keitel's character...meanwhile, he has her trading sexual favors in order to get her piano from him, which never should have been his to begin with!  Her husband seems like a decent enough guy until he find out about the affair, and one can't really blame him for being angry since his wife basically refuses to come anywhere near him, though his subsequent behavior is inexcusable.  Other elements of the story, such as the relationship between Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin's father and the reasons behind Holly Hunter's muteness, were either underdeveloped or unexplained altogether.  All in all, the performances are good, and Anna Paquin's performance in particular is riveting, but the film still irritated me."

"Pelrad","2","6","12","15 April 1999"," Gives the disgusting message: ""It's okay to abuse women""
","""The Piano"" gives the message: it's okay to abuse women because they will end up falling in love with you anyway. There have been famous trials where the keepers of ""sex slaves"" have held their defense as being that their captors fell in love with them, so what they did was justified. This is the same message that is given by ""The Piano"". In the film, we are supposed to believe that a woman is ""forced"" to marry a man that she doesn't care for, as if she had no choice; thus, women are portrayed as animals rather than humans - having no free will. Like the movie ""Radio Flyer"" which had abused children overcome their victimization through fantasy, ""The Piano"" has the woman take out her frustrations by playing her piano. She insists that it be taken to her new home - a remote location. Her will seems to be strong here, even though we are to believe that her will was not there when ""forced"" into marriage. Incidentally, she is mute but obviously not deaf. She further ""escapes"" being with her husband by taking piano lessons from a man that begins molesting her - played by one actor who could pull this off (Harvey Keitel). We are given a very clear message that she cannot stand this - which seems right. But, suddenly, she falls in love with him. He is slimy and sleezy. Her husband finds out, but, surprisingly, he doesn't seem to mind - he hides in the piano to watch their goings on. But then he forbids her to see him. She writes him a brief love-note which her husband intercepts and reacts violently to this. Hmmm...he didn't mind watching them in the act, but when he finds out that she writes him a love note, he goes mad? Strange. I won't give away how the story ends; you are probably sick to your stomach already. No film could paint such a degrading view of women. The film is pro macho man and anti-woman. Its only redeeming value is the beautiful music and symbolism of the piano which seems to be the source of all the evil. (2 out of 10)"
"ishjtar","1","7","15","20 January 2013"," Utterly nonsensical
","In my opinion a good alternative film stands out because of its emphasis on character development and story line. The Piano fails in both aspects.<br/><br/>The film tries to depict a love triangle without providing the necessary background. <br/><br/>The location of the story is never explicitated. The viewer is left to derive it must be New Zealand because the indigenous population are called Maoris.<br/><br/>The viewer lacks crucial information about the social position and the past of the protagonists and therefore cannot understand their state of mind and motives.<br/><br/>How did Ada become mute ? Who fathered little Flora ? Why was Alisdair chosen as her husband ? How did she feel when this arranged marriage was announced to her ? <br/><br/>Is Alisdair a rich or important member of the community ? What exactly is his trade ? How and why did he choose Ada for a wife ? Why is he so shy and insecure ? <br/><br/>How did Baines end up in New Zealand ? Is he an employee, an associate or simply a neighbour of Alisdair ? Why is he so bitter ? <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>To top of the lack of character development the actions and decisions of the protagonists are often completely illogical.<br/><br/>Ada has clearly stated to Alisdair how dear the piano is to her. Therefore surely he knows trading the instrument with Baines will hardly win her heart ? <br/><br/>Baines seems merely interested in the looks of Ada and manipulates her into sleeping with him. Why does she suddenly fall in love with him ?<br/><br/>Why would Flora side with her stepfather against her own mother ? <br/><br/>Why does Baines not rush to rescue Ada immediately upon learning her dreadful fate ?<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Finally, the clumsy portrayal of some scenes ads to the frustration of the viewer.<br/><br/>Who would manage to cut off just a single digit with an axe when the entire hand is on the block ?!<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>In conclusion I find The Piano utterly nonsensical. How a budget was established to shoot this crap let alone how it gathered such critic acclaim is beyond me. <br/><br/>There, now anyone opposed can brand me an ignorant sexist ;-) ;-) ."
"loredenizen","10","7","15","26 May 2004"," A Magickal Overview
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>As a student of metaphysics and magick I found ""The Piano"" to be rich and detailed in it's illustration of fundamental magickal principles, i.e. kundalini, the ""true will"", and polarities (yin & yang). Ada's muteness was a physical manifestation of a throat chakra blockage, as this is the chakra that relates to self-expression.<br/><br/>Note the sort of female archetype Ada represented is the kind men find most threatening. She is silent, inscrutable, unpredictable, powerful, with a mind of her own, like the ocean that carries her in and, and the conclusion, away. <br/><br/>Baines and Stewart could not have been more different, and here depict the yin-yang polarities that generate the conflict in which Ada finds herself enmeshed. <br/><br/>I don't know anything about the Moari, but in the film they seem to be a pretty free and open people. Indigenous cultures are highly magickal, attuned to the rhythms and cycles of the earth and sky. I assume Baine's tattoos signify a degree of initiation into their mysteries. I gather that Baine's work with the Maori opened him up to the point that not only was he able to ""hear"" Ada through her music, but really ""see"" her, in a way that Stewart would never be able to. <br/><br/>The ""arrangement"" Baines made with Ada basically amounted to a sex-magick operation. It was a successful one, replete with the usual blowback one can expect from these sorts of thing. The fact that the operation worked can be attributed to Baine's single minded focus and that he was in actuality the right man for her. He loved her for all the ""right"" reasons. They resonated together.<br/><br/>Baines had a limited time to generate enough Kundalini to show Ada how he felt about her, get her to reciprocate, and then stand the universe on it's head so that they could be together.<br/><br/>The ""arrangement"" was in my eyes the most genius part of the film. While it would appear that Baines has the upper hand it is really Ada who is in control, because he is thrall to her. He asks for permission every step of the way, and she grants it. He allows her to set the terms. She is an equal partner in their process.<br/><br/>I must digress here because Ada's will is usually expressed by what she choses NOT TO DO, i.e. won't speak, won't sleep with Stewart, etc. The only time we see really see her chosing TO DO something it is in relationship to Baines. In this respect he succeeds in ""giving her a voice"" in her destiny.<br/><br/>To overcome their barriers Baines uses touch. His touch was always gentle, even worshipful. When he appears naked before her rather than an aggressive move it is a sign of his vulnerability. Contrast that with Stewart, who could not tolerate being vulnerable. Baines succeeds in raising enough kundalini to charge them both up and the piano as well.<br/><br/>When forbidden to see Baines, Ada tries equlibrate by working the other side of the formula with Stewart. This is where she tries to undress him, caress and explore his body, but he won't play. <br/><br/>Naturally events escalate to the crisis level, after which Stewart realizes he can't fight fate and lets Ada go, although not out of any altruism but rather so that he can keep his stiff upper lip and go on pretending none of it ever happened. <br/><br/>The ending is terribly ambiguous, although it's far more satisfying to think Ada consciously submerged the past and was reborn into a new life of love and happiness in a bright, sunny, modern place. If Stewart showed no growth then Ada and Baines must necessarily grow, as they represent the other polarity. Of course, if Ada did drown herself one could view it as hers and Baines' punishment for messing with the natural order of things. Such is the trouble with magick. <br/><br/>There is so much information encoded in ""The Piano"" that I could go on for days, but I just wanted to express my views on these points, as they seemed the most important."

","In order for me to enjoy a character based film like this I must have some reason to like the characters.<br/><br/>I loved Harvey Keitel, Anna Paquin, Sam Neill but even though I normally really like Holly Hunter and her acting was good, what is there to possibly like about her character. She is a self absorbed jerk who acts like a spoiled little slut (I hate that word but it is appropriate for description). The way she treated Sam Neill was deplorable. She even tries to kill herself at the end and leave her daughter an orphan. I was hoping everyone would get as fed up with her crap as I did and leave her in the woods! Then we wouldn't get to see anymore of her selfish tantrums. Why is it that we as men are suppose to fall for any woman in any movie as long as she is not half bad looking. No matter how badly women treat men, they get away with anything and men are portrayed as buffoons that are to just put up with it.

","Dark and bleak entry from writer-director Jane Campion (Oscar-winning for the former and Oscar-nominated for the latter) which concerns a mute British woman (electric Oscar-winner Holly Hunter) who moves to newly colonized New Zealand in the mid-19th Century. She has been promised in marriage to Sam Neill by her father. Thus she makes the long trek to the South Island of the small country with little more than her young daughter (surprise Oscar-winner Anna Paquin) and her most prized possession (the titled item). Hunter has refused to speak supposedly since the unfortunate death of her first husband and uses the piano as an outlet to express her feelings and thoughts. Immediately it is realized that Neill is not capable of love and that native Harvey Keitel may be the person that Hunter desperately needs in her life. A forbidden love affair blossoms between Hunter and Keitel, but how will Neill and Paquin react when Hunter's secret disappears? ""The Piano"" thrives on its performances (Hunter and Paquin in particular) and has a soul of its own with its haunting score. However Campion's screenplay is not near as concrete as I would have liked. She seems unsure of where she wants to go with the story and ultimately her direction suffers as well. Honored left and right in 1993, ""The Piano"" pales miserably to ""Schindler's List"" and lacks the overall heart and intensity of ""The Remains of the Day"". Still a good movie, but never quite hit the right notes with me. 4 stars out of 5."
"Guratza","1","5","10","11 January 2017"," A glorification of passiveness and weakness
","With Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel, I was expecting to see one of the best movies ever. Each of them, alone, are reasons to see a movie, as they are amazing actors, usually involved with interesting if not thrilling films.<br/><br/>This was not the case.<br/><br/>The lead Character, Ada, is an annoying, weak creature, with almost no will of her own. Her life is left adrift to the wind, like a feather carried away. She stopped speaking, she had a child, now she is force-wed to a rich man, and none of these was her own choice. Throughout the film, almost nothing she does is her own choice. She can't speak, because she has nothing to say. She is an empty vessel, that happens to be a very good piano player, but by no means she could ever be considered an artist. There is nothing artistic in her lack of personality, her lack of character and her lack of strength. Art is all about the opposite, a triumph of will, expression and attitude, over the meaninglessness of human existence. The only thing that Ada shows is denial and refusal. She wouldn't even give in to Harvey Keitel's desire, but not because she doesn't want to. ""Want"" is an unknown word for her. That is, because all she can do is deny. She is driven to him by instinct, not by conscious decision. She is a weak, pathetic human being, that also stands against all values of female empowerment, and not only should she have drowned with her piano, but not have existed in the first place. Such characters are a disgrace for the human race, and only can be used as stepping stones for the forces of tyranny. On top of all that, she is accompanied by her even-more annoying, obnoxious daughter (although, a great performance by Anna Pacquin).<br/><br/>Sam Neill's character makes no sense also. His attitude towards life is equally a submission to the slavery of non-free will. He marries a woman he doesn't know, and believes he is gonna love her, and she will love him back, and even though these could've been customs of those times - this suggestion doesn't make sense, even by neolithic standards. We are humans, and deep inside we all know what love is, no matter what social standards and fads of a certain era may try to force into us.<br/><br/>So we're left with our ""hero"" being George Baines, a potential rapist. If I was a woman I'd be even more angry with this sexist, sentimental piece of garbage that tries to glorify victims, weakness and passiveness.<br/><br/>Don't fall far this movie. We've grown out of this stuff as a species."

This poor little girl is screaming her head off telling him to stop and he just chops away! And to make things worse, you see a nasty spray of blood spurt all over the girl. Ewe!!! (No wonder the girl grew up to play in an HBO TV series about vampires). The whole thing was acted out well and the plot had potential. There just needed to be a different script: not as dark or depressing or gory. And they could have definitely cut the nudity. The actors were not attractive and no one wants to see that.

And he was ultimately portrayed as a stereotype, which totally went against his persona in the earlier part of the movie.  Ada should have been slapped for her childlike behavior.

Gosh, one wonders how entertainment like that can go so unappreciated! Throw in a kid who is bratty half the time and you have more incentive to watch this crowd-pleaser.

","Even 24 years later I can recall how bad this movie was. I thought to take my fiancé to this as we are both amateur classical musicians, the title suggested a musical theme, I like Sam Neill, and early reviews had raved. We saw it in a theater just off the Princeton campus, full of date-night couples with the guys sucking up a chick-flick. The music was a catastrophic disappointment. The main character plays the same awful insipid piano tune the entire movie. The tune was anachronistic- clearly written in the late 20th century by a mediocre film composer, and being played in a mid-19th century setting. It was difficult to suspend disbelief every time it was played. Was hoping for some Beethoven Piano sonata music or at least something from the era. To my ear, she might just as well have been playing ""Hey Jude"". The characters engendered no empathy in me. As an example, near the end of the movie the piano is being moved by boat and falls overboard, entangling the Holly Hunter character and dragging her down to the bottom of the ocean. Things look bad for her, and I was delighted. ""Thank God this movie is over!"" As I prepared to get up to leave, the guy jumps overboard, rescues her, and the movie goes on another ten minutes or so. Ugh. When the credits finally started I couldn't help myself, and blurted out sarcastically ""My, that was uplifting."" I think every guy in the theater erupted laughing (and probably ruined their chances for the night given the tough Princeton-feminist crowd). I thought to say that this is the worst ""guy movie"" ever made, but my fiancé, now wife of 20 years, never passes on an opportunity to rant about this horrible film. I'm pretty sure I've always had almost zero respect for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts, but the awards this film received were confirmatory.

I could not hear the soundtrack. I quickly realized why Jane Campion (writer/director) fought with her producers to have Holly Hunter removed. Try watching the movie without sound and you will see it also...<br/><br/>When Holly wants to portray sadness, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she wants to portray happiness, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she is excited, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. When she is scared, she opens her mouth and stares off into the distance. Throughout the film, she doesn't change a single bit. What does change is the soundtrack.<br/><br/>After being tortured with this film for a month-long run at the theater, I finally saw it on video and I thought it was OK. The soundtrack makes the film. It makes it appear that Holly Hunter can act.<br/><br/>So, all in all, I'd suggest just getting the soundtrack and listening to it. However, you won't get a very brief shot of Harvey Keitel's penis. I was utterly amazed at the number of people who came to the movie just for a few frames of an ugly guy's penis.<br/><br/>Side note: One woman told me that she was planning to rent the movie, but she stopped watching art movies after the 'cutting off the finger' scene in Farewell My Concubine. I really wanted to tell her she would love The Piano, but I was nice. I told her to go get a snack when Sam Neill got the axe."

","I love movies. I love foreign film, dark film, artistic film, different film. This TRIED to have all of those elements but failed in every aspect.

Both men were filthy, she fell in love with a man that physically assaulted her? That makes no sense- maybe if she had actually taught him piano I could see how that could happen, There is not one redeeming lesson or moral, she does not choose anything for herself, and after all that she gets rid of the piano?

"crculver","5","4","8","29 July 2017"," A woman married off to one colonist in 19th-century New Zealand is seduced by another, in a tale that becomes a trite romance novel
","Jane Campion's third feature film, THE PIANO is a historical drama that tells of a Scottish woman, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter), who is married off to a colonist in New Zealand that she has never met. Ada is mute, a development that mysteriously came upon her in childhood, but she is a virtuoso pianist and her cherished instrument is one way she communicates her feelings to the world. As Ada and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) land on the shores of New Zealand's South Island sometime in the mid-19th century, her new husband Stewart (Sam Neill) ignores her sign-language entreaties to carry her piano inland along with their other belongings. Feeling no love for this man she has been forced to marry, Ada is drawn into sexual bargaining with another colonist, Baines (Harvey Keitel) who offers to get her the piano back if she does what he wants.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is an interesting study in sexual power and the tragedy of a woman's lot during this historical era. Neither Stewart or Baines are admirable men; Stewart is uncaring of Ada's true passion for the piano, but Baines exploits her distress and powerlessness to get what he wants and he doesn't respect consent. Unfortunately, as the film develops, Campion decides to ultimately turn this into a straight-up romance novel, where the heroine willingly gives in to the roguish bad-boy. I realize that Campion might go for the common desire of a woman to feel desired, but that shouldn't come at the expense of glorifying a creep as she does here.<br/><br/>To better serve as a foil for Baines, Stewart's squareness is played up, and the two characters are reduced to crude cutouts of a ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". This extends to a critique of 19th-century colonialism and racism: naturally, as the man who audiences are supposed to feel is disgusting and unattractive, Stewart is keen on stealing land from the indigenous Maori people. Baines, on the other hand, as the cool heartthrob, hangs out with the Maori and respects their culture even to the point of learning their language and tattooing his face.<br/><br/>Well, even if the actual plot is a ridiculous pulp fantasy, the production values are fine. New Zealand's wild shore and rainforests are memorably captured by cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. The film has a distinctive blue cast that unites the thick cover of the forest and the depths of the sea. While some controversy remains about the depiction of the Maori people here, they are still given a great deal of screen time and the ability to speak their own language on film. The piano-heavy soundtrack by English composer Michael Nyman is deservedly celebrated: deliberately anachronistic, its saccharine, minimalist feel of the 20th century represents Ada's innermost thoughts.<br/><br/>There is good acting as well. Anna Paquin, of course, won an Oscar for her depiction of Flora, and one wouldn't expect such mature composure and convincing emotions from a child of this age. Holly Hunter has to convey everything through gestures and facial expressions and she does this marvelously. One of the delights of Campion's feature debut SWEETIE was Genevieve Lemon, and here in a supporting role she turns in here a mildly comedic performance that adds some levity to the severe sexual drama.<br/><br/>Seeing it again some two decades after it came out, THE PIANO feels like a rather slighter film than I remembered it, and it is difficult to understand what drew critics to the time to rave about it. I would really only recommend this to people with a specific interest in New Zealand or Michael Nyman's soundtrack, but I don't see this as an all-time classic."

"bwaynef","Null","4","8","5 April 1999"," Strikes a wrong chord
","Years ago, when foreign ""art"" films by the likes of Federico Fellini were all the rage, attracting attention even among the general populace, Mad magazine parodied these often difficult to comprehend films, suggesting that the more obscure the plot and the more ambiguous the actions of the characters, the more lavish the critics would be in their praise.  Alfred E. Newman and company also provided tips for their readers who wanted to make their own art film, something that was possible because, at the time, the more amateurish the production, the more authentic it was thought to be. There is nothing amateurish about ""The Piano,"" Jane Campion's film that, if not for ""Schindler's List"" would likely have won the 1993 Best Picture Oscar, and some might argue that it is not foreign since the characters speak English, but otherwise it meets all the requirements set down by Mad magazine for an ""art"" film:  It is obscure, ambiguous, and just plain stupid.<br/><br/>The piano of the title is, I reckon, meant to be symbolic, but what does it symbolize?  The sexuality of the lead character, Ada?  Ada is a mute married to a man whose neighbor also has designs on her, but no matter how strong the passion both men feel, Ada's only satisfaction comes through playing that piano.  Her playing would seem to represent masturbation.  Men, of course, are brutes only interested in their own pleasure.  They don't make love.  They only have sex.  If Ada is to experience orgasm, she will, as dozens of women's magazines and TV talk shows will tell you, have to do it herself.<br/><br/>Set in an ill-defined period that resembles the 19th century (at least the way it is usually depicted on film), the movie's costumes, cinematography, and set designs are very pleasing to the eye, as is Holly Hunter as Ada and Anna Pacquin as her daughter.  Though neither performance was deserving of an Oscar, both are quite good considering the foolishness of the script. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill as Ada's lovers are okay, too.  Still, like those ""art"" films parodied in Mad magazine, ""The Piano"" is simply nonsense--a ""woman's film"" (egad!) that bashes men as forcefully as Ada hits those keys.  It is as fashionable as ""political correctness,"" just as silly, and just as likely to be laughed at in years to come."
"neil_mc","5","5","11","6 May 2003"," Not the most cheery of tales
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>Firstly I have to say that I'm bemused as to how Holly Hunter received an Oscar for this. She doesn't have any dialogue, therefore you would expect her to at least show off a facial expression or two. But no - she doesn't even have any of those in her locker, and instead maintains the same utterly depressing face throughout the entire two hours. To be honest, the whole story nearly bored me to death. To have the main character in the film as a mute isn't the best start, but we are not even offered any thoughts as to her predicament through the use of voice-over. Only at the beginning and end does her 'mind speak' and in all honesty I expected a lot more of this, particularly with the torment she suffers. Because of this, I couldn't sympathise with her at all as she was as distant to me as she was to the characters.<br/><br/>It seems ambiguous as to why she is mute in the first place - the obvious and most intriguing explanation being that she is seeking attention. Indeed she decides at the end of the film that she wants to speak now, as the idea of mutism is simply brushed aside.<br/><br/>The most discouraging aspect about this film on the whole is that nothing much happened. The pacing is extremely slow and laboured and in the end there isn't much to take from it. I'm still not sure how it received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture - very strange."

She also constantly shows no care for her young daughter, in fact her new husband seems more like a parent to her kid than she does.

","This movie is so bad, other than its cinematography, it's hard to believe it received so much praise at the time of its initial release, and continues to do so.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>I found none of the main characters sympathetic nor likable. Not even little Anna Paquin's character, Flora, the daughter of main character Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter); at a few occasions throughout the movie one felt the little girl Flora was consciously and with purpose trying to cause trouble for her mother and create turmoil and upset for the other main characters. Main character Ada McGrath was selfish, self-absorbed, angry, manipulative and seemingly uninterested in even communicating with anyone around her other than her daughter, and then only to express her demands, never to inquire about the feelings of anyone else. Rather than attempt to make it clear she was determined to get her piano back in some honest way, she immediately whored herself to her neighbor and cuckolded her new husband to reacquire it. Even her expression of ""love"" for the neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel) seemed only to be made as a means of effecting her escape from her arranged marriage. Husband Alistair Stewart (Sam Neill) was clueless, selfish, mean-spirited (for his own gain he traded away his new wife's treasured piano shortly after first leaving it on the beach rather than as well as committing his wife to teaching piano lessons on it within days of meeting her, after having first left it on the beach rather than make arrangements to transport it to their home!), a bit of a sicko (spying on your wife shagging your neighbor through cracks in a wall and from under the floor of your neighbor's house!), and he ultimately violently disfigured his wife in a fit of jealous rage. Neighbor Baines takes an immediate shine to his neighbor's new wife and spies a way to coerce her into his bed by trading for the wife's piano! Under the guise of wanting piano lessons he instead offers the piano back to his neighbor's wife in exchange for a long series (44 at first ... one for every black key in the piano!) of various demeaning physical intimacies and ultimately sexual favors! My how ""romantic""! Ugh.<br/><br/>Lastly ... everyone in this movie sported such wretchedly poor regional accents that listening to the characters speak was cringe inducing. Only Sam Neill's voice could be heard without shuddering; while I'm not sure even he sounded quite right as a Kiwi, at least he sounded vaguely but authentically ""of the British Empire"" so you could at least mentally give him a pass. Little Anna Paquin's weird effort at a Scottish accent was all over the place. Harvey Keitel ... I don't know what the hell he was supposed to sound like but it was a mess. Even the ""mute"" character played by Holly Hunter spoke enough butchered Scottish accent inside her head that one wishes her inner voice was also mute.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy this movie because I remember how much praise it received when it came out. However even nearly thirty years later, and on my second viewing now, I found it even worse than the first time around, which unfortunately I guess I didn't recall before starting watching it tonight to pass the time during this year's ""COVID19 / Corona Virus"" pandemic enforced ""social distancing"" and working from home.<br/><br/>Summary: Beautifully Shot. Otherwise Horrid."

","American viewers bad? European viewers good? The movie had no hidden meanings, everything was right there in the open. One has to look no further than George Baines' full frontal nudity scene. However, if I, the superior European, offered insight for the true meaning of ""The Piano"" it would go something like this: Jane Campion's story was about the assassination of JFK. When Ada McGrath (Jackie Kennedy) lost her finger, that was the symbol of JFK being assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald (Alisdair Stewart). The George Baines character represented Ari Onasis. He took Jackie away from the USA to the safety of Greece. And of course Flora McGrath was none other than John boy. Jane Campion used poetic license in an ingenious way making him a female, to further add mystery to this powerful story."
"JuguAbraham","7","5","12","21 April 2002"," Clever film that makes you wonder...
","I have seen the movie twice. I liked it the first time because it was refreshingly different, restrained in some parts, erotic to an extent, with some brilliant camerawork of Stuart Drybergh and choreography (beach scene with Holly Hunter, Keitel and Paquin, with the overhead shot and the imaginative designs of footprints in the sand).<br/><br/>My second viewing had me reassessing if a viewer can be led to like a film without thinking rationally. Take the example of Paquin carrying the piano key with the written message. She takes one path, retraces it and takes another. This crucial action changes the course of the film. Why did she make that choice? Coincidence? If it was deliberate, the relationship between the child and foster father is not adequately developed. The director persuades us to notice this decision with a high angle shot. We in the audience know that Kietel's character is illiterate--but the message is finally read by someone who could read. And so the story gathers momentum.<br/><br/>The ""quiet"" strength of the film is in the character who chooses to remain mute. A finger is chopped off but there is no howl of pain, only blood, only a resignation to fate.<br/><br/>Despite a great performance by Hunter and impressive direction by Campion, I begin to have a nagging doubt if the audience is meant to leave their mind behind and merely indulge their senses, what they see and hear...On second viewing, the script seems more manipulative rather than virtuous. In the epilogue, what are we to make of the metal prosthetic finger--that all is healed? Or was it a convenient way to end the film?"

","Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued me—so I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw.<br/><br/>Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky start—complicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus""romance"" begins to blossom.<br/><br/>You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a ""bad"", but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic."

"beautifulbooks","10","4","10","8 October 2003"," My personal recommendation is to watch this movie more than once...
","Warning: Spoilers sprinkled throughout!<br/><br/>When this movie came out 10 years ago, I watched it and thought it quite good. I have watched it again, for each of the past two days, and come away with a much deeper appreciation... even passion for it.<br/><br/>I found I was able to grasp so many more of the expressions and bits of dialogue which I had missed in previous viewings. My personal recommendation is to watch this movie more than once. The first may capture you with its story and the passion which flows through it but there is so much blatantly ""visual"" material that you can't absorb the rest.<br/><br/>I can see how some of the other reviewers could form their opinion that this was soft porn, as there is plenty of simple nakedness and scenes of people loving. However, to me, Baines' disregard for clothing simply goes along with his blunt honesty. Why hide what you are feeling or thinking? When you see him bathing and washing his clothes in the river with his Maori(an?) friends, his nakedness and that of the others does not seem pornographic, just practical and comfortable. It makes the uptight ""civilized"" folks seem even more pathetic. Sometimes, clothes just get in the way.<br/><br/>During subsequent viewings pay special attention to the facial expressions, especially of Ada while she plays her piano. When you do, you sense a bit of what Baines (Harvey Keitel) is stirred by. Unable to speak, Ada plays her piano, and it is as if she doesn't miss the ability to speak with her mouth, as the music she can produce with her fingers is so much more beautiful than spoken words. It wasn't until my second viewing that I caught that Ada was able to speak with her mind to her former lover, like laying music on a sheet. At first I thought she was just telling a fantasy or sugar-coated story to her young daughter, the product of that particular relationship. Towards the end of the movie, however, when her situation seems so hopeless, she allows herself to communicate with her ""husband"" the truth of her need and sadness. It took something so shocking to break him out of the morbid path he was bent on following, and it works, much to the relief of the characters and the viewers.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the ideas I was struck by is the recurrence of being slapped in the face by the reality that one's ability to speak (Ada), or read (Baines), or see (the piano tuner) does not always limit one from finding ways to express and fully enjoy passion and joy. Sometimes, it seems, a person can allow that ""disability"" to send them more fully in other directions, perhaps finding their way less distracted because they focus so much more on the senses or abilities they still have. Sometimes I have caught myself recognizing that my life might be so much simpler if I was only really interested in one or two things instead of the myriad fascinations that strike me and take me down different paths.<br/><br/>Baines has found his place in New Zealand, with the Maori people instead of in Europe with his wife. He is surrounded by their love and respect and you can't help but notice the happiness they find in their simple ways. The blunt honesty in their speech seems to match that of Baines. This contrasts greatly with the stilted Victorian mannerisms of Ada's husband and other European settlers there.  Ada doesn't fit in with them and likely never did even while in Europe. At first you think that is because of her muteness, but then you see her fire and forthright spirit shining in her daughter Flora. It becomes obvious that their honesty and beauty will just wilt away if they stay in the oppressive ""civilized"" world.<br/><br/>The ending, with Flora contentedly cartwheeling across the grass and Ada playing her piano and sharing a tremendous love with Baines, was beautiful. I smile just thinking about it and look forward to owning the DVD."

","Part of the downside of writing movie reviews is that on occasion, you are forced or compelled to watch some utter tripe. Movies that have little value as entertainment are all too easily found on the shelves of your local rental store or lurking hidden on TV schedules, ready to pounce on unsuspecting viewers. Thank God for that rare film that comes along that is not only beautiful to watch but also contains a powerful story lit up by electric performances and also offers a very different experience to other movies out there. This might be a little Oscar-friendly for some but that shouldn't detract from what is a haunting love story with the oddest of protagonists.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a Scottish mute living in the mid-1800's who is married by her father to landowner Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). Together with her treasured piano and her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin), they are shipped off to New Zealand to spend the rest of their lives with Stewart. At first, Ada and Flora distrust Stewart after he leaves her piano on the beach but eventually, it is retrieved by Stewart's right-hand man Baines (Harvey Keitel), a fellow Scot who has integrated himself with the local Maori. As time passes, Ada's attention is diverted to Baines after he asks her to teach him how to play the piano and soon, their romance threatens to boil over and ruin everything.<br/><br/>You can always tell which performances have been recognised by the Academy - films like ""Training Day"" and ""Monster's Ball"" both feature actors that lift the film beyond mere drama. Hunter's in ""The Piano"" is another, giving a faultless performance as Ada, whose haunting looks stay with you some time after the film has finished. Keitel is also superb, being both fearless and sympathetic as Baines. But for me, this is director Jane Campion's masterpiece - it is just a wonderful film to watch, each shot feels painted and lit with painstaking effort. Take the shot of the piano on the beach or of Flora skipping over the hills singing. It looks fabulous, a real pleasure for the eyes and as the ears too as the soundtrack is equally haunting and most of it played by Hunter herself.<br/><br/>It might not be everyone's cup of tea but ""The Piano"" gives you something that you just don't get from most other movies. It's a wonderfully quirky romance that doesn't resort to quick titillation (as I suspect a male director would have done) but builds the tension nicely as the film progresses. It also offers a wealth of acting talent on display and then gives them a decent script to get their teeth into, meaning they have to do more than just deliver lines. It even gives your ears something pleasant to listen to, assuming that delicate piano notes are your thing - which they are. It's difficult to say that this is entertaining because it's more cerebral than that, like a Booker Prize winning novel. You might not get it first time and if you're not used to thinking about films then this will turn you right off. However, it's good to catch a film that really delivers and thankfully, ""The Piano"" is just such a film."

","Brilliant, beautiful, you have not lived until you see it. I went and bought the book, which was beautiful, and explained some of the mysteries not dealt with in the movie. As always, Hunter, the absolute best actor, was fantastic. Her role as the mute, Scottish woman Ada Wyston Mcgrath, whose one from of expression and release was her piano, was beautiful. A mute outcast, rejected from society in her home town, merely for being mute, only to be aggravated further by her having an illegitimate daughter Flora McGrath (Anna Paquins very first movie, also a brilliant actor). Flora being the result of a night of passion with her piano tutor. Not a most suitable and acceptable thing to do at the time. Her father, desperate for her to settle down with someone and become a respectable member of society, sends her to New Zealand for an arranged marriage. When she arrives her relationship with her new husband, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), gets off to a rather terrible start. Having to leave her precious piano at the beach, she does everything possible to retrieve it, aggravating Alisdair, who, no matter how hard he tries cannot manage to fathom why the instrument is so important. His friend, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), however sees this, and uses it to his advantage. My personal favourite parts are the voice overs of Adas thoughts at the beginning and end of the movie. There is a silence where hath been no sound/There is a silence where no sound may be/In the cold grave under the deep, deep sea/Or in wide desert where no life is found/Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound/No voice is hushed, no life treads silently/Though clouds and cloudy shadows wander free/That never spoke over idle ground/But in green ruins, in the desolate walls/Of antique palaces, where man hath been/Though the dun fox or wild hyena calls/And owls that flit continually between/Shreik to the echo and the low winds moan/There the true silence is- self conscious and alone -Silence, Thomas Hood (1798-1845)"

","I agree with the other viewers who commented that the film on the surface looks promising, but when you sit down and watch this film, you find that it does not deliver.  It has nice cinematography, and you are immediately drawn into the innocent and fragile world as seen through the eyes of the mute character, Ada.  Holly Hunter deserved an academy award for this portrayal. But when you try to find substance below the surface of this film, you come up short.  I feel like this was a poor excuse for the director to show as much flesh as an R-rating allows, and the sex scenes are as trashy as ones depicted on the soft porn shows put on after midnight on Cinemax.<br/><br/>(MILD SPOILER)<br/><br/>The only real drama in this film happens after Alisdair Stewart cuts off Ada's index finger.  But before this, there is no development in the plot. And, after this, there is not that much of a resolution.  I miss the days when directors and writers worked together to develop engaging characters through both good writing and close up camera angles.  Grant it, Ada didn't speak anything besides the voice overs at the beginning and ending of this film, but the other characters should've been given better lines.<br/><br/>Also, this film should've had more subplots.  This is something which would've worked better as a short film, but was stretched a little over two hours.  I give ""The Piano"" one star out of five!"
"tm-sheehan","9","0","0","30 April 2020"," This revisit 30 years on was rewarding
","Isn't it extraordinary how our opinions can change over time ,well mine anyway.
After so many positive comments by people who list this film as one of their all time favourites I thought I should watch The Piano written and directed by New Zealander Jane Campion.
It must be over 30 years ago that I first saw The Piano and It was like seeing it for the first time today .I don't know why I disliked it back then ,there were a lot of changes going on in my life but today I can only praise this film and I'm so glad I was curious enough to revisit it.
There has been so much critical praise heaped on ""The Piano ""I won't add much except to praise the genius of Jane Campion ,the entire cast and technical personnel ,especially the camera people and film editors not only is it the greatest film to be produced in New Zealand but it holds its own with any film anywhere on earth.
The year it was made 1994 The Piano was up against very stiff Hollywood competition with Stephen Spielberg 'S brilliant film ""Schindler's List"" if not for that I suspect I'm not the only one to think ""The Piano "" also would have one Best Picture and Best Director it thoroughly deserved it's 7 nominations and 3 wins.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film to watch of course the breathtakingly beautiful misty forests and sea scapes of New Zealand .
The emotional impact of Holly Hunter's Academy Award winning performance as Ada ( who doesn't have a line of dialogue except subconscious narrative ) and of course Anna Paquin as her precocious adult child daughter Flora are superb .
Anna was only one year older than Tatum O'Neil the youngest Oscar winner and has had a much more impressive film career than Tatum since her win.
The actors Sam Neil as Alisdair ,Ada's patient but ineffectual husband and Harvey Keitel as George Barnes the lonely overseer with a vivid fantasy emotional life are also very impressive in these roles .
I did wonder if the few sexual scenes could be filmed as convincingly in today's ME Too World ? the actors would have to follow much stricter guidelines I suspect.<br/><br/>Finally I guess I'm writing this to encourage anyone who feels very strongly about or dislike a much praised movie to keep an open mind and give it another chance as I did the reward was worth it.
Ps the music of course by Michael Nyman adds to the enjoyment but it's Director and writer Jane Campion who has produced a film where even the title ""The Piano."" An inanimate object becomes almost a living character that determines all the main characters fate and destiny."

Looked like the little girl from x-men was in this...Anna Paquin. Knew she was going to be a superstar the minute you saw her on screen.

The cinematography is beautiful at times, though lacklustre in others. The piano music which fills the film is wonderful.<br/><br/>But all these plus points can't save a film that is, sadly, lacking in so many crucial areas. This is very much a character-driven film, so when the characterization turns out to be so shallow and cliched, it's a crippling blow which the film can never recover from. It's to Hunter and Paquin's eternal credit that their hopelessly underdeveloped characters achieve the kind of life they do - the rest of the cast cannot match up, and leave their ""characters"" as mere cardboard cut-outs copied from any of a hundred other sources.<br/><br/>It's a pity, because every once in a while this film does throw up some flashes of brilliance. Some scenes are genuinely, beautifully touching- unfortunately, they're rare gems in an ocean of drab. It's easy to see how this film could have been much, much better than it ultimately is, and that's what makes it all the more infuriating, because it's so close to being great, but ultimately falls far short."

Listen to not only the words, but the music, the tone of the moods, and the movement from Holly Hunter's character. The entire film feels like it is taking place on stage. The setting is made for our enjoyment. Watch the setting closely as you watch the characters in the film adapt to the surroundings. You must watch very carefully, you may miss the message that the film is trying to make. Watch.......and Listen......closely."

","Beautifully shot by Jane Campion in a dreamy soft focus The Piano gives the impression of being a better film that it really is. Some mud, some misty woodlands and a few tattooed and grinning Aborigines do not disguise the Mills & Boon plot-line. No matter how hard the viewer tries to get some depth out of the story you come up with nothing. Is this a story of women's lack of voice in the world? No - Ada McGrath is a strong woman who communicates very well, despite not speaking. Is this a story about the desire to create or express ones self? No - the piano is used as currency for sexual favour which Ada McGrath wants as much as George Baines. The seduction scenes are titillating rather than romantic, and the film slowly becomes sordid. The Piano is 9 1/2 Weeks meets The Draftsman's Contract, without the merit of either of those films."

Holly Hunter (Home for the Holidays) won an Oscar for her part, which she played beautifully, specially considering that she played the piano herself.  Oscar winner, Anna Paquin (Fly Away Home )  lights up the screen with her innocence and beauty. She loves that butterfly wing! The acting is good.  The photography is great! The sex scenes were too graphic for me and my household. But it is over all interesting, but I was unable to discern what the core issue was in the movie. After watching this movie the scenes really stuck to my head, I just cannot forget the graphic scenes. I guess they are traumatic scenes!"
"jboothmillard","10","4","13","16 September 2005"," The Piano
","Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Jane Campion has created an excellent film about one woman's inner soul and feeling being expressed by a wonderful sounding instrument. Based in the mid-19th century, a mute woman, Ada (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Holly Hunter) is the woman married to a man she has never met, Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill), so she is leaving Scotland along with her young translating daughter Flora (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Anna Paquin, aka, X-Men's Rogue) to New Zealand's South Island. But the one thing Ada does not want forgotten of all her possessions is her precious piano, the one instrument she can really express herself, and almost communicate with. But her nasty husband (who has no interest in it) sells it to his neighbour, illiterate George (Harvey Keitel). George promises that if Ada teaches and plays the piano for him at his home, he will eventually return it to her. But soon enough, after some despising from Ada, and some stroking, it turns into a real relationship (affair), that will be doomed when Flora and then Alisdair discover their love. It may have tragic conclusions, with Ada's finger chopped off, and Ada being able to let go of her piano, but it is a very touching story. Both Hunter and 11-year-old Paquin deserved their Oscars, and the BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated score by Michael Nyman and Veronika Jenet is exquisite. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Campion, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Harvey Keitel was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Keitel's rubbing of Hunter's small stocking hole (vulnerability). Outstanding!"
"bill-324-11358","5","3","9","22 March 2012"," The piano-shaped object
","As a piano historian, I find it amusing that in a film with its plot centred around a Broadwood square piano, nobody bothered to take a moment to check what one should look like. There are plenty of them on the net, but instead, we have this odd-looking object on the beach that is presumably based on trying to justify the other object used inside the house. That, in turn, seems to be a grand piano, with the ends of the keyboard filled in by peculiar wooden blocks, and the tail end hidden through a partition. Where is the historical accuracy, the authenticity that we come to expect in a costume drama like this? If they made equivalent mistakes with costumes, or allowed a plane to fly over the set, people would say it was unacceptable. Does anyone have any answers for me?"
"jpschapira","9","3","9","19 May 2007"," Layers...
","It's amazing how many layers a movie can have. ""The Piano"" has enough layers for you to watch it ten times and analyze a different element during each viewing. It's also amazing how disturbing a story can be, at the same time it is touching; and how good a person can be, even when he or she is a bit crazy. I came to the conclusion that the three main characters of ""The Piano"" are good hearted people, but with big mental issuesBut that's just one of the layers of the film.<br/><br/>Set in the 1850's, the story follows Ada (Holly Hunter) and her daughter (Anna Paquin) Flora, as they travel to New Zealand, where Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neil), an intended husband she hasn't met, is waiting for Ada to begin a life with her. Ada (she explains to us during a narration at the beginning of the film where her mind is speaking) is mute and plays the piano, so when she arrives to the beach, her piano is loaded down but Stewart refuses to take it to the house; so they leave it on the beach.<br/><br/>There will be one person who will help her get the piano back, and that's Baines (Harvey Keitel), and that's the development of the film about which I can't say no more. The way Ada looks at the Piano (it is worth putting in capital letters because it's another main character) on the beach when she's on top of the hill as she walks to the house; that's the main element of the contemplation present in Jane Campion's direction.<br/><br/>Not only that beautiful shot of the lonely Piano on the beach, but the way she pays attention to the jungle or the houses, when the camera shows empty spaces; in a metaphorical way that really seems to be saying something. That's another magical element: let's call it ""unexplained understanding"". Through Campion's astonishing script is that we also see the layers I'm talking about. She covers a lot in such few words that Holly Hunter's look is enough to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, I'm getting stuck with this review; but because I have many things to say. The intense character study is something from another world. Campion, both in her direction and script, makes sure that every scene has total importance, without differentiating between a main character like Ada or an aboriginal from New Zealand.<br/><br/>Every scene is so intense with the focus on the characters that you can't keep your eyes off the screen, even when the film is slow and depressing like no other. Whether it is in the house, on the beach or inside the jungle, each scene takes the action from ten different angles with a big number of different shots. This is Stuart Dryburgh's flawless achievement in cinematography; which includes close-ups so daring and compelling as the ones he uses now, more than ten years later, in films like ""The Painted Veil"".<br/><br/>I can't forget about Michael Nyman's score, which is not the best thing in the world, but is perfectly combined with every piece Ada plays in her beloved Piano; in order to give a continuing musicality to the picture. Now, I don't know how much Nyman wrote of these pieces Ada play, butThe moments in which she plays each of them and the way she does it and how the pieces sound; I could assure that they represent Ada's feelings in their most original form. I mean, I don't know much about classical music and that's what I'm saying. However, if those pieces existed and were at least known, their title or (as I said) their form would be incredibly connected to Campion's story.<br/><br/>I don't even know how much Campion knows about music, but if she doesn't know anything, it didn't affect this beautiful piece at all. Realize how much I've said about ""The Piano"" and I haven't even mentioned the performances. I shouldn't have to, though: Holly Hunter won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here and it is as simple as it sounds; she doesn't speak a word. Little Anna Paquin, who is know big and talented, was also incredibly talented then with ten years old; and she also got an Oscar for it. She couldn't even watch the film when this happened because she was too young, and apparently she hasn't completely watched it yet.<br/><br/>Sam Neil achieves a remarkable job with a character that requires several big changes of mood and decisions; and that angry actor that Harvey Keitel is presents an unexpected gentleness as the troubled Baines. But as I already mentioned; they are all somehow very troubled. And between this troubled and frightening and confusing and violent environment, Ada sits down and speaks, through her Piano; that, as a colleague of mine said, is her own voice."
"Weredegu","10","3","9","6 March 2007"," Piano lesson about hidden narratives
","After watching 'Girl With a Pearl Earring' the previous day, I bumped into another, by-the-way very well-made, movie with some feminist undercurrents in it. 'The Piano' is not merely feminine, to paraphrase another commenter whose remarks I liked even while not agreeing with them entirely, it is indeed feminist to a degree. Here's how I decode what you find in the movie, without spoilers. This is a story, with some mysteries that you won't be able to fully decipher, that is messy but enjoyable at the same time, and it's kept moving by the layers of hidden narratives that are there for you to explore. So there is a load of other critical stuff in it beside feminism. Think of how 'inappropriately' Ada's little daughter behaves at times! She's annoying, isn't she? But then remember that she's a child who had to move to the end of the world with no option of saying 'no' to the idea. And all those aborigines, they also behave so inappropriately at times! In their case remember that their lands are being bought up for nothing by newcomers of another world, that are intruding their civilization rather inappropriately, one could say. And so on. Getting back to the feminism theme, the piano is the medium that Ada uses to break out of the limitations imposed on her (never having fitted the role of a 'Victorian woman'), she can't use her voice, so she'll rather play the piano scandalously well for a good girl - yeah, that's pretty obvious symbolism alright. The men around her, the characters played by Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel. Well, in my interpretation one is the non-natural man whose rule in society is built on social constructions evident in conventions of the era, while the latter, played by Keitel, is representative of a kind of true, natural manliness. Anyway, I don't want to create the image of being totally self-assured about meanings, for I'm in fact not. And you'll have a lot more questions to ask after the film, I promise. But that's not going to take away the pleasure of watching it, if you're ready to buy into some post-modern, surreal stuff, a really catchy, captivating film score and some truly brilliant cinematography."

"dierregi","5","2","5","25 October 2014"," Never trust a child
","Jane Campion likes the grotesque. In most of her movies some characters are distinctively weird in looks and behavior. The Piano is no exception. Main character Ada, played ferociously by Holly Hunter, is a bit of a freak. Stubborn and self-contained she ""decided"" to remain silent from age six and never spoke a word since.<br/><br/>She also managed to produce obnoxious child Flora out of wedlock, so her father is packing her of from Scotland to New Zealand, where she will get married to Alisdair. The official story is that she is a widow. These are Victorian times, so there is nothing strange in sending Ada to the antipodes to cover up for her indiscretions.<br/><br/>Once in New Zealand, Ada continues to make trouble, starting a reluctant affair with Alisdair's neighbor, George (Keitel, in another naked role). The fact is, Ada loves only her piano (her ""voice"") and Alisdair decided to leave it on the beach where she disembarked, while George decided to have it transported to his hut.<br/><br/>Considering miles of uphill trekking on muddy ground, Alisdair's decision does not seem so unreasonable, but Ada dislikes him for this. Sullen and cold, Ada is sending conflicting messages to those around her. First she is shocked by George's fondling, then she is intrigued. Unfortunately, creepy Flora gets jealous, also shifting her alliance, but from Ada to Alisdair. Her action brings the movie to its climax. A sort of puzzling happy ending shows Ada insisting to have the piano dropped in the sea and attempting suicide, for reasons hard to understand. <br/><br/>Some beautiful landscapes and hunting music hardly make up for the fact that most of the movie is shot in claustrophobic and dark rain forest and three out of four main characters are creepily weird."

I think the setting, deep in rural New Zealand at the time of the colonists, was so original that it brought something completely new to the familiar love triangle story line.<br/><br/>And of course, of course of course, what a wonderful performance by Holly Hunter. It was a stroke of genius to make the lead actress dumb. It makes you concentrate on all the other parts of her performance. Her movement, her expressions, her decisions. And the piano as an emblem works well. The supporting performances from Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin are excellent too.<br/><br/>I can't say this movie is perfect. It does, as I predicted, have that soppy storyline after all. But it's incredibly well done, very refreshing and certainly worthy of those Oscars."

","Agree with others there is not a single character here that is likable or you want to care about. In Hunter, her main character is walled-in and obnoxious to say the least. She made no attempt to relate to anyone except her daughter, then suddenly she's found this great affection for the perverted, scheming Mr.Bain, the neighbor. It was not believable. As for the husband, who for a moment looks like Robert Wagner in a rain hat in an early post, only to revealed to be the inexpressive,aloof Sam Neil whose appearance in any movie is guaranteed flop; maybe the bad attracts the inept. The young daughter is equally repugnant with her own brand of contemptuousness. Lastly director Jane Campion who was New Zealand born, bored a haughty supremacy attitude toward the natives - a third character in this movie. There were no worthy diaglog written for them and they were collectively a servitude with low intel, from the way they were portraited.<br/><br/>If Hunter's only expression comes from playing her piano, or so the underlying theme and the title tells us, you'd wonder why there are not more varying pieces? It is the same piece over and over again except one brief underscored occasion. Could Hunter feels the same mood all the time, which appears that way actually with her dour complexion.<br/><br/>Overall the film moved too slow, too bleak and without substance for much of the first half. There were genuine moments of importance in the finale but I feel the screen play could have a much better outcome if it is handled better or differently, perhaps with more sensitivity."

Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute, brilliant piano mistress who's recently been ""sold""/""married"" to a man she's never met (Sam Neil) in New Zealand. Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's ""marriage"" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, ""I don't understand where this film is going,"" but in the ""how would I act in this situation"" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it.<br/><br/>This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling.

","This movie is problematic, as one person commented earlier. But I liked it because of the imperfections. The characters are just who they are. The story unfolds as it does because of the characters. I'm not sure it can all be easily explained. It's not ""western white man bad"" and ""white man assimilated into native outlook"" better. Whether Jane Campion intended this, I don't know.<br/><br/>This is one of those works that I find myself feeling a like and dislike of every character in the movie, save perhaps for the little girl. The adults are all rather dysfunctional and their interactions show it. Personally, as a female watching the movie, I found Baines unappealing and would not have liked his advances. In theory, I'd go for Stewart, although I can't imagine myself as a mail order bride. (gag) Instead of an industrious, pleasant (at least initially) young man that Stewart was, it could have been some lecherous old curmudgeon. Or a man who beat his wife as a matter of habit.<br/><br/>Certainly, Stewart's early comments were not endearing.

From the gorgeous tumult of the beach scenes, (prefaced by an outstanding underwater shot ot the boat gliding through water) which includes the glorious tableau of Ada playing while Flora dances, to the surreal blue-tinged forrest scene, and the gripping dismemberment part in the rain, the pictureseque quality of this work is haunting.  But the story of emotional turmoil, human volition and love is compelling.

","I completely agree with the many others who have commented that this film tells a story of love and passion. It is extremely therapeutic to watch a Victorian woman overcome the moral dogma of a repressive society, so vivid to us in all those Victorian novels we still love today!<br/><br/>
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br/><br/>I liked the scene where Ada nearly drowns but makes the choice to save herself...I felt Jane Campion was rewriting the fates of all those tragic, stoic, Victorian fallen angels who were, ultimately, unable to save themselves.<br/><br/>But what captivated me the most was how honest and insightful Jane Campion is in her depiction of Ada's growing realisation of her sexual power. Ada does something that the Victorian heroines rarely did...she recognises the sexual power that she can hold over men and takes a lot of pleasure in it, without guilt or shame. Maybe 'Jane Eyre' unconsciously hints at this, and Estella in 'Great Expectations' has been reared to manipulate lovelorn young men mercilessly.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILER!<br/><br/>But Ada is different because she gets to be happy at the end of it all. She isn't made a victim and held up as an example of feminine cruelty and sexual transgression for ever more. Campion acknowledges that her heroine is playing with fire, but happily doesn't judge, just lets her get on with it, to dramatic effect. As a result, the film depicts people who can be passionate, loving, cruel, violent, tender, loyal and selfish; as ambiguous as real people are."

","The Piano is 121 minutes, but it feels like a 3 hour movie. My opinion of this over-rated bunkum, is that it IS over-rated bunkum. I read a few reviews and there are many who feel that this is an art movie. Believe me, this is very far from being art-house. Its that old love triangle, which has been done more times than there are stars in the sky. So, what is it that makes some professional reviewers go weak at the knees after they watch this ? Well there is the voice-over from the mute. A mute talking is so breathtaking...i must give this an extra star. (Thinks the reviewer). It is a grim film to sit through. Just mud and Kiwis..and not a laugh in site. I do concede that the acting and the camera work are both very good, but what we have here is a director who was so intensely trying to make this great---she forgot the fundamentals of movie making.

","Critically acclaimed across the nation, ""The Piano"" attempts to tell the tale of the tragic Ada, who, unable to speak after an horrific accident, is married off by her father to a New Zealander whom she has never met. And so she must travel to this far away, foreign land with her daughter in order to meet her new husband and start over.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter is very impressive as Ada McGrath, the mute Scot who is so very much out of her element in rugged, muddy New Zealand.

Special mention too must go to Ana Paquin as Ada's little girl Flora.<br/><br/>Writer-director Jane Campion's film is visually splendid too (cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh), and features some truly marvelous music from the pen of Michael Nyman. Sadly though the film has a weak link which really lets the whole production down. The script comes off very distant and aloof, as we are stunned by most of the events that shape the film, rather than moved as perhaps we should be. Campion's characters are so well portrayed, yet we find ourselves detached from them, unable to relate in any way to their feelings. Too much is left unexplained both about Ada, and the other important elements of ""The Piano"". Even the comedy seems remote, and although it is quite funny, it is a little too mistimed to come off effectively.

","""The Piano"" is one of those films that becomes famous for one aspect and not so famous for the other.

Holly Hunter is quite good, though not wonderful, as Ada, the mute who, along with her daughter, is sent to New Zealand to meet her new husband through arranged marriage.<br/><br/>What got me about this film was that it was all about the piano - obviously. But there were times when I didn't really like Ada as a character - she seemed like a spoilt little child at times, acting worse than her daughter when she didn't get her way about the piano.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for Harvey Keitel and Sam Neil. They, along with the music, saved this film for me, with very good performances that seemed quite out of character, actually.

","The Piano (1993) was written and directed by Dame Jane Campion. It stars Holly Hunter as Ada McGrath, a woman who is mute. She arrives in New Zealand from Scotland, with her ten-year-old daughter, as a mail-order bride. Anna Paquin plays her daughter, Flora. Her husband, Alisdair Stewart, is portrayed by Sam Neill. Harvey Keitel is their neighbor.<br/><br/>It's hard to say much about the plot without revealing it, so I'll focus on other aspects of the movie. Just for the record, don't watch the trailer if you intend to see the film. The trailer tells too much about the plot.<br/><br/>Dame Jane Campion is a brilliant director, and Holly Hunter is perfect as a strong Victorian woman .Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill are both gifted actors, who give us solid performances.<br/><br/>However, Anna Paquin, a (then) amateur actor, steals the show as her mother's interpreter and companion. Paquin--at age 10--won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>This isn't a film for the squeamish or the faint of heart. (Or for people who are offended by nudity.) We saw it on DVD. It would work better in a theater--some of the scenic shots are breathtaking. The Piano has a very strong 7.6 IMDb rating. (Even the top 1,000 raters--who never like any movie--gave it a 7.1.) I think it deserves that rating and more.<br/><br/>P.S. Holly Hunter plays the piano herself in the film. It's hard to believe that it wasn't dubbed, because her playing is extraordinary."

A nearby neighbour (Harvey Keitel) has his sights on the pianist.<br/><br/>Director Jane Campion (also the screenwriter) has created a movie experience that is sensual from beginning to end. She gets to the heart of nature in every scene even making the viewer experience rare feelings. The opening scene of an arrival at a beach is beautiful and provocative; the sight of the giant waves is stunning but also a dangerous and uncontrollable part of nature that acts as a preview of what's to happen with the characters of the story. The sex scenes are also very unique in that they express a passion and warmth that is rare in films of its era as well as those that have followed; particularly in moments where a facial expression shows genuine pleasure from the sense of being touched.<br/><br/>Campion gets great work from her actors. Keitel and Neill show a sensuous side that might only be encouraged by a director with a feminine perspective. Paquin gives one of the best child performances in cinema. And Hunter's performance is truly amazing. Her facial and body language say so much. In a shocking, climactic scene, her quiet breakdown rips the heart out. Her character is someone who might seem demanding and annoying at first but it is clear later on that Ada is one of those souls who seems more attuned to the spirit world than to the mundane details of the physical world.<br/><br/>The story may have flaws (as others have pointed out) but it is how it is expressed that makes it stand out. Here, Campion is greatly aided by cinematorgrapher Stuart Dryburgh and the music by Michael Nyman. A treasure for the senses.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Jane Campion"

"hall895","4","2","7","3 May 2015"," Out of tune
","Holly Hunter, without saying a word, turns in a remarkable performance in The Piano. It's a shame that performance is stuck in such an unremarkable movie. This is a slow, plodding, grim and quite dull movie. Hunter creates a compelling character but the movie really has very little else going for it. The whole thing is rather pretentious. This is a tough movie to get through.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in the mid-19th century. Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute Scotswoman who has been sold into an arranged marriage to a New Zealander, Alisdair Stewart. So after a long journey Ada comes ashore in New Zealand. She brings two very important things with her. Her young daughter, Flora. And her piano. Playing the piano is the way this woman who cannot speak expresses herself. She pours her heart into her piano playing. So suffice to say her relationship with Alisdair gets off to quite a rocky start when he decides he can't be bothered transporting the piano to his home and leaves it to rot on the beach. This is not going to be a happy marriage.<br/><br/>Alisdair ends up selling the piano, which mind you isn't even his, to his neighbor George Baines. Ada is of course enraged. Further enraged when Alisdair orders her to give George piano lessons. George is a very simple man. He can't read. He has adopted many of the local Maori customs, including tattooing his face. Why does this crude man want to learn how to play the piano? Well he doesn't. He wants Ada. He just wants to watch her play. They come to an arrangement where she can earn her piano back by letting him do things while she plays. And the things George wants to do are not at all innocent. Maybe he'll start by just looking up her skirt. But before long they're naked and in bed. Well, what's a girl to do when she wants her piano back, right? Anyhow, this whole arrangement goes badly because George actually has affection for Ada but she's just using him to get her precious piano. And of course there is the small matter of Ada's marriage to Alisdair. That loveless marriage, with its complete lack of affection, greatly frustrates Alisdair. That frustration will manifest itself in rather terrible ways.<br/><br/>This all seems like it could make for an interesting story but for whatever reason the movie just doesn't work. It is not entertaining at all. The whole thing is so bleak, perfectly matching its backwater setting. Hunter does so well to convey so much emotion without even speaking. You always know exactly what Ada is thinking, great credit to Hunter for being able to convey that. The role of Ada's young daughter turns out to be a critical one and Anna Paquin does well with it. Flora is an intelligent, mischievous little schemer and Paquin's performance is very good, very mature. An Academy Award was probably a bit much though. Whereas Hunter and Paquin shine the men in the picture don't come off nearly as well. Admittedly they're not helped by a script which gives them some rather clunky, awkward dialogue. Harvey Keitel plays George and never really seems comfortable in the role. Meanwhile Sam Neill's portrayal of Alisdair falls hopelessly flat. This is a movie largely about passion but it comes across as almost entirely passionless. It's a movie that is badly out of tune."

","This movie had me from the beginning. The rush of the waves that carry Holly Hunter and daughter Anna Paquin to Holly's arranged marriage to farmer Sam Neill in New Zealand and the intense emotions projected by mute Holly Hunter on the beach about needing her piano (more than her clothes or anything) sets in motion the roller coaster ride of yearning and sensuality in this dark and beautiful masterpiece. People who are sensible and are not impressed by moody films will not be affected by this at all. And, some just won't get it.<br/><br/>She may be married to Sam Neill, but when he wouldn't take her piano with them to his home after knowing she wanted it, if nothing else, he subconsciously let her know he doesn't really care about her. She gradually comes to love Harvey Keitel (when he shows interest in music, her piano, and her), and she is more his than Sam's.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a mature story of love and acceptance (and I've barely scratched the surface in all it conveys) that isn't ashamed to use all the emotions in the book to evoke an experience you're not likely ever to get anywhere else. ""The Piano"" is a 'feelings' movie that demands you get involved. You will love it, or you will be left wondering what happened. Emerge yourself into the world of ""The Piano."""

","The first known woman director in film history, Mme. Alice Guy, died claiming she was also the first person to ever shot a fiction film, a credit usually given to Georges Méliès. Since Guy's first movie, ""La fée aux choux"", in 1896, to Jane Campion's ""The Piano"", a complex story of women in films is still in progress, from Guy's pioneer efforts to today's on-going fight against sexist role assignment to female workers in film industries, a fight against stereotyped participation as script girls, costume designers, or make-up artists. Many may become accomplished writers, editors, producers or directors, but many others can remain in the dark, even after obtaining a degree of success, as Dorothy Arzner in the 1930s. With her 1993 masterpiece, a century after the invention of several devices to register moving images, New Zealander Jane Campion made a full circle of cinematic melodrama, bringing us back to its origin, heavily influenced by the 19th century novel, with a twist: Campion took the classic model of representation, and used its best resources to tell a story from the Romantic era, enhanced by a contemporary point of view. Two currents meet in this beautiful motion picture: first is eroticism, powerfully claiming for women's rights to decide about their bodies and sensual options; and second is culture and its decisive role in people's lives. Scottish Ada McGrath (a magnificent Holly Hunter, winner of multiple international awards for her first-rate performance) is a frail individual, surrounded by patriarchal violence and a wild environment, and although she struggles for her rights to the extreme, in the end she is seen --in the last, poetic submarine shot-- tied to her piano, suggesting our inner fixation to the cultures that mold us. ""The Piano"" shows the potential of an old formula in the hands of a clever and sensitive filmmaker, transcending the limits of melodrama. It opts for simple entertainment, avoiding emotional traps, and it also pays tribute to primeval cultures, when one compares the rigid ""occidental"" debarkation of Ada and her daughter Flora in New Zealand, to the beautiful Maori farewell ritual in the conclusion."

","This is indeed a nice movie, not Jane Campion's best, but a good movie. I think the movie is a nice love story, doesn't deserve the title of 'Best Movie I've Ever Seen', neither the title of 'Worst Movie Ever Made'. It's maybe the biggest incursion of Jane Campion in the mainstream of the movies scene. But a big thing doesn't always means a good thing. For instance, 'Portrait of a Lady' was, for many, best than 'The Piano' but it wasn't mentioned as much as this one (at least not in Portugal...). Holly Hunter makes a good job with her role, but the best thing of her acting is the fact that she is actually playing the piano, and she really has the feeling. Sam Neill also acts very well, maybe better than Holly, but that may just be of his character, that has more feelings (no matter what feelings they are). Anna Paquin has the role of her life, at least because she has an intensive dramatic character, and she can show that on screen (it's not easy, with 9 years old). Harvey Keitel, he's a fabulous actor, needless to say that he has many better roles than this one (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs...many more). And finally, Michael Nyman. This is probably one of the best composers of his time, and maybe of all times. The musical score of this movie is a work of ART. It really is 'The Mood That Passes Through You'. I can hear this album over and over, without getting bored of it. It leaves you in a state of mind that I can't describe, it's amazing. I really recommend everyone that likes piano music to buy this cd, and to everyone that has this cd, buy other things from Michael Nyman, it's fabulous. 5/10 for the musical score."

","The Piano a 1993 award-winning film was written and directed by Jane Campion and starred Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin. The film tells an intriguing story of a mute woman who, along with her eight-year-old daughter, are shipped by her father to New Zealand to marry a man whom she never met. The story begins with Ada, Flora and Ada's piano landing on a beach having been rowed there to meet her soon-to-be husband. He (Alistair Stewart played by Sam Neill) greets them rather blandly and comments about Ada's small size as if she couldn't hear him. Along with local natives he decided the piano was too difficult to transport so they left it on the beach. The piano was beloved by Ada because she expressed herself through it. Later Alistair decided to trade it for some land owned by George Baines (Keitel). George seemed to understand how important the piano was to Ada so he strikes a deal with her that she can earn it back by giving him piano lessons. He had no intention of learning to play the piano but more interested in Ada herself. Ada made numerous trips to George's meager hut to play the piano, but a romantic relationship ensues. Alistair eventually finds out about the affair and in retaliation chopped off one of Ada's index fingers. At last Alistair dissolves the marriage. The ending contains a bit of a surprise.<br/><br/>The extraordinary will of a disabled woman to overcome hardship describes the theme of this film. We see it first as she arrives on the beach after an extremely rough voyage to meet her husband and having been fondled by a bunch of nasty sailors. We also witness her incredible will to get back her piano, her will to maintain her stoicism when her finger was amputated, and her will to live when she accidentally was pulled into the ocean when she finally sacrificed her piano to the sea. We see it again later after George crafted a silver prosthesis for her finger as she taught piano lessons. This film in many ways parallels The Miracle Worker, the story of Helen Keller and her stubbornness and extraordinary will to thrive.<br/><br/>The subjective angles of the close-up facial shots in The Piano play a huge role in capturing the theme. Ada so many times expresses herself through her lack of verbal communication simply with her eyes. One can tell her inner-thoughts just by reading the close-ups of her face and interpreting her stoic, Victorian expressions. They are used during the most dramatic moments – as her finger was being amputated and as she fell into the sea, just to name a few.<br/><br/>Was this my most favorite movie of all time? Probably not, however from living first-hand with a person with a disability, I marvel every day at the incredible will that disabled persons muster just to be ""normal"" and overcome adversity. This film was a display of just that."

","Jane Campion's 'The Piano' is a beautiful, poetic, sensual and intense story set in New Zealand. Campion has an eye for visuals and not only does New Zealand look haunting and captivating but attention to detail is given in almost every frame. It is a subtle film, not only because of the actors' performances but also the use of sound. With the exception of the piano tracks there is hardly any background music. All the piano tracks are mesmerizing (the soundtrack is a keeper). The love scenes are also wonderfully handled, with a sense of delicacy and art. The cinematography gives life to the quiet landscape. Holly Hunter delivers a riveting performance that is subtle and haunting (and she's hot too). She has already proved be a master in acting and 'The Piano' only supports that. Here she beautifully displays the slow transformation of facial expressions contrasting with the rapid gestures of her fingers. Harvey Keitel is just as terrific. Sam Neill and Anna Paquin are too of note. 'The Piano' is also like a tense mystery. It's haunting and mesmerizing effect has a strong cinematic impact.

Holly is a fine actress so it was only fitting that I watch the 1993 film ""The Piano"" that she starred in and won an Oscar for best actress. I must say the performance was good and the type of character she played made it award material. Still I found this film a little slow moving, maybe it was because of her characters disability.

Conflict will arise in Ada's life as her husband(Sam Neill)will cross ways with his intense neighbor(Harvey Keitel). Only Ada's husband will find out that she and her piano playing has turned on their neighbor not only emotionally but sexually also. Tense passions of erotic feel and love erupts. Only in the end the true passion will be seen as the piano was her one true love that will last. Not really a great film in my book it's a watch for Hunter fans, and it's point is proved that a person can have more of a lasting love with an object or instrument more than they can with a person."

","May contain spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie felt a lot like the Lars Von Trier movie, Breaking The Waves to me, because both feature strong women who are in horrible situations and both are hard to view and almost impossible to view a second time.<br/><br/>There is much symbolism in the story, much like a fable. Ada, whose will has made her not talk since the age of six, is mute. She has a daughter (I am not sure if she is from a previous marriage or not, I don't think the movie says) and is married to someone she has never met and shipped off to an island where her new European husband and a bunch of natives live. Also there are some Europeans that have embraced the culture, getting tattooed, etc.  The contrast of wild man actually nice guy deep down while cultured husband is completely feral, didn't go unnoticed to me as did the piano as the metaphor of Ada's voice and tie to European society (and/or supposedly civilized men.) At the end, Ada's finger is chopped off (this made me think, oh gods, I am watching another Breaking The Waves, please kill me...ugh...) but it is a metaphor yet again, a symbol that chops off (ick) her tie to society that she has known (people treating her like a dog) and the metal finger is her tie to the future, providing she has one and doesn't die at the end.<br/><br/>Ada is a strong woman stuck. Both her husband and the neighbor emotionally rape her and they try to do that physically too. They blackmail her to be sexual for them. It is only when the neighbor sees her play, that he is drawn into her soul and then he can't be brutal to her because he loves her and she loves him back. It is confusing that he changes in character so fast, but I think it is reasonable. He loved her but couldn't express himself much like Ada couldn't speak. This movie is about silence and miscommunications.<br/><br/>But if she did die, it proves her will and the piano were tied together (I need to stop the puns!)  If the piano was lost, so was she. She was already lost the moment she fell in love with a man who wasn't her husband and losing a finger didn't help that along.<br/><br/>The girl's name being Flora must have some connection to nature. Or chaos even, since she brings about her mom's supposed doom.<br/><br/>Many comments have talked about the nudity in this film and that surprises me. Being a R film, there is hardly any violence, other than a few attempts at taking Ada's virtue, that are tastefully done and there is a sensual sex scene that is very well shot, very erotic and nothing like what you would see on Skinamax late night. This movie is much more highbrow than that. If you can't take nudity, then you probably shouldn't watch this...but there is nothing wrong with nudity in general, so you may have to ask yourself why you have a problem with it.<br/><br/>Overall, the finger scene bugged me, but it proved Ada's will to be her own person was stronger than any other characters pull on her, and that theory works if you believe she is alive at the end or not.  But how can one have a voiceover at the end if one is dead and if she was dead at the end, why didn't anyone dive to save her? The last scene she is alone with no one breaking the waves (heh) to save her.<br/><br/>
Watch this and Breaking The Waves together for a sickening look at the way men brutalize women...you may never sleep well again.<br/><br/>I would give this movie an 8...it would get a 9 or 10 if it wasn't so left up in the air at the end, I would like to know if she lived or died. Also, the symbolism was a bit much at times...to the point an idiot would get it...it was like the film was trying too hard. But see it for the color, soundtrack and story...it is a great way to pass two hours and think about the way women are viewed in society."

However, who really makes this film the best one I´ve ever seen is Holly Hunter´s performance. Her role as a mute pianist is amazing. Every time I watch the movie I just don´t believe my eyes. She really made Ada McGrath a live person, with desire, pain, silence. I was so stupefied during the scene she loses her finger. Holly made Ada´s pain beyond tears. ""The Piano"" is a single experience which nobody should leave behind."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","17 March 2017"," A tiny, mute, 19th century woman speaking huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion...
","I must have been misinformed about ""The Piano"". I've always thought it was going to be one of these insufferably long movies that take the words slow and dim-lit as synonyms of deep and profound, these films where you try to convince your mind that it's genius while you have a hard time sitting through five minutes without checking your phone, or maybe I thought it was a sort of pseudo-feminist movie meant to content the elitist tastes and earn a Golden Palm on that biased bass.<br/><br/>But what the hell I know? ""The Piano"" is a straightaway romance, full of heat and passion like you rarely see in movies, and where all the players, no pun intended, cut straight to your heart. A few movies make you feel for their protagonists like ""The Piano"" does and I guess it says a lot about the sensitivity of Jane Campion who wrote and directed a magnificent story of souls lost in the middle of nowhere, trying to live in a pretension of civilization among wilderness, only to discover their own wild desires, triumphing over the hypocritical pretension of 'marriage', and with a piano, of all the matchmakers. Who would have thought that a tiny and mute woman from the 19th century would indirectly speak so many huge, loud and modern statements about love and passion.<br/><br/>I was going to praise the modernity of the author who wrote the original novel, expecting a figure à la Jane Austen or Eyre, but then I read that it was an original screenplay. What Campion did was to assemble many familiar topics from these literature classics while infusing them into a personal idea of feminist heroism, and it works because Ada is one hell of a creation by Campion and Holly Hunter. This is a woman who had an illegitimate child, a mini-Ada named Flora (Anna Paquin); only in the edge of the world, a man accepted to marry her, an uptight British landowner (if you can call lands these swampy muddy traps) named Stewart (Sam Neill) who emigrated with his Aunt (Kelly Walker) and her dim-witted servants. He recreated a microcosm of England in the midst of New Zealand's bush, he needs to recreate the illusion of marriage.<br/><br/>But from the opening start where we see Ada and Flora being carried by the sailors on the beach to the way their frail bodies literally sink into the mud, we have the signal that this is a very awkward setting and things won't turn out as we expect with this kind of material. You have indeed that texture that belongs to period pieces or Ivory/Merchant productions but in a territory where man can hardly set the mark of progress or civilization. You can't just conquer the land easily, and it is fascinating how Ada embodies that notion. This is a woman who chose to be silent at the age of six until it confined to muteness. She revolted against the patriarchal system, her muteness is part of her character and she's got it more than any 'normal' woman Stewart would have married, but he takes her muteness the wrong way and commits the worst mistake by abandoning her only valuable item: the piano, on the beach, because the Maori natives can't carry it.<br/><br/>Stewart misunderstood Ada, he thought Flora was the translator of her feelings, but Flora is a free-spirited angel (almost literally) that doesn't need to be everywhere with her mother, but to understand Ada is to listen to her music and understand her love for the piano. Modern visions of love sometimes put 'understanding' far above love and respect, Stewart respected Ada but the one who understood her could win her heart, and the rival was George Baines, played by Harvey Keitel. George is an adventurer with a face marked by Maori tattoos, and when he hears Ada playing piano for the first time, he understands how he can reach her. He sells a land to Stewart in exchange of the piano and courses from Ada. Ada is reluctant until she sees the extent of the bargain, for each course, she'll get a black key symbolically, when the count is down, she takes her piano back.<br/><br/>This is the start of some of the most powerful erotic relationships of recent time, one where you can pinpoint the transfer of power between Baines and Ada. It comes to the moment where he raises the price just to be able to touch her neck, and later, when he gives three keys so she can lift her skirt, she's shocked but then suggest five, they settle at four. Both have the power, the piano is just a decoy, an excuse to let them play with their fantasies. It is the credit to a filmmaker who assumes her feminism to have portrayed a relationship where the man has the upper hand only because the woman gives her blessing. She doesn't see herself as a whore, she simply values Baines' fascinatingly awkward ways to reach her. And like Campion said, sometimes a man's extreme masculinity reveals a woman's extreme femininity. ""The Piano"" is about characters who repressed their feelings for too long until a piano would open their eyes and the rest.<br/><br/>""The Piano"" is served by a terrific bittersweet score from Michael Nyman, stellar performances from Hunter and Paquin, who won Oscars, as well as Campion for her thought-provoking script, while her directing was intelligent and sensitive, especially with this attention to such details like Flora acting like a child and not being unrealistically smart or the way the Maori were portrayed, on an equal foot with the Whites, and even showing how hard it was for women to get the simplest things done, like going to the bathroom.<br/><br/>""The Piano"" is melancholic, captivating, haunting but inspirational because it's about people who simply learn to become honest and 'eloquent' about their feelings."

It just felt very clunky and lacks a visual language to further its simplistic story line about betrayal and self-discovery. In addition, a very questionable romantic/jovial tone somewhat diminish its self-discovery story line and somewhat makes me not take the film very seriously. Nevertheless, the film boast great cinematography and fabulous acting from Hunter, Neill and Keitel. I just wished this film was given a different direction.

","Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) has been mute since she was 6 without a reason. She and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) are brought over to New Zealand to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). She communicates with Flora with sign language. Her piano is her prize possession and her voice. However Alisdair deems it too heavy to carry and leaves it on the beach. Then Alisdair sells the piano to his illiterate neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel). George proposes to sell it back to her with one visit for every piano key and she counters with just the black keys.<br/><br/>This is romance novel melodrama from director Jane Campion and it is epic. Everything works including the epic landscape. The pounding waves, the lush forest and the isolation becomes part of the story. It is filmed beautifully. The performances are great. Anna Paquin is precocious. Holly Hunter and Harvey Keitel are not the natural romantic pair but there is something touching about that."

","Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin). Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with.<br/><br/>Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband.<br/><br/>The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making.<br/><br/>As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","This is a decent films. It combines masterful scripting, cinematography, performances, and musical score into a disturbing, erotic, and ultimately uplifting piece. The movie's heroine, wonderfully portrayed by Holly Hunter, is mute (symbolic of the fact that she has no say in her own life), with her daughter (the astonishing Anna Paquin) and her piano as her personal obsessions. Her conscripted husband, coldly played by Sam Neill, is trying to win her heart and her desire in all the wrong ways, while his crude tribal neighbor, sensually played by Harvey Keitel, understands her needs and ultimately captures her ... physically, intellectually, and romantically. The film's message and its delivery are extraordinarily powerful, the cinematic technique is rich ... the sequence shot with Hunt, Pacquin, Keitel and the piano on the beach is one of the best pieces of work I've ever seen.

","I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Piano. I believe that there is a movie somewhere out there that suits every person's personality. I found it with the Piano and I believe many others will too.<br/><br/>Quiet and hypnotic but at the same time bubbling over with emotion, eroticism and atmosphere, it is as un-Hollywood as a film can get - the plot is insignificant, it only sets up the atmosphere. There is not a hint of Jane Austen in this. It's all Wuthering Heights mixed with Jane Eyre mixed with Lady Chatterfly's Lover on the background of Dances with Wolves.<br/><br/>The eroticism in the film is the most frank, mature and realistic I've seen. At the beginning of ""The bargain"", I expected to be disgusted. Instead, I was pulled into elaborate, prolonged foreplay, every moment of which and the outcome is erotic. Makes you think of just how immature Hollywood's approach to sexuality is in comparison.<br/><br/>The film is almost perfect. My only criticisms are the violent incident at the end which is utterly out of character both for the film's tone and the character which commits the action. The second is that George's disinterest in Maori women who throw themselves at him just seems a little convenient.<br/><br/>While I'm not completely convinced Anna Paquin deserved the Oscar, she was remarkable in this - instead of being cute, she was plucky and brought energy to every scene."

","A lot of audiences didn't quite know what to make of ""The Piano"" upon its initial release, which I think is a testament to its originality. I really hadn't seen anything quite like this movie and was riveted on my first go around with it.<br/><br/>Jane Campion wrote and directed this story about a mute woman arranged to marry a landowner (Sam Neill) in 19th Century New Zealand. She has two loves: her young daughter (played by Anna Paquin) and her piano. She's drawn to a frightening but magnetic worker on the plantation (Harvey Keitel) and begins a torrid affair with him. Things come to a boil when she's found out by her husband.<br/><br/>The film is intensely erotic without being gratuitous. The characters are fascinating, and the acting is uniformly stellar. Holly Hunter gives a brave and fierce performance. Not brave because she allows herself to be filmed nude frequently or because she recreates quite graphic sex acts; but rather brave because she allows her character to be complicated and difficult and perhaps to some even unlikable. She never asks for our sympathy, but she does ask for our understanding. Neill and Keitel offer able support, and child actor Paquin amazes and delivers a quite un-childlike performance.<br/><br/>Top the whole thing off with vivid cinematography and a lush score from Michael Nyman and you have one of the best films to emerge from 1993.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

What (I think) many others have already mentioned is a great performances by Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter, but what really impressed me was Sam Neill's performance.

","Technically this was not my first viewing of Jane Campion's ""The Piano"". I have been haunted by images of this film since I was 7 years old (yes, you may ask, what was a kid that young doing watching this film? Answer: I wanted to watch absolutely everything my 17 year old sister watched). Of course, I didn't understand the complexities of the character's relationships, and I couldn't understand why Ada would be attracted to a tattooed, craggy man (Harvey Keitel). At that age it's all about bland Prince Charming! But the beautiful cinematography, and the muddy ""punishment scene"" stayed with me. As an adult, I view it as peculiar, but very good, film. It is quite striking how little exposition there is in this film. We never find out exactly why Ada turned mute at the age of 6. Campion never forces the issue, so we accept it as a state of being, something beyond the character's control, just as Ada and George's attraction is. I see it as a mood piece that probes female self-expression in the 19th century, but it's a film that really can't be summed up or pigeonhold. It is quite unique. Holly Hunter won the Academy Award for her Ada, her piercing gaze and ability to express a range of emotion without dialogue is very memorable. Keitel and Sam Neill are also very good, but the performance of a then 10-year old Anna Paquin stands out most. She was terrific."

However, I believe the music contributes most to the film - the symphony used throughout seems to reflect the pain, passion, and urgency all the characters experience.<br/><br/>A mention must be given to the sequence in which George reluctantly takes Ada and Flora to the piano. The fact that Ada smiles for the first time in the film conveys her love for her piano and music. Along with the symphony, the image of Flora dancing in the waves and George's face as he gazes at Ada, this scene is hauntingly beautiful.

It is especially gratifying to watch young Anna Paquin, only 10-11 years old at the time exhibiting some of her mystery and vulnerability that is evidenced in later roles. The rest of the cast is also excellent, working as characters who are limited by the culture of the times, but who also show a great range of feeling and emotion.

","The scene is an Australian film production company's office. The time  early 1990s:<br/><br/>Film Company Executive: So, Ms Campion, tell me about this idea you have for a movie.<br/><br/>Jane Campion: It's a love triangle really, set in the 1850s. The woman is in her 30s, a mute with an illegitimate daughter. Neither she nor anyone else knows why she can't speak. She expresses herself through playing the piano. She travels from Scotland to New Zealand to take part in an arranged marriage with a settler. He's a bit icy and combs his hair before putting on his hat in order to be photographed. The third corner of the triangle is another settler who is on his own and is picking up on Maori ways, painting his face and the like. He likes to dust the piano in the nude. It's all about the development of their relationships.<br/><br/>FCE: OK, so we have a woman who can't speak, but plays the piano, her husband who's maybe a couple of cards short of a full deck, and a half Maori nude piano polisher? <br/><br/>JC: Well, yes. Oh, and it's set in a swampy rainy forest environment.<br/><br/>FCE: Thanks Ms Campion. Don't call us, we'll call you.<br/><br/>
Fortunately, of course, the company did call and this riveting piece of cinema was made. How did Campion achieve the well-deserved acclaim, given the rather odd material? Simply through obeying the rules about how to make good film. All the elements, photography, music, editing, acting and, above all, direction come together to make this one of the best films of the 1990s. <br/><br/>It's claustrophobic atmosphere (apart from the opening and closing sequences, there's hardly a glimpse of the sun and sky, or the world beyond), the persistent rain and the rough living conditions create a haunting but compelling 100 minutes or so of viewing. Not an easy film by any means and, like any intelligent cinema, we must think for ourselves rather than have everything sign-posted in big letters. <br/><br/>
If there's a fault it's with the hoary old problem of accents. There seems to be a jumble of English (Geordie), Irish and Scottish, but let's assume they were speaking early New Zealandish! <br/><br/>It comes as no surprise that this won a string of awards and is deserving of its place in the `Time Out' list of Top 100 films of all time (as voted by directors, critics and others in the business, rather than the general public)."

But there are grand passions beneath its starkly beautiful surface, of a kind the cinema had scarcely witnessed.

I remember seeing it with my parents when I was a kid, but I found it to be so boring that I asked if I could go into another auditorium and watch a different movie. I know now why they said yes.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter inhabits the silent role of Ada, a mute woman who enters into an arranged, loveless marriage in 1850s New Zealand, incidentally the place where Anna Paquin, who gave the most stunning performance in this movie, grew up. Campion's New Zealand feels like a small, isolated island surrounded by a cold, dreary sea, and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh relishes the opportunities he has for cold, warm, and emotional lighting, literally painting the movie in cold or brilliant colors for us, and the results are fantastic. <br/><br/>San Neill and Harvey Keitel play opposing roles, Neill as Alisdair Stewart, Ada's arranged husband who hopes that they will grow to love each other, and Keitel as George Baines, a man with Maori symbols tattooed on his face and who has a relationship with Ada that achieves astonishing change throughout the film. But it is Anna Paquin who steals the show entirely. Her performance is so brilliant and so unexpected that many times I forgot about the rest of the film and just tried to figure out how Jane Campion got that performance out of her. It is one of the best child performances in film history.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I had some bizarre Sam Neill coincidences today. First I watched a terrible time travel film this afternoon called A Sound of Thunder, and one of the threads on the IMDb message boards for that movie asked what people's favorite time travel movies were, and many people mentioned The Final Conflict, which stars Sam Neill. Then while I was watching The Piano, out of nowhere I started humming to myself this old Rob Zombie song called Demon Speeding, where the chorus goes like this, ""In the mouth of madness, down in the darkness, no more tomorrow, down in the hollow..."" And I thought, ""Hey, In the Mouth of Madness, I haven't even thought about that movie since high school!"" And then I looked it up on the IMDb and sure enough, Sam Neill stars in it. <br/><br/>Sorry, I just thought I'd mention that. But more importantly, The Piano is a stunning accomplishment, another complex and engaging film from Jane Campion, who I don't think has made anything much less in her career. Bravo!"

Ana Paquin as her daughter is wonderful and expressive addition to the cast. The circumstances of Ada's ""marriage"" and affair are both pitiful and enthralling -- she captivates you with her blank, yet at the same time incredibly deep stare, and the viewer is left wondering what she might be thinking ... not in the frustrating, ""I don't understand where this film is going,"" but in the ""how would I act in this situation"" sort of way. To that question, there seems to be relatively no answers, except the ones provided on screen. The honesty and sadness, and even the desperate kind of hope or joy expressed in the resolution of the film left me both sick to my stomach, and glad to have seen it. <br/><br/>This movie should not be approached by the faint of heart -- it's both so strange and so real, and the graphic / traumatic scenes verge on the deeply unsettling.

","This is one of the most original and unusual love stories ever put on film. Holly Hunter is Ada McGrath, a woman of English origin that travels with her daughter to New Zealand in an arranged marriage to a man also of English extraction. Ada is a mute and has a love for playing the piano, one is a component of the personal belongings she brings.
Sam Neill plays Alisdair Stewart, the husband of the marriage and a man with no time for music, all he wants is a wife obedient to his wishes. Alisdair simply leaves the piano on the beach, an act that devastates Ada. Harvey Keitel plays George Baines, a native Maori that warms to Ada and her love for music. He has the piano transported to his residence, giving him the opportunity to be alone with Ada.
At first, Ada resists George's advances, but her love of the piano overwhelms all of her qualms and she becomes sexually intimate with George. This sets up a love triangle where Alisdair acts out the most brutal of what a husband could legally do to his wife. All of the players give superb performances, especially Hunter and Anna Paquin that plays daughter Flora McGrath. Ada's intense love for playing the piano comes through very clear through facial expressions and body language.
The viewer quickly finds themselves empathizing with Ada and antagonistic to Alisdair. There is the hope that somehow Ada and George will become a couple and the movie will end with Ada blissfully playing the piano. Not quite the ending. George's fellow Maori provide a solid supporting role by providing people of Maori culture rather than more transported people of English extraction. This is a great movie, worthy of every award it received."

Campion's remarkable script and sensitive direction is matched by outstanding performances from the four lead actors. Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel are great and eleven year old Ana Paquin gives as strong a performance as I have seen a child her age give. The mesmerizing performance by Holly Hunter, as the strong-willed and mute Ada, is arguably the best of her career. In my opinion it surpasses the terrific job she did in Broadcast News. Hunter's performance is made even more impressive by the fact she does not speak a single word throughout the film. Then again, who needs words when a simple glance, a touch or music will do the job. The Piano is like listening to a great orchestra. It moves you and then it lingers in you and haunts you."

","Jane Campion's harrowing romance tale quickly became one of the hottest romance films of the 90s thanks to its four leads at the top of their game. I do find this film overrated, but not enough to say I do not like it at all. I cannot discredit so many great things this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>When people think of gorgeous films, you think of brightness and a lot of colours. 'The Piano' has a very dark look, but is still stunning to see. Only a supremely talented director like Campion could pull off beauty with such a dark palate. David Lean would even have troubles with this. The look is perhaps the best part of the film, my favourite anyway.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter leads the cast as strong-willed Ada McGrath. Hunter plays Ada with fierce determination and a dominating presence. She is mute and has not spoken a word in a few years with it being unclear why. She stopped talking the day her husband got struck and killed by lightning, so it is possible she has a damaged voice box. Her daughter, Flora (Paquin) is also her interpreter through sign language. Other than her daughter, Ada's most cherished thing in the world is her piano. Only Ada knows how much it means to her.<br/><br/>Ada has been sold into a marriage to New Zealand frontiersman Stewart plays by Sam Neill. Since Ada is mute and their neighbours butt their noses into their affair, much of Ada and Stewart's relationship gets lost in translation. He doesn't get how much the piano means to her and sells it to their Maori (he is white but adopted their customs) neighbour, Baines (Keitel) and agrees to piano lessons. Stewart doesn't think a great deal of it since they can get money and Ada can still play, but Ada hates what Stewart has done. Since Baines understands Ada, they have an affair. Their chemistry is steamy.<br/><br/>Her is my problem with the film: Ada is very selfish and not willing to give her marriage a try. Sure she does not know Sam Neill, but he is actually making an effort. He tries to make the marriage work. He is perfectly okay with Baines giving the piano back. Ada rebelling and cheating on him with Keitel made me resent her. I do not blame Neill for flipping out. I get that Ada is a strong-willed and independent woman, but to me people need to do their share of working out problems and meet in the middle. But it is just Neill that tries to be a good husband while Hunter cheats. I never liked this portion. And since so much of the story is revolved around this love triangle, it diminishes the overall quality.<br/><br/>Luckily, the performances are all stunning. Keitel and Neill have done better, but Hunter and Paquin are sheer dynamite. Very worthy of their awards.<br/><br/>See this beauty for yourself<br/><br/>3/4"

On the positive side, the cast is strong and acting is good. The annoyingly indirect narrative is one of an artsy crowd pleaser with full of symbolism, which pretentiously attempts to cover plot holes of the story turning around 3 unlikable characters and a kid who merely acts as a messenger. In all this travesty, Maori folks are used as a room decoration. Harvey Keitel strikes again baring his butts and genitals for no apparent purpose. This whole mess is certainly a good consumption material for the artsy fartsy crowd who'd go rapturous to tell how much handy-dandy this flick is and decipher its subliminal messages. In reality, it is downright a borefest, although a certain quality cannot be denied owing to the nice scenery."

","The piano (1993) written and directed by Jane Campion, is a drama film about Ada, a mute piano player and her daughter Flora, who are sent, along with her prized piano, to wet, marshy New Zealand. Set in the 1850's, the story circles around the musician's love for playing the piano and her struggle and determination to regain her piano after it is sold. <br/><br/>Bordwell and Thomson refer to cinematography as the 'manipulations of the film strip'(2013:239). Film used a range of different modes including sound and visual therefore it's effective in portraying feelings and attitudes and creating particular moods. <br/><br/>The type of light 'will clearly effect the saturation and value of its hues and the illusions that it gives' (Rose 2016:79). Therefore, light is a major aspect to producing a desired atmosphere of an image. The use of light filters is made great use of throughout the film, to evoke emotion and give insight into the characters feelings. The blue filter is used predominantly to project the notions of melancholy, solitude and misery, for example in the wedding photo. There is a lack of warmth and delight that usually is present in a wedding photo. The blue cold blue hues reflect the isolation and loathing she has for the situation. However, a rose filter is made use of to reflect feelings of happiness and peace, in contrast to the blue filter. The rose filter is made particular use of when Ada is playing her piano on the beach. Campion allows the audience to see and feel, through this warmer filter, that music is Ada's secret to happiness. <br/><br/>Sound, is also a major component within film. Reay (2004) suggests that music within a scene has a considerable effect on its interpretation and significance. Music, in particular piano, is a predominant factor within the movie. The music represents Ada's voice, emotions and attitudes; it is her internal monologue. The repetition of the same song, 'The heart asks pleasure first' through the course of the film helps to show the continuity and determination of her character. However, the song is played in a variety of ways throughout different parts of the film. The different volumes, paces and intensities produce certain atmospheres. In the finger cutting scene, the music is increased in volume and doubles in speed, which portrays to the audience that Ada is feeling threatened and frightened. Contrastingly, in the scene where Ada visits the piano on the beach, the song is played softly and gently. This highlights her inner contentment, as the piano is the only way she can express her feelings. <br/><br/>The use of different camera shots is also highly significant within film. Bordwell and Thomson (2013) state that a close up shot puts emphasis on a character's facial expressions, showing their emotional state. The extreme close up of Ada's eye just before she is nearly raped, shows boldness and stamina. This close up is extremely important, as because she is quiet, the viewer must be able to read her emotions from her facial expressions. <br/><br/>Personally, I see the film as exceptionally incredible, as it truly moves you, making you almost feel the inner turmoil and heartbreak of the characters."
"veronika_smile","10","0","2","13 March 2016"," Great script and actors portraying the emotion
","This may be one of my favourite love tragedies. The script is just wonderful - a classic story, a woman is married to a stranger into a foreign land and the only thing she has is not her voice, it's her music. The combination of art and romance and tragedy makes me wonder, doesn't this portray the usual life of women in the past? Being sold off to men who couldn't care less about them, but just care that their wife is their property, not to be touched or seen, not a real human with real feelings. I think that this is a story of finding yourself, of finding what really life has planned for you, it teaches that is is okay to change ones mind - only if it is not too late to do so. This story is about great misery, but also great love - the kind that prevails everything, makes that same misery disappear and makes you see just how happy you can be even when something seems to be missing from you (literally). This film keeps you on your toes, makes you wonder and fantasize about what is going to happen next, and when it happens you think - I couldn't have been more wrong."

","The Piano is considered a most romantic movie. And in a way it is, but not really in the classic use of the word ""romantic.""<br/><br/>The characters are far from two dimensional, with ups and downs, highs and lows; both good and bad. No one is just one thing and it is a very fresh, raw take on humanity. The script colors their characters beautifully, and the story has many different aspects. But the one that stands out most, as it should, is Holly Hunter's journey from saddened, numbed woman to vibrant lover of life.<br/><br/>The men that desire her are scoundrels and undeserving of her, and yet both are good men in their own ways. Patient, kind, understanding. It's interesting to see how and why both of these men want this woman who has abandoned all hope of ever loving anyone other than her daughter ever again. Hunter's character is an enigma. She can love fiercely on one end of the spectrum but she cannot hate. She also doesn't realize that she has a say in her life until she falls for one of the men who desire her. <br/><br/>This movie is odd to say the least. Each time you view it you will think differently of all of the characters. You will never be quite sure who the villain is or who the hero is. But you can be sure that it is a gripping original take on love and starting over. 7.8/10"

","I watched this movie 22 years after it's release in 1993, and can really see why so many people raved about this movie. Holly Hunter, who won a best actress Oscar for her performance in this film, shows her incredible acting skills with only her facial expressions and movement (except for the two voice overs at the beginning and end of the film, which were great too, of course). <br/><br/>Her character has been mute since she was six years old, and this just gives the whole love story between the forcefully wedded woman and the poor Harvey Keitel character, a nice cherry on top. This film has so many powerful scenes and every scene adds to the story and gives us something new to learn about a certain character. Holly Hunter's Character, Ada McGrath has a daughter too, played by Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a 10 year old, which was probably the best child performance I've ever seen (with Jacob Tremblay for Room) and the scene *SPOILER ALERT* where Sam Nell's character cuts off Ada's Finger to stop her from playing the piano, after she finds out she's been sleeping with Harvey Keitel's character is truly one of my favorite scenes of all time. The pain Ada must be experiencing is extreme, but still no spoken reaction from her yet you can see how broken and physically/mentally hurt she is and the way Hunter portrayed that scene was when I realised that Holly Hunter is one of the best actresses of our time, truly magnificent. <br/><br/>The ending is beautiful, yet disturbing, yet very powerful. I watched it over and over again!<br/><br/>In the end, The Piano is a must-see movie for anyone who enjoys the art of motion pictures."
"joshuafagan-64214","10","0","3","30 August 2015"," Spectacle of Art; One of the Best Movies of the Decade
","One summer, I watched two movies ostensibly involving pianos. The first was 'The Pianist,' a fine if not extraordinary Holocaust picture that I feel gets a bit more love than it deserves, though it does get far better in the second half. The second movie was this one. It concerns a mute girl whose only voice is her piano, as well as her daughter, played to Oscar gold by a young Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>Of these movies, The Pianist gave me about what I expected. If I hadn't seen Schindler's List first, I think I would have liked this movie better. But it is a fine picture that I will say is better than the movie that did win Best Picture, Chicago (though LOTR:TT is better than them both). This movie, on the other hand, gave me what I didn't expect. I don't know what I expected, but an artful, stirringly-shot film with characters that you get invested in that is also quite erotic is not it.<br/><br/>Especially the erotic part. It is done well and I liked it alright but it did surprise me. Part of that is because I live in America, a country with no problem showing mass amounts of violence but that hates showing natural sexuality. I could describe this in detail but I see no reason to do so when so many people have done so already.<br/><br/>What I will do is take a bit of time to completely destroy the argument that sex and violence in movies can be gratuitous. Bear with me. As a writer, I know that gratuitous means unneeded or unnecessary. But think about that for a second. By that definition, do you know what else is gratuitous? Vacations. Fancy food. And fiction itself. Sex and violence are no more gratuitous than good characters and writing. If you don't like ample portions of sex and violence in fiction, fine. But don't call it gratuitous. Because it's not. Instead, we should judge whether or not it adds something to the tone and desires of the film. More likely than not, it does.<br/><br/>Certainly, it does in this movie. I'll try not to spend too long talking about this because there is a lot else that I want to get to. But sex is not glamorized here. There is simply carnal passion between the characters. But it is not simple at all. It addresses it complexly, which it is. All and all, it rings true.<br/><br/>And it is as these points above all else that it is clear that this film was directed by a female, one of too few major films that is. I'm not saying that she does a better or worse job at these scenes because of her sex, but it is definitely different. And educational for me. As a male, I do not automatically see things from a woman's perspective. This opened my eyes somewhat, as many good movies tend to do.<br/><br/>If you watch these scenes of passion, you see that warm colors dominate. Saturated reds and oranges take center stage, as opposed to the outside scenes, which are shot with cold colors. Those being saturated blues and greens. I am always a fan of this sort of chromatic differentiation when it is done well, a major reason why I love Soderbergh's Traffic. Also notice that whether the colors run hot or cold, they always run distant, a choice that I do believe helps with the cold, intermediary, almost purgatorial feel that the film is going for. It the second best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>The best being Anna Paquin's performance. Though only a ten year old girl at the time, Paquin pulls off the best performance of her career and the best performance of the film in general. As well as the most important. Her innocence and naivete adds a certain light to a movie that can at times get dark.<br/><br/>There were times when I was about to fade off into the dark blues of the cinematography, but Anna brought be right back. And that's not to say she's only an ingenue. She comes off as a legitimately driven, hopeful, real young girl. To the film's credit, they don't even make her Superman-perfect like they do for so many kid characters. She is the main reason her mute mother, played well by Helen Hunt in an Oscar-winning performance, suffers a catastrophic physical setback that I won't go into for sake of spoilers but that is quite traumatic. This is one of the best performances by a child actor ever. That actor is deserved.<br/><br/>Not that the other performances are bad. Other than Helen Hunt, Harvey Keitel is also spectacular. Sam Neill, otherwise known as 'that guy from Jurassic Park', is okay but is the worst performance in the film. That guy just doesn't have any charisma.<br/><br/>And I will not forget to mention the soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard. It's like an Avengers soundtrack, made up of some of the best pieces in history, particularly the theme, which I listen to every time I want to get immersed into life.<br/><br/>Just like the piano brings out the heart and soul of our mute main, this movie brings out our heart and soul. If I could, I would give myself up to this film. Let it play some music on my heart."

","Nothing to this film diverges from the expedient path of what is crafted to encounter a wide audience's expectation. When the man the woman will fall in love for first appears, who doesn't know that is the man the woman will fall in love for? And so forth, and so on. A series of well played clichÃ©s, each eliciting some cheering, some even stock tears.<br/><br/>And yet. And yet among the assorted humanity of this film, betwixt the sea, the mountain, trees, fire, thunder and storm, timid, as timid as a fallen fragment of inexplicable heaven by accident fell onto the Earth, lies a lost angel. The camera finds the strength to let us see the bottomless offense it takes when coming in touch with humankind: the contrast between inferno and heavens is ice that melts anything, demands for an undying tear, and stands as a genuine cinematic moment."

","I'm going to do something that I don't usually do and give a ""thumbs up"" to 1993's ""The Piano"" even though I don't particularly like major aspects of the story. Why? Because everything else about the film is exceptional on every level -- the beautiful dense forest cinematography of New Zealand's North Island, the realism of the Maori and the 1850's colony, the beautiful piano score, the great acting, etc.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: A mute Scottish woman, Ada (Holly Hunter), and her daughter (Anna Paquin) go to a New Zealand plantation to meet her husband, Stewart (Sam Neill), an arranged marriage. Ada is slowly seduced by a gruff worker on the plantation, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), as she gives him piano lessons.<br/><br/>The story is Exhibit A on why arranged marriages aren't a good idea. After all, how can you be ""one flesh"" with someone for the rest of your life if you don't even like him/her or find him/her attractive? This is an adult historical drama with inoffensive, but overt nudity and adult themes, like control, sexual repression, sexual growth and the search for true love. Even though this is a girlie romance movie and I find elements of the drama dreadfully boring -- like Stewart's final confrontation with Baines (where you can barely make out the dialogue) -- the film makes up for it in every other department. It's in the realm of overall atmosphere -- the realistic, awesome, beautiful and harsh ambiance of 1850's New Zealand -- that the movie shines.<br/><br/>The film was shot on location in New Zealand and runs 121 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

Baines even goes so far as to ask Ada to give him piano lessons which the only thing he plans to play with is Ada not her piano. He just lays under the piano as Ada is playing it and tries to look up her dress which, in what he sees, he finds far more interesting then her piano or piano playing! It's by then that Stweart finally realized what was going on and went completely berserk that lead to the tragedy at the end of the movie. Not only to Ada but to himself as well in losing it and becoming even far more uncivilized then Baines who by then wanted nothing at all to do with Ada.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** Acrtress Holly Hunter playing the mute Ada McGrath also played the piano by herself without a double in the movie. As for her nude scenes, with a body that most men would gladly die for, with both Kitle & Neil she seemed to , I'm not quite sure, have done them by herself as well. The tragic ending had Ada on her way home to England have the piano thrown overboard into the Pacific Ocean with Ada, with her foot caught in the netting, hanging on to it for dear life. It was all for the best in that by a miracle she was able to untangle her foot and swim up to the surface and be rescued and go back, without Stewart, to England. Later as the movie was about to end Ada was also able to regain her voice that she lost there due to a thunder storm so many years ago that took her first husbands life."

Ada, her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her prized piano move to the forests of South Island in New Zealand. But when Alistair refuses to move the piano his remote home, Ada takes an instant dislike to the shy man. Alistair's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) offers a solution, he buys the piano and ask Ada to teach him to play. But Baines only wants Ada around for sexual arousal and the sexual tension starts to grow.<br/><br/>Campion is a certainly bring a rough edge to The Piano and it felt like the period. This remote outpost really felt like the edge of civilisation. You can easily feel the mud, the rain, the wind and the harsh environment and that it was a tough place to survive. This is not a romantic view of the New Zealand landscape like other director but show what would have been like for settlers in a land that has yet to be developed. This bleak and nature visual is enhanced by the art direction and Stuart Dryburgh slightly dark and dim cinematography.<br/><br/>Thematically there is a one big ideas is a clash of cultures. Obviously there the clash between British settlers and Maoris, but also between Ada moving from upper class luxury in Scotland to a small colonial outpost with her daughter and that Baines is a rough, tough and a uncultured man. There is a also a big theme of sexual repression, from Alistair to being a man who seems very shy, looking for love and Baines unable to express himself so starts off being a very creepy. There is also idea that love can not grow or be forced, but a spontaneous thing, something that happens from an act of passion.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent throughout. From Holly Hunter in a very difficult role as a mute character, so has to express herself through her body language and her face. Neill and Keitel were great male leads, Neill being the man of civilisation and more traditional fellow and Keitel as a more rustic man of the wilderness and looking for an outlet for his sexual desires. Accompanied with the direction Baines comes off as a creepy character, particularly during a scene when he makes Ada lift up her skirt as she plays the piano and gets pleasure from touching a hole in her clothes. Paquin showed that she was a very good child actress, giving a confidence performance as a young acting older then she is but still acts childish at times. And she also gave an excellent Scottish accent.<br/><br/>Michael Nyman supplies an excellent simple piano based that fitted the film.<br/><br/>At times The Piano is a little slow at times and about ten minutes could have cut.

","Jane Campion's film The Piano is about Ada, a strong willed woman who stops talking to prove a point for so long that she loses the ability to speak at all. Instead, she expresses herself through sign language and also by playing the piano. As the film opens she is arriving in New Zealand with her adolescent daughter for an arranged marriage with a man she's never met. The man isn't prepared to move the piano she has brought with her from Scotland so it gets left on the beach; the man cares so little for his wife's wishes concerning the instrument that it remains there until she talks to Baines, the only other white man in town, into taking her back to play it and he's so entranced with her playing that he develops a strong lust for her. This causes him to trade some land to her husband for the piano. She's allowed to play the piano regularly but only at Baines' house. Gradually she begins to form a relationship with him as she remains aloof around her husband and the other puritanical whites of the neighborhood. Naturally, conflict arises from there.<br/><br/>There's a lot of subtext going on in this film; I mean here's a woman in the 19th century that doesn't have a voice, apparently because she realized that what she was saying wasn't going to get here anywhere. She chooses instead to communicate to the world via an artistic medium that also becomes tied up with her sexuality to such a degree that she uses part of it to symbolize her heart. There's also some commentary about society in general at the time as the rigid morality of the whites seems close to destroying the mute protagonist throughout the film while the more liberal natives seem much more sensible and even prosperous. Baines, the one white person who truly has become integrated into native society, seems much more successful and certainly much more able to form a connection with another person, although even his avenue of approach to Ada is less considerate than it should be.<br/><br/>So this is a film with a love triangle plot tied into criticisms of the repressive, patriarchal society of the time. This isn't anything particularly wonderful in itself but Campion's style takes what could have been tepid and heavy handed material and breathes some life into it. The visuals here range from impressive to unforgettable and the music always complements the action. The Piano also pulls off a truly excellent ending thanks to the haunting final shot."

The woman can only speak through her daughter or by playing her piano.<br/><br/>CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER Communication. How we express ourselves to others, the true nature of love, and perils that we must go through to find true happiness.<br/><br/>PROS AND CONS I would consider this a ""women's"" film. It deals with a woman's search for love and understanding in a harsh land. The central focus is on Holly Hunter who portrays Ada McGarth. She gives a very good performance considering that she does not speak a word in the entire film. She also plays all the musical pieces on the piano. Good enough in fact to win her the Academy Award for best actress.<br/><br/>The film is written and directed by Jane Campion who is somewhat of an icon in Australian and New Zealand film making. She specializes in these types of films, which have stunning scenery and intimate character studies. During this viewing of the film I was surprised at what a rather simple and straight forward story it is. The film is more visual than anything else, which is not surprising, since the main character never speaks. But Campion pushes this even furhter, giving turn of the century New Zealand a beautiful, almost surreal quality.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin portrays Flora McGrath in the film and won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress as Ada's daughter. This is somewhat puzzling, since she isn't really all that prominent on screen and her acting scenes are nothing more than what the average little girl of 12 would do anywhere else. There are also large gaps in the development of Sam Neil's character, Alisdair Stewart, ( who portrays the mail order husband). He appears frustrated and impotent in the film, but his mindset and issues are never really flushed. out. He is spurned by Ada only because he appears to not see the value in her piano. But he does try and never gives Ada a reason to dislike him.<br/><br/>This film is graphic at times and there are scenes that come very close to bordering on the explicit. There is also violence but this is more for effect as opposed to simply showing gore and blood.<br/><br/>More than anything else, this film makes me admire the acting abilities of Holly Hunter and also makes me want to visit New Zealand. It also makes me realize that any woman that has to have a piano hauled everywhere she goes is not the sort of woman that would make a good long term relationship."

","Coming across an ocean, Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) sits silently with her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) beside her and a piano accompanying. They are on their way to New Zealand where Ada's new husband (Sam Neill), whom she's never met, is waiting to be with her. Upon arrival, the two instantly dislike the newest member of their family as he drags them up towards their home and leaves the piano on the dreary beach. The next day, Ada gets George Baines (Harvey Keitel) a tribesman who works for her husband, to bring them back down to the beach to the piano. Ada is mute, but finds poetic beauty in the sounds that she produces through her piano and I have to say that I was quite moved with their beauty as well and so was George. Or rather, he was moved by Ada's beauty.<br/><br/>So George brings the piano up to his home and keeps it there; he arranges for Ada to give him lessons to play and in turn she can play her piano at his home. Soon she finds out that his reasoning for having her come there is of a much more erotic nature. They come to an agreement that for every visit she makes to 'teach him to play', she will be one step closer to him giving her the piano. But while she visits and plays, he makes requests of her (such as lifting her skirt up or taking off her dress-coat so that he can see her arms). Quite quickly these requests come to her laying down next to him and eventually them laying nude together. Initially she is stubborn and put back by this man, but soon she begins to feel for him. Soon she falls in love with him. In this love comes my favorite aspect of the film. It's not your typical love story between two incredibly attractive people torn apart by their families or some twist of fate and they fight to get back to one another. These are two very flawed individuals who have nothing stopping them from being in love, except for her caution towards feeling so deeply for someone again. But once they finally accept their passion for one another, they have her new husband to deal with.<br/><br/>The Piano is a tragic film with scenes of extreme tension and one of the most wrenching moments I've ever had to witness on screen when husband Alisdair discovers their affair and picks up his axe. However it's also a beautiful picture with some of the most gorgeous cinematography I've ever seen and a score that sweeps me away. Two shots in particular had me stunned; one focused solely on the piano in it's crate sitting on the beach as the waves crash on the sand behind it, and another where Flora runs over a series of hills to deliver a message to Alisdair. As I said before, the love story in it is certainly unique and thus it's one of my favorites ever depicted on screen. In order for it to work, the performances had to be flawless and they most certainly are. Holly Hunter is painfully moving without saying a word, Sam Neill is flawed and naive throughout the entire picture until the final act where he is absolutely terrifying and Harvey Keitel makes the audience feel as Ada does; at first he is strange and despicable but we realize that under this creepy exterior is a gentle lover and Keitel perfectly embodies both aspects of this. My only complaint with the film is in the young Anna Paquin, who won an Oscar for this role. I personally found her to not only be unbearably annoying, but her scenes near the end felt so forced and ridiculous it almost came to the point of hilarity. If it wasn't for the incredible performances surrounding her and the power of the story, I believe I would have ended up laughing. However when there is such strength and flawlessness encompassing everything, one little thing isn't going to ruin the experience. An absolutely incredible film with such a beautiful ending."

","""The Piano"" has a lot going for it: a strong cast, a unique premise, great on-site scenery, but somehow the combination left me flat and unmoved.<br/><br/>The story follows a young English mute woman (Holly Hunter) who is sent to New Zealand to become a bride for a local settler (Sam Neill). Her passion is her piano which she brings across the ocean, but her new husband has no interest in it. Instead, one of his native workers (a curiously miscast Harvey Keitel, who doesn't look Maori for a moment) is drawn to her, and thus we have our triangle.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes showing the interplay of Maori and English cultures were fascinating. The views of New Zealand, both the large-scale and also the smaller-scale views of jungles and mud (there is LOTS of mud!) were very enjoyable. The idea of someone being forced to express herself solely through music, and then finding herself in this wilderness totally devoid of culture, that too was interesting.<br/><br/>But this story lives and dies on the basis of its characters, and somehow the main ones (the men especially) were baffling and, worst of all, unsympathetic. Neill's character treats his new wife with coldness and indifference at first, though he does seem to warm to her later on. Keitel's character is even less plausible. He is drawn to her sexually, and realizes he can use the piano as a bargaining tool to achieve his carnal desires. Halfway there, though, he relents. In the meantime, Hunter's character warms up to him, even though he was abusing her. Hunter does the best acting, even though she can't speak any words, still she conveys the frustration and anger and resentment at her predicament very well.<br/><br/>More could have been made of the piano as a metaphor for civilization out in the wilderness among the savages, but it wasn't. In fact there was the opposite: the native man feigns interest in the piano, only to ensnare the beautiful woman. One never feels that his interest in the piano was truly musical or artistic.<br/><br/>Again, it's hard to explain exactly why, but the combination of characters just did not click very well for me.<br/><br/>I found the score hopelessly anachronistic; at no point does the piano play any of the music one would have expected during that period (Liszt, Chopin, Brahms, etc.), but it's still decently pretty. And be warned, there is plenty of male nudity, including the full frontal variety, and a little female as well.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing, but I walked away thinking that a very interesting premise was somehow mishandled and left untapped."

","I just watched ""The Piano"" again (I first saw it one year ago). Back then, I saw it as a movie about a tragic love triangle with two men competing for the love of the same woman (which it is)and how the one who came to truly understand what the piano was to her won her love. (But I sure didn't agree with his tactics!) I also felt that Ada was symbolic of the lot of women at the time-not able to control her own life and basically just seen as a piece of property by her husband. It also seemed to paint men as dealing with women in exploitative ways. Baines invents a sexual game using Ada's compulsive need for the piano as a bargaining chip to get her into bed (hardly a romantic way to seduce a woman!), while her husband Stewart clearly has rape on his mind on at least two occasions, it was written all over him. I am presently in a Master's degree program in Special Education and my newly acquired knowledge of autism and related disorders has led me to recognize that Ada seems to have autism. The facts that she can hear, can read and write, yet is non-verbal, are a few clues. Other clues are that she engages in repetitive behavior. She composes music with very repetitive note patterns, and plays the same pieces over and over, just her own music and no one else's. When deprived of her piano, she carves the shapes of the piano keys into the table top, so she can still ""play"" the piano; she compulsively needs to do this. Still other clues are her inability to express her emotions and interact with people, and her aversion to being touched. Both the men in her life are frustrated with these two characteristics. She never tries to communicate with any of the people in the village, and barely interacts with her husband or Baines. The only person she really interacts with is her daughter, until Baines manages to finally break through her emotional wall. In many ways, she fits the profile of an autistic savant. Many autistic people have profound musical talent, and it is a means of communication and emotional expression for them. I haven' t heard anywhere that Jane Campion intended for Ada to be autistic, if it's a coincidence, it's a very interesting coincidence. I wonder if anyone knows for sure if it's true. It is a very subtle movie, and none of this is very obvious, and it is a movie that can be interpreted in many ways, so I'm not surprised that no one else has picked up on this yet."

Whenever I watch a movie I would rather NOT recognise the actors because this attitude leads to expectations. This was one of those movies, and their acting was simply brilliant. So was the cinematography. I still can see the moment when Hunter was left at the shores with the piano, looking very small and alone save for her oblivious daughter. The way Hunter sort of recoiled when Keitel touched her for the first time was as abrupt as the music itself... even I was jolted.<br/><br/>And who could forget the stark contrast between Paquin's innocent costume and the climactic event that transpired between her mother and his stepfather?

It simply is, just like life.<br/><br/>Someone here said that this movie is not to be watched with rationality in mind. I agree. This is not a rational movie at all. Why would Paquin, who all along had been supportive to the Hunter-Keitel relationship, change her mind while taking the key to Keitel? Why wouldn't Hunter say a word? Why didn't Neill shoot Keitel and Hunter while they were in bed, where they would have been the most vulnerable? Why did Hunter fall in love with someone who obviously uses her for sexual gratification? It's because human nature *is* not rational. See it for yourself in The Piano."

","Contrary to many other comments, I found the film simply stunning. Yes, Holly Hunter plays a mute, and yes, this, obviously results in her having no dialogue, but I feel that Michael Nyman, the man who composed the score for the film, effectively becomes her voice via 'The Piano'. The music is beautiful, as is the majority of the acting. The violent and love scenes are made that much more poignant by her inability to speak. As a pianist I am probably somewhat biased, but if you appreciate the piano as an instrument at all you will find a depth in the film like no other. The soundtrack contributes hugely, and I found that the film complements the music, rather than the typical vice versa, but the combination is none the less profoundly moving."
"heywood100","7","0","4","6 May 2003"," Haunting
","The actual plot of The Piano is a very straightforward love triangle, the only difference being that one of the three is mute. To recap it quickly: Harvey Kietel gets naked; Holly Hunter gets horny; Sam Niell gets mad; then Sam Niell gets less mad. What does make The Piano stand out somewhat are the brilliant visuals. The outside action takes place under a web of grey tree branches obscuring the downcast sky. The whole film makes a far more disturbing use of the New Zealand scenery than the over-hyped-but-pretty The Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>The Piano reminds me quite a lot of Japanese horror film Onibaba. The actual stories of the films are poles apart, but both have a feeling of detachment. Until the very end of the film you could be forgiven for thinking that The Piano is set in an alternate universe, so far away are the characters from any other humans. This love triangle is completely isolated, and from start to finish there is no possibility of any outside forces interrupting or for any of the characters to escape. It is this quality, along with the desolate landscape of the film, that give The Piano it's quality. Plus, the music's great."

"Bev-7","9","0","2","26 February 2003"," A haunting romance
","Erotic and emotionally powerful, ""The Piano"" tells of a haunting romance that swells on the waves of pride, Victorian prudishness, and passion. The four main characters embody the times and social attitudes. Mute and cold and bargained through an arranged marriage, Ada arrives on the island with her mischievous young daughter and her precious piano. Her new husband Stewart is a socially inhibited and emotionally repressed English settler who has a penchant for mistrusting others. He decides that the piano is to be left on the beach where they disembarked, in the rain and weather because of the trouble it would be to move it piano into the settlement. He fails to see how important the piano is to his bride; how it is her only means of expression. The fourth character, Baines, is another English settler, quiet and isolated, who comes to be the most complex of all.<br/><br/>
""The Piano"" is gray and dank like the emotions that burden the settlers as they attempt to maintain a semblance of western civilization in a rainy island settlement surrounded by Maori natives who adopt the apparel of their new neighbors, but not their repressed notions of self and society. Only Baines has embraced native ways, and it is he who brings those moments of emerging tenderness and truth. <br/><br/>The pace of this film matches the pace of the seduction, beginning with slow caution and rejection, moving carefully through the strangest courtship ever, to its resolution, fraught with loss and sacrifice.<br/><br/>
""The Piano"" won many awards, including three Oscars; it deserved every one of them."

","Jane Campion offers perhaps the most effective portrayal of female agency ever seen in the cinema. The protagonist Ada lives by her own standards and refuses to be subjugated under the the Victorian patriarchy that must control and dominate everything. This tension is evident through the entire film and eventually Ada's will defeats the desires of her husband who purchased her as a mail-order bride. Then after her victory, she inexplicably gives up her agency for stereotypical romantic love. Beautifully shot and edited with great performances especially by Anna Paquin, everything is here for a great movie apart from the deeply unsatisfying ending."

","Spoiler I ve had a look at the other comments, but I don t share the same views.<br/><br/>First, I m not sure Ada just decided to stop talking. Maybe that s the way she wanted the story about Flora's Dad to be, but it comes from a child. Also, if I had been able to speak, then if I decided to stop I would still be able to speak twenty years later. However, Ada learns to speak at the end of the movie -- maybe she s never been able to. But I was amazed at how somebody could communicate through any form of art ( I am also thinking about other movies).<br/><br/>Second, I don t think that there are any cliches (like Baines being the strong sexual brute..., and Ada s husband being rejected because he cares too much...). The relationship between Ada and George is not purely sexual... I mean physical. They probably see sex the way I see it: the accomplishment of love, when two bodies become one. If he only wanted to f*** then why not trying one of the natives? I just think he wasn t good at expressing his feelings, but surely he doesn t want to lose her. And in the end he takes care for her, as she seems to be happy living with him.<br/><br/>Finally, just my personal opinion on it.

First of all, I must say that this is a movie that is sure to move you if you keep an open mind and don't take it at face value. Remember it's an analogy and it's meant to represent a theme not ""real life"".  And like, Ada's voice in the film, this movie will only speak to you if you truly listen and want to hear its message. Several people I know took the film too literally and missed the whole point. They kept asking ""Why won't she dump that piano?"" and ""Why doesn't she talk?"" Ironically, the answers to these two questions are remarkably intertwined. (I'll leave you to find the answers when you watch it.) I also am haunted by the image of Ada's ""lullaby"", her vision of herself tied to the piano under the sea. What a striking picture! I loved the fact that the piano was both her voice and her burden. This film expressed a lot that I think needs to said about the issues that are still facing women in our society.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack is wonderful. What's great is that it is stunning by itself, outside of the film-a rare thing in scores today."

"bedazzle","8","0","4","31 May 2001"," passion, not love
","Interpretation, spoilers: <br/><br/>The box for this movie states, ""only one man (Harvey Keitel) understands that Ada's heart can only be won through her beloved piano."" I must disagree. After decades of hollywood love stories, we now have a love movie schema to use in watching and interpreting films of this sort. Expressed in words, it might be something like ""love conquers all"" or something of the such. Implied in this schema is that the love is of extraordinary meaning and almost heavenly. It's a nice sort of message, but it biases our movie-watching experience; i.e. 'the Piano.' <br/><br/>Though Ada's love for Harvey is of a merely carnal, animalistic sort, this should not interfere with the power of this movie. After the move, a dichotomy between the white man and the aborigines is formed. The white man represents propriety and decorum. The aborigines represent primitive human passion and unrefinement. Case in point: the scene in which the daughter is chastised for playing the aborigine tree-humping game. This point is further illustrated by Ada's confining wardrobe and aborigine/Harvey chats about his need for a woman. Thus, Harvey is associated with the primitive bodily passions of the aborigines. <br/><br/>It is this passionate essence of Harvey that attracts Ada to him. It would be ridiculous to claim that the piano in which Harvey blackmailed Ada and nearly prostituted her with made them fall in love (It did in a purely indirect phsyicalist way by bringing them together, it was the passion that made them actually fall in love.) The fact that the piano is not equated with love is the fact that Ada's feelings remain the same after the piano is brought to Same Neill's house. <br/><br/>Two types of expression are prominently displayed in this movie: through music and through passion/body. After Harvey teaches Ada to communicate with passion, her piano is no longer needed. Music is renounced and passion taken up. However, with the passion option, a living-in-the-present will comes along. This will follows the dictates of her every desire and she cannot control it. It causes her to flirt with death, but her next split second decision to free herself affirms life. Living passionately, the only constant in her non-meditative will is her will to live.<br/><br/>
Perhaps a more than carnal love develops later. This is alluded to with her transcending over bodily communication to actual language. But, the movie itself is not a love story of the typical sort, and I for one am all for showing the love-aspects of each type of love-relationship. I think the main message is that even passionate love is a worthwhile love, and if anything ""conquers all,"" it is the will to live."

","The Piano is my favorite all-time movie. It is visually stunning, and the score is remarkable. People (men mostly)don't like it because it evokes emotions. It's a very intellectual movie and the contrasts are amazing. Ada (Holly) has been married off to an unknown husband in a new world, by her father. Her husband doesn't understand her and lives in a house that destroys the New Zealand nature much like he destroys that which he does not understand. Baines (Harvey Keitel) understands and wants to know Ada for who she is and he sparks her passion after he is sparked by hers. His house fits into the natural surroundings without destroying it. Two viewings are required to absorb all of the subtleties. Holly and Harvey and Anna are at the top of their form! You must be able to think and empathize with someone in Ada's plight--a woman essentially without choices during an era when women were possessions/cattle--to understand and enjoy this movie.  Ada didn't ask to be married to Alisdair.  Would you then call it a marriage? If there is no free will?  If there is no free will, then is it wrong to leave the marriage? For our puritanical society, with its hangups surrounding absolutes, this movie seems sacrilege, as marriage is an institution that is holy unto itself.<br/><br/>This movie is so different from you typical Hollywood pabulum, that it shocking to many people.  I enjoyed it thoroughly through several viewings."

","""The Piano"" is one of those rare films that reasonably intelligent and feeling adults can discuss at length while disagreeing with each other on whether the film is good or not. My boyfriend, with his British lit upbringing and reading habits, thinks the story doesn't hang together and finds nothing compelling about any of the characters. I, with my poetry and American fiction background, have plenty to think about regarding the wealth of themes and imagery woven into the film.<br/><br/>The movie has to be approached thoughtfully. The clues to all of the ""problems"" reviewers complain of are in the film -- everything from why Baines would understand a message written on a piano key to why Stewart lost control when Ada didn't do what he expected. It's all in there, if the viewer can allow the film to emerge. (Reviewers complaining about the ""obvious"" symbolism make me think that they are victims of a rather rigorous and unfeeling literature teacher who has the emotional subtlety of a two-by-four. I want to urge those reviewers to forget the piano and what they think it ""stands for"" and instead start to notice the real images.)<br/><br/>The film does us the favor of showing us from the beginning exactly how complex it intends to be -- combining a voice-over about silence and the strength of will, a statement that this woman has been married by her father to a man in New Zealand, a view of her tender care of her daughter and finally of her expressing herself on the piano -- and doesn't let up till the credits roll. Nothing is simple: not the relationship between Ada and Flora, or between Ada and Stewart, and certainly not between Ada and Baines.<br/><br/>If you aren't prepared to give yourself over to a film, skip this one. It'll be a waste of your time because it won't fit into any preconceived notions of what constitutes a ""good"" movie.<br/><br/>Otherwise, flow with it -- it'll carry you if you let it."

","This haunting film, directed by Jane Campion, is a showcase for several things.<br/><br/>  First of all, the performances by the four leads are magnificent.  This is Holly Hunter's show.  Her performance remains one of the best of the decade. Her facial impressions, and voice-overs really give this film it's punch. Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin are also great.  Sam Neil surprises me the most.  His character is not really a villain (not until he chops her finger off).  <br/><br/>  The script it amazing, and the cinematography astounding.  The drained greys of the beach scenes are especially well done.<br/><br/>  The only fault is overlength, but that is a small fault for this movie."
"flickfan-2","Null","0","3","10 July 1999"," A very graphic and disturbing movie
","I have seen several comments about Paquin's performance in the movie but it is really quite unmemorable.  Several people I know don't even remember her and her bit role in this movie.  Holly Hunter is very good.  Sam Neil(or whoever it is that cut her thumbs off) is a very gruesome individual in this movie.  I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie before I saw it. I am really surprised that I watched it but my curiosity got the better of me I suppose.  IT is a very hard film to watch and the images can be very disturbing and way too graphic at times.  Not a film that I would suggest watching (unless you want to be disturbed and or alarmed)"
"shaunny7","Null","0","1","4 June 1999"," a truly beautiful film.
","The performances in ""the Piano"" are absolutely magnificent.  This is the first Holly Hunter film i've seen, and she truly impressed me a great deal.<br/><br/>Hunter is to marry by arrangement, a man she never met before (sam neil) and a man whom she would never learn to love.  She leaves her home, to New Zealand, along with her young daughter (anna paquin) and with her beloved piano, in which she is clung to, and the only thing she really loves. There in New Zealand, she meets Harvy Keitels character.  From there, Keitel understands that she cannot live without her piano, and they fall in love. This romance causes jealousy to Neil.  And so on.<br/><br/>Everyone in this film is superb, especially by Hunter and young Paquin. Anna is really adorable, and her acting and accent are flawless, at such a young age!  Holly's performance haunted me. As her role required her to be a mute, and she didn't not say a word (besides her narration), i came to the conclusion that she is one of the best actresses out there, better than most actresses who actually have dialouge in their films.  Harvey proves to me, that he is a virtuoso actor, and he is more capable of more serious roles, not that i didn't enjoy him in BAD LIEUTENANT.  And Sam doesn't surprise me, as his performance was splendid.<br/><br/>Everything else in the film was great, including the photography, the dark/bluish scenes, the direction, and especially the music.  Holly's piano playing is astonishing.  I strongly recommend this film!"

","Ada, is a very beautiful woman, but she can't talk... her language is the music (great piano in the soundtrack), and her deepest emotions, her whole soul just escapes from her fingers, through the piano chords. Another hands and touch language is brought to our eyes by Harvey Keitel, not on piano keys, but on human flesh! The scenario could be bypassed, music and fingers shows it all. And the landscapes! They are through the story, a perfect representation of Ada's feelings! Beautiful!"

","The Piano is a great movie, with an intense story, beautiful photography and extraordinary performances by Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill and Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>An excellent choice for a rainy afternoon."
"erica-14","10","0","3","30 April 1999"," a difficult and wonderful movie
","I've read the previous comments about ""the piano"" and it seems to me there are a lot of confused and even contradictory ideas about this excellent and difficult movie. Somebody seems to believe that it's an ultra-feminist opus, on the other hand, somebody else wrote that women are here portrayed as animals, without a real will; many people found it disturbing and morbid, others believe that it's just stupid and arty.<br/><br/>I'll try to explain here why these ideas are in my opinion erroneous. This movie is about people living in another ""world"", with more strict rules than in today western society (marriage arranged by parents were rather usual), a world where who didn't conform with those rules was an outcast.<br/><br/>Ada is clearly a strong person and in many ways she doesn't act as woman in her position was expected to do in this period (she has even got an illegitimate daughter), she's a rebel but she doesn't realize that she's also prisoner of her own rebellion (see her dependence from the piano).<br/><br/>I guess she consented to her marriage because she wanted to escape from her previous condition. Unfortunately, her rather wild nature isn't understood by her new husband, a good and moralistic man, who refuses to take her piano to his farm. It's true that her request is unrealistic and that the piano looks so out of place on this seashore ""on the other side of the world"", but the piano is Ada's life (and cage), her main way for communicate.<br/><br/>On the other side, Baines, a man that lives as a Maori, is fascinated by Ada, he wants to ""conquer"" her through the piano (no prostitution, no violence! his approach is direct but he cares for her from the beginning). As the ""liaison"" between  them becomes deeper and more and more passionate, all the community gets to know it. Ada's husband, understanding that she really loves the other man, has a violent and wild reaction (but not that strange for that time), but, eventually, he decides to make free his wife.<br/><br/>This strong love passion is the cause of the final Ada's ""rebirth"" , in one of the more upsetting scenes she ""gets free""  from the piano: now she's really on the way to be a independent human being.<br/><br/>I really hope that everyone try to watch this movie with a more ""open mind"" and try to remember that it's set 100 years ago,  when behaviors and ideas had different standards. It's possible you don't like it but it isn't a dumb movie in any way."
"Karen-34-2","10","0","2","14 February 1999"," An emotionally complex woman you will never forget...
","Jane Campion is a director who is not afraid to create challenging films about emotionally complex women (i.e. the haunting ""Sweetie"" and the biography of troubled poet Janet Frame).  In ""The Piano"", she continues this tradition with Ada, the mute Scottish mail-order bride, who is one of the most intriguing characters ever seen on film.  The viewer may not empathize with Ada's situation and may even dislike her as a person but undeniably, she is a character who speaks volumes with her gestures without ever uttering a single word.<br/><br/>Holly Hunter gives the performance of her career, portraying Ada with such strength that whenever she ""speaks"" through her piano, she has the ability to silence and/or mesmerize everyone around her, especially her lover Baines (Harvey Keitel).  As Ada's daughter, Anna Paquin is brilliant as the precocious girl who shows that she can match her mother's defiance and unorthodox attitudes in several pivotal scenes.<br/><br/>Other than the top-notch acting, the cinematography is lush and breath-taking and Ada's music is sensuous and haunting. I agree with other viewer's comments about the music seeming out of place during this time period (1840's).  However, Ada was unconventional in Victorian society.  She could not play the ""proper"" music of the time as this would have completely stifled her creativity and inner voice.  Her compositions were her life force and without them, she could not survive.<br/><br/>I think many Americans did not know what to make of this erotic film when it was released (after garnering high acclaim at the Cannes Film Festival), but it is a true work of art that should not be missed, especially by romantics."
"Mick-21","10","0","2","20 September 1998"," A Magnificent, Musical Film
","The Piano is a hauntingly beautiful film. The soundtrack is magnificent, the harsh New Zealand landscape is starkly beautiful, and the performances are as deep and subtle as any I have ever seen. Holly Hunter gives a stunning performance as Ada, a woman mute by choice who only truly speaks through her piano. Ada's experiences as she and her daughter (played wonderfully by Anna Paquin) are shipped halfway across the world to live in an arranged marriage on the coast of New Zealand make rivetting viewing. Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel are also excellent, Neill as Ada's cold husband and Keitel as the intimidating New Zealander. A film that lingers long in the memory, The Piano is not to be missed."
