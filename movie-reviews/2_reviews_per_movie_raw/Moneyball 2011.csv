","Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics, a team that rose to notoriety because of its low payroll and unorthodox player selection. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manage, grows tired with the ancient, inefficient ways of the game he has committed his entire life to. When a transaction goes awry he stumbles across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale, economics graduate who believes he has a system to rating players based on numbers.<br/><br/>Billy and Peter begin trading, signing, and grooming the team based on data, not scouting, something that other members of the team are not fond of, including Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the team's manager. Billy and Peter's system defies current baseball logic, but when the club starts to win games with players like Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop), and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), the eyes of the country turn to Oakland, where only seeing is believing.<br/><br/>What happened in Oakland back in '02 was incredible. It shouldn't have happened if you ask the right people, and other people will tell you it means nothing. Well, it did mean something it has changed the way people think about the game for good. You couldn't just go out and look at a kid to see if he would be a star or not. There were more stats to consider than home runs, strikeouts, and batting average. The game was expanding and becoming more and more a battle of logic.<br/><br/>The film's structure is centered mostly on Billy Beane, but the most exciting parts for me were about the system. Writer Aaron Sorkin, who a few months back accepted a slew of awards for his screenplay The Social Network, tosses out jargon that baseball fanatics go crazy for. For the general audience, that's where Billy helps out. Peter explains the system and has to break it down more for Beane (i.e. the audience) so everybody on screen and in the seats is on the same page.<br/><br/>Pitt's portrayal of Beane won me over. He completely caught me off guard. I know Pitt can act but I remember him for performances that were very complex on the outside. Aldo Raine (Inglourious Basterds) with his pronounces chin, squinty eyes, and thick accent. Benjamin Button (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) who grew younger as he got older. Jeffrey Goines (12 Monkeys) who couldn't sit still let alone focus on one subject in a conversation. Yes, he was nominated for all these performances, but in a performance like this there is something bubbling under the surface. All of his characters to an extent have something going on underneath, only this character, Billy Beane, is so normal and calm on the outside, yet when he is alone we can see pain and frustration.<br/><br/>His supporting cast of Hill, Hoffman, and the slew of ball players and colleagues, help turn this baseball team into the world of Oakland Athletics. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior. Hill is quiet, timid, and very smart. Hoffman is cold, weathered, and stubborn. Pitt is able to play off of both temperaments and make their scenes together pop off the screen.<br/><br/>The one thing that this movie has going for it is the lack of actual action on the diamond. There are some great scenes of actual baseball, one at bat by Hatteberg in particular struck a chord with me, but for the most part the action is behind the scenes. There is enough for a sports junkie to get their fix and enough drama and with Beane and his family to entice any average viewer into the theater. I can't think of many target groups that wouldn't find it interesting, except for children, due to language and complexity of some of the dialogue. All in all this is one movie that will please a lot of people, and more importantly a lot of different people, sort of like The Blind Side, only the movie is actually really good."
"allmyrebs-td","Null","178","211","11 September 2011"," Worth admission even if you care squat about baseball
","Just caught this at the Toronto Film festival. It is undoubtedly one of the higher quality dramas in 2011. At its heart is a baseball-centric docu-drama, but even folks with zero baseball knowledge/interest can enjoy and be moved by this movie.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill's performance in the film is phenomenal, and this may be the break that that young actor has been joshing for. His portrayal Peter Brand, a Yale Economics major and full time computer nerd is beyond believable, you practically swear that you know him personally a few days after the movie.<br/><br/>The role of Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, is an incredibly demanding one. While there are tons of dialog, hack arguments, display of physical rage, etc; it is the silent story telling, emotional turmoil, change-of-heart reflections, pupils-triggered catharsis, and so on that are the toughest to convey and requires a well-seasoned character actor. This is easily Brad at his widest acting range - and you see all of it in a little over two hours. <br/><br/>To be totally honest, I have not been tracking Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting career until this film. His portrayal of the ready-to-exit Oakland A's coach Art Howe, caught between ""the for-sure old money"" and the ""crazy senseless new reality"", convinced me that they couldn't have casted this part any better. Hoffman delivers on every single scene and you literally sweat his frustration along with him. This foil to Brad Pitt's character is actually effective enough to save several heavy- drama exchange where Brad's delivery falls slightly short of the mark.<br/><br/>This is an ""onion"" movie, constructed purposely to be entertaining on many levels. It can be watched purely as an entertaining account of modern baseball history - how player statistics became one of the most important factors determining financial success in modern baseball. <br/><br/>For more sentimental audience it tracks the journey of a man, forced to embrace change and disappointment as he fumble aimlessly through life etching out an unremarkable career first as a failing professional player, then small-time scout, and washed-out General Manager; only to finally wake up - and find himself becoming one of the greatest living innovator of the modern game.<br/><br/>Finally, for the abstract-at-heart, and those who knows or cares little about the game of baseball (like yours truly), this is a tale of an industry under irreversible change; a documentary of the conflict between innovators who brave the slings-and-arrows to map out the new ways, and the old stalwarts who goes all out to protect their crumbling turf. <br/><br/>At this historic moment in time, the message really hits a home-run! Other than baseball, we've recently witness similar changes and conflicts played out in public across the automobile, music distribution, movie distribution, book distribution, home computer, banking , and many other industries. Every unemployed in a vanishing industry can easily identify with the old Billy Beane, it is how Billy leverage his disappointment and experience, to turn his life around that we can all aspire to.<br/><br/>A worthy note is the soundtrack for the movie, grass-root simple and heartfelt, it sent me looking for the album on itunes - only to realize that the movie has not been officially released yet."
"napierslogs","9","110","130","1 October 2011"," More than a game of numbers
","It has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in ""Moneyball"" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of ""Moneyball"" starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary. <br/><br/>A lot of people took offense to Beane's approach of degrading players down to the sum total of their on-base percentage and runs-in potential. But I liked it. Since the game of baseball isn't changing any time soon and players will always just be elements that can help win games and make more money, why not view them as numbers rather than as people with ugly girlfriends? Like Peter Brand, I like numbers. <br/><br/>It's a movie about doing more with less, so I think we're just supposed to ignore the irony that they needed an excessively high budget to make it. In fact, it cost Sony Pictures more money to make this movie than it cost the Oakland A's to field their entire team for a season. Oh well, only one lesson for Hollywood at a time, and I still liked the movie.<br/><br/>For a movie about people trying to change the game of baseball, it's only fitting that they are changing the sports genre. This isn't about the team and how many games they're going to win. As in all cases, they win some and they lose some. And we really only meet one player, the rest are just names thrown in the air. The movie is about Billy Beane, a real person, and a multi-dimensional character. At first he realizes that he is going to have to play the game with more than just money, and then after he makes it about numbers too, he finds a balanced statistical and personal concept.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" says that the game is about money, but the movie is about people. Writer Aaron Sorkin knows how to write people, and as evidenced by ""The Social Network"" (2010), he also knows how to turn computer-programming into riveting cinema. We find humour in the least-expected of places, we find heart in the least-expected of people, and 'Moneyball"" gives us a completely enjoyable movie that becomes so much more than numbers."
"Legendary_Badass","9","135","170","21 September 2011"," Pitt is at the top of his game
","I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before its national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction. <br/><br/>Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former major leaguer turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After losing in the playoffs to the Yankees, the A's lose their stars to free agency. Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition. <br/><br/>While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.<br/><br/>Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman—or at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job—frustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).<br/><br/>Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.<br/><br/>Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team."
"KnightsofNi11","8","79","98","2 October 2011"," A high quality crowd pleaser
","America's pastime has returned to the big screen and it is more witty and elegant than ever. Moneyball is the inspiring story of the Oakland A's, a team that was all but bankrupt but managed to beat the odds through intelligence and perseverance. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the team's general manager who has run out of ideas on how to make his strapped for cash team successful. This is until he meets Pete Brand, played by Jonah Hill, an economic major from Yale. Brand devises a formula that analyzes players in a way nobody else does, thus revealing statistics about players that no one else can see. Beane and Brand use this formula to build up their unlikely roster of misfits. The themes of this film run deep through our aspiring minds. It's a film about beating the odds, going against the current, and standing up for what you believe is right. It is a moving and inspiring film that really only uses baseball as a backdrop for its deeper and more universal themes. It's a moving film and you don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.<br/><br/>The strongest element of Moneyball is easily Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian's incredibly sharp script. Moneyball brings up fond memories of 2010's The Social Network in which Sorkin pulled out all the stops in his intellectual screen writing ability. The dialogue in Moneyball moves at the same pace as any Sorkin or Zaillian script does. It has a driving cadence to it that keeps a film entirely dominated by dialogue very exciting and entertaining. Their script is lively, energetic, and diverse. Moneyball has intensely emotional scenes that compel and inspire, but then it has its lighthearted and much funnier moments that have the exact same affect. There's a lot to be said for any film that has the capability to make its audience laugh and cry in the same two hour span. Moneyball is a film like that and it all begins at Sorkin's fantastic script.<br/><br/>However, it is helped by the film's superb cast. Brad Pitt leads the film perfectly, creating a very interesting protagonist and driving the film in a way few leads can. He attacks his role as Billy Beane with the utmost care, respect, and sincerity. Despite all of Pitt's good looks and always recognizable celebrity face, you will have a hard time remembering that Pitt is the one acting, not Billy Beane. But, as always, where would such a strong lead be without his supporting cast? Moneyball has that supporting cast, and it finds its immeasurable talent in the most unlikely of places. I'm talking, of course, about Jonah Hill. Hill has built his career on being a comedy caricature with over the top flicks such as Superbad and Get Him to the Greek. But all that changes when Hill takes on the role of Pete Brand. His performance is stellar. He proves himself to be a true up and comer who won't find himself restricted within the confines of teen comedy.<br/><br/>Overall, Moneyball is your typical crowd pleaser, but it is incredibly high quality. It is so well directed, so superbly acted, and Sorkin and Zaillian's script is practically flawless. Personally this isn't the film I will go crazy about. Rather, it is a film that I will enjoy so sincerely and with all my heart. I really did love this film and my respect for it is eternal. It may be typical and straightforward in its overall themes, but the quality of the film outshines this. Moneyball is just an excellent film."
"Red_Identity","Null","59","73","15 November 2011"," Intriguing, investing, with a great screenplay and a fantastic performance at its core
","Sports films... Not a huge fan of them, and don't see them much because of the predictability of them. However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler. Moneyball can now join them and is among the best films of the year.<br/><br/>The film is always intriguing, and Aaron Sorkin (whose screenplay for The Social Network was last year's best) is to be congratulated for this. It's his wonderful script that gives the film the energy. What also helps is the lack of predictability. Sure, one can't seem to hope for an 'experimental' sports film, since this is based on a true story. However, Sorkin, as well as the director, always keeps things refreshing and interesting without becoming repetitive and stale. The dialogue is brilliant of course, and the lack of 'field' action makes it even more involving so when the important ball scene comes along it makes an impact. The other big driving factor is Brad Pitt, who has had an incredible year. His performance in The Tree of Life is already among his finest work, and now this joins it as well. He portrays all of the character traits with such versatility and charisma. A great and satisfying protagonist. <br/><br/>Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this. It is to this day the best adapted screenplay of the year, and not surprisingly Pitt is my win in both categories for both of his films."
"adrian-meli","Null","63","82","4 October 2011"," Wonderful movie
","On recommendation from a friend, I recently saw Moneyball and thought the movie was quite great. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and though a lot of people already know the plot the movie made it come to life. The cast was great and specifically Jonah Hill, who usually does a great job in comedies, should get nominated for best supporting actor in it. It is nice to see him make a switch to a non-comedic role and I am sure this will greatly help his acting career.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare movies that everyone should like, whether they are sports fans or not. The story is so interesting that it could not have been made up and the original author of the book was well represented in the screenplay. I read some commentary that this might not be as big as The Blind Side overseas because a lot of people aren't in love with baseball, but I think this appeals to all people even if they are not a fan.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Sorkin did a wonderful job with the movie and picked a perfect cast-he has definitely been on a roll lately. Although I saw a matinée, I would have even liked it had I paid full price for my tickets. So, enjoy... :-)"
"estebangonzalez10","10","15","17","9 January 2012"," Who thought Baseball and Economics would make an interesting movie?
","¨There are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's fifty-feet of crap, and then there's us. ¨ Moneyball was among the best films I've seen this year. It really caught me by surprise since I'm not a big baseball fan and wasn't expecting much considering the subject matter. Baseball and economics seemed like a bad combination for me, but since Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were all starring in this film I had to see it. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Billy Beane character and the relationship he had with his young assistant Peter Brand. They are really the center of this movie so if you're doubting wither or not you should see this worrying about the subject matter all I can say is go see it anyways because it is much more than simply another baseball movie. There are some very strong and emotional scenes where I couldn't help but get goose bumps over a team and a sport I really didn't care for. That is how good this film is. Moneyball is directed by Bennett Miller, who also directed Capote in which Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his lead performance as Truman Capote. Miller has proved he can make some great films. The movie was adapted from the book written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) which focuses on the true story of the Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane, who managed to put together the 2002 team on a very low budget by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players based on a formula which was perfected by his young assistant. This would change the game forever. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network and Charlie Wilson's War) did a great job at adapting the screenplay for the big screen.<br/><br/>The movie begins with real footage from the last 2001 divisional series game between the Yankees and the A's. The A's were winning the series two games to nothing, but the Yankees came back to win the final three games and leave the A's out of the Championship Divisional game for a second year in a row. The bad news for General Manager, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is that he's going to lose his three star players for the next season. The A's don't have the kind of budget that other rich teams like the Red Sox or the Yankees have. It's just impossible to compete against those teams, so it's time to think outside the box. Billy meets with his talent scouts to see how they can replace these key players without any money, but finds no solution. He decides to hire a young Yale Economic graduate who was working as an adviser for the Cleveland Indians. His name is Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and he uses statistical data to analyze each player and decide which one has a better value based on their batting average and price. Beane and Brand go against all odds and decide to build their team entirely on these computer statistics. The scouts are outraged by the decision, but Beane believes this is the only way he can compete with the big budget teams. Beane also has some arguments with manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) over whom he should start, but the main focus of the film relies on the relationship between Beane and Brand. There are also a few scenes dealing with Beane and his relationship with his young daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) who lives with her mom Sharon (Robin Wright) in California as well.<br/><br/>Moneyball works as both a sports film and a biographical movie, but it is really much more than that. It works thanks to a very strong performance from both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill who shine in every scene they are together in. Since Beane doesn't like to watch the games for fear of jinxing the team we don't really get to see a lot of baseball. There are several conversations revolving around baseball, but it really isn't that central to the film. The true heart of the film is Beane who we all want to see succeed and silence the critics. We want his system to work because he is such a charismatic character and he believes in what he is doing. The scene where the streak begins is very inspiring and one of the best moments in sports film in my opinion. I really got a lot of goose bumps during that twentieth game winning streak. I also enjoyed the side story revolving around Billy and his daughter Casey. Kerris Dorsey has little screen time, but she is great opposite Brad Pitt. As for Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright they really don't have much to work with and don't bring anything to the story really. It's a shame because Hoffman is a great actor and he could've had a better role in this film. In my opinion the ending is perfect as well and the soundtrack was also great. Moneyball was one of the most emotional experiences I've had with a movie all year and I really recommend this inspiring film.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"bjones","Null","81","112","1 October 2011"," A Home Run
","Well, when purchasing my ticket I expected to see a good movie about 
 baseball. I was rewarded with just that. Overall I thought the film 
 excellent, both as a finely crafted film and as a representative of 
 baseball. To demonstrate that I had no preconceived prejudices, I can 
 say that I'm not really a fan of professional sports any longer. My 
 fond memories of baseball are mostly from playing the game when I was a 
 kid. We lived in a neighborhood with a lot of boys, all of whom were 
 involved in sports and we played baseball a lot. But, that was the 
 1950's and times have changed. No one now days can hold a candle to The 
 Mick.
 
 The film centers around the Oakland A's in the early 2000's and it's 
 controversial General Manager, Billy Beane, skillfully played by Brad 
 Pitt. The premise is the real story of how, with an extremely small 
 budget for a professional sports team, he managed to win a surprising 
 number of games, including setting an all-time major league record of 
 20 consecutive wins. The method used by Beane was not of his invention, 
 having already been around in theory and known as ""sabermetrics"". The 
 crafting of the team into that form is credited to have been begun by 
 Beane's predecessor, Sandy Alderson. Beane himself was thrust to the 
 forefront as the focus of a successful 2003 best-selling book 
 ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game""; which ultimately led to 
 this film.
 
 The film was very well done, really succeeding in sucking in the 
 audience to it's ebb and flow. The audience I was in clearly enjoyed 
 the film, there was a lot of laughter in the right places and applause 
 at the end, which is rare enough. The setting had the look and feel of 
 realism and the same with regard to the actors portraying the players. 
 There was a fairly long list of good character actors peppered 
 throughout the film, all of whom added considerably to the film's 
 realism.
 
 But the lion's share of the film, and the credit for it's quality, goes 
 primarily to it's major stars, Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman 
 playing Team Manger Art Howe, and Jonah Hill, as the fictional 
 character Peter Brand who is said to have been based on Paul DePodesta 
 who was Beane's assistant during the period covered by the film. 
 Hoffman is great as usual but played his character a bit understated. 
 Jonah Hill nearly ran off with the attention altogether while he was on 
 screen. But Pitt clearly controlled the central attention and did so 
 with ease and excellence. He managed to make the character look smart, 
 fair and quite human.
 
 Pitt's humanity was helped by the presence of tidbits of his family 
 life, mainly focused on his relationship with his 12 year old daughter, 
 well represented on screen by the young Kerris Dorsey as Casey Beane. 
 The interplay between them added a lot of humanity to the film that 
 would have otherwise been lacking. There was a small part played by 
 Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife Sharon. It was the closest anything in 
 the film came to a romantic involvement.
 
 Many of the character actors made important contributions, such as 
 Stephen Bishop as David Justice, Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg and 
 Brent Jennings as Ron Washington. There was even a cameo by Joe 
 Satriani playing his guitar as superbly as usual.
 
 Leaving the theater I thought that one would have to have at least a 
 working knowledge of the game of baseball to get the most out of the 
 film. I wondered how it would play to someone without that knowledge 
 and I think a lot would be lost, but it would still be enjoyable for 
 it's basic story of struggling to overcome long odds to achieve 
 something good and the exploration of the people and personalities 
 involved. That's a pretty good accomplishment for any film to make and 
 this one does it with a lot of fun and class."
"daveygandthekeyboard","Null","82","115","16 September 2011"," Possibly the best baseball movie I have I ever seen.
","In a league where the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox regularly field teams with $100 million-plus payrolls, how do you field a competitive team with a payroll that is a mere fraction of that, at $37 million? This question could have been the basis for a dry documentary, only appealing to a legion of die hard statistical analysis baseball geeks, but instead, it forms the basis of a film that shows a great deal of heart and spirit which moves it into a statement I never thought I would be making, but here goes: Moneyball is possibly the best baseball movie I have I ever seen.<br/><br/>Granted, I've never seen Bull Durham or Major League, but even with that deficiency in my sports film-viewing I can say with some confidence that this is at least as good or better than Field of Dreams and at least as good or better than The Bad News Bears.<br/><br/>The answer to the conundrum of fielding a competitive team with a limited budget is in fact the one sought by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. In 2001, after sending a team to the divisional playoffs only to lose in a heartbreaking game 5 to the big market big money New York Yankees (who went on to lose the World Series to Arizona), he was losing three of his star players and he simply could not afford to replace them. He hit the realization that in order to compete, he had to re-think the way that baseball business is done. No longer could he think in terms of buying his way into the playoffs (as the Yankees seem to do every year), but instead he would devise a system that would revolutionize the way that baseball is playedor at least they way a team is constructed. To this end, he constructed an unorthodox and unconventional system which at the time was completely unheard-of. Suddenly, players were valued not for home runs or batting average, but for walks and runs scored. Under this system, 3 players making 250,000 each were worth the same as one player making 7 million. And in doing so, Beane managed to field a winning team who set an American League record for consecutive wins. Critics may point out that as yet, under this system, the A's still haven't won a championship. But they were always competitive, which is more than we can say for the majority of the teams in the league who also are not winning championships and are in fact spending a lot more money.<br/><br/>These ideas have been around for about ten years now and are now pretty much commonplace in baseball, but at the time Beane was ridiculed for trying them. The writing is excellent (Aaron Sorkin has a screenplay credit) and draws you in even without a lot of ""action."" We know that Oakland will not win that final game of the series, we know that Beane will continue to strive for that elusive championship, but we still have a lot to root for and cheer for. Even my personal feelings about my own team (sigh--long-suffering Orioles fan) did not in anyway prevent me from cheering the A's improbable drive toward history. The relationship between Beane and his daughter is a nice, and helps to drive in the fact that to some, baseball is more than a game. You might even argue that this film is not so much about baseball but about the effect our choices have on our lives and the lives around us--the supposed threat that unconventional thinking presents to the status quo.<br/><br/>Ultimately this film is the Bad News Bears of the new millennium--a ragtag group of veterans and rookies and cast-offs come together under the visionary leadership of a general manager who dared to think outside the box. It is possible that if you have absolutely no interest in baseball, you would still like this movie for its message about resisting the urge to do what is safe and easy in favor of what is odd and maybe even crazy...and works."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","8","9","28 February 2018"," Moneyball isn't focussed on just playing Baseball but instead the inner workings of building the greatest team.
","Hundreds of sports films, hundreds of them. Pretty sure Hollywood has tackled every type of sport, including Baseball several times over. Why should this one be any different? Well, this is the true story of the Oakland Athletics to which their General Manager at the time used a new technique of deciding a team: the Moneyball model. Using statistics and logic to pick the most effective players at the cheapest price, therefore building the ultimate economical team. Such a model could change the Baseball industry and negate years of traditional intuition. This is not so much about changing Baseball, but a personal journey for Billy Beane. He himself was chosen to play professionally, ditching his chances of further education. It didn't work out, and so he desired to change the system and defy the industry as a personal vendetta against them. Completely unconventional, having a computer system pick the most suitable players as opposed to listening to veterans who have something that algorithms do not: experience. Thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can say I have no interest in Baseball (not particularly huge in the UK). A screenplay by Aaron Sorkin was destined to keep me captivated. Every script he writes is filled with sharp, concise dialogue that keeps you hooked on the characters. Brad Pitt looked effortlessly natural, owned every scene he was in. Jonah Hill...get ready guys...I actually liked. Finally!? A film I like him in. Cool, calm and calculated, was perfect at playing a graduate economist. Bennett Miller's direction was clean with a great mixture of old footage of Baseball games with the reconstructed acting. There's a scene towards the end where the result of a game relies on Chris Pratt hitting the ball. When he does...silence. I felt the tingles, was beautifully executed. Whilst the sport of Baseball does not interest me in the slightest, I loved the focus on the team building and thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone."

In the wake of Sri Lanka beating Australia (I think) in the one day cricket World Cup final many years ago (a form of the game that cricket 'purists' would no doubt deride as 'baseball' and not the 'real form' of the game...heaven knows what they now make of of the Twenty20 form of the game!), I did happen upon an article which argued that Sri Lanka had revolutionised this shortened form of the game with their batting tactics. That story intrigued me...I doubt if Sri Lanka's batting strategy was created from statistics or maths, but it was persuasively argued in the article that it had mathematical or statistical logic to it (no doubt with a big helping of common sense too).<br/><br/>Furthermore, I had dabbled with free, customisable N.B.A. fantasy basketball leagues, where I had created two leagues with opposing philosophies...in one league, unsporting conduct was astronomically punished, whilst in the other league it was nicely rewarded. This created drafting conundrums...someone like Kobe Bryant could be a star in the fair play league...but would be a star in the foul play league. He was definitely a gamble in the fair play league though...in one year he could crush the coach's hopes, and in another year he would be a surprising star. I did get the distinct impression that coaches' who did well did so with the help of spreadsheets...to crunch the statistics...which is what this movie is all about. Before I start the review proper, I'll just mention that I may have been roped into joining someone's fantasy baseball league as a quid pro quo for them joining my league...just found the whole language of baseball gobbledygook...and never really hung around that sport for long. It's a good thing that this movie was not geared to those fans who love the gobbledygook (be it something called ERAs or whatever it's called).<br/><br/>Based on a true story, this movie outlines the revolutionary approach to selecting a baseball team for the major league in the wake of having your star players bought for large sums of money by cashed up teams. That's a major theme of the movie...the underdog against an unfair system. The approach taken contrasts that taken in Australia for the game of Australian rules football (AFL), where a form of 'socialism' was instituted over a decade ago, I think, with 'equalised' drafting, priority picks and salary caps. This 'socialism' has seen a diversity of teams win the sport's major trophy. Perhaps the main character in this movie, Billy Beane, might have been content with such a system.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, and it is striking how much Brad seems to be growing into Robert Redford's face as he ages. Billy is the general manager of an underfunded (by cashed up teams' standards) baseball team, the Oakland Athletics. As in many sports where distorted markets rule (e.g. European soccer, where American multi-billionaires borrow huge sums of money and buy famous teams and load them up with debt...which is fine...until the bubble burst and the teams might face bankruptcy...or, where Russian oil billionaires buy teams and eat into their own cash reserves, paying insane salaries for stars. In both cases, there really is no business model, apart from paying crazy money which you either do or do not have for purpose of winning trophies), Oakland has developed some players into stars...only to see them picked off by cashed up teams.<br/><br/>Pitt plays Beane in the charismatic/brash way that Orson Welles played the youthful and exuberant 'Citizen' Kane, and he does a nice line in sizing people up and yet biting his tongue or taking sly amusement from their ways. This is interesting due to the history of Beane...he was seen as a potential star of the game and he does carry around some of that baggage with him at times. His experience illustrates the art vs science approach to baseball...he was drafted due to the former and he has to butt heads with his recruitment department in his new role as the team's general manager in order to bring a more scientific approach to recruiting.<br/><br/>Peter Brand plays Jonah Hill, a smart draft by Beane, who recognises in this geek a man capable of revolutionising the thinking of his recruitment department. Peter/Jonah is the most unathletic man you could imagine...short of someone who would require a crane to take them out of their bedroom by a hole in the roof in order to be taken to a hospital. He's like me playing fantasy N.B.A...or that man in the Matrix who sees everything in terms of binary digits...even that beautiful woman in a red dress.<br/><br/>For people who enjoy watching the game of baseball on the big screen, the last half hour has some nice moments for them. What makes this film more interesting for a general audience though is the intriguing insight into the backroom discussions of an elite sporting team. How players are valued and reasons why they may not be valued more highly are discussed.<br/><br/>In some ways this story is like those horse racing stories where someone buys a horse for under a $1,000 which was destined for the knacker's yard, but it goes on to win a fortune. You do get the equivalent of horses bound for the knacker's yard in this movie, as far as the baseball players who are recruited by Beane.<br/><br/>There was a scene I liked in this movie, where reporters discussed who was responsible for the team's turnaround...it was all attributed to the coach...which was in contrast to the tale that the movie tells.<br/><br/>A well told story which did make me laugh on occasion."

","I hate sports, I really do but I love movies and this one peaked my interest and I decided to watch it and I was thoroughly impressed by what I saw. The filmmakers To a really good job of making you care about the success of The Oakland Athletics because they take the time to show you just how bad a state they are in. They also take the time to build the characters so that you understand how important it is for them to succeed. Brad Pitt was fantastic in this film not only did he have some really great one liners but he had a great heart to him you felt sorry for him through seeing his last failings and I really loved his chemistry with Jonah Hill who was also great in this film up until The Wolf of Wall Street this was his best performance ever, I loved his character because he was easy to relate to, that new kid quality does that and I thought Hill did a great job with some of the more emotional scenes. The baseball scenes are filmed terrifically there done in a very documentation style which makes them feel more life like. The relationship between Pitt and his daughter was a really nice touch it made you care more about him and gave you a sense of who he was as a person not just a manager. I liked the fact that they made this film feel real, you completely understand how bad the odds are against this new system, you see them be put down, get angry at defeats and face dismissal and it makes you care all the more about this team succeeding. The late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie and he did a great job, I really liked his character he didn't agree with this system and it let you get the series of events from the players perspective and added a more personal touch to the games. I do have a few flaws with this film, for one Chris Pratts character was very wasted, at first it seemed as if they were setting up a good arc for his character but they don't give it the time required to make you care and just ends up being unnecessary. I also thought that they should have taken the time to see the teams success instead of simply shown it in a montage as it didn't give the victories any emotional weight and was an unsatisfactory conclusion to such a good story arc. <br/><br/>Despite hating sports I really enjoyed this movie, I loved Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, you really got invested in the characters and the team and the sporting sequences themselves were very well done. <br/><br/>84%/A-"

","Baseball and submarines: American cinema seems to thrive in these two arenas. Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane. Philosophy meets strategy in a perfect pairing, as Billy and Peter go to work implementing 'moneyball' with an almost religious zeal. Pitt brings his now taken-for-granted charisma and complexity to Beane. The casting of Jonah Hill is a gamble that pays off as he manages to give Peter a backbone, when it would be all too easy to lampoon this character. And when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman stepping up to play a small but crucial part, then you have a movie that is intriguing and compelling in equal measure. Very few people have the courage to choose a transgressive path, and of those that do, fewer still will stick with it in the face of adversity. A film of quiet determination, with occasionally explosive conflict, it is at all times humane and authentic. One to watch again and again."

","I used to be a fan, about sixty years ago when I would take the trolley to Griffith Stadium to watch the Washington Senators lose again.

So, when a friend offered me his copy of this DVD, saying it was something special, I figured I would watch it and politely fib that I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Well, I shouldn't have worried. This was one of the finest films I've seen on so many levels. How they captured interactions from the G.M.'s relationship to his daughter, and his young adviser along with every one of his professional colleagues with such utter truth is amazing. Not a single false note. I compare it with the work of David Mamet, an esteemed film writer whose dialogue is his image of how men talk, with every other word four letters beginning with F. I've worked in setting such as the sales rooms of his film Glen Berrny-Glen Ross, and can attest that he was portraying caricatures rather than real people, unlike those dramatized by every single character in this film.<br/><br/>From the original book, to the screen adaptation, to the acting, directing and editing---this was a gem, but beyond technical excellence it was inspired-as reflected by the fat player who tried to get back to first, not realizing that he had hit a home run.

","Despite being a non-sports fan, let alone a non-baseball fan, there are still a lot of great sports films out there...of which 'Moneyball' is an example of one.<br/><br/>It is not going to be for all tastes. It is wordy with a lot of talk and not a whole lot of baseball, which may be a disappointment for fans, but to me that was not a bad thing at all. It saw a different side to the sport and how sports films are approached and portrayed, and it was done wonderfully, apart from a couple of scenes that were a touch too talky.<br/><br/>'Moneyball' is a very well made film, not one of the most visually beautiful films of the year but still beautifully shot and the scenery is very handsome.

","""It's hard not to be romantic about baseball. This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans. It sells tickets and hot dogs""<br/><br/>Moneyball is a sports movie what makes it stand apart from the crowd is that it takes all the clichés that are associated with sports movies such as heroic games, emotional moments and motivational speeches and turns them down on their head to deliver a movie that delves in the cold and calculative science behind sports- in this case being sabermetrics. Sabermetrics is the specialized analysis of baseball through objective, empirical evidence, specifically baseball statistics that measure in- game activity. Thus it is all about objective knowledge related to baseball, It points out facts such as which player has the highest onbase percentages rather than subjective arguments such as who is the best player in the game.<br/><br/>Picture this- in a conference room at the Oakland athletics headquarters, baseball scouts and team management are squabbling to pick stars for their team. And while evaluating prospective players, phrases that go around are-""clean cut, good face, good jaw"", ""he is a good looking ball player"", and my favourite ""when he hits the ball, it pops off his bat. You can hear it all over the ballpark. There is a lot of pop"". It is then that a manifestation dawns upon Billy Beane - that the current technique of player selection is flawed and unsuitable for teams with smaller budgets. When he stumbles across Peter Brand, a fresh out of Yale statistician, he realizes that he may have found a more cost effective way to get the right players in the team and do battle with the 800 pound gorillas in the league. Using statistics he finds value in players that no one else seem to do. People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws- Age, appearance, personality. Mathematics cut straight through that, and Billy, is able to create a championship team that they can afford, because everyone else in baseball undervalues them. After initial setbacks, he manages to effect a dramatic turnaround from a written off team to claim, at 20 games in a row, the longest winning streak in the history of the game.<br/><br/>""I hate losing more than I even wanna win"" says Brad Pitt as he plays a career defining role as Billy Beane, a reclusive general manager for the Oakland A's who when young promised much as a player, but turned out mediocre. Having taken up scouting, and later a managerial role in a team riddled with middling performers and a tight budget, he is so intense that he does not go to watch his team play, yet he is able to make himself look indifferent as he says that making relations with players will soften him up when he has to make tough decisions about who to keep on the roster and who not to. He finds losing repulsive, yet that seems to be his fate unless he is able to embrace the principles advocated by Peter, played by the usually fat king of vulgarity- Jonah Hill. And what a revelation Hill is in this movie- he is precocious, understated and nerdy to Pitt's charismatic, yet in his quietly confident and softspoken way, he matches him in every scene, proves that there is life for him after he ""outgrows"" (pardon the pun), teen comedy. Being riled by scouts yet having analyzed tons of players in the league, he is able to influence Beane to try out his theories which he believes will bring the team out from the rut that it currently is in. Juxtaposed between them and not quite seeing things the same way, is the bull headed coach of the team, played excellently again by Philip Seymour Hoffman- so much so that he continues to frustrate not only the lead characters, but also the viewer in his obstinacy- you so want to get inside the screen and sock him. Some of the movie's best scenes involve intense discussions, and standoffs between these three characters. <br/><br/>The movie is based upon 2003 best-selling book by Michael Lewis, ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game""- and while baseball continues to remain the backdrop, the movie touches upon how difficult organizations find it is to change, flattening of hierarchies by the availability of information, and the need for efficiency that capitalism demands. While the strongest element of Moneyball is its script by Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian reminiscent of their work in The Social Network. Its lively, intense and emotional, and yet it has its lighthearted moments. <br/><br/>While it is gloomy to know that a computer can do a better job at assembling a successful team than years of collective human experience and emotions, at the end of it, this is a movie in which brain triumphs brawn. It is intelligent, the script witty, fast paced, and with strong elements of drama. Each frame is a work of art and is lovingly shot- whether the action in the games, or the real action, which in this case, is behind the scenes. The end results don't matter, nor does is matter that Billy Beane is still looking for his first league win, what matters is the change that his thoughts managed to bring to a sport riddled with tradition.<br/><br/>The movie has already garnered 7 Academy Award nominations including ones for Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and best movie and script also. It has already won the American Film Institute's movie of the year, and it will win many more for though Moneyball says the game is about money, but the movie is about real people, and this makes for riveting cinema.

"ferguson-6","7","20","32","14 September 2011"," Sabermetrics in the Grand Ole Game
","Greetings again from the darkness. While reading ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, I never once considered what it might look like as a movie. And I am the kind of guy who looks at a mailbox and wonders if a movie about a mailman might be interesting (Costner proved me wrong). If you are a baseball fan, you should see this movie. If you are not a baseball fan, the movie works very well as a metaphor for any business maverick who takes a risk and analyzes their company or industry from an entirely new perspective. The game of baseball was over a hundred years old when Oakland A's GM Billy Beane turned the institution on its ear.<br/><br/>Mr. Lewis spent most of the 2002 season with the Oakland team and had full access to GM Billy Beane, Asst GM Paul DePodesta, and their process in putting together a team that would contend for the American League title ... all under the severe handicap of ridiculous salary constraints placed by team owners.<br/><br/>In this movie, Brad Pitt is spot on as Billy Beane - the cocky, tobacco spitting former jock trying desperately to put his stamp on the institution of baseball. Due to some lawsuit of which I know nothing, the DePodesta role is renamed Peter Brand and is played by Jonah Hill, who looks absolutely nothing like Mr. DePodesta (who played baseball at Harvard). Despite this, Mr. Hill does an terrific job of becoming the statistical whiz who can analyze data and place value on players ... a skill he is obsessed with even 10 years later.<br/><br/>Watching Beane trying to communicate the point of change to the old school scouts is simply priceless and painful. Years of scouting based on body type and girlfriend ranking is replaced by statistical data spit out by Brand's computer. The real fun comes when the team's field Manager, Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), flashes his bah-humbug attitude, bucks Beane's system and continues coaching old school ... from the gut. It's not until Beane takes away all other options that Howe is forced to follow the new plan.<br/><br/>Baseball fans know that Bill James is the godfather of sabermetrics in baseball. For years his formulas and calculations were ignored by owners, managers and scouts. Thanks to the A's success, ALL teams now utilize some form of sabermetrics combined with old fashioned scouting. Every measurable event in a game is tracked and results are analyzed. Many fans say it has sucked the joy out of the game. Others say it has provided opportunities for players previously ignored. I prefer to look at it as the same in any industry ... everyone looks for a competitive advantage. Never ignore a tool or approach that can make your company more profitable or your team more competitive.<br/><br/>Being a long time Texas Ranger fan, I must mention some of the ties to this story. The Rangers current manager, Ron Washington (portrayed by Brent Jennings), was an infield coach on those Oakland A's and gets a few scenes. Grady Fuson was the Head Scout for the A's and later came to the Rangers as co-GM or Asst GM (depending who you ask) but had a very limited stay. Mike Venafro was a relief pitcher for the A's who gets traded in 2002 so they can pick up a more valued reliever to take his spot. It should also be noted that current Rangers GM Jon Daniels and his talented staff have a place for sabermetrics and their formula has worked.<br/><br/>The director of the movie is Bennett Miller, who was responsible for the excellent ""Capote"", which also starred Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Bennett's DP here is Wally Pfister, who works frequently with the great Christopher Nolan. Pfister's camera work here is superb. The amazing writing team of Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin provide a script with sharp dialogue and just enough baseball lingo so that everyone can follow. Supporting actors include Chris Pratt (Parks & Recreation) as Scott Hatteberg, poster child for sabermetrics, Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife, and fantastic writer/director Spike Jonze as Wright's zenned-out new husband and the polar opposite of Beane.<br/><br/>I need to make a point about the performance of Jonah Hill. His movies ""Superbad"" and ""Get Him to the Greek"" are not my type of movies so I was never a big fan. That changed when I saw ""Cyrus"" last year. During the Q&A after this screening, Mr. Hill pointed out that ""Cyrus"" was the bridge that allowed him to be cast in this movie ... his bridge to drama. He went on to state that his acting heroes are Dustin Hoffman and Bill Murray because they have had successful careers in both comedy and drama. I can honestly say that it is easy to see Jonah Hill having a Bill Murray type career, especially since he has now lost so much weight - a significant weight loss after the filming of Moneyball. He is no longer the funny fat guy. He is a talented actor."

The movie shows an internal conflict of the main character who has dealt with the dilemmas of both a player and a manager.

This film is for baseball lovers too regardless of what team you're rooting for whether the Oakland Athletics, the New York Yankees, or the Boston Red Sox. The accolades were well deserved for Pitt and Hill. I am not much of a baseball fan to begin with or a sports fan at all but this film made me enjoy the game which can for hours and seven games with a rival. This film is not about money which has overtaken baseball but the love of the game. This film shows how a small underpaid team like the Oakland Athletics can be David to New York Yankees' Goliath."
"Gloede_The_Saint","5","23","42","3 January 2012"," Two hours of dry shoptalk with Pitt on auto-pilot
","Moneyball is a slow moving chamber room film about the administrative and strategic aspects of baseball. Does it sound dry to you? Then you'll probably think it is. It's very down to earth, almost minimalistic in a sense, just lacking the emotional strength. Nothing is exaggerated, all the scenes are like normal everyday conversations.<br/><br/>The acting style, particularly from the bit players is a mix between aping after documentaries/filmed real life conversations and the some poor TV networks drama of the week. The acting isn't exactly bad, it's just unmemorable and lacking strength. Jonah Hill is the only one here who gives a relatively good performance. Brad Pitt just seems like he's on auto-pilot and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's barely even in the film, just blends into the background.<br/><br/>The structure is fairly simple, it's basically all shoptalk, and relatively uninspired shoptalk at that, as Brad Pitt move from meeting to meeting. I think it's biggest weakness is the rather emotional score, which seems a tad sappy and banal. It seems to want to make up for the otherwise dry and unemotional business aspects, and takes every tiny opportunity to insert a tear in someones eyes.<br/><br/>In a way I respect it, because it must have been really hard to get this movie made, but it just doesn't manage to be as good as it potentially could have been. It far from bad mind it. It's more than competently directed, it's Capote helmer Bennett Miller after all, and all the aspects are more or less decent. It even contains a few rather good scenes, which shows that they could have gotten it on the right track. So yes, I'm slightly disappointed. At high hopes for this. Won't write off Bennett Miller yet though. He could still have a great career in front of him. And it was nice to see Jonah Hill do well in a nice, toned down and quiet role. 5/10."

","Every year there has to be one BIG award winning film that I just shake my head about and wonder what the hell everyone is thinking? Slumdog Millionaire was WAY over hyped, American Beauty, Babel, every George Clooney movie...I could go on. But Moneyball is the exact definition of me shaking my head. I thought Moneyball was downright boring. Yes the performances were solid but the content of the movie, and the scenes were simply boring. The film was about two hours too long and nothing of any significance ever happens. I am just constantly surprised by people's comments on this film and I don't just mean professional critics. IMDb reviewers are saying...Best Film of 2011, ""Incredible"", Brad Pitt's best role...surely some sort of mass hypnosis has been done because this movie was not even average. It was boring, contrived, with zero climax and had more to do with money than baseball.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt gives a decent performance as Billy Beane. It is an okay role. He does a good job. Without him this film probably would have been a 2/10 or less. But this wouldn't even fit in his top twenty performances and I think he's an outstanding actor. Sorry Mr. Pitt but you shouldn't get a nomination let alone the award for this. Jonah Hill is also decent as Peter Brand. He is the straight man but also the comic relief delivering some funny lines and him and Pitt have a good but awkward chemistry opposite each other. His performance is as good as Pitt's which isn't saying that either of them are outstanding. The very talented Philip Seymour Hoffman is completely underplayed and underused in this film. His whole character amounts to scowling and making angry faces at Pitt. Robin Wright getting top billing in this film is ludicrous as she is pointless and useless and hardly shows up. She has long been reduced to a sub character actor.<br/><br/>This whole review and my entire opinion can be reduced to the film being over-rated quite simply. What about this movie makes it so fantastic? Why is this better than the thousands of other movies released this year? I know that I'm in a minority of people that didn't like it but I think sometimes people get caught up in hype. I saw Moneyball within its first week, if not weekend, so before all the hype started and I was bored to tears. The entire plot is Pitt sitting in an office calling people, bantering back and forth, and nothing ever happens. To call this a baseball film is ridiculous because it has nothing to do with playing baseball. Anyways millions will flock to see it, it will likely be on the top of everyone's awards list but for me, outside of a few decent performances, was a dud all around. 5/10"

Miller takes Sorkin's unsurprisingly clever dialogue and surrounds it with long shots of character's still faces, and beds the whole movie on beautifully atmospheric music.

The film also stars Jonah Hill among some other names, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill put on fantastic performances in this film and are both deserved of their Academy Awards nominations. To accentuate the quality of the acting the film is very well directed and there is a fantastic script from Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. I think the film is very well edited and interspersed with some real life footage and flashback stuff to fill in gaps with the story. There are also some fantastic and interesting dialogue sequences. The film seems to offer an interesting insight into the sport of baseball and the management of sports teams. Especially the actual financial and logistical management as opposed to player management. This is another film that manages to get the audience (well, me at least) behind the team and the competitors in the sport. We definitely feel the adrenaline of the player victories.

This is a good thing and the movie is cute and entertaining a chuckle at a time. It does not really give the actors anything Oscar worthy to deal with though, so nothing bad to say about the acting, but no hip-hip-hooray either.<br/><br/>As a baseball fan I found some of the movie interesting, but overall I felt like the insider access was not as interesting as just watching MLBtv and long periods of time were passed over without me really getting invested into the drama of it all.<br/><br/>This is a good, entertaining movie, and worth a rent, but it's not a ""time and time again"" sort of flick to me and seems like a strong contender for A title at an amazing $5 price at a retail store less than a year after release to home video. I saw it at the movie theater and it wasn't really a sit and see it n the big screen type of flick."
"smpv45","2","34","70","4 October 2011"," Baseball's best book yields terrible movie
","Michael Lewis' book, Moneyball, ranks among the best sports book of all time. After the success of The Blindside, this superior Lewis book seemed prime for a film as fantastic as the Sandra Bullock driven movie. Unfortunately, the film adaptation is the worst baseball movie since Major League and The Sandlot spawned sequels. <br/><br/>Moneyball first told the story of the Oakland A's competing with an inferior budget at the early part of the decade in 2003. Years later, the Michael Lewis masterpiece fell into Bennett Miller's hands. Screenplay superstars, Steven Zaillian, and Aaron Sorkin, butchered the baseball elements of the film to focus on the character elements. This would have been fine had they actually written in any personalities for the characters.<br/><br/>Like the 2011 Oakland A's, Miller struggled to recapture the magic of the 2002 team, misdirecting Moneyball into a snooze fest. The film featured more shots of Brad Pitt thinking to himself than actual baseball. <br/><br/>The casting of Pitt as A's General manager Billy Beane seemed superb. However, if the character does nothing but sit there and silently reflect , than the best actors like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman lose their advantage over the actors like Keanu Reeves and Jean Claude Van Damme. <br/><br/>The excitement that Lewis infused into a story about revolutionizing baseball strategy takes a backseat to a half-hearted attempt to spotlight Beane's personal relationships. His bond with his daughter seemed like an artificial addition to the film. While this should make the character more human, he still lacks the personality that enlivened the book version of Beane. <br/><br/>To his credit when Pitt speaks, the character's charisma comes through. However too many scenes feature him silent or engaging in a conversation that does not affect the plot of the film. <br/><br/>This especially rings true in the chat between Beane and his assistant GM, Peter Brand, about cutting players. The drama, in three later scenes that demonstrate this act, fails miserably. Only one of the players seems to care, and the other two are so nonchalant that the scenes become meaningless additions to the film. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill's portrayal of Peter Brand makes Paul DePodesta, the real life character, glad he refused the rights to use his name in the movie. The character has no personality, no passion, and no inflection on any word he says. <br/><br/>Like the book, the film flashes back to Beane's scouting and struggles in the Big Leagues. However, Miller and company once again dropped the ball. These reflections are disjointed and unorganized. They fail to illustrate Beane's inability to separate emotion from the game. <br/><br/>They show that his time in the big leagues let down everyone including himself. However, in a statistics based movie, filled with titles on the screen, a showing of Beane's career stats would have helped audiences better understand his hatred for conventional scouting.<br/><br/>A movie based on a book about baseball should have filmed more than just one baseball game. This game, the finale of the streak segment, stands out as the best part of the movie. The sequence is well filmed and captures the emotion of this pivotal game for the Oakland A's. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie jumps immediately from this streak into the ending of the season. They show just one out of the A's final game, a decision that once again shows a flaw in either writing or directing. <br/><br/>After this final game, the movie continues to drag on with more Beane self reflection and his forced relationship with Jonah Hill's character. I have never seen two actors with less chemistry than Pitt and Hill together. <br/><br/>Another horrible flaw that usually helps other baseball movies succeed are the players in the film. They, like the rest of the characters, never showcase any personality or charisma. In fact, they might as well have been posters on the dugout wall. <br/><br/>The characters in the film never have any growth. The movie included an awkward conversation between Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) and David Justice (Stephen Bishop). <br/><br/>Justice attempts to comfort Hatteberg on his fielding concerns, but never reassures him. This scene would have worked in the film had they later shown Justice offering better advice to other players, or had they shown the real life fielding improvement of Hatteberg at first base. <br/><br/>Like every other relationship in this film, this connection never developed. The interaction between Beane and his ex-wife (Robin Wright-Penn) also never goes anywhere, or has any impact on the story being told. It is a forced awkward scene that should decorate the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Great baseball films showcase players with charisma. The Sandlot, Major League, Little Big League, and the host of other great offerings in the genre, be they kids movies or biographies, have players with personalities. They also have more than one baseball sequence.<br/><br/>Fans of the sport of baseball, and the Michael Lewis masterpiece, should avoid this film at all costs. It is not a baseball movie. It is Brad Pitt thinking time. Terrible directing, screen writing and mediocre acting efforts earn Moneyball a D- for ruining a great book that should have been a great movie. <br/><br/>Check out more reviews and movie lists at http://movieauthority.blogspot.com/"
"disconixx","4","26","53","19 November 2011"," A great movie to fall asleep to!
","There was nothing engaging about this movie. The characters were bland. The cinematography was nothing to marvel over. I understand that real life isn't always as engaging as we'd like it to be, but it worked for the Blind Side. I fail to understand why these directors couldn't make it work.<br/><br/>For some reason, the actors seem to have been directed to be silent for 3 seconds after anyone talks. Why? There was so much awkward silence in this movie! It left the audience giggling nervously. It added nothing to the plot or character development. If the silences were taken out, I guarantee it would be an hour shorter (and a lot less painful to watch). The film also seemed to lack a sufficient musical score. Scenes that would usually have been made more exciting by background music were played out in complete silence. It's very difficult to be excited about a plot development when the makers of the movie don't seem to be either. <br/><br/>The characters spoke in monotone. None of them struck me as likable, perhaps bar Billy Beane's daughter. Billy frequently becomes unjustifiably angry, throwing sports equipment at walls for dramatic effect. It all seems very fake and scripted. There's so little dialogue in this movie, I barely feel like I know any of the characters. If we're meant to rely on Billy Beane's facial expressions to get a sense of what he's feeling, then Brad Pitt doesn't do a good enough job. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a snooze fest. I kept looking at my watch, hoping it would soon be over. Don't see this movie. Wait for it to be shown on TV. You can watch it while reading a book, or doing the laundry. Trust me, you'll still get the general gist of it."

","Billie Beane was drafted by the Mets to be their next slugger. Or at least he looked the part. The only problem is he really wasn't the player they wanted him to be. So why did they draft him in the first round? The answer comes in a revolutionized method to see baseball called Sabermetrics.<br/><br/>Fastforward to 2002, where he is a general manager for a team with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. Its a team that can't buy its way to win, so they have to outsmart everyone including thier own team manager. He trades away their best players. He crashes the locker room with a bat when they are seen dancing after a loss. Beane becomes obssessed with winning.<br/><br/>What ends up happening in Oakland will be a model for how to win in the modern MLB era. The team of scrappy blue collar players begins winning. How many wins? MLB Record Setting wins.<br/><br/>As history is being made, everyone begins to witness a transformation away from the traditional way baseball is viewed. As Oakland begins competing with big market teams, they begin taking notice of Billy Beane. And finally, as a general manager, he is able to over come the demons of his days as a failed ball player.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, this is a love story. As other big market baseball teams try to pull him away from the small market in Oakland, he has to make a decision as to where his heart is. The answer to this comes in the final few minutes of the movie."
"dv-65","2","14","26","19 December 2011"," Another Brad Pitt eating movie..
","I'm starting to think Mr.Pitt doesn't know what to do with his hands when he's acting. But now he is rarely seen far from finger food. Initially I thought it was a character trait he'd invented for whoever he played in the Ocean's 11 series[ whenever we cut to him he usually was finishing some snack or other...hilarious!] But it seems that it's going to be a regular part of his performance cannon.<br/><br/>He indulges in so many snacks, he actually mistimes one and while on the phone sorting out one dull transfer or another, he puts peanuts in his mouth just before he has to speak and then he spits them out.[ Honestly watch it again, it's no planned move] I'm baffled by this long uninteresting story, and why someone as good as Mr.Sorkin got involved. In a nutshell big league failure Billy Beane [ ""Dammit ! We've only got $39 million to spend !!...yeah, that must be tough""] uses Peter Brands system and fails to win the big prize...<br/><br/>Why is the film about Billy ? Surely it's Pete's story , he's the underdog who came from nowhere to majors and changed how some teams used players. Billy was losing until he came along.<br/><br/>Oh, and that 20 wins in a row ? This film is based around the use of statistics. And statistic's prove that if you do something long enough eventually all permutations will occur. That's why the record had stood so longit was simply time, not talent.<br/><br/>Also Philip Seymour Hoffman, always brilliant, is left on the bench for most of the picture. And when he does appear he's only allowed to field rather than pitch [ Thats a baseball reference right ?]"
"bigfoot951","1","37","82","15 January 2012"," This movie is a disgrace to baseball
","If you know anything about baseball or care anything about baseball then this movie is a huge disgrace.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt did a good job in this movie as well as Johah Hill and others. I don't mean to say that the acting was bad in this movie because it wasn't, but the story told was insanely inaccurate to the point of being complete fiction.<br/><br/>They intentionally left out the fact that this A's team had one of the best pitching staffs in the big leagues(Zito, Mulder, Hudson, and Koch). They had two perennial all stars on the left side of the infield and hitting in the middle of the line up(Tejada and Chavez).<br/><br/>This A's team had a great team that had nothing to do with the philosophy presented in this movie. These great players are why this A's team had so much success yet they did everything they could to keep them out of the movie.<br/><br/>This whole movie was made about a philosophy that flat out did not work, yet people are praising Billy Beane for this great season. It is not only a joke, but a disgrace to the integrity of baseball."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","11","20","16 January 2012"," There may be no crying in baseball, but there sure is a lot of talking
","So last year it seemed like one of the most talked about movies was Moneyball, everyone has been screaming about Brad Pitt's performance, so I was more than enthused to rent this film. I'm also a baseball fan, it's my favorite sport, so I thought I would naturally connect to this film as well as my fiancé who just a sports fanatic in general. Baseball is a tricky sport though, some consider it very boring and some consider it thrilling. So I was thinking that people would hated baseball would not get into this film, but over all the reviews have been more than positive. I actually think this was a good film, however for the first time in my baseball life, I found it kind of dull. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good movie, but I don't find the story that fascinating. I know that it's a story that was about the way we changed how we look at athletes when recruiting for teams, however the film can drag out a bit and doesn't get really good until the ending.<br/><br/>Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane is upset by his team's loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 post season. Beane attempts to devise a strategy for assembling a competitive team for 2002 but struggles to overcome Oakland's limited player payroll. During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him, Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Sensing opportunity, Beane hires Brand as the Athletics' assistant general manager changing the way that baseball looks at athletes forever.<br/><br/>I liked the exploration with Billy Beane, showing him not just as a man who is trying to pull his team back up but also a struggling father. He's human, he makes mistakes and has fears like any other man. I loved Brad's chemistry with Jonah, who I must say has come a long way in acting, I thought this guy to be nothing more but a man child who annoyed me in every role he ever took. I really liked Jonah Hill in this movie, he plays off the big boy actors very well just like his character in the film sort of speak. I loved seeing the rise of the Oakland A's, almost rooting for them as they are actually winning the games and becoming a real team(even though I'm a devote Cubs fan lol). Like I said before, despite all the good, I think the film is a bit too long and talky at times. I'm not sure if this was a good way to convert those who are not into baseball onto the sport. I know that's not the film's intention, but I like to see people get excited about baseball as it is an exciting sport. Brad does a great job, I'm not sure if this is my favorite role with him, but if he gets an Oscar nomination for it, good for him! I would just recommend this movie as a rental though if you really do want to see it, but it's one of those movies I saw once and more than happy with that.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Philley11","4","14","27","23 September 2011"," More a movie about Billy Beane then Moneyball
","Moneyball is about finding and then exploiting market deficiencies and it is applicable to any business not just baseball. This book was key to changing the way a walk was valued and it started a new era of baseball thinking which eventually evolved into a hybrid of numbers and scouting. They choose not to focus on this and instead made a super melodramatic story on what Billy Beane went through. Am I suppose to think that a guy who outperformed his expectancy the past few years is now in trouble of getting fired because of one bad start to a season? This is just a example of the over-dramatic feel that this movie has created for itself. A twelve year old daughter overly concerned about her fathers job security when she herself is singing songs about being so alone in the world is another example.<br/><br/>Michael Lewis and Billy Beane had a great chance to show the non-baseball following world a little bit about how the sport has and is currently evolving. Instead they opted for the Hollywood angle. I think with better screenplay and with better direction this movie could have been one of the best baseball movie of all time much like the book. I mean they didn't show any of the 2002 draft preparation which was the best part of the book. Weak sauce."
"bhachu","3","13","25","25 September 2011"," henry ford meets baseball
","I bought the hype. I watched this movie yesterday thinking it would be a story that teaches something about the business of professional sports. I thought I would be entertained with a story that explores concepts like greed, pride, perseverance etc. It probably does do this, but it was really boring.<br/><br/>I can summarize the theory as follows: A player should not be judged on how well they play individually, but how do they contribute to the team's ability to score runs. If a winning game was the equivalent of a Model T, then a player is the equivalent of a worker on the assembly line. Billy Beane, the General Manager decides to replace Giambi, their star first baseman who earns 7 million a year with"" 3 defective players"" for less than a million dollars, who total the same batting average when put together. The fact that none of the 3 players plays first base is inconsequential because it doesn't contribute to scoring runs.<br/><br/>The new theory put forward by the Yale Economics Major who becomes the Assistant Manager to Beane, is to pick players that can produce the most number of wins for the least amount of money. The movie delves into baseball minutiae, it touches on player experiences but focuses on the main character's history through the use of flashbacks. Billy Beane was considered a rising star who passed on Stanford University to play for the New York Mets. He had been considered full of potential but could not deliver. This motivates Beane to accept and implement the new team structure based on the new theory.<br/><br/>Unless you are a major baseball fan, this movie is tedious to watch."
"relian-1","9","11","21","12 September 2011"," Excellent movie about changing the rules to win
","Excellent movie. Tells the story of the resurgent Oakland A's under Billy Beane's leadership when his winning team had just lost key players (Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen) to deep pocketed and large market competitors, and the A's couldn't replace them with comparable talent due to financial constraints. The solution? Replace them in aggregate rather than player-for-player by focusing on new metrics that had not previously received much attention and algorithms that were not feasible before computers. Scouts and managers still generally inhabited that prehistoric world - at least before Beane. There's a lovely scene with Brad Pitt's on-screen daughter singing a song with resonant lyrics. Brad Pitt is stellar in his acting (and in his appearance at TIFF, together with someone called Angelina.)"

It's one of those movies that you can see the preview for, and that's all you need.<br/><br/>First, the only characters in the movie are Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. NONE of the characters are developed further than reading their lines, particularly the players themselves, followed by his ex-wife and daughter, whose sequences don't fit into the movie at all. <br/><br/>Secondly, only baseball fans are the ones that say you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it. I'm not a baseball fan, and I still don't get it, nor did I enjoy it. <br/><br/>It is NOT entertaining. I go to the movies to be entertained. I don't need some deep, non-stated meaning at the end that leaves feel-bad ambiguity about why the story was told in the first place. At one point, Brad Pitt's character states that ""It's all meaningless"", referring to the fact that if you don't win the last game of the season, the entire season was pointless. The same goes for this movie. If the ending sucks, the entire movies was pointless. The ending to this movie is absolutely terrible. I don't care if it's based on a true story, as if that is justification for a bad ending. In the end, the movies simply states that Brad Pitt's character was a loser. He made the wrong decision early in life, and then, at the end, another wrong decision...or was it? We never know! The closing scene is Brad Pitt listening to a song written by his daughter, summarizing his life....""Dad, you're a loser"". Huh? Did I really just watch an entire movie about losing? Life is hard enough, movies are supposed to be an escape, not a manipulation of your feelings to get a reaction for it's ""artistic value""<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, watch the preview, and save your time for something better, like Battlefield Earth...lol (sarcasm)."

Look across the professional sports world and you still see people making the same mistakes that Billy Beane fought against a little over a decade ago. Nonetheless, the movie, though long, was not boring at all and I think most people would enjoy watching it, even those who are not baseball fans. Ultimately I think that's something unique about this film. Yes, it is a sports movie but it isn't necessarily about the sport of baseball but rather one person's fight against the prehistoric culture of baseball.

","Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill create one of the best on-screen chemistry between two actors this year in Bennett Miller's fabulous sophomore effort Moneyball. Delving into and bringing a fresh take on a sports film, Miller along with writers Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, and Stan Chervin achieve a well balanced story full of laughs, drama, and heart. Pitt brings one of his best interpretations of a character to life hosing in on the insecurities while bleeding out the confidence and sure-fire wit. Hill delivers his best performance of his career and one of the most surprisingly brilliant turns this year. He even manages to steal scenes from co-star Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is just as good as ever, and have the viewer hone in on his wonderful acting portrayal. Miller's direction should be applauded and recognized as going just as ferociously and heavyhearted into this film as he did with his directorial debut, Capote. This is the best baseball film to hit the screens since Field of Dreams.<br/><br/>(***½)"
"TheUnknown837-1","5","3","4","5 October 2011"," Who knew that Steve Zaillian was capable of writing such an impersonal screenplay?
","When the Academy Award nominations are announced in January, there will be two people involved in Bennett Miller's ""Moneyball"" whom I will be rooting for. Not only that, but given the picture's late-year release and the Academy's habit of voting for fiscally successful pictures, I am sure that Brad Pitt will garner his third Academy Award nomination and that Jonah Hill will claim his first. The movie is certain to score big in the other categories as well, however, I must reserve my enthusiasm for Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill alone. For it was only through their great performances that any energy at all was built up. They are also due credit for the few great moments that nobly attempted to save the whole picture. The sad news is that, for me, ""Moneyball"" was an overly cynical exercise that did not bring up anything new about baseball or the people in it and left me feeling rather left-out.<br/><br/>Leaving Mr. Miller's adequate but unremarkable directing aside, the core fault of the picture revolves around a question I continued asking myself over and over again: Who knew that Steve Zaillain (the writer of ""American Gangster"" and ""Schindler's List"") was capable of putting together such an impersonal, non-involving screenplay?<br/><br/>I am usually a sucker for sports movies because of something that has been with the genre since the beginning: inspiration and heart. Remember, this is coming from the same reviewer who gleefully recommended ""Gridiron Gang"" five years ago. However, that uplifting and exciting trend is completely absent in Mr. Zaillian's screenplay, who substitutes moody cynicism in its place. Now of course, the movie is about what Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane did to assemble a team that would go on to hold a record winning streak and not so much about the game of baseball itself, but what it does show us in its behind-the-scenes stuff is rather downbeat. It starts out moody and ends moody. And while this is not necessarily a bad thing (and can be done wonderfully for dramatic effect) the effect here is overall limp and impersonal. Where Mr. Zaillian also fails is what has become his trademark: information. Compare the screenplay with ""Moneyball"" to his impeccable writing and bucket-loads of fascinating, hard-to-find information for ""Schindler's List"" and the contrast is staggering. We learned a lot about Oskar Schindler and the Holocaust in that great Spielberg film, but we learn very little about Billy Beane and the general managing of a baseball team that we could not learn from just picking up a newspaper or an almanac. Where is the dope? Where is the emotionally-gripping background plots? For that matter, what has become of the fascinating character dynamics? What little we get is between Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill, the former as general manager Billy Beane and the latter as his statistics assistant Peter Brand. Mr. Pitt has a daughter in the film, but there is no real chemistry between them, nothing that has not been seen done better in so many other, more confident films. Robin Wright, a charming actress, is given next to nothing to do as Mr. Pitt's ex-wife and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is merely something in the background, even though his role as the disgruntled A's coach is meant to be an important factor. And although the movie tackles the subject of the general manager having to trade off and let go of players, and tries to use this for dramatic effect, we learn so little about the players of the A's that they frankly could have been extras. That makes the introductory scene to one of them, where Mr. Pitt signs him onto the team, even more pointless than it already is.<br/><br/>Only one scene in ""Moneyball"" takes place in the rain, but you would never know it by the way Wally Pfister has photographed the images. Mr. Pfister has made his mark, and won his Oscar (for ""Inception"") by using low-key lighting and vast shadows. However, he overdoes it here. In fact, it's rather amateurish. Every shot in the picture looks as if no lights outside of the staged environment were used at all. It looks grainy, like something shot on a home video digital camera. At times, the shadows crossing Mr. Pitt's face as he ironically stands in sunlight threatens to guise the wonderful expressions he is generating for his performance. The only moment where the drabby lighting works is in a shot where Mr. Pitt is driving at night, at which point we can only see the outline of his face and the reflection of streetlights in his eyes. That is terrific. But the rest is so gloomily-shot it really becomes tiresome.<br/><br/>Mr. Zaillian's screenplay rambles on and on, but what it had to say was not so interesting that it deserved, I felt, so much attention. The movie clocks at a little over two hours in length and the second half of that seemed much longer than it really was. I must again commend the efforts of Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hill, who are so charismatic and so excellent in the film that they actually managed to produce some lively moments, especially early on in the film. But then, that's when they are being spontaneous. By the end of the movie, where they are just speaking in hushed voices, and the moodiness becomes sappily overwhelming, I was left to sigh over and over again in the auditorium. The movie has its moments, but I would be much happier seeing ""Remember the Titans"" for the umpteenth time than revisiting this coldy impersonal film."
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","4","6","5 February 2012"," The torch has been passed.
","Moneyball is a fine, diverting picture dealing with Oakland Athletic's GM Billy Beane. The film documents his successful attempt in 2002 to build a competitive baseball team with low-rent players. The film is a baseball fan's dream, and full of interesting characters and good writing. The main thing I noticed above everything else, however, is that the torch has officially been passed in American cinema. For years it was Robert Redford as the eternally handsome American leading man who got all the great parts, despite his often limited acting range. Now that Redford is too old for that distinction, Pitt has finally reached the point is his career where he can take the torch and run with it.<br/><br/>Perhaps on the set of Spy Game they even agreed on this transition. ""Brad,"" Robert may have said to him one morning outside their luxury trailers, ""one of these days it will be all you. I can't fool them forever. Just smile at the camera, let them give you enough back-light, find a cause or two, and you will be immortal."" ""Cool. That's heavy,"" Pitt would have replied. ""But do I have to have a cause? Can't I just hold a film festival in the mountains like you do each winter?"" ""No,"" Redford would have replied, sternly. ""Sundance will always be my gig. Maybe you can just find an attractive, yet creepy woman and help her adopt a bunch of racially diverse kids. That can be your cause."" ""Okay. Cool,"" Pitt replied. You get the picture. Anyway, Brad Pitt is now officially THAT GUY. He's the handsome leading man who can't really act, but doesn't necessarily need to. Clark Gable might have preceded Redford.<br/><br/>But as far as Moneyball goes, its good enough, but not great. I loved the cost cutting measures the Athletics use to fit within their meager budget. Having players actually pay for soda in their own locker room. Signing fossils like Dave Justice and having to put him out on banners since there are no real stars on the team. It also gives the players some nice human touches. Think of a journeyman like Scott Hatteburg. What do these guys do for money once all MLB teams are convinced you have nothing left to give the sport? They still have families to feed, but all of a sudden no means to do so. The film suffers from too many maudlin scenes of Pitt moping around or driving around depressed. The film needed to be more upbeat. Too much time spent on Pitt's family, too. But did you notice how he's beginning to feather his hair on the sides? He's even trying to look a little like Redford. But this film is no The Natural. 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","This film is about the general manager of a baseball team, who tries an unconventional statistical formula to pick his team.<br/><br/>In contrast to Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"", where they showed a football game for 30 minutes and make it a poignant emotional high, ""Moneyball"" does not achieve this same level of emotion at all. There is in fact no emotional zenith in ""Moneyball"". There are no motivational speeches, no players striving for excellence and no sign of ecstasy even when winning a record breaking streak. Instead, we only get to see Billy Beane looking lost and miserable the whole time. There is a serious lack of tension and engagement. ""Moneyball"" is way overrated in my opinion."

","Once again Hollywood reinvents history.<br/><br/>Search the 2002 Oakland A's. Compare that roster to the 2001. There are four, even five names that are almost completely absent from this script, which is why this is a terrible movie.<br/><br/>This flick makes you believe that the A's were successful due to the free agent signings, trades and other moves made by Beane and co. Makes you believe? Make believe is more like it.<br/><br/>Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson were NOWHERE in this film. Oakland had a run of four to six years where these three horsemen were dominant in the American League. Their minor league coaches AND SCOUTS developed these guys. Their starting rotation was POWERFUL.<br/><br/>And how did the A's replace Giambi? They did not replace him in the variables, through out the lineup. To be blunt, they didn't. And with Eric Chavez and Miguel Tejada batting 3, 4 they didn't really need to. Oh, and did I mention Mulder, Zito and Hudson?<br/><br/>I know the salary of the A's made a great headline but the truth is the A's were just in a baseball demographic where several talented young players all bloomed during the same period.<br/><br/>To suggest their success was due to Beane and their miser owner skimping on a few million here or there is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Oh, and the biggest joke of the movie was Brand dissing Johnny Damon. Did anyone watch ANY of the 2004 post season? I think he had a few hits in the 2007.<br/><br/>Overall this was a fun movie, I mean for a non fiction or just partially based on a true story.<br/><br/>But to tell this story, the way they did, in my opinion it should have been a little league tale.

"michaelj108","6","5","9","3 December 2011"," Too much Pitt, too little baseball
","I will comment first on the movie as a movie and then on sabermetrics.<br/><br/>The movie is a typical Hollywood ego picture for Brad Pitt, who is an Adonis to be sure, now if he could just change his smug expression once a while, when not looking into a mirror. Fortunately, the screenplay does not ask much of him. Fat Boy does the nerd-lifting, leaving Pitt free to spit, grin, punch telephones (which work faster if punched), pump iron, drive a gas guzzler, and other macho pursuits, though strangely no women. Fat Boy stares at the video, enters the data, runs the algorithms, produces the spread-sheets, and spouts the numbers. Evidently a Hollywood leading man cannot be seen reading data or studying a problem.<br/><br/>The screenplay sets up tensions that are painfully obvious and contrived and then abandoned, first with the scouts and then the manager. Neither of these is resolved, they simply drop out. A careful viewer will conclude some of the scouts resigned or were dismissed. But it is just guesswork. Likewise the manager, who looked painfully bored by the whole thing, is an obstacle and fades away.<br/><br/>Endowing Pitt's Beane with a double back-story is another Hollywood standard to keep the focus on the lead. The first back-story is Beane's own baseball career. The second is the ex-wife and daughter. Neither contributed to the storyline and both were poorly done, but they gratified the need to make Pitt into some kind of sympathetic hero, since his acting is not going to engage us. Sabermetrics got into baseball without need of these stale conventions.<br/><br/>In fact, Sabermetircs has been around a long time and there have been others in baseball who have taken an interest in it, including Beane's predecessor in Oakland. So Pitt's Beane was not the singular voice of reason presented here. Moreover, Sabermetics does not produce a single number as Fat Boy is made to say. It produces many, maybe too many, for most purposes. Specifically, On Base Percentage (OBP) is certainly important, but the film presents it as the absolute. As anyone of those scouts who are deprecated in the film would say, a team can put two runners on base every inning and never score. A few, clipped scenes where Beane and Fat Boy talk to players about specifics is good but not enough to balance the matter.<br/><br/>Sabermetrics has the most to offer strategically. It makes sense for a general manager to consider that kind of data. The essential difference between sabermetics and the orthodox baseball data is that the former factors in games won, whereas the latter are always isolated absolutes. A batting average, an RBI total are taken alone and out of context. There are batters with impressive averages and big RBI totals whose hits and runs batted in come in 11-0 routes, and never in 2-2 ties. At the end of the season they have big numbers.<br/><br/>Neither OBP nor RBI total are absolutes. As to OBP, since it is the focus of this movie to the extent it has focus apart from Adonis, tactically, to win a game it takes more than a high OBP or RBI total. In the bottom of the ninth, with one out and the tying run at third, a batter who gets a walk does not win the game. But maybe a batter who can hit a high, long fly ball for a sacrifice or maybe a batter who knows how to bunt, they can win the game. The skill set does come into the equation to produce those numbers and a naif watching the movie would never know that.<br/><br/>I will certainly concede that baseball has long been the most hidebound and inward looking of the professional sports. Professional basketball and football have been much more open to social and technological change than baseball since the year dot. Moreover, baseball has always been replete with numerical data which has been subjected to only the most primitive analysis, e.g., batting average, or earned run average. Making more use of the data available does make sense. But the movie hardly indicates how that is done. There was just too little baseball."

There seemed to be no real point to it, no real payoff, nothing. Once again, Pitt confirmed my earlier perception and he was always... him. An actor reciting a script in a movie that had no message aside from a new take on hiring players.

While there are interesting moments in the movie, like Billy Beane doing some fancy horse trading, I just never connected with this movie. Brad Pitt was rather bland and even though the script was co-written by Aaron Sorkin, I found the dialog flat. The story is interesting, but it seems to move so slowly; I think I would have been better off reading the book.<br/><br/>Sometimes a movie can be riveting even though its subject matter is unappealing, but this isn't one of those movies.

","Moneyball is the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland A's general manager, trying to compete against ""the big boys"" with a small budget team and no way to buy the players he needs. While visiting the Cleveland Indians' management trying to make deals for better players, he meets a young man on their staff who has devised a way to assign a numerical value to players based on their ability to get on base, rather than the more traditional ways that baseball players are rated. Instead of buying a player from the Indians, he hires the statistician and together they rebuild the A's team after the loss of three key players who move on to richer teams. Brad Pitt's performance is stellar; you forget that he's Brad Pitt and believe that he's Billy Beane, which is the true measure of a great actor. This is the best Brad Pitt has ever been in a roll, and he dominates every one of his scenes. Jonah Hill is excellent as the naive though brilliant statistician and Philip Seymour Hoffman shines as the team's head coach who butts heads with Beane time after time over the new way of staffing the team. People in the movie audience applauded when the A's won 20 games in a row; you could feel that the audience was totally ""there"" in the moment, because the actors make you believe you are seeing the true story of Billy Beane and the A's. Great movie, great acting, wonderful story that will keep you rooting for the A's even if you're a die-hard Yankee fan like myself."

","For many, many years I, along with a lot of other baseball fans, whined about ownership that didn't spend the kind of money the New York Yankees were spending on the best players in baseball. As the 2001 season was coming to a close, the Oakland Athletics were faced with the reality that the teams three best players were going to leave the team via free agency. Billy Beane, the team's General Manager, was tasked with putting together a competitive team without significantly increasing the team's payroll. Moneyball, based on the bestselling novel Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game written by Michael Lewis, begins at the end of that 2001 baseball season; the end coming for the Athletics and their payroll of $33,810,750 in the American League Division Series against the New York Yankees and their $109,791,893 payroll.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, in Director Bennett Miller's film. Using a screenplay co-written by Oscar Winner Aaron Sorkin, Bennett turns what could have been strictly a baseball movie into the study of one man's character and desire to put together a winning team. Pitt's Beane is compelling as a baseball mind, realizing that in order to compete using the means he's been given, he must approach the game from an altogether different perspective. Pitt delivers on all fronts as Beane; showing the human side of the game, such as when he goes out to offer a contract to a player that's been injured. He also shows that torment that goes along with having to deal with ownership. Most importantly, he shows that sometimes change can make a difference. Jonah Hill, as Peter Brand, is the main cog in convincing Beane that the old way of scouting is no longer the best way. Hill, not his usually hysterical self, plays Brand very professionally. There are a few scenes that cause the viewer to laugh, but it's the dialogue as scripted that's funny and not just the delivery of lines for the purpose of adding humor to the film. Without a doubt, this is Hill's most serious performance to date; and he excels in the role. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is perfectly cast as the manger of the team Art Howe. Seymour Hoffman's ability to express the anger and frustration of a man put in a no win situation is so convincing that I could not foresee another person playing the part. <br/><br/>A movie that easily could have gotten bogged down with too much baseball action, or brimming with statistics or Sabermetrics, to be more specific, does a fine job of intertwining all of that with excellent story telling. You don't have to be a fan of baseball to follow or understand what's happening.

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>I have never been a baseball fan. The game bores me completely and I always found it to be a money-grubbing sport, even though it's still considered America's favorite past-time. The 1994 -95 Major League Baseball strike put the final kibosh on the sport for me. So I went to see the critically lauded sports film Moneyball with some bias and trepidation. Though it did not reinforce my love of the game, it did prove my initial response to be wholly accurate. And the film scores big-time, even though the subject matter still bored me sporadically.<br/><br/>They say money can't buy you happiness, but it sure as hell can buy you a winning team. Or so Billy Beane ( Brad Pitt ), manager of one of the lowest paying team, the Oakland Athletics, believes, as he finds himself battling the odds with his players against those damn Yankees and other pro teams. <br/><br/>Billy builds a strong winning team only to have his best players hired out from under him. Enter the nerd, Peter Brand ( Jonah Hill ), baseball statistician and Yale graduate, with a plan for the Oakland A's and Billy to succeed. But it's the team manager, a gruff and unbelieving Art Howe ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman ) that doesn't hold kindly to the Ivy Leaguer and his aggravating boss interfering in the Major League business of baseball championships.<br/><br/>The dry subject of statistical analysis of baseball players and their point averages may weigh heavily with your enjoyment of this film, but Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin take this nominal and unexciting premise and run with it with their literate and expertly written screenplay. Although they may not totally succeed in their exposition and narrative clarity of the numerical plan that Beane and Brand hatch, they wisely give much screen time to Billy and his witty banter with Peter, plus show his paternal side with his loving daughter ( a charismatic Kerris Dorsey ) to full effect.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller's use of baseball montages and statical numbers as graphic images delivers a nice visual look to the film. The director also assembles a crackerjack A-team of players. Leading the cast is Brad Pitt who adds to his impressive resume with another heartfelt performance. Ecstatically and statistically speaking, this actor's average as a major talent grows with every film he chooses lately. Hill has never been more appealing as his nebbish of a business partner. Especially strong is Hoffman as Billy's doubting nemesis. More screen time and further scenes of conflict with this fine actor and Pitt would have only enhanced this fine film even more.<br/><br/>Moneyball triumphs with its behind the scenes look at baseball and its quick-witted dialog and vivid characters. As previously mentioned, I still don't have a love of the game, nor did I love this film, but I did love the masterful performance of Brad Pitt and his fellow acting pros.

"RolyRoly","8","5","10","14 September 2011"," The business of baseball
","There is no question that Moneyball should immediately be elevated to the already crowded upper echelon of baseball movies, but it is really more about business than it is about sport. The storyline is already familiar, and the good thing about it being, as they say, ""based on a true story"" is that we are spared a Hollywood ending in the form of a 7th game, extra innings victory in the World Series.<br/><br/>Moneyball is a classy production from start to finish. The script is tightly written, the casting is impeccable and the direction is slick and largely unobtrusive. Brad Pitt is competent in a role that doesn't demand too much of an actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman looks every inch (or pound) an old school baseball manager in his exasperated attempt to impose the ""right way"" of doing things on the hapless misfits he has been given to lead into battle. Stephen Bishop is a remarkably fine David Justice, the former superstar trying to come to terms with the vagaries of ageing and fading acclaim. The real star, though, is Jonah Hill, who, as a precocious young math whiz, and an Ivy League grad to boot, is a fish almost completely out of water amongst the cynical old guard of the baseball world.<br/><br/>It is a fine film, to be sure, but if there is any justice come Oscar time then at least two other films which were also featured this week in Toronto, The Descendants and The Artist, should be the front runners for best picture."

","How did they ever make a movie of ""Moneyball?"" The famous Michael Lewis book is not a human-interest story so much as a sabermetric-centered theoretical treatise on how a small-market baseball club found a way to win by blowing up the game.<br/><br/>The answer: Throw us a big star, a couple of name screenwriters, and not much in the way of a working plot.<br/><br/>As the 2002 Major League season begins, the Oakland Athletics find themselves ""gutted"" of their best players. They can't afford any big free agents, so general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) takes a fresh approach that challenges conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>""If we play like the Yankees in here, we will lose to the Yankees out there,"" Beane tells his skeptical brain trust of codgers and malcontents.<br/><br/>Having read ""Moneyball,"" and enjoyed it, I see how scripters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, and director Bennett Miller, tried to make a movie of it: By ramping up conflict wherever they could find or invent it, and pushing sentiment in a occasionally effective but often manipulative way that put me in mind of ""Field Of Dreams"" or ""Terms Of Endearment."" Bad guys are clearly defined as people who don't see things Beane's way, while much of the emotional ballast is carried in Gunga Din fashion by little Kerris Dorsey, who plays Beane's daughter Casey, and if there is justice in life if not baseball, will find better films in a long and happy future.<br/><br/>I really like Pitt in this movie, too. He wears his signature cool with quiet authority, earning your interest in his deft handling of whip-smart lines and supporting players. He and Jonah Hill as a Yale graduate Beane takes on as his deputy do a lot to make otherwise clunky exposition scenes work.<br/><br/>The film also scores with the few scenes it shows of the various players, ""misfit toys"" as Hill's character dubs them, who find themselves hired by the A's because of their undervalued ability to get on base and avoid making outs. Stephen Bishop plays aging hotshot David Justice with appropriate swagger, while Chris Pratt brings likability and humor to the character of struggling first baseman Scott Hatteberg.<br/><br/>There's a lot of fine talent in front of and behind the camera. They just aren't always put to good use. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe with such a put-upon mien that I was surprised to learn the actor lobbied for the part. The point of Howe is that he sees Beane as the enemy, and acts accordingly, but given Hoffman's talent, it's a shame to see him so ill-used in his handful of scenes. I get that Howe didn't see things Beane's way, but could the script given Howe more to do, or say, rather than just look discomfited?<br/><br/>The most ridiculous scene in this regard shows Beane firing his head scout Grady (Ken Medlock) after a nasty confrontation. Medlock plays the role so nasty it's no wonder the guy's always decked out in black when we see him.<br/><br/>The film also lacks for a satisfying close. The A's did well in 2002, but didn't make it to the World Series, so much of the story centers on a winning streak. Here, the makers push all the buttons but, as Beane makes clear, the end result is meaningless in terms of what he wants to do. So we get a second, strained ending involving Beane's talent being recognized by a rival club. Here as elsewhere we get a lot of close-ups of Pitt, but little idea what makes him tick beyond flashbacks to his unhappy playing days which are the film's weakest moments.<br/><br/>I guess if you follow baseball at all, you already know how this ends. I did, but I don't think that affected my reason for not caring. ""Moneyball"" has its moments, but it doesn't really justify its existence by offering satisfying drama or interesting characters. It just puts quality actors through the motions, and left me a bit empty."
"FlushingCaps","4","3","5","17 November 2013"," Unlikeable people plus little baseball make this a bore
","I watched this on TV finally in November 2013. I am puzzled why anyone thinks highly of this dull film with no likable characters. The film shows how the Oakland Athletics ) won a division title in 2002, despite losing three star players after 2001. It focuses almost solely on general manager Billy Beane, (Brad Pitt) and his new assistant, a fictional character named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill). It is presented that Peter's chief contribution is letting Beane know that on-base average is the best way to judge the value of players.<br/><br/>One night the club is going for the American League record of 20 straight wins, Beane is out driving to Visalia to see their minor league club. I guess we aren't supposed to know it is a 4-hour drive, because the A's are playing a night game when Billy decides to turn back to see the A's game instead. I should imagine it unlikely the Visalia club to have a game scheduled for midnight, so why was he driving there at that time of night to see the minor leaguers? <br/><br/>My chief criticism of the film is they make Beane out to be rather hostile, almost rude, to virtually everyone around him. I hope the real Billy Beane doesn't behave like the movie Beane. There is one scene of Beane and his ex-wife and her new husband. For no apparent reason, Beane treats the new husband rather shabbily. I wonder why they included this scene since there was no follow-up to it, no other scene dealing with any aspect of his broken marriage. Nor was there any hint that in real life, Beane had a new wife himself. They throw in 2 or 3 scenes of him being nice to his teenage daughter. Since the film was almost totally about his work life, they would have been wise to leave out the small bits with the daughter altogether.<br/><br/>Just like Billy and Peter, none of the players have any character development. Unlike the stars, the players are quite minor characters.<br/><br/>As a baseball fan, I thought it laughable that Billy flies from California to Cleveland just to talk to the Cleveland GM about making a trade for a little-used relief pitcher. That was to set up Beane noticing Peter, leading to him being hired by Beane.<br/><br/>Another laugh came when the two were together in Beane's office and Peter tells Beane that the left-handed reliever he wants to get from Cleveland, could only be wanted by 1 other club—San Francisco. Beane immediately phones the Giants and engineers a quick trade to get them another lefty reliever, so Cleveland will have to trade the guy to Billy. I dare say that a good left-handed reliever would in any season be desired by more than one or two clubs.<br/><br/>The film tries so hard to make it seem like this new strategy of Beane's—look for high on-base average players, disdain bunting and stealing—he tells them at one point that they should never bunt, leads to Oakland winning the division in 2002. Facts are they bunted for sacrifices 25 times in 2001, 20 times in 2002. The did cut down their stolen bases from 68 to 46, but considering the center fielder they lost, Johnny Damon had stolen 27 himself in 2001, and he was replaced someone who stole only 4, the lower stolen base figure must surely be attributed to that more than anything to do with strategy. It was interesting to hear Peter telling Billy early on that he didn't want Johnny Damon, that it was good for Oakland he was gone. Many people in the game consider Damon's play huge in helping the Red Sox win the World Series two years later, and later helping the Yankees to their only post-2000 World Series title to date. The A's have one post-season series win since 1993, and haven't won 100+ in any season since 2002.<br/><br/>I know the A's really relied on more than OBA, but that one stat cited in the film as being key makes it worth noting that the club On-Base Average in 2001 was .345, and in 2002 it dropped to .339. Their runs scored dropped from 884 to 800. I found it troubling that the real hitting stars of the A's, Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, each of whom drove in over 100 runs are not featured at all.<br/><br/>More significantly, the key role of the pitching staff was totally ignored. The only scene featuring a pitcher, was Chad Bradford, who like a grateful kid approached Beane at the start of the 2002 season and thanked him for being the first one to give him a chance. This was rather weird in two ways. First, Bradford not only had pitched in 44 games over three seasons with the White Sox, but had worked 35 games in 2001 for Oakland. It's true he worked more in 2002, but he hardly would have known about getting a bigger chance before the season started. The other thing that was weird was the way Beane reacted. He couldn't wait to walk on past Bradford, almost like the ""Go away boy, you bother me,"" notion of W.C. Fields.<br/><br/>Even though I knew the A's haven't reached a World Series since 1990, how they've stayed competitive, which they indeed have, seemed like a good idea for a movie. But Beane seemed like such a jerk who doesn't know how to talk to people nicely. Peter had almost no character other than a guy who quickly comes up with numbers. And no other person's character was explored in any way. So we got not character development AND almost no baseball action other than what took the place of the old newspaper headlines in movies from decades ago. All we're left with is some people talking about the fortunes of a baseball team during one season, plus a few random highlights."

","Baseball is the sport to follow if you love numbers. Almost every aspect of the game can be and is quantified by a percentage which both ball clubs and fans use to rank players. The science of ranking players using particular categories, specifically on base percentage, is the foundation for an analysis program known as sabermetrics. Moneyball never uses this term, but that is what they are talking about. <br/><br/>Moneyball tells the story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season. At the end of 2001, the A's lost the divisional playoff series to the Yankees and then their three superstars left for free agency. Compared to the Yankees and the vast majority of the rest of Major League Baseball teams, the Oakland A's were poor. They could not compete with the other clubs to put well known impact players on their roster. General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) pleaded with his scouts to come up with a new way to identify players instead of the usual way it had been done for the past hundred years or so, mostly gut instinct and the usual power numbers. <br/><br/>While in Cleveland on a bartering trip to replace the holes in his lineup, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a low level player analyst, who has some unconventional ideas about what it really takes to win games. To win games, you have to produce runs. To produce runs, you have to get on base, be it with hits or walks. Scouts and baseball crowds prefer hits since they are far more sexy than walks; however, they are one in the same to Peter Brand and Billy Beane quickly becomes an acolyte to this new way of thinking. Shifting focus to the most undervalued players in baseball, Oakland starts signing guys who are considered too old, sub-par fielders, and unimpressive at the plate. Not only does the scouting staff start to revolt, but the coach, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) looks at Billy and his methods like they are from Mars.<br/><br/>Sabermetrics was not new in 2002, but no ball club ever put a team together using mostly stats before. Everybody expected them to lose, be at the cellar of their division, and for Billy to be fired at the end of the season. However, the 2002 season went in a different direction and produced some profound ripple effects throughout the rest of the league and how teams valued players afterwards. Moneyball is definitely a film for baseball fans and stat geeks. However, if you are not into baseball, you most likely will not enjoy Moneyball very much. There is limited on field action and a lot of detailed conversations about baseball methods with its corresponding jargon.<br/><br/>Moneyball is based on a 2004 book and is advertised as the true story of what happened in that 2002 season; however, there are a lot of dramatizations and changes. First of all, there is no Peter Brand in real life. In fact, Billy's Assistant General Manager joined the team in 1999 and was named Paul DePodesta. Mr. DePodesta did not like how they wrote his character in the script and asked that his name be changed. He argues that he was not only focused on statistics to shape the team. <br/><br/>I desperately wanted Moneyball to be an amazing film. I love baseball and I really enjoy reading and talking about baseball stats. Unfortunately, Moneyball is not a great movie, it is just OK. It lacks a certain weight and depth. Early scenes between Pitt and Hill could have been much deeper concerning their ideas to change the way the game is played, but they are light and choppy. Peter Brand never really gets a long monologue to explain just how his ideas could create a winning team from start to finish. Furthermore, the character of Coach Howe is ridiculous. Philip Seymour Hoffman spends his very limited screen time hurling out one word guttural answers and just looks ill. I know he was meant to disagree with the way the team was headed, but why make him look deathly pale and on the verge of a nervous breakdown? <br/><br/>See Moneyball if you are a baseball fan; you will enjoy the behind the scenes look at the scouting meetings and the shenanigans which go on at the trade deadline. However, be prepared for a light fiction film which can stray pretty far from what really happened that year."

","The first baseball game I ever saw was in Yankee Stadium when I was ten years old. At that time, the Yankees had players now considered baseball immortals: Phil Rizzuto, Joe Dimaggio, Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller, and others. The Yankees closer was Joe Page who, when summoned into a game, always climbed over the bullpen gate like a little boy, awestruck with wonder. All were products of the traditional scouting system, operating without the benefit of knowing a player's slugging percentage, on-base percentage, or a pitcher's WAR (wins above replacement). Scouts had to recommend players based on past performance, personal observation, and something intangible - their best sense of who would and who would not make it in the major leagues. . Those days are past, however, and today every team uses a computerized analysis of a player's value called ""sabermetrics,"" which is supposed to provide information such as how often a player will get on base. This new approach is dramatized in Bennett Miller's Moneyball, an entertaining and often moving film that may be an early contender for an Oscar Best Picture nomination. Adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin from the book ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, the film stars the charismatic Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, a former player who became the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics in 1998, and who changed the game forever. <br/><br/>Using authentic recreations as well as archival footage, Moneyball opens in 2002, one year after the Oakland Athletics were eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Yankees. As GM, Beane has the daunting task of replacing three of his key players, including Johnny Damon and Jason Giambi, who signed with Boston and New York. In flashbacks, we learn that the young Billy Beane (Reed Thompson) was heralded by scouts as a ""five-tool"" player who signed him out of high school in 1979, convincing him to give up a full scholarship to Stanford to play for the New York Mets. The scouts guessed wrong on this one and, after a brief and unsuccessful career as a player, he turned to scouting and then management.<br/><br/>Perhaps bitter about his history with scouts, he now chides his scouting staff for their efforts to find bargain replacements for his departed stars, and makes a plea to ownership for more money. Things take a sharp turn, however, when Beane has a chance meeting with Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an Economics graduate from Yale University, who is working for the Cleveland Indians. Brand is a disciple of Bill James, the man who developed sabermetrics and who had come to believe that a player's ability to get on base (on-base percentage) through a combination of hits and walks was more important to the team than just his batting average. <br/><br/>After Brand tells Beane that there's ""an epidemic failure to understand what is really happening"" in the game, Beane snatches him away from the Indians and appoints him as his personal assistant. Together, they use statistical analysis to seek out players whose value to other teams may have diminished, and who are now available at a lower price. Beane immediately receives strong opposition from his manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a veteran who is also upset about his one-year contract, and some flack from his chief scout Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock), who feels threatened by the new approach and considers it detrimental to baseball. <br/><br/>Beane is depicted in the film as being volatile and aloof, unwilling to travel with the team for fear of becoming too close to the players. In spite of his cold exterior, however, the scenes with his ex-wife (Robin Wright), and his musically-talented teenage daughter (Kerris Dorsey) show him to be a warm and caring person. The game of baseball is his passion and, even when his team goes on a record breaking winning streak in 2002, he maintains that nothing matters to him except winning the final game and that his real goal is to change the way teams are constructed. <br/><br/>Supported by outstanding performances, especially those of Pitt and Hill, Moneyball stays away from sports clichés and always feels fresh and alive. Today, nine years after 2002, the year in which the film is set, sabermetrics has become an accepted part of the game. Unfortunately, however, in the same way that the quality of a film has become less important to the studios than its appeal to target audiences, baseball teams may have become too reliant on statistical analysis. While it can never completely reinvent the game, it extends its reach today, not only in the recruitment of players, but also in day-to-day decision-making where ""playing the percentages"" often trumps common sense. <br/><br/>Though statistics are useful as a tool, baseball will never be a science. It is a game of measureless intangibles, of emotion and desire, of late inning heroics and dramatic comebacks. Unscripted and unpredictable, it is a game of grace and skill, ""a ballet without music, a drama without words."" To a ten-year-old, ""the stuff as dreams are made on."" The poet Wordsworth asked, ""Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"" It is still there and will always be, but, perhaps like contemporary society, the scientist and the artist are struggling for its soul."
"Reel_starz","8","4","8","29 September 2011"," Brad Pitt and co. get the job done
","For a movie where the most memorable line is ""How can you not be romantic about baseball?"", Moneyball is surprisingly unsentimental. Granted, it features its fair share of rousing montages, some glossy cinematography courtesy of Inception's Wally Pfister and a quietly wistful score, but – and this should be made very clear to prospective viewers – it's not your typical, inspirational sports flick.<br/><br/>Then again, Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics didn't exactly conform to the typical underdog narrative. After suffering a tough loss to the New York Yankees that eliminated them from the playoffs and losing their three star players, the A's began to drastically rebuild their team by putting numbers and stats over perceived star power, hoping to compete with their better-budgeted rivals by taking players that, for various reasons, were undervalued by others. They went on to win their division in a year highlighted by a record-making, 20 game win streak, only to be defeated, once again, in the early postseason. Not quite a storybook ending. Director Bennett Miller and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who reworked a script by Steve Zaillain, are bold enough to not sugarcoat or ignore this anticlimactic finish (in one scene, Beane contends that a failure to win the World Series would mean all of their hard work has been wasted); fortunately, they're also savvy enough to pull it off. This risk represents one of many elements of Moneyball, from Brad Pitt's comically short and to-the-point take on the traditional locker room motivational speech to emotional moments that are understated rather than melodramatic and grand, that transcend or avoid the clichés that usually plague the genre. The film-makers care about telling the story they've been given instead of tweaking it to make it more crowd-pleasing. The result is an effervescent and keenly observed portrait, imbued with nostalgia and optimism in equal measure, of America's Favorite Pastime.<br/><br/>In another daring move, Moneyball takes viewers off the field and focuses the majority of the action behind-the-scenes, largely confining the actual games to effective and well-edited montages that intercut real footage, both visual and audio, with recreations. The business side of baseball has rarely been portrayed on film in great detail, and such subject material could easily have led to a dull, textbook-dry movie. Enter Aaron Sorkin. Though his dialogue here isn't as knock-you-down, 99 mph-fastball quick as in The Social Network, it still zips along effortlessly, drawing both humor and drama out of situations where you'd expect to see neither. He avoids sentimentality and leaves room for audiences to judge the events and the characters for themselves.<br/><br/>Still, the indisputable MVP is Brad Pitt. Over the years, he's proved himself to be much more than a pretty face, tackling challenging, complex and (usually) supporting roles when he could have simply coasted on his heartthrob status, and 2011's combined one-two punch of The Tree of Life and, now, Moneyball can only further cement his reputation as one of those rare actors with star power and talent in equal measure. In arguably the best lead performance of his career, Pitt portrays Billy Beane as flawed and decidedly human, a pleasant contrast to the bigger-than-life, almost saintly geniuses that frequently dominate sports movies. Outwardly, he's competitive, shrewd and stubborn almost to the point of arrogance, a forceful and assertive presence in the A's organization, but on the inside, he's plagued by doubts (what if this gamble doesn't work the way he'd imagined?) and regrets (he passed on Stanford to sign with the New York Mets only to crash and burn as a player at the major league level). He's a caring father to his 12 year old daughter, Casey, played with surprising aplomb and believability by Kerris Dorsey, but a divorce from her mother (Robin Wright, in a role that could've been filled by an extra) suggests that his personal life has seen its share of bumps along the way. Pitt sinks into this character with verve, and there isn't a moment when his performance feels unnatural or actor-ly. It's a work of subtlety, perhaps too quiet to earn him the Oscar attention many have started talking him up for, but worthy of notice nonetheless.<br/><br/>Also deserving of a shout-out is Jonah Hill who plays it straight to admirable results, while also garnering some deadpan laughs. As Peter Brand, a fill-in for the real-life Paul DePodesta, who gives Beane the idea to run his team using sabermetrics and subsequently becomes an assistant to the general manager for the A's, Hill provides an ideal nerdy but not socially-inept (thank God) foil to Pitt's more boisterous jock.<br/><br/>As a huge baseball fan (Nats and/or Rangers, anyone?), I went into Moneyball with mixed expectations. What I wanted was a tribute to baseball, an homage, if you will, that captures the complexity of the game, the constantly simmering tension, the exhilaration and feeling of unity and camaraderie that has me and other die-hards hooked. However, the possibility that it would actually accomplish this seemed dim. It seems fair to say that baseball's glory has faded a bit. America no longer seems as infatuated with the sport as in decades past, and Hollywood has been no different. The last well-received baseball movie was The Rookie in 2002. Since then, any offerings, let alone good ones, have been few and far in between. Also mixed in with that hope and skepticism was the fear that I'd get too caught up in noticing minor inaccuracies and technicalities to truly appreciate the movie, though had it been genuinely not good, that would've been a different story. It's a testament to the quality of Bennett Miller's film that, at some point pretty early on, my critical eye relaxed and I allowed myself to get caught up in the tale of Billy Beane and the Oakland A's. The fussing and nitpicking can be left to the real experts. It wasn't perfect, but I had a blast nonetheless."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","8","24 September 2011"," The Metaphor
","Leaning over an introspective Brad Pitt as Billy Beane confesses to his assistant GM Peter played by Jonah Hill, "" It doesn't mean anything."" Pitt's Billy frames the context if his Oakland A's don't win it all. In the Big Picture, Billy gets it. And so does Director Bennett Miller in ""Moneyball"". Steven Zaillian (""Searching for Bobby Fisher"", ""Schindler's List"") and Alan Sorkin (""The Social Network"") wrote the screenplay based on Michael Lewis's book, ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"". Bennett's ""Moneyball"" is about altering the way people think, and the genesis of leadership and greatness. ""Moneyball"" is one of the best movies of the year. Brad Pitt is awesome.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" recalls the story of the 2002 Oakland A's and their record breaking 20 game win streak, following the gutting of the team due to superstar free agency. The joke is that the A's much like other small venue franchises have become farm teams to the Yankee's, who have a $100 million plus payroll. Unlike other professional sports, the baseball salary cap void is indicative of Lewis's book's title. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's GM Billy Beane, who was supposed to be baseball's next superstar when recruited back in 1979. Zaillian and Sorkin delicately weave that narrative thread, and Pitt eloquently evokes the regret of unrealized possibility. What makes ""Moneyball"" so amazing is that it is more than just a baseball movie. Bennett subtly cops to this at the movie's catharsis when Pitt says to Hill, ""I get the metaphor."" It is about the romance of the game, about forging the greatness in people.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" works because of Brad Pitt. What is refreshing is that he isn't asked to play unattractive here to be taken seriously. In fact he looks great and incredibly lean and fit, at his charming best. Pitt is amazing in communicating in his silence, whether he turning his back to the camera or in one scene as his eyes glaze over as his scouting staff discards a potential prospect, because he has an ugly girl friend—obviously has low confidence. In a radical move Pitt's Billy hires Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) as his assistant, after discerning his critical acumen in a negotiation. Hill lands perfectly with Peter's humble genius and earnestness. Peter is a Yale graduate with a degree in Economics. Peter's revolutionary paradigm is that in baseball you don't buy superstars, you buy wins. More specifically, you buy runs, hits, and walks. Given the $38 million salary of the A's, you are literally creating a team of ""misfit toys"". Peter's brilliance lies in analyzing the statistics and getting the undervalued talent. Pitt and Hill have amazing chemistry. They are funny together, and their underlying bond is respect. This is part of the touching humanity of ""Moneyball"".<br/><br/>The other humanizing relationship is Billy with his young daughter Casey (wonderful Kerris Dorsey). Dorsey is the authentic shy teenager. She lives with her Mom, Billy's ex played by Robin Wright. Pitt has a natural fatherly partnership with Dorsey. Pitt has a beguiling charisma that is never overshadowed by kids. Together as Casey sings Billy the song she wrote for him, unpredictable movie magic emerges.<br/><br/>What I found so inspiring about ""Moneyball"": its soul is about reclaiming one's innate greatness. Billy and Peter acquire 37 year-old David Justice (commanding Stephen Bishop) in the twilight of his career. Pitt has a come to Jesus meeting with the aging superstar. Billy points out that Cleveland was willing to pay half his salary for him to play elsewhere. He admits to Justice that he is also gone if this experiment in Oakland is a bust. Pitt looks him in the eye and says, ""Be a leader."" This is just awesome stuff. Leaders generate other leaders, and alter the way we view the world. Pitt is amazing. He is uncompromising in his passion and humanity, and he delivers with humor and heart. This is a wonderfully scripted movie by Zaillian and Sorkin. Director Bennett elicits authentic performances from his impeccable cast. On the surface ""Moneyball"" maybe about getting things on the cheap, but it is really about seeing the best in people. ""Moneyball"" is more than just about baseball, it's about life. ""Moneyball"" is one the best movies of the year."

"robin_dhanju-1","Null","5","11","23 September 2011"," A Total Bore, Even to an Avid Baseball Fan
","First and foremost, I want everyone to know that I love baseball and I do understand the intricacies associated with the game, and the fact that the A's were competing with a payroll of 1/3rd of the Yankees is very significant. However, I found the story line to be extremely slow, and boring. <br/><br/>I came into this movie totally hyped up and excited about a baseball movie after way too long of a wait. I went to a matinée with only about 20 other people there to watch the movie on opening day (I know it was early but 20 is very low). Most of them seemed like avid fans as well, judging by their giggles at some of the jokes (very few) in the movie. The first thirty minutes were O.K., as it was meant to build the story line and introduce the characters. That was understandable, what was not, was the fact that the story didn't capture my attention any more throughout the the next one hour or so. I believe that the movie touched upon three players, mostly the first basemen and their transition to becoming an Athletic. I also felt that the movie focused way to much on Brad Pitt and Billy Beane, and I understand that he is the GM that revolutionized the game, but the character development really didn't reach a climax. Billy Beane had the same attitude towards baseball, and his life in general, as he did in the start. And the two hours that it took to get to that point really didn't accomplish much. I also felt that the climax of the movie was VERY rushed, it was condensed into 15 minutes that really didn't have me very interested, rather had me thinking to myself ""what the hell just happened"".<br/><br/>Overall, I believe the movie was a total let down, and even Brad Pitt's and Jonah Hill's presence isn't enough to keep baseball fans (let alone casual viewers) interested. I am going to be generous and give this film 5 stars out of 10, although I hope I could get those wasted two hours back of my life, to do something meaningful, like watching ""Major League""."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","3","31 December 2019"," Moneyball-management or the odd ways to beat sports odds...
","""Moneyball"", directed by Bennett Miller, respects the viewer's intelligence so much it elicits a rather unexpected non-emotional response towards sport. Sure it's one of these movies that are more about the business than the game and one thing for sure, the way odds never work as we expect is part of sports' beauty; still, the film isn't concerned about the beauty of the game.<br/><br/>First, I'm not American, so although I've seen countless movies about baseball, the game is still total mystery for me. However, I know one thing or two about the laws of odds when it comes to sport and the particular mechanisms of sport business to understand the following: just because something is logical on the paper doesn't make it bound to happen on the field. Let's take an example in a sport I know a little better: football, or as Americans call it: soccer.<br/><br/>Real Madrid had all the best players in the early 2000s: Zidane, Beckham, Figo and Raul to name these, it was their best team on the paper and yet from 2002 to 2006, before the Barça got Leo Messi, they didn't win the Spanish championship and they had to wait a whole decade before winning the Champions' League. Once again, all the boxes were ticked talent-wise but something was lacking in another department. And then they had Zidane as a coach for less than five years and they won the League four times, including a winning streak of three, a record. It couldn't be luck, it couldn't be the sole presence of Ronaldo who was there for at least five years before the first win, but something did catalyze his talent as well as the other players.<br/><br/>This example proves that sports obey to certain rules that are less about reuniting than managing talents together and sometimes, winning isn't made of having the best players by any means but by getting the best game from any players. Because even a Real fan would admit that the Barça had the best team. So it's not just a matter of being the best and if you get that, you'll get ""Moneyball"", a film that relates the 2001 2002 season when the Oakland A's beat the odds and broke a record of 20 consecutive victories thanks to a new unorthodox approach from the manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his right-hand man, Peter Brand, a nerdy expert in statistics played by Jonah Hill (both will be Oscar-nominated for their performances).<br/><br/>The duo defies the traditional scouting methods (consisting on picking the players with the best ratio of financial accessibility and ratings) through a new statistical approach of the game based on Excel tables and a meticulous examination of past results and combined percentages. So they manage to form an unlikely dream-team with players who were constantly overlooked, including some who never dreamed to play again. The core-idea is that at the right time with the right combination of factors, any team can win,;it all comes down to create these factors... and convince the no-nonsense coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to let the players play.<br/><br/>It takes a while to make this ""omelet"" of victory and of course, it doesn't go without breaking a few eggs, and a few egos. Among the many things Brand learns about the business is to tell a player that they let him ""go"" and the quicker he gets to the point, the better... nothing personal and strictly business. The catch of that (no pun intended) is that everything works like a business and makes Beane's situation antithetic to a certain vision of sports. The film gives us a few hints about his youth when he was a 'natural' (à la Redford) who had all the makings of a champion, who abandoned school to be a professional and for some reason, never really took off and became an infamous casting error.<br/><br/>Beane's paradox is that he had personal reasons to make his team win, he wants to matter for baseball and yet the methods he pulls are so mathematical, so rigorous that he reminds me of that quote about Ace Rothstein in ""Casino"" : ""he was so serious about it all that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself"" And that might be the irony of Beane, he takes the business so damn seriously that he seems dispassionate about the 'playing', only the outcome matters. It says a lot that he doesn't even watch the games. Pitt plays a paradoxical character whose hate for loss is stronger than his love for the game, which makes all the victories feel good and gratifying but not quite emotionally rewarding.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" was written by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillan and you can feel both the cold/methodical approach and the human/character study touch, at the end, we have someone so serious about his job he doesn't enjoy it a bit. And Pitt has a way to play these characters who seem detached even from things they supposedly enjoy; that he's divorced doesn't even surprise... if he handled his marriage with Robin Wright like he did with baseball. At the end, the only person who seems to bring genuine love and fun is his daughter (Kerry Dorsey), which shows the only facet of his life that isn't made of regrets and dreams of revenge.<br/><br/>Now, the film is based on a true story, which means it couldn't afford a different ending, but talk about irony in the end, we don't get the limits of Beane's approach of victory, but of ""personal"" victory, as an individual, not a manager. In fact, the ending proves him both right and wrong, and remind that just because you get the recipe doesn't make you a good cook for all that, and after all, even Zidane is struggling right now with Real Madrid.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" addresses audiences used to sports archetypes to better subvert them and through its philosophy of winning, it manages to create a rather uninspiring and depressing movie about underdogs, which is quite an achievement story-wise."

I am so glad that it was mentioned in a recorded seminar on screenplays, as it is well worth anyone´s time. In fact, it is hardly about baseball at all. Brad Pitt does an excellent job, as do Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP). The primary focus is on overcoming odds and being willing to take risks in pursuit of one´s dreams. Along the way is a convincing portrayal of how bold thinking is always rejected as crazy by conformists. Without being preachy or didactic, the film offers much bigger lessons, applicable to human life in general.

They sign a catcher (Chris Pratt) who can't throw, an outfielder (Nick Porrazzo) with an iron glove, a ""has been"" with bad knees (Stephen Bishop), and a pitcher (Casey Bond) who throws underhand.

The movie is interrupted by flash backs in Billy Beane's baseball player career, and his present home life.

","I have no affinity to Baseball as a sport, I'm British you see. I tried to get in to it when British cable networks began showing it, but it never grabbed me. My only contribution to any conversation about the sport is that I support The Cleveland Indians because of the film Major League, a film that continues to make me laugh to this day.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by Moneyball, synopsis tantalisingly offering up a sports success story based on an improbable blend of maths (something I hate with a passion), guile and perceived misfits as a team. Sure enough, after viewing Moneyball it has landed joyously onto a personal favourites list.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, when digging into the actual facts of the Oakland Athletics 2002 season at the core of the story, I found truths stretched, some character portrayals toyed with, and omissions to round out a better story. But crucially, the key element here is the moulding of a team for what in Baseball parlance is financial peanuts. This makes their 20 game wining run as being an outstanding achievement.<br/><br/>The mathematical aspects of the story are easily explained via the interactions of General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his economics right hand man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Baseball operations behind the scenes are given fascinating clarity via the tremendous screenplay (Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin). And ultimately the blend of on field action, family relationships and team assembling flows beautifully as one.<br/><br/>In turn punch the air brilliant with heart tugging worth, and brainy into the bargain, Moneyball most certainly a film non Baseball fans can watch and maybe love for bringing something new to the sports movie table. 9/10"

","The story shows the hope how one can leverage own failure to overcome and make another dream come true. It's always wonderful to see the thing every other else says that's impossible become real. By that, we can keep hanging on the hope in the real life. Billy led and accomplished amazing and unbelieveable 20 consecutive wins of the team that no one had expected for.

"shihanyu","9","2","3","9 June 2017"," A great translation of a beautifully written Michael Lewis story
","Moneyball's greatest aspects: an adapted screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin, based off of a Michael Lewis book.<br/><br/>The film is incredibly well written, with each scene reliving the story of general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) struggling to rebuild an unfortunate, low budget Oakland baseball team. The screenplay allows for excitement and attentiveness, somehow changing a slow moving sport into an enjoyable, dramatic motion picture.<br/><br/>The attention to detail throughout the film, like the fit of the baseball pants and the design of the locker room, truly shows the hard work and effort put in by the production crew. Despite the simplicity of baseball uniforms relative to usual film attire, the costume design for Moneyball is still impressive. The well designed set for the baseball team's locker room and offices allows for long shots through hallways that show characters' moods and general ambiance.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film crew did a fantastic job of understanding and breaking down the data-oriented system that is used in baseball today to rate players. Director Bennett Miller successfully delivers comprehensive scenes to teach the audience about this complicated concept, all the while incorporating drama and baseball action into the film.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are both fantastic in Moneyball. Both of them grow into their characters extremely well, and the film successfully manages to get the audience to become attached to them. Brad Pitt wonderfully depicts inner frustration and pain on the screen, all the while smiling externally to his character's coworkers and family. His performance is further enhanced by the personalities of his supporting cast, specifically Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>Director of Photography Wally Pfister has a great sense for a scene's look and feel, and he proves that to us throughout the film. For a baseball movie, Pfister shoots scenes with aspects of ingenuity and reality, sometimes shooting scenes the way a person would view a baseball game through their TV. His use of both natural light and artificial light is nicely done — specifically, Pfister's shots tend to have certain lights turned off, whether in a room or in a stadium, to project a dramatic feel onto the scene.<br/><br/>Additionally, the editing was superb. By going back and forth between the 2001/2002 baseball video montages with the film footage, the film is able to tie together 2001/2002's exciting commentary with slow motion pitches and swings.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Moneyball is able to successfully fulfill and translate the beautifully written story told by Michael Lewis."

","I've been a baseball fan for the better part of two decades. As such, I vividly remember the events surrounding the 2002 Oakland Athletics that are the prime content of this film. ""Moneyball"" does an incredible job of recreating the nostalgia of those events, as well as telling the story behind them that likely was not known at the time.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Moneyball"" focuses on the character of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the GM of the Oakland A's who realizes in the early 2000s that he can't spend with the ""big boys"" (e.g. New York) that comprised his competition. As such, with the help of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and to the consternation of A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Beane uses the statistical analyses popularized by Bill James to build a team capable of dethroning the Yankees on a shoestring budget.<br/><br/>The hallmark of this film is that, to the viewer, it really won't matter if you're familiar with this story. The narrative works either way:<br/><br/>If your a newbie to all this ""baseball-o-nomics"" stuff, ""Moneyball"" does a great job of breaking things down and giving you the ""Reader's Digest"" version of the Moneyball concept. You don't even have to be a baseball fan to ""get it"", as Beane's mindset and principles can be utilized in many walks of life.<br/><br/>For those (like I) who devoured ""Moneyball"" in print form, it is just flat out amazing to see the events played out on the big screen. Those of us who have been intrigued by the whole concept since those ""early years"" can sit back and be amazed by how it has truly changed the game. The fact that a great deal of actual baseball footage is used only adds to the effect.<br/><br/>About the only nitpick I can possibly find with this film is that the choreographed baseball scenes are not always entirely accurate. This is a small nitpick, of course, but one that bugged me just a bit considering how easy it would have been to fix.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Moneyball"" is a fantastic re-telling at perhaps the most revolutionary concept to ever be introduced to the sport...using in-depth statistical analysis to mine for talent that may be lost to the human eye. Whether a hard-core baseball nut or just a casual movie-goer, ""Moneyball"" will impress you...just in different ways."

","I watched a movie Moneyball yesterday. I barely got last night because it made me think lots of things.<br/><br/>The main character of this movie, Billy, (Brad Pitt acting) is a cruel boss. He fired a lot of players and workers for reconstructing team. Anyone could understand why he is so notorious and selfish about managing the baseball team. <br/><br/>Actually while watching this scene in this movie, I reminded some incident two months ago in my working place. My company had a huge reconstruction that time, so many attendant had to leave their previous position. I also could not escape from this human resources part. So I had to my working time and my paycheck was thinner than before. I blamed my boss : ""This reconstruction is so pathetic and ridiculous! It is like one soccer player made play the baseball!"" But yesterday, through this movie, sometimes this kind of exchange can make positive conclusion. And some people can overcome his own trouble through this sudden change.<br/><br/>In this movie, Billy was a great promising player when he was a high school student. He was great intellectual student, too. But he gave up his learning opportunity, and he became a baseball player in Major League. However, he did not make up people's expectation. <br/><br/>Billy realized that some professional people cannot see who is good or bad in the baseball. Billy have believed only statistics and his belief started working after 3 months of reconstruction of team. Sometimes I have thought : ""My decision is right in the past? For example, if I found my own job earlier instead of studying in graduate school, how much I get money now?"" <br/><br/>Billy is a lucky guy in a broad sense, I think. When he realized he could not success as a baseball player, he threw up all his career. I envy him his courage. To be honest, I also gave up my learning in school and I started my working life. Well, I really trusted my ability about study when I entranced into a graduate school. I thought wrong I was a prodigy before.<br/><br/>Whenever I see Oakland's T-shirt, I would like to remind this movie."
"maheshakavarapu","9","2","3","15 August 2016"," How can you not be romantic about baseball?
","Moneyball is based on a real story of a manager, also a former professional baseball player, Billy Breane(Brad Pitt) and the journey of his team, Oakland A's, in the season of 2002. The movie depicts the circumstances under which the teams makes a transition from being underdogs to becoming all-American record holders, a success attributed, at least as portrayed in this movie or the book on which it is based or often by the general public, to Billy's unorthodox and unusual methods of putting price on players based on numbers and statistics. <br/><br/>Although the movie is based on baseball, it doesn't often depict out-of-the- park home runs, sacrifices, stolen bases nor any such adrenaline fueled scenes. Rather, the movie proceeds in a silent ambiance taking its audience much closer and intimate to the dialogues. The movie centers around Billy, making the role of Brad Pitt crucial in judging the quality of the movie, which, I feel, is indeed very fine, because, to mention a few, of his facial expressions and lines which perfectly fit to the situations. Jonah Hill takes a non-comedian role, which is kind of rare yet done greatly, of a statistician, Peter Brand, assisting in Billy's managerial decision matters. Besides, the movie also presents several philosophical insights to its audience through a life journey of a manager, and the frustrations, complications, and joyous moments involved with the job, which are never better said than watched.<br/><br/>For the audience loving baseball, the movie may not reach the expectations, as it focuses not much on the game, rather more on the team's managerial issues. Consequently, the audience interested in management may find the movie quite interesting. The same applies to those audience who come from a background of statistics or IT, who would like the role played by Hill. In my personal opinion, I would describe the movie, although I'm not a big fan of baseball, yet in the very lines of the movie as, ""How can you not be romantic about baseball?""- it's a metaphor."
"Screen_Blitz","10","2","3","15 August 2015"," Brilliant movie about why we love baseball
","Brad Pitt brings the best of his acting talent to this biopic drama about what everyone loves about baseball. Based on the true events as well as the non- fiction novel by Michael Lewis, director Bennett Miller and writer acclaimed writer Aaron Sorkin takes a stab a story of the complexities of the Major League Baseball association, and the odds that defied expectation during these events. Pitt plays Billy Beane, manager of the Oakland Athletes disillusioned by the loss of the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the help of Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), an economics graduated from Yale, Beane recruits a team of undervalued players while coping with a tight budget. Rather than scouting, his method of recruitment involve choosing players based on home run scores and ability on base. Their unusual method of recruitment takes a challenge on the old-school traditions of baseball Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Art Howe, Beane's manager who looks at his recruiting with disapproval.<br/><br/>Many may have seen classic baseball flicks such Field of Dream (1989), A League of Their Own (1992), and The Sandlot (1993), but none of these come near as fascinating to this one. Brad Pitt demonstrates a top notch performance as Billy Beane, he definite kind of performance that demands for your attention. Looking back at the previous roles in his career, it is easy for some to cite this one as the best performance of his career. Then you have Jonah Hill, who is known for mostly comedic roles, takes on his first dramatic role and his performance is nothing short of magnificent. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also given a share of spotlight, but not enough to make this a memorable role of him. This film is also beautifully written, the script is pretty sharp. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch that writer Aaron Sorkin conveyed in his previous, 'Social Network' for an example; there is plenty of heart and flair to be experienced. It tackles on some major issues dealing with baseball and it does with wit and intelligence. Unlike most baseball movies, this one doesn't directly focus on a team trying to make it the top of the scoreboard, and instead revolves around the business activity behind the park. Avoiding all the sports movie clichés, the plot follows how Billy Beane uses an unusual fashion for recruiting players, and it goes deeply how it affects the system. It teaches the audience the behind-the-scenes story of baseball that many may have never knew, and it does such an amazing job with it. It also demonstrates a clear image of what baseball is about and what goes on behind the stage. Yes, it has some funny moments, it has its dramatic moments, and there are other scenes that will have you lifted.<br/><br/>Moneyball is one of 2011's best movies. This film is just so pleasing and so intriguing to watch. This would be very pleasing to baseball fanatics, as well viewers who enjoy the charismatic nature of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Even if you are not much of a baseball fan, this one is definitely worth watching."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","2 July 2015"," A Film About Baseball That Easily Transcends Its Game
","A film about baseball that effortlessly transcends its game, an interesting study of the clash between the conventional & new approach, and a highly polished drama that packs in a lot of heart, soul & inspiration, Moneyball is a fabulously crafted, expertly narrated & brilliantly performed picture that enters the film arena as an underdog but leaves everyone surprised by the time it finishes, much like its subject matter.<br/><br/>Based on actual events, the story of Moneyball follows Billy Beane; the general manager of Oakland Athletics who's given a low-budget team to prepare for the upcoming season. Very disappointed with the limited payroll, he hires a new assistant and decides to put his radical theory to test when it comes to scouting & analysing players, eventually putting together a team of undervalued players who later go on to script history.<br/><br/>Co-written by Steven Zaillian & Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Bennett Miller, Moneyball is a big shot of inspiration that hits many home-runs over the course of its runtime and features Brad Pitt in one of his strongest roles. The screenplay is a pure gem and Miller does a terrific job in transitioning it on the silver screen for his direction here brims with confidence and he approaches the story with a clear vision of what the film needs to be.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are firmly executed under the director's supervision. Set pieces are finely detailed, shooting locations carry an authentic feel, Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera to capture all the action on & off the field, and also gives it a grassy visual flair, Editing keeps the plot real tight & gripping and provides a favourable pace to the whole narrative, while Michael Danna's score makes its presence felt only when it's required.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Moneyball features a reliable cast in Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill & Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, and all of them chip in with commendable performances. Pitt is the real star here for he commands the screen with full authority and performs his duties with finesse. Hill also delivers a strong supporting work as assistant GM while Hoffman is at his usual best and the chemistry these three actors share with each other lifts the story up by a great deal.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Moneyball is one of the best films of its year & amongst the finest examples of its genre that benefits most from its impeccable writing & solid direction. The rejection of unorthodox ideas, the errors in management style, the continued use of outdated methods & favouring polished pebbles over diamonds are few of the elements that goes beyond the arena of baseball and Moneyball makes these points heard loud & clear without preaching it. An intensely captivating & thoroughly entertaining experience, Moneyball comes highly recommended."
"tedvangreen","9","2","3","21 September 2014"," Moneyball is a hit for sports fans
","A must see for any true baseball fans, Moneyball takes a look at more than just the Oakland Athletics. It beautifully mixes Oakland general manager Billy Beane's decision to shake up how he runs his team, with his personal life. Bennett Miller, the director, really causes the viewer to root for not only the A's team from ten years ago, but gives fans reason to root for Beane and the A's in today's season by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The Oakland A's are coming off a season in which, although they made the playoffs, they suffered a disappointing loss to the New York Yankees. Unfortunately for Billy Beane, three of his biggest stars leave in free agency. Beane has to find a way to replace his best players, while still staying within the lowest salary cap confines in all of baseball. Beane turns to unconventional methods of replacing lost production.<br/><br/>This is where Moneyball, in my opinion, excels. The way Bennett Miller portrays the old school vs. new school ways of thinking is very good. It portrays how many baseball scouts and front office men were stuck in the past where the eye test is all that matters. However Billy Beane and his new assistant Peter Brand, a Yale graduate with a degree in economics, turn to a radical new method of determining player values: saber-metrics, which is looking mainly at certain statistics to determine players value. Many of the old school scouts greatly resent this new method of determining player value and think that Beane is ignoring all of their hard work, especially when Beane sign a slew of unconventional players to help replace the loss of his three stars.<br/><br/>The first half of the season does not go well for the Athletics, leading to critics to call Beane's new method of selecting players a failure. This is very frustrating for Beane as he has to win the support of the owners, while pouring every single minute of his life into his job. The problem is that Beane recently got divorced and shares time with his daughter. His increased work responsibilities make it harder for Beane to see his daughter.<br/><br/>One of the neatest scenes, if you are a sports-nerd like myself, is the trade deadline scene. It is a very tense few minutes as Beane and Brand attempt to wheel-and-deal with other teams. Miller paints Beane as a powerful general manager to be feared by having him give other GM's deadlines and telling them they are giving up a huge opportunity.<br/><br/>However the turning point of the film definitely is the streak. After struggling to compete in the first half of the season, the team rips off a 20 game win streak which is the longest in A.L. history. At this point in the film, there is a general consensus being reached that Beane's experiment with saber-metrics have worked as the A's are roaring towards the playoffs. Although they may lose to the twins in the post season, almost everyone around baseball generally agrees that saber-metrics is here to stay and is probably the future.<br/><br/>The end of the film has Beane meeting with the owners of the Boston Red Sox, who offer him the largest contract for a general manager at the time. This is the hardest decision Beane has to make of the whole film. He could go to Boston and take the money and help remake that once great team into contenders again, or he could stay near his daughter, and finish what he started in Oakland. In the end, he ends up choosing to stay in Oakland, after listening to a CD of his daughter singing and thanking him for being a great Dad. After the film ends, the reader learns that Beane stays in Oakland to finish what he started and to win a World Series there. They also learn that the Red Sox have won two world series in the last decade using a strategy similar to that of Beane's. By including this information, the director causes the viewers to feel sympathy for Beane and makes the viewer hope that the Athletics can win a World Series with Beane at the helm.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill perform very well in the roles of Billy Beane and Peter Brand respectively. This is a great film to see if you have a genuine interest in baseball or even sports."
"g-bodyl","9","2","3","19 April 2013"," Deserves The Praise!
","Moneyball is definitely worth all the praise it has been receiving. This is not a baseball film per se but more of a drama that centrals around the Oakland Athletic's General Manager, Billy Beane. This film features great acting, solid direction by Bennett Miller, a well-written screenplay, and a new take on the baseball films which have been done so many times before. Of course there are baseball scenes, but for once we get a look at the realistic portrayal of what happens behind the scenes.<br/><br/>This film, based off the autobiography by Billy Beane himself, is about his 2002 season. After three superstars leave his team to get more money elsewhere, he designs a way to get players based off stats. With everyone calling him crazy including the A's manager, will this stat plan be effective? Brad Pitt is a very good, versatile actor. He certainly displays acting chops and I believed he should have won Best Actor at the Oscars. Jonah Hill takes a turn for the dramatic and perhaps has the best performance of his young career. And of course, Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as always.<br/><br/>Overall, Moneyball has to be one of the greatest baseball films I have seen thanks to the way they filmed it. If they are to make sports films in the future, this is how to do it. It takes away all those clichés we see over and over again. It's good that this film was recognized by the Academy. I rate this film 9/10."
"policy134","10","2","3","2 February 2013"," Another triumph from the ""Capote"" director
","With all of the focus being on who can make the loudest, use the most spectacular visual effects, it's amazing that this movie made any money at all.<br/><br/>Forget that this movie has major stars like Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in the cast, although they do their characters justice (these are probably the most subdued Hill or Pitt characters you have ever seen). The main reason why it works is because of the really fascinating story behind it.<br/><br/>It could have been easy to make the character of Billy Beane into an arrogant jerk, who thinks he knows more than anybody else. Pitt makes the wise choice to play a guy who has nothing to lose and is willing to think outside the box. But he is also humble enough to know that he can't do that alone and quickly realises that he needs somebody like Hill's character, Peter Brand. Brand is the quiet introvert who is brilliant, but doesn't think much of himself. He just turns out to be exactly what Beane needs. It is a lot of fun to see Pitt and Hill play off each other. There couldn't have been a more odd couple in the history of cinema but they have undeniable chemistry on screen.<br/><br/>The movie handles baseball as a business, where it is the latest thing you have done that counts. That is usually what people remember. In comes the manager, played by Capote actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. It is of course necessary to make general manager and the manager into adversaries in these types of movies, but Hoffman plays it without the usual cliché of screaming and lecturing because he knows more than the boss. They may hate each other but it is never the main conflict in the show. That goes to Beane's self-doubt about what he is doing and why he is doing it. Again, Pitt handles it beautifully, especially when we learn that he has an ex-wife and daughter. Watch the scene where he is trying to put on a brave face when his team is about to go to the dumps. There is also a hilarious scene featuring Spike Jonze as a more than understanding 2nd husband to Beane's former wife. Simply brilliant.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this fantastic film, but just to add a little more. Were it not for filmmakers like Miller who does these character driven stories so well, we would be forced to read books, just to get the noises out of our heads from the latest superhero flick in theatres."
"sagghoffnung","8","2","3","18 January 2013"," pitt is at top of his game...
","I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before it's national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch of well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction. <br/><br/>Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is a former major leaguer turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After losing in the playoffs to the Yankees, the A's lose their stars to free agency. Billy is tasked with rebuilding despite a payroll that leaves the A's trailing the competition. <br/><br/>While going through the usual motions, Billy happens by Pete Brand (Jonah Hill), an economist who may have found a way to scout baseball with the efficiency the A's need. The two delve in head first, and despite some tough outings they never back down.<br/><br/>Pitt is at the top of his game. As an everyman—or at least one that isn't played up as wealthy, a man struggling to keep his job—frustration is clearly seen in Pitt's face. Pitt brings humanity to the ominous job of a general manager. Flashbacks of his stint in ""the show"" surmise his entire life, be it his divorce or relationship with his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey).<br/><br/>Moneyball is not the action-packed sports outing one may be expecting. Director Bennett Miller spends very little time focusing on the game of baseball, or even the personalities of the players. Moneyball is a movie about management. Its deadpan, forthright approach is fresh compared to the typical underdog story filled with home runs and stolen bases. There's no electrifying music or thrilling speeches, but the excitement found in a phone call is realized as well as one could imagine. I don't think any actor other than Hill could pull of his slowly clinched fist.<br/><br/>Like the good sports films, Moneyball shares a deeper meaning than simply winning. Immediately the value of loyalty comes to mind. The sports genre is changing, much like how the crew of this story changed talent scouting. Just last year a movie rose up about the struggle to manage a boxer, and now here's the struggle to manage a team."

The film confirmed all my suspicions that it really is just rounders on steroids, and I would still not feel inclined to cross the street to watch the sport.<br/><br/>But despite all that this is a great film that I found engrossing from start to finish. It, at its heart, is a story about an organisation in crisis whose only solution to being in a hole was to carry on digging until the hero (well, heroes) say ""damn you all"" and go a new way.<br/><br/>What is, curiously, even better is that they do not QUITE succeed (it is based on real life events, apparently, so check out the history) which makes it all the more affecting because its like real life. There isn't the perfect, happy, ending - but the world has changed as a result.<br/><br/>Even it you know as much about American Rounders as I do, even if you hate sport, enjoy. Its a good film."
"StevePulaski","9","2","3","8 September 2012"," ""An island of misfit toys""
","""There are rich teams, and there are poor teams. Then there's fifty feet of crap. And then there's us"" Billy Beane coldly states at a meeting early in Moneyball. Beane is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, which in 2002, were the lowest-salaried MLB team, that began their season with eleven loses in a row. If it hadn't been for Beane's devotion to the team and the excellent crew working alongside them, the team may have likely spiraled down to become one of the worst performing teams in MLB history.<br/><br/>Beane (portrayed excellently by Brad Pitt) was recruited as a player to the MLB at a young age, and after failing to drum up much attention, was assigned the A's GM in 1998. After losing to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason, Beane continued to seek out other options, hiring the Yale-educated Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), working as an assistant for the Cleveland Indians at prior to this, to work as the numbers-cruncher for the team. Brand quickly pulls up a list of ""misfit players"" that should be going for a higher price, but are ostracized because of their quirks. Even on a limited budget, they recruit a number of lesser players and went on to compile a team that would win twenty games in a row, the highest winning streak of any MLB team in history.<br/><br/>Moneyball closely examines Beane and Brand's tireless game with numbers, how both of them faced opposition from the A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and despite being overwhelmingly successful at the game, Beane's constant dissatification with the team as a whole, even saying that winning twenty games is meaningless unless you win the final game of the season.<br/><br/>The one person he continues to keep close to him is his young daughter, Casey (Kerris Dorsey), who becomes increasingly worried about how her father could do so much to help yet remain mostly unmoved by it all.<br/><br/>Writer Aaron Sorkin pens Moneyball with a rare side of cynicism not only from Beane but from the sport of baseball itself. The complexity of the game is stunning, the statistics sometimes brutally unfair, and the stress and anguish of it all, unfathomable in every sense. I rarely attend major league baseball games, and usually stick to the humble, but sophisticated Midwest League when I am hungering for baseball. I'm sure the stress is there about as much as it is in the bigger ballparks as well.<br/><br/>Sorkin, who penned The Social Network just a year prior to this, continues his streak of taking a questionable premise and making it interesting, informative, completely understandable to anyone regardless of interest or education, and shows the importance of slick, flowing dialog from character to character.<br/><br/>Moneyball is a wonderful work of supreme intellect, on a subject that more often than not spawns a by-the-numbers story. Pitt is increasingly favorable as Beane, Hill works wonders with the dramatic screenplay, and Hoffman brings yet another fabulous performance to the table in his string of successful ones. And even when one of those three are not taking screen (which is a rare occurrence), we still get wonderful, stylistic visual flair. This film has it all.<br/><br/>Starring: Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Directed by: Bennett Miller."

","Clocking in at 2 hours, 13 minutes, ""Moneyball"" requires a commitment. Beyond time, an interest - or at least a lack of aversion - to mathematical concepts and, obviously, baseball also will aid in the enjoyment of this biopic. While athletic Brad Pitt does a reasonable impression of athletic former ballplayer Billy Beane, the true star is author Michael Lewis. Lewis is contemporary literature's foremost writer on men, money and the risks the one takes with the other. His ability to illuminate the arcane economic theories the character of Peter Brand (the Oscar-nominated Jonah Hill) brings to bear on baseball player selection gives the book and the movie real heft. Hill likely does not deserve the Oscar nod for player a fairly uni-dimensional statistician who is not taxed to demonstrate any real emotion (unless awkward is an emotion). At least the wildly miscast Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't get one for the cerebral actor's misguided attempt at portraying put-upon Oakland A's manager Art Howe. Beyond these three men the other characters are largely forgettable former (mostly) baseball players. In short, if you like baseball or numbers the film is a must-see but otherwise you'll find it overlong and lacking true dramatic engagement."

Pitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance in arguably his best on screen work as determined Oakland A's baseball General Manager Billy Beane, whose desire to get his last-placed major league team to a fulfilling winning season in a genuine pennant race by employing the unorthodox plan involving a statistics number crunching green wunderkind (Hill in a surprisingly underplayed winning performance equally worth a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award too boot). Based on the best-seller by Michael Lewis, dream team scribes Aaron Sorkin & Steve Zaillian hit a grand-slam with equally refined clear-eyed direction by Bennett Miller. Wisely Pitt in charge with a low-key, no 'bs' in his performance of a man attempting to do one specific goal : to win-in-spite-of-the-odds underdog undertaking that so easily could fall into a sports film cliché (which it lingers with admittedly) but is arguably the best film ever made about the game and one of the year's best films, bar none.

","Okay, first of all I'd like to tell everyone I'm from Pakistan and folks from Pakistan don't know a thing about baseball {we're more into cricket, hockey and football (soccer)}.<br/><br/>Moneyball has to be thee most anticipated movie about sports, passion, hard work and motivation and I'm pretty much blown away to see that this movie didn't get that much recognition as it deserves. I believe this movie stands equally with movies like ""Million Dollar Baby"" ""Rocky"" ""Cinderella Man"" ""The Wrestler"" ""Raging Bull"" and etc. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt as Billy Beane did an amazingly magnificent job and it'll be a disgrace if he's not nominated for an Oscar for his brilliant performance, the way he cloaked himself into the character it was just masterclass and on the other hand he's equally well supported by Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman (who by the way did an amazing job as well)<br/><br/>In my view, Moneyball is arguably second best sports movie ever made. <br/><br/>My Rating: 8.7/10"
"dharmendrasingh","7","2","3","28 November 2011"," How could you not be romantic about baseball? (...By not watching it, I suppose)
","My only ever baseball experience was memorable for being unmemorable. I sat in what I was told was a 'bleacher' seat. In my native England, a bleacher seat would be a prime location from which to view a live game. But bleacher seats are so named because there is no roof covering them, allowing the sun to bleach the riff-raff who occupy them. I walked out before half-time (if indeed there was a halfway point). <br/><br/>Bennett Miller's 'Moneyball' has good and bad points, just like his 'Capote'. Sure, there are parts which engage, but there are also parts which repel. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, general manager of the real life baseball team the Oakland Athletics, or Oakland A's. They're a middle-of-the-road sort of a team, destined for nothing except mediocrity. After losing their big chance of winning a championship title, Beane has to sell some of his key players to keep the club financially stable. Only, if he does that he can kiss goodbye to any chance of winning anything again. <br/><br/>The intriguing thing about 'Moneyball' is that it takes us from the pitch, through the locker rooms and further until we get to the back office where the real game is played – a game of backhanders and backstabbing. 'Moneyball', I think, introduces to the screen the quirky concept of sport management via a computer. <br/><br/>The biggest reason why I can't recommend this film over other ones currently on release is Brad Pitt. When it comes to Beautiful Brad, I'm in a minority. I don't think he's a great actor. He's more a personality, as De Niro would say. If you look at his filmography, I bet you couldn't name a film where if he wasn't in it it would be a poorer picture for it. 'Fight Club' is as good as he'll ever be. And I bet my journalistic career that he will never win a competitive Oscar. <br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian's script is weak by their standards. There are lines of dialogue which stand out, but you can always spot good lines in an ordinary script. Zaillian is used to adapting his screenplays from books, whereas Sorkin has the skill to write one from scratch. The script isn't poor, you understand; it just isn't worthy of either man. <br/><br/>Beane's shrewdest managerial decision is to poach Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a player analyst from a rival team. He's a softly spoken, obsequious young man, who's a bit of a dark horse. He has an economics degree from Yale and understands baseball better than anyone else Beane has ever known. <br/><br/>Brand explains to Beane that throughout history baseball managers have been wrong. They are blinded by celebrity to the extent that they dismiss most players because of their age, appearance or personality. Brand persuades Beane that, if they view players as statistics rather than as celebs, they can assemble a championship-quality team. You could say that Brand is the brains behind the A's' recovery while Beane is the face. Naturally. <br/><br/>Sorkin or Zaillian (who knows which?) does manage to slip some nice dark humour into characters' lines. This along with Jonah Hill's performance would be a reason to watch the film. In real life he's an extrovert, so it must have been hell to speak only when spoken to. In one scene, Beane points to him all cool and managerial-like, tacitly wanting to him to confirm something he's said in a meeting. Brand points to himself and says 'Do you want me to speak?'. The whole audience loved this kind of gag.<br/><br/>A quick-fire negotiation scene featuring Beane and Brand is impressive. Or do they speak so quickly that the scene only seems impressive? Either way I won't be watching it a second time to find out.<br/><br/>The film focuses on too many different characters. It gets lost in its own details. Toning down the success the A's' go on to achieve would have made sense (20 consecutive wins, although true to life, is too schmaltzy to be taken seriously in a film). It's a sporting cliché otherwise. <br/><br/>The ending was a sell-out. I gather Beane wanted desperately to win with the A's. As a player he was as star manqué, so winning a championship with them as GM would be his salvation. The offer made to him by the Boston Red Sox was so similar. They, too, were a losing side who needed Beane to take them to a championship. He could have easily gone back to the A's; it's not like they would have turned him down. (The Red Sox used his (Brand's) model anyway and won the title without him.)<br/><br/>I don't want to sound like I hate Brad Pitt (I don't think anybody does), but I have to be honest. Speaking honestly, then, how long does the camera have to be held on Pitt's eyes before he sheds a tear? His way of conveying the regret his character has is to exercise more than any of the players and break a lot of things. Also, can anybody tell me why Pitt eats in virtually every scene of every film he's starring in lately? What kind of trademark is that? This is a man who topped a great actors poll above Brando a few years back. And people wonder why I'm so cynical about the state of cinema. <br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"
"jdesando","Null","2","3","23 September 2011"," On the Money
","Here's an enjoyable sports film with history behind it and heart inside it. The facts: Under the general management of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the Oakland A's achieved a phenomenal 20 game winning streak in the early part of this century. The cost: less than two thirds the expenditure of the Yankees. The real cost: players let go and Bean ridiculed, until his winning streak, which changed baseball forever. <br/><br/>Moneyball's heart is in Brad Pitt's gentle performance, the best of his career depicting Beane's cool assurance relying on the statistics that have always been available, rather than the guesses of his scouts. A major part of the success is the data-mining mind of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a 25 year old Yale economics grad with a statistical approach that predicts the strength of players who have been marginalized or let go by other clubs. Sabermetrics is his creation, a strategy that builds on player strengths ignored by supposed experts.<br/><br/>Unlike most other sports films, even the storied Any Given Sunday, Moneyball delivers organically, just a slow series of setbacks that are nonetheless essential to eventual success. Although we know the outcome, director Bennett Miller strategically paces the early struggles to make you care about the characters, even the negatively traditional coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Where some other films may surpass Moneyball is their showing the reasons on the field for the team's success, whereas here only some locker room chat and brief counseling can be seen as contributory.<br/><br/>Like other sports films as well, the middle sags like Art's belly until the winning streak naturally enlivens the somber mood during the losses. Yet the film is exemplary in its feisty meetings as scouts square off against general manager Beane, who is slowly challenging their philosophies of status quo and intuition. <br/><br/>On that note is the real strength of a film that exalts both creative thinking and mathematical accounting. Yet never is any of this change made easy"

","While certainly a great movie about the game of baseball, there are so many valuable insights as well relating to the creative way that patterns can be detected by stepping back and observing the picture that numbers can draw out for us. In many of those instances we are able to confirm what seems so obvious, yet in some cases it helps us to think about what is really at the heart of something. With Moneyball, it's about ""Get on base"", and however that might happen... a player who's good at seeing balls versus strikes, a player who's good at stealing bases, a player who gets more singles than doubles or triples. The cast is amazing, and the story timeless. A must see!

","Now, normally I wouldn't willingly see a film with Jonah Hill in it, but he really pulled it out and helped make this an enjoyable movie.
Essentially, the story goes that if you always do what you've always done, then you'll always get what you've always got. With the added challenge of limited funds, it becomes difficult to change a baseball team from one that loses to one that wins.
An interesting movie that kind of played like a dramatic documentary, ""Moneyball"" turns everything upside down in terms of what's important. Numbers over flaws, runs over fame, and (most importantly) people over money."
"michaeltrivedi","8","1","1","5 January 2020"," Well Made
","To be honest, I've tried to watch this movie a few times, finally completing it sometime a few years ago. I found it really boring. I guess it was just a lot of sport analytics. At least The Big Short has the glamour of finance. This was lacking that glamour, as I didn't find anything fascinating about baseball.<br/><br/>I rewatched it recently and really enjoyed it. I thought it was a well made movie, might be the best Pitt movie out there, though not close to being my personal favorite. I don't think there were any great points being made however, whether political or economical. It was just about a guy making the best baseball team with underdogs of the system. Didn't really hold any deeper meaning than that, nor was this some fantastic cinematic experience. I could see how it's an Oscar contender, but I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't too.<br/><br/>Pitt's good in the film. He showcases his acting skills, and he does it well. Whether he is good at acting up against other great actors remains in question. And whether he could really hit the emotional highs and lows as well. For what the movie is, he's watchable. Jonah Hill is a pointless character, and I could've done without him.<br/><br/>It's a story about a man. Plain and simple<br/><br/>Watch it, don't watch it. Whatever. It's alright<br/><br/>8 stars"

","The Social Network for sports fans! Remember when you first tried to tell your friend to watch The Social Network and they said ""A movie about the making of Facebook??"" Well Aaron Sorkin did it again except this time for sports fans. So now your friends can ask ""That movie about baseball statisticians??"" You can answer ""Yes"" proudly because the script and direction are near perfection. Pitt and Hill work miracles together on-screen as they spout off Sorkin's musical dialogue and take you deep into the world of an MLB GM (a world you didn't know you needed to visit). You ride the highs and lows of a season with Billy Bean because Sorkin's script doesn't feel cold like an auctioneer, but instead his fast paced dialogue brings you close to the heart of Billy Bean and his desire to win and change baseball forever. This highly personal story touches one so close while still remaining on the intelligence level of Social Network. It works so well it shouldn't exist, but thankfully it does."

Moneyball is a great film about the virtue of pursuing your dreams, even if logic tells you otherwise, which stands in conflict with the main plot of the film, which focuses on Billy Beane (played by a note perfect Brad Pitt) a boss trying to introduce objective analysis to baseball, a sport where evaluation still relies heavily on feelings and innuendo.<br/><br/>It's in the conflict between Billy Beane's emotional ""need"" and his logical ""want"" were Moneyball shines. I won't spoil it, but if you love sports, Moneyball is a poetic film that will remind you of why you love sports. Great direction by Bennet Miller. Great scripting by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin, and Steve Zailian."

","Imagine an employment system that is solely relied on a computer-generated analysis system. ""Moneyball"", directed by the famous actor, Brad Pitt, is a movie that discovers a unique economic theory based on baseball players' competency. The film, synthesized with actors, intricate scenes, and humor definitely make it worth watching (possibly several times), especially knowing the fact that the movie was drafted from a book based on a true story.<br/><br/>The Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane is faced with a conflict: after the top three baseball players on the Oakland A's leave, he must form a new group of people that can substitute their professionalism. The tight budget of the team leaves Beane with no choice but to come up with a solution to work around the finance issue, hence the creation of the Moneyball thesis: a statistical analysis that allows small-market teams to compete by buying assets that are undervalued by other teams and selling the ones that are overvalued by the other teams.<br/><br/>What impacts can we see today after the creation of the Moneyball theory? The foremost point is that this economic theory formed by has created major political changes. According to Vice Sports, the book (Moneyball) revolutionized baseball, and eventually, every team in the majors adopted some or all of the concepts outlined by Michael Lewis (the author of the book). By the end of the decade, the term ""Moneyball"" was used to describe a statistical based approach (the economic view) in almost all of sports.<br/><br/>Some people criticize about the central misconception about it. For example, ESPNs Matt Bryant explains that, ""The Moneyball concept, recognizing the most valuable but least expensive commodities in player evaluation, was immediately transformed in public perception into an obsession with on-base percentage. Therefore, a team that values on-base percentage is considered to espouse ""Moneyball principles"", even though, as Beane points out, players with high on-base percentages have become extremely expensive.""<br/><br/>Despite the criticisms about the misconception of what the Moneyball theory has brought, If not for the low finance condition laid upon Billy Beane, the creation of such widely pronounced theory would have not been constructed."
"tabuno","10","1","1","18 January 2019"," A Baseball Movie That's Not About The Baseball
","26 September 2011. Surprisingly, this movie is less about the baseball game than the game of baseball. What is striking about this movie (and it's not about outs) is the raw audio sound technique used in this movie that is usually found in documentaries than feature films which helps make this movie come alive. There is a the ambiance of background sound and the echo that seems to resonate and bring the movie closer to the audience and present a much closer to realism experience. There isn't that much actual continuous footage of baseball in this movie, but rather the management of it. The heightened personal and emotional tension is carried throughout the movie and Director Bennett Miller has put together this compelling very intimate portrait of a man played by Brad Pitt and his statistician in an unusual angle of the game of baseball.<br/><br/>Somehow the almost overly brief snippets of scenes and background of current events and story are blended together along with poignant flashbacks will edited into some meaningful, main storyline without ever creating the idea of that the additional footage has someone been shortchanged. Bennett Miller apparently in his wisdom was able to capture the primary message of the movie, developed an accompanying background, and maintained the singular story around the entire movie, the art of carefully scriptwriting and editing.<br/><br/>Even without the formulaic all-American ending, Bennett Miller was able to wrap this movie into a complete feeling of wholeness for a feature film. Miller made excellent use of silence and editing choices in keeping the camera going just long enough for the more in-depth, substantive emotional impact of a scene to sink in. Miller seems to have brought a new found vision of a approach that brings a more connectiveness and meaningfulness to film-making, especially to interesting stories of reality that aren't even about the biggest and most momentous achievements of humanity and bringing them captivatingly to the big screen."

","For the baseball fan stretches of Moneyball are more than engaging - seeing how Beane constructed the 2002 out of the ashes of the 2001 edition, which was ravaged by free agent departures; watching losing baseball becoming the winning variety; and re-living ""the streak"" - a 20-game odyssey that made ""Moneyball"" a common word in baseball circles. Non-baseball lovers may enjoy the proceedings but are likely to be less impressed than their sports-savvy counterparts. It will be interesting to see how much of the early Academy Awards word-of-mouth is transformed into late-innings buzz and, ultimately, into Oscar gold. Brad Pitt is very good and along with The Tree of Life he has shown that a typical award worthy role doesn't have to be a mentally handicapped or a paraplegic or a raging alcoholic- He is the guy next door here. Jonah Hill provides worthy support in a non-comedic turn."

Brad Pitt has a marvellous performance as general manager of the Oakland AAs club and team and along the movie he makes us greatly feel the suspense and drama of building a victorious team out of the usually admitted parameters.

","It's the end of the 2001 season and the Oakland A's just lost the American League Division Series. To add insult to injury, they have just lost their star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen. Needless to say, the Oakland A's and their General Manager Billy Beane (played by Academy Award Winner Brad Pitt) is caught in a rut, and it doesn't help that he has the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If they want to win the World Series, they have to come up with something new. Eventually, he and his new assistant Peter Brand (played by Academy Award Nominee Jonah Hill) shake up the game when they use statistical analysis to place value on the players that they pick - a decision that has their entire scouting team and coach (played by Academy Award Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman) up in arms about. <br/><br/>This is a great film. Plain and simple. This film was nominated for a number of Academy Awards and, although it didn't win any, it clearly deserved each nomination. I don't know much about Sound Mixing and Film Editing, but kudos to those guys also getting some Academy love! However, let's start with the writing. First off, amidst two other guys, one of the writers is Academy Award Nominee Aaron Sorkin, who also penned A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War, The Social Network and Steve Jobs. Needless to say, this guys is a natural talent, and it was good to have him on here. Academy Award Nominated Director Bennett Miller is a master of knowing how to use his actors in each scene he directs; his movies are all about character development, and they delve into the psyche of each character. He really should've been nominated for Best Director for this film over Terrence Malick for The Tree of Life.<br/><br/>But of course we must now turn to the actors involved. First I want to start off with some of the more supporting actors in this film. In one scene, you have Golden Globe Winner Robin Wright who, in her one scene, is absolutely amazing :) Then you got Chris Pratt, who is especially well known for his portrayal of Star Lord in the MCU, Emmet in The Lego Movie franchise and Owen in the Jurassic Park franchise (yes I know he's in Jurassic World, but let's face it, that's an entire franchise from 1993 - present); he does a good job with the limited amount of lines he's given. But now to the main three actors. First off to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He plays the General Manager Art Howe, a man who is a traditionalist; he believes that baseball was built on the greatness of the scouts and players. Hoffman captures the gruffness very convincingly; he is a great actor who is still sorely missed. The biggest surprise to me was Jonah Hill. The mark of a great actor is when they can pull off different genres. While Hill is most well known for his comedies, this was his first non-comedy movie, and the next year he would star in the action-comedy 21 Jump Street. Needless to say, I believe that Jonah Hill will be considered a great actor in the years to come. I was hesitant to see him in this role, but he knocked it out of the park and he was excellent as Peter Brand. But of course, most of the credit has to go to Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the sports GM who is looking for a way to change the game in their favor, since it is his job that is on the line. If his way doesn't work, he will be out on the streets. Pitt conveys the desperation that Beane went through at that time; you can see the pain of a man who was once a promising young baseball player but who ended up being a disappointment. He really wants that ring on his finger, and he is willing to pull out all the stops to do it. Kudos to Pitt for such a great job!<br/><br/>Overall, go and watch this movie! It is a great movie!"

Also, this movie has a generic story that could have easily made Moneyball already dated. That's why I putted this movie off for a very long time, and I really regret doing that.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller, along with screenwriters, Steven Zaillian, and Aaron Sorkin took a story that sounds uninteresting and turned it into an enjoyable movie that is funny, intense, and very touching in equal measure. I didn't know that Aaron Sorkin co-wrote the script but I felt his touches while watching the movie till I became completely sure that he co-wrote its script even before I check that out.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so smart and sharp, and Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill were both great, especially Brad Pitt, and they had an incredible chemistry that made the dialogue even more captivating.<br/><br/>Let's face it, no director-screenwriter collaboration can beat Fincher-Sorkin's one. But that , by no means, means that Bennett Miller didn't do a great job directing this movie. Besides the fact that he made a very good-looking movie, he captured some truly magical cinematic moments that can stick in my head for a very long time. A very long sequence near the end, in particular, that is about ten minutes is easily one of the most riveting and gripping sequences I've ever watched. I was literally on the edge of my seat sweating, and putting my hands on head. It was really stressful and exhausting to watch. Also, the moments Billy Beane, Pitt's character, has with his daughter are just delightful to watch.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Moneyball's problem, IMO, is that it's a bit boring! Its runtime is 133 min, and the movie definitely could have been way shorter. The problem is that there is too much talk that I really wasn't interested in, and most importantly, didn't need to. The movie lost me sometimes at the middle and the very end.<br/><br/>Billy Beane is a well-written and grounded character that brought to life by Brad Pitt's Oscar-nominated performance. It had a lot of development, and it was a very interesting character. That being said, I felt that his backstory isn't complete. I think it was interesting at the beginning, but then the movie just ignored his past. As a result, I felt like there was something is missing in this character. The movie actually did keep advancing his backstory forward in a way that connect very well with the ongoing events of the movie, but that, unfortunately, didn't happen after the first act anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved Moneyball so much, and enjoyed watching it quiet a bit, and I didn't even think that I was going to like it.<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","For non sports fans or fans of true live films, Money has been seen and well praised in its own rights as a true based film. The acting performances from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are what stands out in the film, as well as the nature of the aspect that the film is based upon true events. Hvaing little to no knowledge of the true story, the film depicts what Hollywood believed as to what happened, within the baseball team and season of 2002. Moneyball is well written, directed and has enough suspense and drama that keeps it entertaining. For non baseball fans or sports fans, might consider the film as boring but it is a rather slower paced drama that builds as the film goes."

","Not the best baseball movie I have ever seen. That honor belongs to ""The Sandlot"", however this one is a fascinating look at scouting, drafting, and general baseball management. Acting is good. Not sure that Jonah's performance was that awesome - he simply wasn't smoking a bong or getting stabbed at a kegger, which I think surprised some people. The tension of work and family does show up and adds a nice human element to the film. Mixed in with some baseball highlights of the actual events can add more power for the A's fans out there. Worth a watch if you like baseball or play sports video games and love building the teams up more than actually playing the games.

","Never I seen Brad Pitt performance better than Hoffman to be honest, but when you saw 'Moneyball', you'll convinced that the real star and the only star of this movie is Brad Pitt himself. Not only he delivers a strong performance as Billy Beans but since this movie is all about Billy Beane, Pitt's factor really bring it out.. While the element of surprise came from Jonah Hill's performance which is surprisingly good, but to be honest if I can vote whether he should receive an Oscar nomination or not, well I vote for another actor.. But overall, 'Moneyball' is an interesting drama about sports with good performance from the cast"

","First of all, I am not a baseball fan, so I guess my opinion should count a little. In fact, I am not even aware of the rules of this sport. But you know what? I really enjoyed Moneyball. Being based on a true story, you just know that there has got to be a good enough reason for that story to be turned into a movie. <br/><br/>In Moneyball, you don't get to see that much baseball action though, for it shows you the other side of the sport. You get to see the bureaucracy and the extent to which a GM needs to go to be able to compete with wealthier teams. His new approach when recruiting players make him a few enemies along the way, and the majority of his staff seems uninterested in helping him make a good run for the title. His only help (in fact the source of his inspiration) comes from a young economist from Yale who has zero experience in baseball, but both of them are about to embark on a journey that will change the history of baseball forever At least that's the impression I got. <br/><br/>As a result, the movie is one of those that leave a long lasting feeling. Most of us will relate to the protagonist and feel that sometimes, all you need in adversity is to see things from a different perspective, especially when the big fish is way bigger than you"

Bennett Miller told a screening audience that A's assistant GM Paul DePodesta did not wish to have his real name used in the movie, but was very generously helpful during its making. While the filmmakers had no obligation to change his character's name (to Peter Brand), they did so willingly. The Oakland A's set the new American League record for consecutive wins, with 20. The all-time Major League record is 26, set by the New York Giants in 1916, including one tie. Without ties, the record belongs to the 1935 Chicago Cubs (21 straight wins).

"koenraad-coel","6","1","1","3 January 2014"," What exactly makes this a good movie ?
","After watching this movie, I'm really amazed at it's pretty much stellar reputation. I didn't see anything here that I haven't seen a thousand times over. You might credit Moneyball for side-stepping some of the big sports-movie clichés, but I can't go as far as to call it compelling. Granted there are some very decent performances here -especially from usual suspect Hoffman- but then most characters do little more then talk about dry facts and figures. Not exactly challenging stuff for an actor. This is mostly due to a very lackluster script; there's plenty of conflict but none of it gets fleshed out in a meaningful way. Apart from one climactic sequence nestled uncomfortably far from the eventual ending, tension or drama is mostly absent. We get to see extremely little baseball, instead watching TV-screens, spreadsheets and boardrooms. Crucial points in the season pass by before you even realize the story has jumped past them. What you're left with are flashbacks that don't seem to have much connection to the present and business-meetings in which the main characters never even get challenged properly. Character development is limited to Pitt's character re-enacting scenes from Californication with his daughter for a pitiful pay-off.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of baseball, so maybe lovers of the game get much more out of this then me, but I can find little to recommend here. The way I see it, Moneyball does to movie-making what I understand it does to baseball: it sucks the life out of it."
"tieman64","Null","1","1","24 June 2013"," Hey Pete, why doesn't your boss travel with the team?
","Directed by Bennett Miller, ""Moneyball"" stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. When he loses three star players in one season, Beane is forced to rebuild his squad. The problem is, Oakland's owners are broke. Beane thus adopts a new strategy. He hires an economics guru, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), and uses a sophisticated sabermetric approach to analysing, scouting and acquiring players. Using this method he buys a number of ""cheap"" players, and uses them to win 20 consecutive games, an American League record.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" is at its best when it's telling a familiar, underdog tale. This is a David vs Goliath battle in which little guys go up against Big Money. Organised sports as a rigged game, ""Moneyball"" details the way in which money leads to an accumulation of power and so the amassing of resources to the detriment of others. This has led to one chunk of American film critics reading the tale as both an attack on capitalism and a love letter to Occupy Movements. Hilariously, another chunk of critics read the film as being a celebration of the ""progressive power of free markets"", ""value creation"" and ""the rational, free, independent judgement of innovators"". According to such oppositional views, the film either pities poor Billy Beane for being crushed by Big Money, or celebrates him for being innovative and making efficient use of underused, overlooked workers. The latter view offers the usual free market fundamentalism: competition promotes efficiency, innovation, forces employees to work harder and faster, urges employers to maximise the use of their capital, to make better use of dollar-to-talent ratios, and incentivises the use of those who don't command as much in labour markets. In real life, truth's almost the complete opposite (capitalism hampers innovation, progress, aggregate efficiency goes down etc).<br/><br/>Epitomizing the film's ideological confusion are readings related to its treatment of baseball. Several critics see ""Moneyball"" as highlighting how math, science and a very specific corporate logic ""dehumanises"" and so sullies sports. To such critics, Beane, who tries to calculate his way to success by collating statistics, has given birth to a kind of robotic, post-human, soulless game in which players are treated as a collection of reliably reproducible and measured machine traits. How dare Billy Beane! <br/><br/>But humans are and have always been machines. Beane's highly rigid method of analysis is no different to that of experienced coaches and selectors. Such selectors may seem to be choosing players based on instincts and gut feelings, but in reality are filtering players through their own formulae and algorithms. They may not know it, but they're making, or attempting to make, choices as rational as any computer. Beane's more rigid method merely forces us to confront how mechanistic humans always are, which of course is depressing. Indeed, ""Moneyball"" may be the most depressing ball movie out there, morphing American's two religions – capitalism and baseball – into a noxious, fluorescent-lit numbers game, humans born to be reductively tabulated, quantified and disposed of, all in the name of profit curves, ""winning"" and GDPs.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" was written by Steve Zaillian, who wrote ""Schindler's List"", and Aaron Sorkin, who wrote ""The Social Network"". Like ""List"", the film fetishizes the idea of a kind of ""humanistic capitalism"". It offers ""more capitalism"" and the ""cleverer use of players/workers"" as a solution to what are really problems of exploitation. If your best players/workers/ideas are constantly being poached by wealthier clubs, forcing you to become ""organ donors to the rich"", then suck it up and be a smarter Social Darwinist. This, of course, echoes Sorkin's ""The Social Network"" screenplay. Hinging on nerds vs bullies narratives, both ""Moneyball"" and ""Network"" pretend to offer critique, but really offer wolves dressed as populist sheep. Think out-of-the-box, harder and smarter, and you'll compete with the big leagues. It's the American way. <br/><br/>Incidentally, Billy Beane's role in elevating Oakland has been hugely over emphasised. The team thrived primarily because of superb pitching and not because of Beane's methodology. During the period displayed in the film, Oakland were second in the league in fewest runs allowed, but finished in the bottom half in runs scored. Why? Because of three dominant pitchers: Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson, and Barry Zito. All three wee early-round draft picks, highly scouted and were not selected using Beane's methodology.<br/><br/>Ironically, 20th century baseball has achieved a much higher level of competitive balance than most other ball games. Some attribute this to funding caps and ""tax systems"" which essentially divert profits to smaller teams. Indeed, the year 2013 also marks the first year to feature ""competitive balance draft picks"", which awards players, via lottery, to small-market, low revenue teams. Most find this kind of ""wealth distribution"" abhorrent, some find it a necessity, whilst most hardcore post neoclassical economists, a field now called thermoeconomics, find such acts to be a positively pointless gesture when talking in terms of systems as a whole. The fact remains, though, that the difference between top and bottom tier baseball teams seems, at least for now, to be narrowing (roughly a 20 percentage points difference, 10 points plus or minus, between the best and worst teams).<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" was directed by Bennett Miller. It's a slick film, always fascinating and Miller keeps things moving at a fast pace. Unlike most baseball movies, Miller's action takes place behind the scenes, in boardrooms, cubicles and in front of computer screens and TV monitors. The film's closing title card states that the Red Sox would win using Beane's methodology, but this is a kind of lie. The Red Sox had the 2nd highest baseball payroll of 2004.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Entertaining but thin. Worth one viewing."

","Had this movie in my collection a while and finally got around to watching it today. One of the best films i have seen on the profession of baseball yet. Kudos to both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill for stellar acting jobs here. Supporting cast ain't that bad either with realistic jobs done also by Phillip Seymore Thomas (Who has a head coach look down perfectly) But both the acting jobs done by both Pitt and Hill are very believable and a storyline which was incredibly interesting and no you don't even have to enjoy watching the sport to know what's going on as i once heard a woman friend say.<br/><br/>Pitt plays Oakland A's longtime GM and former Mets player Billy Beane. Beane is named the Oakland A's GM and attends all the draft meetings with the look of utmost boredom until one of the other brass pretty much ask him what his problem is he asks each and everyone of them if they know what the current problem is that was surrounding the team. After no one can come up with an answer he tells them that the problem especially with the Yankees is that they spend millions on all star talent who once hired don't do a thing as to where he teaches them to look at the guys who are hard workers and can actually get to the base and that are not asking for much moolah in return.<br/><br/>Little does Beane knows is he will start what is now more or less precedent in baseball today when it comes to acquiring talent from any pro ball roster. He through yet another meeting concerning draft talks he acquires assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) from The Boston Red Sox who adds his own pick and great wisdom to the then 2002 season. A good film overall that can be proudly on display with other great pro baseball film that have occurred."
"maximkong","7","1","1","18 November 2012"," Some minus points for deviating from reality?
","Terrific script and a movie packed with top-notch acting performances and life lessons that are able to keep anyone engaged whether you know baseball or not.<br/><br/>Like any other better sports movie out there, Moneyball gave a lot of insight on the ups and downs of the dog-eat-dog world of pro sports accompanied with hidden themes of persistence & courage to go against all odds (or to defy reality) to achieve success. Unlike most other sports movies, but similar to The Wrestler, Moneyball is not made to overglorify sportsmanship and showed that things do not end up in your way all the time.<br/><br/>However, knowing that the same people who was behind 'Social Network' -- a movie that disappointed me -- was involved in this, I had to be skeptical on how accurate Moneyball portray the real people behind these characters. (NOTE: the movie claims to be based on true story, IT DID NOT HIGHLIGHT that it is based on the novel or other material) Like Social Network, I noticed immediately many things in the movie are quite dramatic, which is not a good thing if that causes it to stray too far from reality. For example, the real Billy Beane did not wore those fashionable attire or tracksuit (as done by Pitt) but look more like stolen from his stats assistant's wardrobe instead. Whatever... I have decided to let my final ratings be determined by how the actual people themselves felt about the movie. A quick browse online, I found Billy was satisfied with his character in the movie, Art Howe was offended, Scott Hatteberg did mentioned some things were incorrect in the movie, and I do not know if the sabermetrics guy felt okay with it. Hence, 7 stars is a good compromise from what looks like a 8-9 star at my first glance."

","Enjoyed this, although didn't understand all the baseball references. Basically a true story of a baseball GM who tried a new computer-generated statistic analysis to put a potentially winning team together on a low budget compared to teams such as the Yankees or the Red Sox. Set in the Oakland Athletics, Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane who was an ex player turned scout who finds Jonah Hill the Stanford Economics genius who has developed the equations and such to set up the system. Pitt, Hill and Seymour Hoffman were great, understated characterizations, Pitt bringing his eat & act modus operandi to the character, which always makes me laugh. It wasn't as gripping as some sports films, as it's about the people rather than the game, but exciting enough to follow the team, with some illustrated back story of Bean's career and also about his life out of the dugout (not that he is ever IN the dugout) with a cameo from Robin Wright as the ex-wife. His daughter was cutie with a good singing voice. Well directed film written in part by Aaron Sorkin - which didn't surprise given the tight economic script. Good biographical film."
"DKosty123","5","1","1","22 June 2012"," Missed Opportunity
","This is a movie with a great tale to tell. I have too believe the book is better. I think I know why too. This movie tries to tell the story as a great Managment Story, General Manager Story to be exact. The trouble is the heart is taken out of the story because of that approach.<br/><br/>I understand that Brad Pitt is trying to be made into a great actor. The trouble is Pitt is not a great actor. He can't carry a film because all his career he has been women's eye candy. Now that he is not as young as he once was, this movie proves it.<br/><br/>He is surrounded by a good supporting cast, but the folks around him are wasted as this movie tries to prove that a general manager and a Yale graduate with a computer can win in baseball. Making management into a hero is something that will warm the 1 percent, but leaves the 99% out cold.<br/><br/>When the film is using baseball clips, it is at it's strongest. For some reason, the script conversion here has dialog which does not allow the cast to really dig in. I understand Pitt is retiring from acting in 2 years. This movie proves he has never really acted. Granted, you could blame the script he is reading from but Pitt seems to be wooden in every film he has ever done.<br/><br/>Once the movie gets past 2 hours, it gets too long. It is based on a true story but I would think the real people had better emotions and words than the cast here has or does. Hoffman is nearly wasted in his role as Manager Art Howe, a role which he is perfect for but gets very little script to work with.<br/><br/>This movie about the Oakland A's could have been so much better. It fails to point out the human element. It makes me long for Jim Bouton's 1960's novel ""Ball Four"" which is a great picture of Baseball before free agency and money. Too bad that kind of baseball book can not be written now so we can compare what Jim Catfish Hunter's first free agent victory has really done too change the game.<br/><br/>This movie is half-baked. I hope the book is much better."

","Going in, I knew this wasn't the typical sports movie, and I thought I probably wouldn't like it that much, but it turned out to be a good movie and a neat idea. Instead of focusing on the baseball team, the film focuses on those that build the team, specifically the GM, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt. It's one of Pitt's better roles.<br/><br/>Beane enlists the aid of Ivy League graduate, Peter Brand, in picking ball players. There budget is small compared to other teams, so they look for players that are good at getting on base, and other teams undervalue, ie...won't have to pay them much. Through using a whole new idea to build a team, they are eventually proved successful.<br/><br/>I'm surprised this movie didn't win the Oscar for screenplay, It deserved it. As for the acting, it was OK, but I didn't think Pitt or Hill were anything special and really didn't deserve any nominations. Especially Hill, whose role is to play a nerdy, computer geek, with hardly any emotion and a monotone voice. I don't think that says Oscar.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A new type of sports movie.

"tomgillespie2002","7","1","1","7 April 2012"," A welcome passion project and a successful commentary on greed
","Being a football fan (that's 'soccer' to any Americans reading), it has been an increasingly frustrating past decade or so seeing the sport turn into a greedy, money-orientated business. The gap between the rich super-clubs, and the smaller teams that have been forced into becoming 'feeder clubs', is becoming larger and larger with every progressing season. The takeover of Manchester City a few seasons ago by Arab oil tycoon and politician Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nayhan saw the club spend over £150 million in one transfer window, and now sit second in the league as a result, with a host of superstar playboys littering their team-sheet. This transformation from sport of the working classes to a capitalist business is the focus of Moneyball, but the sport is baseball, America's equivalent to football.<br/><br/>It tells the true story of failed baseball player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), who is now General Manager of Oakland Athletics, a team who are struggling to keep up with the pace of the New York Mets, a rich club who have just nabbed three of Oakland's key players. Disillusioned with the financial distance between the clubs, he approaches Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale-graduated economics analyst who seems to have made a breakthrough studying statistics rather than player valuation. Brand suggests three out-of-favour has-beens and rejects to replace one of the superstars they lost, to which Beane obliges. Oakland become the laughing stock of the sport, until they go on a winning run which will soon break all baseball records.<br/><br/>Like I said, I am a football fan, and I love to watch the game. But my love of the game is hampered by feelings of self-loathing as I watch these over-paid primadonnas whine and dive their way around the pitch, while earning more in a week than I will in twenty years for kicking a piece of leather around a pitch for 90 minutes. Billy Beans shares this view. He says 'it's impossible not to be romantic about baseball', but he has watched the sport he loves become merely dollar signs in the eyes of suit-wearing tycoons who treat it as something to play with in their spare time. Beane does not want to simply win a trophy, a ring, or a record, he wants to change the way the game is run.<br/><br/>Pitt became involved in the production way back in 2007, and became almost a labour-of-love for the actor. He also produces as well as giving an impressive performance. It's alarming how he has transformed himself from a mere pretty boy of the 1990's, into a passionate actor and producer, starring in excellent films such as Babel (2006), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and Inglourious Basterds (2009). He received an Oscar nomination for this film, as it's fully deserved, portraying Beane as a mixture of determination, eagerness and concern, as well short-tempered rage. Jonah Hill is also excellent, following his creepy performance in Cyrus (2010) as the dutiful, super-intelligent Brand (he also received an Oscar nomination).<br/><br/>Moneyball is a welcome passion project that goes as far as translating the love of a sport that escapes us Brits. Although there is very little focus on the playing of the sport itself, it makes it clear why the sport is loved so much and is seen in such a romantic light. It does for baseball what the underrated Friday Night Lights (2004) does for American football. The script by superscribes Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin is suitably fast-paced and complex, giving the film a weight and a darkness that made The Social Network (2010) so good (in Sorkin's case). Informative, insightful, and occasionally gripping, UK audiences should not shy away from this film due to the sport, and instead embrace a film that tackles larger issues of greed and class division.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","It's all true. Everything you've heard. MONEYBALL is ""not just another baseball movie."" But, Lord, give me FIELD OF DREAMS, give me LITTLE BIG LEAGUE, even give me ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD. But keep MONEYBALL away.<br/><br/>I will concede that the film looks wonderful. It has rich darks and infinite blacks, excellent shadows, and pale whites. The shots down long bending stadium corridors are magnificently focused and clean. The film even has an incredibly underrated script. It is full of natural dialogue with organic pauses, repetitions, and idiosyncrasies. The words have such strong rhythm.<br/><br/>Why doesn't the story? MONEYBALL is the story of a great film that was murdered in the editing room. At least 15 minutes could have been edited out of the second and third acts. The analytic neatness embedded in the theme is destroyed by disjunct editing that recklessly jumps from scenario to scenario with wobbly confidence. It's as if the editor was just following the script and putting in the first take he or she could find then letting it play until another switch was necessary. It results in a very sloppy picture. I don't like complaining about this, but the movie is ABOUT NUMBERS, MATH, AND ANALYSIS.<br/><br/>Also, MONEYBALL frequently attempts to employ the inspirational music device while talking about using players who have been numerically overlooked by other franchises. First of all, it is cheap emotion. Second, it is cheap metaphor. Third, it is a bad metaphor. The underdog theory and the BPitt/JHill vs. Everyone bout becomes exhausting. The real problem is that there are no stakes.<br/><br/>No stakes. No personal relationships. No attachments. We are even told that the GM isn't supposed to have close relationships with players. The audience is not full of players. We are never given access to anything interesting or sympathetic about these characters. We see a touch of Billy's past and his failure. In fact, Brad Pitt does a fairly good piece of work in this role. It is understated and precise, a much more difficult character than he might generally see. Either way, as the pressure and focus turns onto the players and the game during the final act, the audience is left with nothing on which to hold. MONEBALL fails to establish any kind of emotional pivot and, as a result, a great adaptation and a great story lose popular sympathy even in a brilliantly shot, lit, scripted, and acted work.<br/><br/>54.9"

","I have to admit that Moneyball is one unique baseball film. Usually films are about players like Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, or Dizzy Dean to name three of the most successful players that successful films were made about. But our protagonist/hero is Billy Beane here, a general manager who in his own way adopted a revolutionary approach to baseball that some consider as significant as Branch Rickey inventing the farm system.<br/><br/>Beane is played here by Brad Pitt and he was a journeyman player who was given a scouting job in the Oakland Athletics organization which was the last team he played for. Beane gradually rose through the ranks and was now general manager at the turn of this century. What to do in the way of competing in this day of free agency with teams who have fabulously wealthy and spending owners like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox in the American League.<br/><br/>The answer comes from Jonah Hill who Pitt hires away from the Cleveland Indians organization and the key is on base percentage. However you get on base, hit, walk, error, hit by pitch or the occasional passed ball by a catcher, you're on and in a position to score. No flashy hitters with huge contracts in the Beane system, just get on base and get moved around. <br/><br/>Of course on screen it works and the Oakland Athletics enjoy a sprint of success in the last decade. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and now a lot of teams are copying the Athletics. <br/><br/>I could critique the system, but this is for movie reviews not a sports writer's column. And the film is a tribute to two men and the system they fashioned. Brad Pitt the visionary general manager and Jonah Hill the bean counter statistician who is an integral part of the success.<br/><br/>Moneyball is unfortunately not a film that who are not sports fans or even baseball fans only can really appreciate. Still that's a wide selection of viewers it can relate to. It received six Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Actor for Brad Pitt and Best Supporting Actor for Jonah Hill. There's a nice performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as field manager Art Howe. Hoffman's range continually amazes. You can hardly believe this is the same man who also got an Oscar for playing Truman Capote. He disappears into roles better than any other actor since Paul Muni.<br/><br/>A film for baseball fans, but that's a large audience pilgrim."
"sddavis63","5","1","1","31 January 2012"," Baseball By The Numbers
","My first comment would be to warn people who aren't big baseball fans that this is a baseball movie. In fact, it's not even so much about baseball - it's about the behind the scenes machinations involved in building a baseball team. There's very little onfield action depicted, so unless the idea of watching the management team rather than the players really turns your crank, this likely won't be for you. Personally, I'm not a huge baseball fan. I follow the game, I know the teams and the big name players, but I'm not a fanatic. So I approach this movie from that perspective.<br/><br/>In 2001, the Oakland A's went 102-60, but then lost in the playoffs. They then had several of their best players leave after the season, because they didn't have enough money to pay them, and General Manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) was forced to try to keep the team competitive on what would be generously described as a shoestring budget. Without the money to pay for the best players, Beane recruits a young executive from the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill) and together they try to craft a winning team strictly by the numbers - using in depth statistical analysis to determine not so much the biggest names but the best fits for their particular team, and we watch as the 2002 season unfolds.<br/><br/>There are things about this movie that I liked. Brad Pitt for one. I thought his performance as Beane was very good and very believable. What I also found believable was the tension that rose between Beane and the team's scouts as well as manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) - all of whom were ""old school"" baseball people who didn't understand what Beane and Brand were trying to do and weren't especially co-operative. The behind the scenes look was as interesting as it could be, I suppose - especially the glimpse at how players are rated and evaluated and treated.<br/><br/>But I have to admit that this movie still didn't really appeal to me. First, I'm not a baseball fanatic, and in my opinion this is a niche movie for a niche audience. I appreciated that Beane kept the team winning, but to be honest they didn't actually win anything of importance (and still haven't.) Yes, the team pulled off an amazing 20- game winning streak in 2002, but they lost in the playoffs and as Beane himself said, nothing matters if you don't win the last game of the season. That's true. I'm enough of a baseball fan that I'm sure I noticed in the summer of 2002 that the A's were on a massive, mega- winning streak, but I don't actually remember it 10 years later. I guess in the end that's what really makes me scratch my head over this movie. It's just not especially important. As much as this was supposed to be a new way of building a team - frankly, it doesn't work. With no salary cap, baseball is about money. Yes, the movie suggests that the Boston Red Sox used the system Beane and the A's developed, but it leaves out an important point - the Red Sox used the system - AND MONEY! The title is accurate. Baseball is about money. The American League especially is divided into 3 groups - the Yankees and the Red Sox (one or both of whom will be in the playoffs because they have a lot of money and can buy the best players); their division rivals the Rays, Blue Jays and Orioles, who (aside from a massive upset periodically) can't compete with them over a full 162 game season and who start every season knowing that they're going to end up on the outside looking in; and everybody else, who compete to be the best of the rest and hope to be able to beat the Yankees or Red Sox in a 3 of 5 or 4 of 7 series. <br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie, but I for one thought it was massively over- rated. It's neither overly interesting nor overly important, and why anyone would have thought of it as a nominee for Best Picture I have no idea. (5/10)"
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","6","1","1","16 December 2011"," A nice character study with a great performance.
","Moneyball isn't a baseball movie. Hell, it's not even about baseball. The sport sets itself as the backdrop for a character study about the man behind the curtain; Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's circa 2001. For a film that is so grounded in the American pastime, it's interesting to note that there is only one game that is displayed prominently in the entire film, nearing the end of it's runtime. Moneyball isn't a sports movie, it's about this one man and his road to redemption, bringing us through themes of change and courage and led by a superb performance from Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The film, as written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and directed by Bennett Miller, doesn't lend itself to any of those big Oscar moments you'd expect, but instead finds beauty in restraining itself. Pitt is the perfect actor for their representation of Beane, a combination of charm, humor and bitter resentment towards a system that chewed him up and spit him out as a young man. There's so much going on inside this man and Pitt carries it with the right amount of brooding gravitas, charming charisma and graceful perseverance. He's a delight to watch and he carries a film that could have easily fallen apart without him.<br/><br/>Overall the film was an enjoyable, easy watch that never got a chance to truly shine for me, which I attribute mainly to Bennett Miller's direction. He understands what makes this different from a sports movie but he doesn't give it enough of a spark to make it stand out at all. I wish there had been more of Sorkin's usual sharp dialogue but we got was enjoyable, I just wish they had chosen a director who wasn't so vanilla. It would have been very interesting if Soderbergh had stayed on. There are a few small details that really tore me out of the moment (a brief cameo, the concept that Beane's daughter writes a song that was a pretty popular hit eight years after the movie takes place) but the thing that I think holds it back from getting anywhere sensational is Miller.<br/><br/>Still, that doesn't mean the film is bad at all. In fact, I was surprised by just how good I found it to be. With Pitt taking the lead and a fine supporting cast to back him up (Philip Seymour Hoffman was the only one that I took much notice of, but no one turns in a bad performance), Moneyball is a vintage character piece with a lot of heart. It took about half it's running time before it really picked up steam, but it never managed to bore me or make me check the clock. It's not a tremendous film by any means, but I think it's definitely a pretty good one."
"ticket_for_one","Null","1","1","21 November 2011"," Pitt is just as charismatic as he's always been
","One of the films of the year! I don't know much about Baseball. I know how to play rounders, but not baseball. So when I read the synopsis for this, I thought I'd have a difficult time watching this, trying to understand Baseball's rules and terminology. I absolutely loved this! And if you're a fan of any sports team, I think you'll also love this film. <br/><br/>It's basically about two men Billy Beane (Pitt) and Peter Brand (Hill) who develop a statistical formula that helps them work out how many runs and wins they are can to achieve in a season. The team doesn't have enough money to buy the players they want, so they focus on the players they need and start looking for players who are more likely to contribute towards these wins, rather the future superstars who earn high wages. The idea meets a lot of opposition, from the backroom staff who believe in old school methods to the fans who are tired of underachieving. As the wins come and records are broken, their idea eventually wins over the board, players and the fans. <br/><br/>Performance wise, I can't fault anyone in this. The acting is flawless. Pitt is just as charismatic as he's always been and delivers a really passionate performance in this film. Not a major fan of his but he is brilliant at what he does and I won't be surprised if he gets another nomination in February for this. Philip Seymour Hoffman offers great support as the disgruntled team coach who clashes with Pitt's General Manager and just wants to do his job. Jonah Hill however is the star of this film. I can't stand him in films. I couldn't stand him in Superbad and Funny People. He isn't funny and I've never found him funny. But he's brilliant in this and is funny without being funny even though this is a drama. First time I've seen him in a film and not try and generate laughs with physical comedy. His chemistry with Pitt is spot on, making their scenes together really enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>The film gives an insight in how business is done in the world of baseball. The trading between teams for players and the cuts that need to be made for a team to be successful. Script is wonderfully played and well written. Aaron Sorkin again doing a fine job with the screenplay. Bennett Miller's direction is steady and easy to follow. I particularly liked how the flashback scenes with Pitt's character were filmed. Moneyball is not just a drama about baseball, it's quite inspirational too. There are few clichéd moments in regards to that but none of them cringe worthy. The film flows well from start to finish and no point becomes boring. Even the scenes where Pitt isn't with Jonah Hill and he's alone in his car, having flashbacks or with his daughter are good scenes because Pitt has the presence to make those scenes watchable. All in all it's a great film and one I intend on watching again. Pitt and Hill put in great performances and Miller's direction is likely to be nominated for several awards."
"samkan","6","1","1","13 October 2011"," Well Crafted If At Times Tedious
","I understand this film was based on a book and respect the makers choice to be faithful to such. The movie was very well made, paced, scripted, shot, etc. But I could never get behind Beane's character; i.e., I could never feel his drive, be sympathetic, etc. The fact that there was no score to the movie also detracted from my enjoyment. The topic and circumstances just were/are neither important nor serious enough to warrant the moody, agonizing emotional throes we appear to be encouraged to see. Critically, while I believe Beane built a successful team, I'm unconvinced his data-crunching experiment was strictly responsible for such as the success might have been in spite of it.<br/><br/>The story, topic, etc., would have made an excellent 90 minute light drama with more laughs and a bouncy soundtrack. Such may have been unfaithful to the book but more enjoyable and less pretentious."

","I enjoyed the movie and I would recommended it to others to see. Good enough to go to the theatre and not wait for the DVD. Brad Pitt does a good job of making Billy Beane into a likable guy.<br/><br/>Two problems: 1. Movie ignores that they had three stud young pitchers, that were the true reason for the 20 game winning streak in '02; 2. The movie tries to create the perception that David Justice was picked from the Yankee's junk heep because they did not realize he had value for his ability to get on base. Brad Pitt confronts Justice and makes a statement, that ""New York"" is paying 1/2 his salary not to be there (it is made to seem that ""New York"" was the ""Yankees."") In reality, the Yankees had traded Justice to the Mets for Ventura, and their salaries were a wash, so no money changed.<br/><br/>But it was a good movie!"
"tnbowers1","Null","1","1","25 September 2011"," Moneyball is a great tale of America's favorite past time with a lot of laughs, lessons and most importantly- heart.
","I have to admit, when I first heard about Moneyball I wasn't jumping for joy, or over excited to see it. You see being on the opposite end of the spectrum of a die-hard baseball fan, who wants nothing more than to be in the stands, cheering for their team while, munching on peanuts and hot dogs- -this was just another movie. I thought it was another movie about an underdog sports team who was down and out, but rose to the occasion like a Phoenix rising from the ashes. We've all seen those kinds of movies, the feel good movies that touch your heart and have you leaving the theater believing you can conquer the world. However, shame on me for being quick to judge, because once I sat in that cozy theater chair, I learned the true story of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and the Oakland A's. I guess you can kind of look at this movie as a modern day Rudy, but don't make the mistake I made and think you know how it all unfolds, because there is so much more. Like any great coming of age type story, Moneyball has lessons, laughs, and most importantly- heart. In a film directed by Bennett Miller and produced by Michael De Luca, Rachael Horovitz, and Brad Pitt, the screenplay written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin is brilliantly brought to life and they all do an awesome job of explaining how scouting works, how trade negotiations are done, and basically the overall workings of America's favorite past time. Set in the 2002 baseball season, the Oakland A's, considered a small market team loses their star players, Johnny Damon and Jason Giambi when they sign contracts worth millions of dollars with other teams. That's a huge hit against the team, so now it's up to the A's general manager, amazingly played by Brad Pitt, to find two star players to replace them, with basically pennies to negotiate with. Capturing his spirit and essence as Billy Beane, Brad Pitt puts on an amazing performance as the once major league player turned general manager, who's main duty is to make it work when all the odds are stacked up against them. From his edgy hot headed moments, to his impeccable comedic timing in many scenes with the character Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), Brad Pitt proved once again why he is considered one of the best. And if you ask me, it also doesn't hurt that he's not bad to look at. Now, back to Peter Brand, Jonah Hill's character; I know a lot of you may be thinking, who is Peter Brand? Well, he's a key part to the equation. He was known as Billy Beane's right hand man who's a brainy, number-crunching, Yale-educated economist. Not giving us the usual over the top and in your face funny, the once chubby actor, Jonah Hill dug deep and channeled something totally different in this role. Don't get me wrong, he definitely brought the funny as the supportive side kick, but it was cleverly understated. Driven to win and basically change the game of baseball Pitt as Billy Beane not only shows his heart in scenes with his daughter, but also in scenes with the players. He risked it all and gave his team a fighting chance by taking on the system and thinking outside the box to do it. With the dough of a third string team, Bean and Brand decide to trust the numbers and more importantly trust each other, so they went after players overlooked and dismissed by the rest of baseball because they're too old, too injured, too odd, or just too much trouble. However, they all have undervalued and key skills that make for a great success story. Probably much like the real characters, Pitt and Hill were there so much for each other as actors, at times it felt much like watching the dynamic duo--Batman and Robin (I'm pretty sure you can guess who's Batman). Just even taking the chance to go against the norm in baseball and do things differently brings forth many antagonists, especially from the A's coach played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. But even through the trials, Beane's mission to change the game of baseball as we've always known it, not only did just that, but it also changed him. In the end, the 133 minutes of the PG-13 movie left me, the least interested person in baseball, wanting more."
"sanghvi4","4","3","6","8 December 2011"," Was expecting so much more from this movie
","After reading all the positive reviews I was looking forward to watching this movie. However, this movie was a disappointment. The biggest problem with the movie is that the characters are not properly developed and as a result the audience has no emotional attachment. Good sports movies create a strong connection with their audience, but this movie fails to do that. Brad Pitt wasn't that great in the movie. Jonah Hill did a good job. However, when it boils down to it this is just another typical sports movie. Nothing special or amazing. You don't get that feel good from other movies such as The Blind Side or We Are Marshall."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","1 October 2011"," A Different Kind of Sports Movie
","Moneyball (2011) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The true story of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who after his team is eliminated by the New York Yankees decides he has to come up with a way to compete without spending the money. Enter a Yale graduate (Jonah Hill) who has come up with a way for a small-market team to get players without paying the high price tag. MONEYBALL isn't your typical sports movie. Most sports films would concentrate on the players or have an inspirational coach but this time we take a look at the behind-the-scenes stuff that most fans never get to see. What makes MONEYBALL so fascinating really isn't the personal story of Beane but instead it's the day-to-date operations of a General Manager. I think most of those not familiar with baseball are going to enjoy the story of Beane who must fight a few of his own demons while trying to field a winning team. What is going to be so interesting to baseball fans is seeing how a General Manager goes about making trades, cutting players and how he must determine the best way to field a winning team. Of course, it doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Brad Pitt who once again proves why he's one of the most interesting actors working today. Pitt was always great playing these laid-back types and that calm and collective nature really shines here. I really enjoyed the way Pitt goes about playing not only Beane's demons but also how he eventually comes to enjoy what he's doing. Hill is also very good in his part and I enjoyed the light comic touches he brought to the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is also very good in his role of the manager but I do feel that the screenplay doesn't do enough with his character. The same is true for Robin Wright; a fine performance but the screenplay does nothing with her role. Those who follow baseball will know how this season in the film turns out but this really doesn't take away from the entertainment. There's some nice human drama along the way and baseball fans will certainly like all the famous names being dropped. MONEYBALL isn't your typical sports movie but it's a fascinating look at parts of the sports we never see."

Watching him alone was worth the admission ticket. One of my favorite quote of the movie, ""I hate losing more than I love winning, and there's a difference!"" <br/><br/>This movie mixed intelligent conversations, flowing pace and excellent cinematography together. It makes this movie a home run. I think suffice to say, as a non baseball fan, it is one of the best movie I have watched.

It had a very depressing feel, from the scenery to the interaction between characters.

","When I went to watch the movie, I was expecting the usual sports based movie where the hero is a sportsman who has some personal problems throughout the movie and an important final match will be the climax where the hero begins poorly, but makes a turnaround once after another important character(his gf, coach or family members) comes to the stadium and talks with him during the game and eventually wins the match. But, MONEYBALL GAVE ME THE HUMBLE PIE. This is totally different in a good way.<br/><br/>I am from India and I am not a big baseball fan, but still I know how it is played and I am aware of the jargons used in the game. That was more than enough to understand the movie. As everyone would know, the movie is based on a book and tells the story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and how he formed a formidable team from the meager budget he received from the team owners.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Brad Pitt does the character with ease. His body language during the Rincon transfer scene and when he talks in the scout meeting is just perfect. But, the person who steal the show is Jonah Hill. Atlast, he has done a role that does justice to his potential. His delivers the dialogues with ease with really good facial expressions and mannerism. Philip Seymour Hoffman, though has a small role, does it perfectly.<br/><br/>Screenplay is the king here. This movie moves away from the usual sports movie stuff and stays in line with what happened during that season for Oakland. There is not a single moment of cliché. Technically also, the movie stays upto the mark with really good cinematography and direction. The way in which the games are captured is also awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, this sports movie doesn't have much scenes from the actual sports. But still engages you throughout.

"jeromec-2","8","2","4","18 December 2011"," Good but very cerebral
","I have heard it said that the most nerdy sport of all is baseball. I believe that to be true. If a math major is going to be interested in a game, the usual choice is baseball.<br/><br/>It is a statistician's delight. Hockey (by comparison) has only a few well known stats and few are published routinely. Hockey might be more exciting to watch, but baseball is a much tenser spectator experience. Will the pitcher out maneuver the batter or will the batter dominate the pitcher? The question hangs in the air as the pitcher absent mindedly scuffs the rubber on the mound and the batter takes a practice swing and sets his stance. Who wins, what are the odds, what history do these two have, how hot is the day, which way is the wind going, who's in a slump, who's not, who can throw nothing but blinding fastballs, who has a slider that looks like it can be hit into the parking lot of Yankee stadium until it winds up in the catcher's mitt? And as the seconds drag on, all these questions are discussed between people who may never meet again.<br/><br/>But these statistics are kindergarten level questions when Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) opens up his computer and starts really classifying data, using factorials, permutations, combinations and z scores and goodness knows what other statistical mysteries known only to the nerdiest of nerds.<br/><br/>Peter is the obvious genius, but there is someone else in the movie who is unusual. His skill certainly ranks above talent. He is driven primarily, it seems, by working a new angle in Baseball, an angle that he himself has no idea where to begin looking. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) knows the answer is somewhere, but he does not know where. There has to be some way to replace the individual ""hero"" of baseball. If you loose someone like (say) Mickey Mantle in your line up, do you look for another Mantle or do you seek a collection of players that individually come no where near Mantle's skill and ability but as a collection of players who can add up to Mantle? Do you go for the individual or the group? Prior to Beane the answer was the Yankee model. You go for a Dimaggio to replace Ruth and Gehrig and a Mantle for a Dimaggio.<br/><br/>Beane changed all that when he looked for a group that could somehow work together and together do what looked like it was an impossibility: put together a winning team that was made entirely of average (affordable) players that collectively could deliver an amazing result, an unexpected one, one that would grab the imagination of a fan base that could not believe the results until records that had stood for years were broken. Day after day the fans were treated to a lengthening of the consecutive wins record. It gave them heart and it gave them courage.<br/><br/>The movie does the same thing. It is all metaphor for collective cooperation rather than individual heroics. We see a man who recognized the gift of someone else and was not at all threatened by it. The two central characters work with each other, each understanding what the other knew and each deeply respecting it.<br/><br/>I took off 2 points for the music at the end. I cannot imagine why the director used it. Nothing justifies it."
"KineticSeoul","7","2","4","29 September 2011"," Baseball business
","One reviewer I read claimed this movie goes in a approach similar to ""The Social Network"". This movie isn't really about a baseball team overcoming difficult odds while working as a team, but has to do with the sport outside of the field. The more business side of things where they trade and have conference to win in the game of baseball. And the plot basically revolves around Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt. Who is a general manager for a baseball team. Brad puts on a good performance as a charismatic manager you can't help but like. Although he seemed to try a bit too hard to come off as the cool manager that loves baseball. But his acting was spot on, just didn't stood out to me all that much nor was it all that memorable. Jonah Hill has been getting a lot of praise for his role and I thought he did a good job, nothing all that outstanding but alright. This is a well crafted film and very well directed, the thing is I really am not a fan of baseball so I didn't give a crap about the topic at hand. Maybe that was the case but this movie didn't really grab my attention or emotions, I could sit through it easily for the first watch but just didn't care what happened on screen. Some of the characters even seemed a bit off at times and not believable, like Beane's daughter for one who seemed to care about her dad's job security a bit too much at times. Anyways if your a big fan of baseball, there is a high chance it will grab your attention and actually want to see what is going on. Like the movie ""The Social Network"" though this is more of a character driven movie that shows what Beane had to go through during the process of the plan that uses stats instead of the traditional way. Instead of delving deeper into the process itself, which was fine for me since I don't care about baseball. To sum it up this is a well crafted movie that the audience will enjoy if they actually care about the sport. It was kind of cool to see a guy trying to reinvent the sport. Although stubborn people that are against change because of the fear of being irrelevant and narrow mindedness tried to hold him down.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Using modern technology and math instead of scouting to rate players he signs of team of ""nobodys"". Being a huge baseball fan I was very much looking forward to this movie, this movie was even better then I was hoping for. Written by the writers of ""Social Network"" it has roughly the same feel. Watching what a GM goes through on a day by day basis gave me new appreciation for what they do, and to watch Bean struggle with making a team with the lowest payroll in the league to try and compete with teams like the Yankees who have almost 100,000,000 dollars a year more is impressive. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie has nothing to do with the movie itself. Going in I knew enough history about what happened with this team and Beane himself that the tense moments and hard decisions lost some of the effect on me. But that in no way hurt my enjoyment of the movie, and for those that don't know as much about this it will have the effect it went for. On a side note Pitt and Hill have the same chemistry that Cloony and Pitt had in the ""Oceans 11"" movies and that makes it more fun to watch. Overall, one of the best movies about sports (not just baseball) I have ever seen. There is also enough in this that even if you are not a baseball fan you will still really enjoy this.

It's both a parable for (hang on to your hats) the impasse of the political system in the age of the Freakout and the Talking Head, and a reminder that individual conscience ultimately controls your own fate.<br/><br/>Some disclaimers. First off, the book only loosely uses the book ""Moneyball"" for its text, sort of the way a good Sunday sermon starts out with a passage from the bible and then pulls in all sorts of more topical and contemporary information to make a new interpretation. Those of you looking for, say, the long sequence in the book about the celebrated ""Moneyball"" amateur draft will find it missing. It necessarily takes an ensemble of real-world characters and reduces it to some amalgams (the Jonah Hill character). And it ignores a lot of the baseball nuance that the numbers open up -- from the contributions of Mulder, Hudson, and Zito to the true meaning of plate discipline. It has to, because otherwise the story and the theme would get lost in the details. For that reason, the book still stands on its own and is recommended, while the movie is going to stand on its own for those who haven't read it.<br/><br/>But this is the kind of remarkable thing: I knew how everything was going to turn out. I knew about the A's winning streak and how the improbable record was set. I knew how the season ended (I was at several of the games) and how and why Billy Beane ended up staying in Oakland, neither fired nor hired away, and why he's still there. And yet I was still riveted by this movie and the way the story unfolded.<br/><br/>There is one sort of semi-sports-cliché montage towards the end of the movie, but it ends very much against expectation. Similarly, the filmmakers pay with the cliché of the ""big locker room pep talk"" scene, so hackneyed in almost every other sports movie. And they sort of tease by limiting the on-field action to just the bare minimum; just as Billy Beane didn't like to watch the games in person, the on-field story of the A's is not depicted as the central subject matter.<br/><br/>I have no idea how this movie is going to do. For those looking for a traditional baseball/sports movie, it's completely unique -- more like Downhill Racer than Rocky. For those looking for the business-cum-statshead movie, it's not there - such a thing is unfilmable. For those looking for the riotous comedy the previews promise -- well, there's plenty of humor, but it's far dryer and more subtle than the trailers suggest, and a comedy, it is not. For those looking for a treacly he-did-it-all-for-his-daughter money-isn't-everything heartstrings movie, well, the theme is there but it's pretty understated and intelligent - there's no violins.<br/><br/>The visuals for this movie are going to probably not get mentioned a lot, but I think they're the key to understanding the breadth of the ambition of the movie. We get a lot of ""real"" baseball scenes -- but they're in the mode of the empty concrete hallways of the Oakland Coliseum, the emptiness of the park after hours, the crappy locker rooms. Even the scene at Fenway Park -- really shot there, and looking more like the ""real"" Fenway than any other movie I've seen that uses it as a backdrop - is done with the park empty and covered with a cold rain that suggests austerity. In the meantime, we get glimpses of the ""real"" Oakland - working class, full of empty landscapes and ship loading equipment and power lines (without those visuals taking any focus away from the character-driven story) that seem to ably reflect the feeling of being in America in 2011 (not the 2002 in which the story takes place).<br/><br/>I suspect many reviews will focus on this as the ""story of Billy Beane"" and it's entirely true that as a character, he seizes the story front and center, and Brad Pitt's (definitely Oscar-worthy) performance deserves a lot of attention. Certainly the use of flashbacks (also not done in a terribly hackneyed way, kudos) to underscore Billy's motivations -- which are complex, but may simply boil down to wishing to be a success in a way true to his nature, instead of the conventional wisdom crowd's desire to merely avoid being a failure -- is nicely done.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a brilliant film because it works on at least three levels. It's a reasonable exposition of how an idea changed the game of baseball, not about the people who came up with the idea so much as how the idea wormed its way in. It's not quite a documentary, but it's close in that sense, and should be illuminating for people who don't know that story (and perhaps will send them back to Moneyball, the book, and hopefully the original source material.) On another level, it's a compelling story about one person, not exactly a put-upon working class schmo, in the persona of Billy Beane. And on the larger level, it's certainly a hint about how people have to find their way in a larger system of economics, personality, and politics that is frequently soul-deadening and perplexing and offers few cut-and-dried solutions to the nuanced and complex problems of the world."
"drew_atreides","9","2","4","25 September 2011"," Entertaining film, though it does dodge some issues...
","Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill make for a very entertaining, likable dynamic duo, and the character actors they've chosen to fill out the rest of the cast all work great together with the leads. <br/><br/>I question the authenticity of everything that is put on display here, but i do have to admit that this makes for a very entertaining ""what if?"" look into the world of a General Manager. Are they this impulsive? Are they truly more critical to the operation of a team then a manager is? This film paints the Manager as being a rather useless facade of a position.<br/><br/>I do find it a bit glaring that they don't even mention the fact that the A's had a three-headed monster of Tim Hudson-Barry Zito-Mark Mulder that was unarguably the most dominant pitching trio of that era. <br/><br/>With pitching in baseball, your team ALWAYS has a chance. This movie tries to paint the picture that Oakland didn't stand a prayer after losing Damon, Giambi and Isringhausen. With that pitching trio, they were always in competition.<br/><br/>Also, dodging the Steroid issue and it's importance to Beane's MONEYBALL theoretics is a bit disingenuous. <br/><br/>Still, it is a very entertaining film. Great performances from Pitt and Hill.<br/><br/>I liked the movie. I don't know that it's entirely factual, but it does make for an interesting glimpse into the General Manager's world."
"Bravesfan17","10","2","4","23 September 2011"," Very well done baseball film
","Moneyball is a very well done film about the game of baseball and the challenges that must be overcome in order to win. The film starts with the Oakland A's in the 2001 ALDS (American League Division Series) against the New York Yankees. The A's blew the lead in the series and end up losing. The most talked about subject in the matter is how the Yankees have a huge payroll while the A's have less than $40 million. Now the A;s have lost their star players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen) to teams with bigger wallets. In the offseason, A's GM Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is talking with his scouts about how they keep talking the same things they have in years past where they are looking for players that are just as good to fill in the voids. After a trade proposal with the Cleveland Indians doesn't work, Beane notices a young man who turns out to know his baseball material named Peter Brant (Jonah Hill). After being impressed by his knowledge, Beane hires Brant to be his assistant. Now it is their mission to find players who are good, competitive, can win games, and be an affordable team to put on the field.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller, whose only other film was 2005's Capote, was an excellent choice to direct this film. Miller knew how to keep a consistent pace. He also did well at making there be a light tone at times, but also be serious about the subject matter. Most importantly, Miller's best work was being able to tell a story as he shows us what Beane is going through at work and in his personal life. He is also great at showing what the team goes through in their triumphs and struggles.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's best performance is his role in this film as Billy Beane. Pitt does great at showing how Billy Beane works in his struggles at work and at home as he doesn't get to see his daughter that much. Pitt also is great at showing Billy trying to take his mind off of what is happening on the field. Pitt makes Beane into a well-rounded, likable character and proves that he is one of the best living actors out there.<br/><br/>This film also has Jonah Hill's best performance to date as Peter Brant, Billy Beane's assistant. Hill shows that he can do more than play his crazy characters from films like Get Him to the Greek and Superbad. At the same time, Hill is a great comic relief as he helps make the film light in parts. The best part of Hill's performance is how his lines prove that Brant knows what he is talking about.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe. Hoffman does a good job in this role, but it is not as memorable a role compared to Capote or Freddie Miles in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Hoffman makes some good choices as an actor on this role, as he is working again from an Aaron Sorkin script, and knows what the role required.<br/><br/>As stated Aaron Sorkin, whose work includes A Few Good Men and The Social Network, was one the writers on this script. Sorkin proved again how he can take material that people might not take seriously, turn it into something exciting, and make what the characters have to say be something important.<br/><br/>As a huge baseball fan, this was a treat to watch. If you are not a baseball fan, it is still well worth watching. If you do not know a whole lot about baseball, it is a film that you will find interesting."

"harrylosborne","7","0","0","8 March 2019"," A film showing science's place in sports
","Moneyball is a slow-paced but intricate true sports biopic, highlighting Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) exploitation of a gap in baseball by utilising statistical analyses above all else. This film makes the little dramas more meaningful, building character development whilst remaining faithful to the source story. The message is ultimately portraying the unlikeliness of financially vulnerable teams making it anywhere in competitions today, but also gives insight into one of the true underdogs in sports history.<br/><br/>A consistent soundtrack adds pathos to the more meaningful scenes, not relying on dramatic plot twists to propel the story, and helped by accurately reconstructed scenes from baseball history. Brad Pitt is strong in his role, and this film also features Chris Pratt and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The standout, however, is clearly Jonah Hill: his innocent voice and quiet intelligence perfectly depict the revolutionary thinking of a modern genius.<br/><br/>Family matters and intra-team disputes take a back seat in Moneyball, but the true story background allows this to not become meandering, making this film a worthwhile watch, particularly for sporting fans."

","Funny, uplifting, fascinating and touching. I would settle for less! An underdog glory story, based on real events! Ever felt abandoned or rejected for reasons of race, gender, looks or certain individual flaws? ""Moneyball"" is a wonderful, uplifting story about looking past race, gender or individual flaws in sports. It's much bigger than just a ""simple"" sports story though.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" is a drama about a small baseball team managed by Brad Pitt, who accidentally discovers the incredible power of computer statistics in analysing new sports talents. Common practice nowadays, but revolutionary back then. One team (managed by Brad Pitt) was the first to use it and they shocked the entire sports industry. That is a terrific story in itself, but what makes this story much more interesting to me other then the revolutionary computer tactics, is the struggle to become the best AND the RISK of losing everything. THAT'S the real drama behind this movie!<br/><br/>This glorious underdog story is being portrayed with magnificent acting AND directing performances with photography and images that are just to die for. IMAGES are EMOTIONS in Moneyball! This cinema photographer (cameraman) called Wally Pfister (remember that name AND fame) is creating continuous pictures that are just TO DIE FOR. He has filmed brilliant, massively popular classics like ""Memento"", and ""The Dark Knight"" His images TOUCH my heart! Very much ADORE it!<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" is a true winner, which really touched me deeply from the get go. Because it has it's heart upon it's sleeve. It's in your face, but in a real, heartfelt, true to life kind of way. Okay, this movies story is about baseball, but this stories spirit, is bigger than simply another sports movie. It's about love. About giving everything, about risking everything you believe in. Very touching and endearing. Wonderful actor's gem."

","""Moneyball"" isn't the typical sports film in which an outcast lead character with the odds stacked against him manages to be victorious in the end. It's a film where, like almost everything in life, the main focus is one and how our world revolves around it. Baseball is an American classic, and with Bennett Miller's interesting and strong film about a failing baseball team in the MLB, we see the politics and business behind this classic game. Brad Pitt gives a great performance who has great on-screen charisma and a euphoric chemistry with Jonah Hill. Pitt does a good job of not overdoing the emotional aspects of his character, yet showing a heart behind his snark attitude. ""Moneyball"" is a different look at baseball and one that delivers a different and delightful story."

","I was raised in a family where softball was everything. Not being a crazy sport movie buff, I was reluctant to watch Moneyball, but it's different from most sports movies. We don't get pointless montages of the players training or team mates having altercations. Instead, we are told the story of a coach piecing together a team and doing so with little to nothing. It's a different approach to a sports movie, and yes, it's pretty predictable, but what Moneyball does, it does well. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are dynamite in their leading characters, the film is boosted by the crisp editing, and the topic of financial difficulties. With so much running time I wish we would've seen more of the skimmed scenes shown in montages in Act 3; but regardless, Moneyball is just a really well constructed movie that isn't made for simply the fans of the genre.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"Uriah43","6","0","0","17 January 2013"," A Good Baseball Story
","I've always been partial to a good baseball movie and this one certainly fits that category. Essentially, this story is about a small-market team (the Oakland Athletics) which cannot compete with teams like the New York Yankees who are willing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the best players around. Recognizing this the general manager, ""Billy Beane"" (Brad Pitt) hires an unknown adviser named ""Peter Brand"" (Jonah Hill) from the Cleveland Indians who specializes on finding undervalued talent. Against severe criticism from his scouts and coaching staff they deliberately bypass well known players in search of inexpensive athletes who have been largely overlooked in the process. At any rate, rather than give the story away I will just say that this film does a fine job in showcasing the risk that Billy Beane took to stay competitive. I thought both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill did excellent jobs in their respective roles. However, I would have liked to have seen more baseball and less of the personal drama in Billy Beane's life as it took away from the overall feel of the movie. But in any case this was a good movie that should appeal to those who like a good baseball story."

","With the best players playing the right way, a team is assured a victory. But if the best players are too expensive, do you simply take who you can get and give in? Or have you been overlooking quality players simply because conventional wisdom said you should?<br/><br/>Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) is General Manager of the Oakland A's and after losing the last game of the season against the Yankees, three of his star players leave for more lucrative contracts. He'd hoped to match their offers, but the owner couldn't afford it. Then, while looking for a trade at the Cleveland Indians' headquarters, he noticed his counterpart appeared to be taking direction from someone he'd never seen before. After the meeting he approaches Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), the one person he didn't know in that meeting who seemed to be calling the shots. Brand and Beane soon have a rapport and before long Brand is Beane's second-in-command despite serious resistance from the rest of the staff in the Manager's office who feel Brand is a threat to the team and the game itself.<br/><br/>Sabermetrics has had wide-reaching and long-lasting effects on the game of baseball from supposedly ending the Red Sox losing streak to posthumously exonerating fabled great ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson. The story is interesting and Jonah Hill acting way outside his comfort zone is, to say the least, adequate. Brad Pitt also plays his part well as he often does, regardless of the material. That said, at two hours and thirteen minutes, the film feels too long. I don't say that because I believe all movies should be shorter than this, but I do believe this one should've been shorter."
"Twins65","6","0","0","5 September 2012"," I guess starting pitching and Miguel Tejeda really didn't matterjust give me a team of Hattebergs, Mabrys & Bradfords and we'll win 100 games?!?
","First off, I've never read the book. I am really familiar with it, as it's been talked about pretty much non-stop in baseball circles since it came out, but I don't know how much starting pitching was addressed on the page. I'd like to also consider myself well versed in the thinking of Bill James and his ideas on winning baseball. Hell, I think I bought one of his Bill James Abstracts almost 25 years ago, so his whole OBS strategy is fully ingrained in my consumption of winning baseball.<br/><br/>That being stated, and even though I'm pretty sure this has to have been touched on already, how the hell can the stellar 2002 Oakland A's starting pitching BE COMPLETELY IGNORED in this movie? Their top three starters (Tim Hudson, Barry Zito & Mark Mulder) collectively went 57-21, with 675 combined innings and ERA just under 3.0. And this was at the height of baseball's so-called STEROID ERA!! Granted, starting pitchers' win-loss records at times can be somewhat misleading, as you need consistent run support, solid defense, and great relief pitching to end up with a winning % like that. Still, these guys solidly pitched approx. 46% of the A's innings for the SEASON in which they won 103 games, and weren't mentioned here at all. I guess they did show the back of Hudson's jersey once, as he was the starter in that wild game where they won their 20th straight, but that's it! Zito even won the AL Cy Young Award in 2002, which helped him eventually procure a ridiculous contract from SF which he'll never come close to living up to, but I digress.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie-makers decided to only champion the role-players, who in fairness, really stepped up and delivered solid seasons. But Tejeda's MVP season (""performance enhanced or not"") was also ignored. You can't ignore a shortstop who plays all 162 games, hits .308 with 34 homers and 131 ribbies!! YOU JUST CAN'T!! <br/><br/>All said, MONEYBALL is a well-made movie which ultimately came up short, just like the A's did in 2002."

Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright are too briefly on screen. Jonah Hill does good acting, but his part is often numb. The other performances and just average and some characters add nothing to the logic of the plot (Pitt / Beane's family, for example).<br/><br/>As for the script, it is slow at times, and the ending is too protracted and odd.

","I write this as a person who is not a baseball fan. That's not to say I dislike the game, I just don't pay much attention to it. So I come to bat (yes, I know, dumb pun) as a movie fan, not a baseball fan.<br/><br/>I struggled through some parts of this film because of not knowing some of what they were talking about as they sat around the table discussing which players to buy. But having that understanding is only helpful, not required to enjoy this film. Because what this film is about is having a different person take a look at some thing (in this case baseball) from a different perspective. And, as a retired school principal, that's a concept I do understand.<br/><br/>Frankly, the other thing this movie is about is Brad Pitt. Most of the actors and actresses Americans have adored have a persona that shows through in almost all of their roles. Take Cary Grant. We went to the movies to see Cary Grant...not specifically the character he played. During an interview, Dean Martin was once asked something along the lines of, ""It seems like you're always playing Dean Martin."" To which Dean replied, ""Who do you want me to play -- Laurence Olivier?"" No, we went to Dean's film to see Dean. But when I think back to some of Brad Pitt's most memorable roles, I can't find the same old Brad in each one. He's always been different. He's been the character. I don't see a connection in persona between Benjamin Button, Heinrich Harrer, Tristan Ludlow, and Billy Beane. In each film he is a different person...and most important of all, he is BELIEVABLE. And that's what really makes this film work.<br/><br/>In terms of the rest of the cast, Jonah Hill deserves special note. What a fine and atypical performance. On the other hand, Philip Seymour Hoffman is an actor I usually don't want to like, but usually end up respecting for his performances. This time I was not impressed. Was he supposed to play a slug? Recommended, though perhaps not as great as I had been led to believe."
"TheSquiss","7","0","0","16 June 2012"," Brad Pitt does baseball, Jonah Hill does maths & Moneyball does depth.
","Moneyball is about baseball and mathematics.<br/><br/>I don't understand baseball; it seems to me to be a more complicated version of rounders but with a bigger bat, more rules and a globally renowned tournament called the World Series in which only America may enter.<br/><br/>As for maths, well, Mr. Barnicot will tell you it and I were never great friends.<br/><br/>The film is based on actual events, although I have no idea how much has been fictionalised.<br/><br/>But none of this matters because, beyond all of the above, Moneyball is a film about vision, about passion, about making a stand, about losing and having another go with whatever limited resources are at your disposal. It's about relationships and being bloody-minded even when the vast majority thinks you're delusional and inept but having the confidence to know, not merely believe, that you are right.<br/><br/>The film works because of the heavyweights putting their best work into it. Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian have written a script that can be understood by even those who have never seen a baseball diamond. It's a screenplay that is brought to life with sincere and beautifully restrained performances by its stars, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill, and supporting cast, notably Phillip Seymour Hoffman. In other hands, each of these characters may have been played more emphatically and with greater decibels but the performers never veer towards pantomime. Hill is particularly engaging with his restrained portrayal of a young man with an unproven theory in an environment where he is almost universally resented.<br/><br/>Director Bennett Miller has delivered a film that may well slip under the radar due to sheer number of high-profile films on release at this time of year, but even if you wait for it on DVD, this is a film you shouldn't write off simply because of a lack of knowledge of sport.<br/><br/>Let me start again. Moneyball is about a baseball team with no money to buy players, mutinous staff and a General Manager who brings in a kid with a degree from Yale and a notion that nobody but the GM wants to hear. Forget the baseball. Go with it and be inspired by a man with determination and a great understanding of that old fashioned ideal: Loyalty.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

","What on earth is Aaron Sorkin playing at? First he succeeded in glamorising IT nerds in his screenplay for The Social Network. Now he's at it again, glorifying nerds in another movie, Moneyball, which tells the story of how statistical analysis revolutionised baseball. The moneyball concept – using performance metrics to gain a competitive sporting advantage – is relatively well known on this side of the pond. The million-dollar question is whether Moneyball could be successfully transplanted to football.<br/><br/>The film, which opened in the UK last week, is based on Michael Lewis' bestselling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The hero of the story is Oakland Athletics baseball coach Billy Beane, who successfully used 'outsider' performance data or sabermetrics – a term derived from the acronym Society for American Baseball Research – to recruit players who were overlooked by old-fashioned 'insider' scouting knowledge. It wasn't that baseball had completely eschewed statistics. Rather, the new metrics deployed by Beane, such as on-base percentage, proved more effective than traditional indicators, like batting averages. Beane's use of performance data to unearth gems from college baseball paid considerable dividends. In 2002, the Oakland Athletics were able to compete with powerful rivals, such as the New York Yankees, whose salary budgets were three times as high. The moneyball approach was game changing. Today, most of the big baseball teams employ full- time sabermetric analysts.<br/><br/>In the film, Brad Pitt performs the part of Billy Beane. It's a cynical piece of casting, a blow for nerd supremacy. Will it wow British audiences? Judging by my wife's point-blank refusal even to consider a trip to the cinema, this might not be a film for the ladies. For her, even top-drawer Hollywood eye-candy isn't sufficient to sweeten the unpalatable mix of sport plus statistics. Maybe I should have pretended that the film was based on a long-lost Akira Kurosawa screenplay about a group of unheralded samurai warriors recruited by a number-crunching monk. Anyhow, I digress. Although the missus wasn't interested, Moneyball will appeal to the swelling ranks of statistic-obsessed football fans. The successes of Fantasy Football Leagues and the computer game Championship Manager attest to the popularity among geeky men – and it is predominantly a bloke thing - of performance data as a tool for predicting footballing success.<br/><br/>But, while Opta stats might enable laptop managers to achieve virtual success on Championship Manager, could data analysis be a recipe for winning real silverware? Billy Beane believes that football's version of sabermetrics is out there waiting to be discovered. 'Every business has metrics that correlate to success', Beane recently told the BBC. 'It's just finding them and which ones are the most valuable and which ones do you invest in and which ones you get a return on.' It's certainly true that some performance data is now considered indispensible in professional football. Most top clubs now use Prozone analytical tools to evaluate player performance and design individually tailored training regimes. Damien Comolli, Liverpool's director of football, is both a friend of Beane and a fan of his methods – though, as Gabriele Marcotti recently observed in The Times (London), 'it's hard to see how Liverpool's summer signings fall into the moneyball category'. Marcotti has a point. Is splashing £35million on Andy Carroll evidence of smart stats or just an old-fashioned hunch?<br/><br/>Arsene Wenger is another well-known stats obsessive. 'Technical superiority can be measured', Wenger has said. 'In the past, it was just about feelings, opinions. I wanted to know a little bit more. I am always in the situation where I have to judge people, and the more concrete, objective numbers you have the better you can achieve that.' Wenger places a great premium on passing speed and, consequently, he measures the average time players spend on the ball. Less time on the ball indicates better technique.<br/><br/>Prozone or Opta can be useful for measuring some aspects of performance, such as fitness or passing accuracy. But, unlike baseball or cricket, which are comprised of a series of individual episodes of play, football is a relatively fluid and complex game which makes metrics for individual player performance much more difficult to devise. How do you measure movement off the ball, positional awareness, defensive concentration, good decision-making or tactical nous? Fabio Capello recently said that he could tell from the England warm-up that his players weren't in the right frame of mind. Can Prozone tell you that? It's easy to ridicule conventional scouting wisdom but, while there are metrics for fitness or passing accuracy, the old methods are still better for assessing whether a player has the hunger or drive to succeed, whether he has a good football brain, whether he is a leader on the pitch or whether he is mentally tough. There are too many subjective success factors such as these which are nigh on impossible to quantify.<br/><br/>I'm all for using analytical tools to aid coaching. However, I find it reassuring that no one has yet discovered a moneyball-style winning formula. Success in football is determined by attributes such as character or creativity and this can't be measured so easily. Football is still more art than science. The title will never be won by algorithms. The nerds will never take over."

","About ten minutes into Moneyball it becomes pretty clear you're on solid ground. The performances are all assured, with Jonah Hill particularly impressive as he makes the leap from comedy to drama. It is however the script that's the real star here. Given the subject matter, Sorkin and Zaillian have done well to craft a screenplay that does justice to this gripping true story. With snappy dialogue and a well judged pace, the endless talk about statistics and trading players feels effortlessly compelling, even if, like me, you have no knowledge of baseball whatsoever. Having obviously recognised the strength of the material, Bennett Miller wisely keeps things simple. Employing an unfussy, classic approach, this is a good story, well told.<br/><br/>www.second-take.com"

"ben_west89","5","0","0","12 April 2012"," Rookie mistake
","Based on the book Moneyball: The art of winning an unfair game by Michael Lewis, Moneyball charts the true story of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), controversial general manager of struggling baseball team The Oakland A's. With a budget, three times smaller than some of his rivals; Beane must build a new team for the start of the 2002 season. Coupled with the departure of three of his star players, Beane has his work cut out. Billy's luck changes through a chance meeting with Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a Yale economics graduate and statistician. Brand encourages Beane to use a sabermetric, that is to say statistical approach to buying baseball players. <br/><br/>It will be hard for me, a person with no prior exposure to Baseball, to write a fair review for Moneyball. From the start the film is awash with baseball jargon and statistics and as a result long periods of this film were for me as interesting as the word sabermetric. Audiences can enjoy films jam packed with technical, nonsense terms take Star Trek for the ultimate example. Crucial though is the fact that the plot hinges on these terms. If, like me, you do not know what getting 'on base' is then forget trying to piece a coherent story out of this film. (It means by the way: 'a measure of how often a batter reaches base for any reason other than a fielding error, fielder's choice, dropped/uncaught third strike, fielder's obstruction, or catcher's interference.') – oh right. <br/><br/>The dynamic between Pitt and Hill is by far the most enjoyable part of the film, they bounce off each other with ease and at times their dialogue had the wit and snap that you would expect from an Aaron Sorkin screenplay (The Social Network). The phone negotiations over the player Ricardo Rincon is a particularly slick scene. <br/><br/>Critics have lauded Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the team manager Art Howe and I have to admit he did not put a foot wrong. He was hardly stretching his measurable acting ability though; being required to fold his arms on their belly and look disgruntled for almost the entirety of the film. <br/><br/>The pace of the film is slow and meditative not least because we join Billy as he mulls over a decision he made as a young man to turn down a Stanford University scholarship to pursue professional baseball. We are shown flashbacks of his decision and the consequences. This gave the film some nice depth but by this point I was losing interest in the story and the characters. I could not engage with the story when it was awash with jargon and terminology which were alien to me. <br/><br/>The tenacity that was displayed by some individuals to get this film into production is quite astounding. The rights for the book being bought back in 2004 and being passed through the hands of three directors. I struggle to understand the resonance that this tale of stats must have for the filmmakers involved. <br/><br/>Director Steven Sonerberg acknowledged that the challenge of making Moneyball into a film: 'to dramatise and make interesting a book about statistics'. For me, they did not rise to that challenge."

","Nominated for 6 Oscars, Moneyball is based on the true story of the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, and his underdog team that almost made it to the championship in 2002. The General Manager at the time, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, had to make drastic changes to his teams lineup, due to the fact that the A's had no money to pay for their star players. When it came time to scout for new players, the rest of the staff was doing things the old way. Billy Beane and his new Assistant G.M., Peter Brand saw baseball a whole different way. Based on the books by baseball writer and historian, Bill James; Peter had come up with a system based on math, to theoretically draft the best baseball team at a much smaller cost.<br/><br/>Billy Beane himself was an MLB player, and started his career out at the New York Mets. It started his senior year in high school, when he was offered a full ride to Stanford to play baseball, but he chose to go to the New York Mets instead. What the scouts did not realize is that he was not cut out to actually play in the major leagues. Whether it was his confidence level, or just pure luck that he made it that far. It was made clear to him after he had been traded multiple times that he was not cut out for the major leagues.<br/><br/>His story as a teenager is similar in many ways to his career as a General Manager, and that is what Moneyball effectively accomplishes. Since the beginning of baseball, scouts have been using the same techniques and statistics to find the best players, and it does not always work. Billy saw this at a young age, and it affected him the rest of his life. The scouts saw him statistically as the best player to join the major leagues, but what they could not find out is how he was actually going to turn out under pressure, and what type of person Billy was going to become as he grew up. Peter's new way of finding players for the major league still used statistics of course, but it ruled out certain aspects, such as, age, weight, injuries etc. The Oakland A's main focus now was who can make the most runs, because at the most simplistic form, runs are what win the game for the team.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt puts on a superb performance much like he always does, and shows the frustration that Billy must have been going through those rough years as a G.M., as he was reminded of his younger years playing in the MLB. I definitely think Brad Pitt deserves to be up for best Actor, and I hope he does get it. Everyone else in the movie did great playing the supporting roles, and making the experience much more enjoyable. Jonah Hill did a good job playing Peter Brand, but for me I always see him as goofy Jonah Hill. About half way through it I adjusted and he actually turned out to be great for the part. It would be amazing for him if he actually wins his supporting role, so he could break out of his comedic shell and do more serious roles like this one.<br/><br/>Moneyball accomplishes everything it is supposed to. It makes us want the Oakland A's to win the championship, even though we already know the outcome of the game, and we want Billy and Peter's ideas to work out, and for them to be successful. It's a wonderful story of the underdog, and even if they don't come out on top, they still accomplished so much for how small of a team they started out as. All that being said, I still don't think its best film worthy. It is a great story, and is definitely one of the best sports films in a long time, but it was not the most groundbreaking film of the year.<br/><br/>7/10"
"seghers","6","0","0","26 February 2012"," OK movie.. but in my opinion overrated
","I am a huge baseball fan, and I realize that baseball movies are rarely so subtle as Moneyball. In most baseball movies, the team is in a slump and everybody is striking out, or dropping easy fly balls. The team is winning, and everyone is hitting home runs. At JUST the right time at the end, unusual players step up, the hero comes through and the team wins the big game. Kudos to Moneyball for breaking that mold and daring to be different and real. Moneyball is more intelligent than most baseball movies, and Pitt handles his role well as the uncompromising GM. The likable Jonah Hill again plays... the likable Jonah Hill. Which is OK. Everyone did OK, and the movie is watchable. The problem I have with Moneyball is that it's not all that interesting or memorable. The moral of the story is, I guess, that statistics are important in baseball. Um, ... OK. There is no huge conflict that is resolved here, there is no danger, no love interest, no... etc. To me, this is not the ""wow"" movie some people make it out to be. It is merely .. OK. An hour after watching the movie, I wasn't really left with any memories or impressions, good or bad."
"knowyourmovie","7","0","0","21 February 2012"," A solid, but flawed and overrated movie with an unrealized potential
","We all know that there are lies, damned lies, and statistics. Some people (including yours truly) also think that there are bad movies, really bad movies, and sports movies (sorry, sports movies fans). <br/><br/>With a commendable bravery, ""Moneyball"" proceeds to challenge both statements: that statistics in sports is useful only for a peculiar and puzzling total waste of time called ""fantasy leagues"", and that a sports movie cannot be multi-dimensional, deep, or nuanced.<br/><br/>Does ""Moneyball"" succeed in its mission? Yes and no. Yes, it is a solid player, but not a champion. Just as its main character, Billy Beane, the movie definitely proves something and makes a strong point yet fails to achieve the ultimate goal. Just as Oakland Athletics, it wins the league and then loses in the first round of the postseason.<br/><br/>When I think about the factors that stood in the way of ""Moneyball"" fully realizing its great potential, the first thing that comes to mind is the screenplay – decent, but plagued by regrettable flaws. <br/><br/>Based on Michael Lewis's book ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" it was re-written three times – first by Stan Chervin, then by Steve Zallian, and finally by Aaron Sorkin, famous for his work on the screenplay for David Fincher's ""The Social Network"". Although there are no ""ifs"" in history, who knows: if Aaron Sorkin alone worked on the screenplay for ""Moneyball"", the result might have been different. <br/><br/>My main complaint is that the transformation from a losing team into a winning team was too sudden and not fully explained or justified in the movie; instead, it was hastily raced through and remained underdeveloped and not very believable. <br/><br/>Another underdeveloped subplot that in addition to its all flaws also has a cheesy happy end was the difficult working relationship between Billy Beane and the Athletics' manager Art Howe. I felt that the script could have added more dynamics and complexity in depicting their conflict as well as more thoughtfulness and depth in showing its resolution. In addition, Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of my favorite actors, seemed to be a miscast as Art Howe. I understand that after a successful collaboration on ""Capote"", Bennet Miller, the director, wanted to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in some capacity in his new movie, ""Moneyball"". However, as versatile actor as Hoffman is, playing a sports manager-type character simply does not seem to be a good avenue for showcasing his remarkable talent.<br/><br/>The scenes that involved Beane's daughter were touching and cute, but at the same time unnecessary and distracting. I realize that the daughter's character was mostly a plot device needed to explain why Beane had rejected the tempting offer from the Boston Red Sox, but a waste of the precious screen time on this derivative subplot that did not add anything to the story seemed both unjustifiable and regrettable. <br/><br/>Finally, ""Moneyball"" remained innovative, engaging, and original only as long as it kept focus on its main theme - the new team building strategy pioneered by Billy Beane and his (fictional) sidekick, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Each time the action would shift from the Billy Beane's office to a baseball field, the movie would lose most of its charm and become just an average, predictable, and boring sports flick. <br/><br/>The directing by Bennet Miller was solid and smart overall, but not breathtaking and not without flaws. I wish he would have a determination and courage to trim all the unnecessary fat from the movie and make it leaner, meaner and about 30-40 minutes shorter. <br/><br/>In the acting department, the strong performances of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill were memorable, but not extraordinary, not the Oscar level if you ask me, despite the fact that both were nominated (Brad Pitt in a leading role and Jonah Hill – in supporting role). <br/><br/>Jonah Hill, a promising actor, seemed to lack versatility and was a little monotonous and repetitive in his expressions. It almost looked like he thoroughly memorized two or three of them and kept diligently alternating them throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance was good but not good enough to make us forget that his Billy Beane was just a movie character played by an actor. We wanted to see Billy Beane, but instead we still saw glorious Brad Pitt playing Billy Beane, which is not the same. Brad Pitt's best impersonation seemed to be a concerned father in the father-daughter episodes, rather than Oakland Athletics general manager in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Moneyball"" is a solid, but flawed and overrated movie with an unrealized potential. It definitely deserves our attention and respect, but not a high praise or an ecstatic acclaim, despite the Oscar hype that surrounds it. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"jim-braxton5","Null","0","0","12 February 2012"," Moneyball--It was the Questions We Had Wrong
","Review of Moneyball<br/><br/>""It's hard not to be romantic about baseball"" – Billy Bean<br/><br/>Moneyball is a fascinating cinematic take on how newer methods of statistical information gathering have steered the course of modern American baseball especially in the last ten to fifteen years. In telling the story of how understanding baseball minutiae in great detail and consequently making real time adaptations based on that information translates into winning baseball games, the movie is, on an instructional level, a great success. There are definitely interesting concepts to explore here about the game for the baseball aficionado. But in a ""big-picture"" sense we all, sports fan and non-fan alike, can take something much more significant away from this powerful piece of art, Moneyball. In a time when many feel it is crucial to cut away the fat and find new innovative ways to survive in a competitive world, Moneyball gives us a useful abstract model that has the power to aid us in becoming more distinctly aware of how we can use what we have-- however limited, however unorthodox, to match up chances with our skill sets or talents, to micromanage, to stop wasteful practices and finally create better outcomes for ourselves especially in the workplace and by extension in life than the ones tradition and culture have sometimes preordained. <br/><br/>It's a world in flux now more than ever. The beauty of Moneyball is that it can be seen as superimposing the structure of baseball culture and economics over the paradigm of shifting aspects of our everyday lives. Looking back, baseball culture, comparable to the American workplace in some ways, remained largely static for many years. Points of reference, determiners of baseball success and statistics about productivity were so broad that they didn't fully flesh out information that would have changed the dynamics of how the game was played were this data looked at more closely. Along lines of history though we can often chart seminal points, hiccups or shakeups where something new was introduced that forever altered what came next. These breakthroughs highlight the reality that what experts thought they knew and valued as fact yesterday can become almost meaningless and obsolete today. In 2012 we can relate to these radical themes of change more than ever. Moneyball shows us through examples we can find common ground with that now more than ever flexibility and adaptability are traits we should develop and embrace; they may in fact be the most important qualities we can possess during these times. Ultimately, Moneyball highlights how in baseball, as in life, traditional ways change and in those changes opportunities for growth present themselves. <br/><br/>Let's review. It's 2001 and General Manager Billy Bean's (Brad Pitt) Oakland A's have won 102 games with an upstart band of small-market, small budget juggernauts. Bean has a knack for finding raw new talent ahead of other much more seasoned, longer tenured scouts. He has a clear vision and an innate sense of independence even going so far as to make what some might feel is an outrageous statement by saying at one point that fans don't decide his lineups. He knows big money, big name players don't always add up to the right kind of chemistry that wins World Series titles. He's a keen watcher of players in their private unguarded moments. He knows winning attitudes can be contagious and other players, despite their big name recognition, have personal attributes that make them detrimental. He has an open mind and he knows a whole lot isn't really what it seems. He understands that some teams have given up on winning and have made making as much money as possible their number one goal, a betrayal he can't stomach. Coming into the 2001 season he has done a good job of separating the wheat from the chaff. But after his successful 2001 season the big money teams in Boston and New York buy up most of his team's talent. Now he's looking for a new edge to even the playing field and to get Oakland that elusive world title. <br/><br/>He finds that edge in the unlikely alliance he forges with Peter Brand, a former security guard at a barbecue restaurant who also happens to have graduated from Yale with a degree in Economics and is a whiz with statistics related to baseball. Brand is a character based on Paul Depodesta who declined to lend his name to the movies producers for the purposes of making Moneyball. Brand's idea is to boil all the statistical data about a player down to one number representing their total value. It's a novel idea especially today, getting at the essentials of worth. What quantifies anyone as productive in the work place, or in relationships in life in general, and why do we use less than really useful criteria to measure worth in any number of settings where that information might add structure and better outcomes? The movie has the effect of extending these questions set within a baseball template to real life. In sum, why do we rely on old notions of value when we have new metrics, new benchmarks for defining what is acceptable or valuable? Moneyball prompts us to ask different questions about worth to open up a whole new realm of better possibilities. In the end what makes Moneyball one of the all time great movies is that it has the capability to jolt some of those so set in their ways to better understand that sometimes we had the right answers, it was the questions we had wrong"

","I've lived in Oakland for over a decade - since a few months before the story of Moneyball starts. In a town where local elections are swayed by candidates' stances on building a new A's ballpark, I had never heard the story Moneyball is based on. Which is to say, I'm not a baseball fan.<br/><br/>Sure I've seen a few A's games, but they were either free or less than the cost of a movie ticket. We got the cheapest seats, since you can basically sit anywhere you want once the game starts. I live in Oakland, but AT&T Park (where the Giants play) is actually closer and a much nicer place to spend an afternoon anyway. So you see, I'm one of the 99% that put the A's franchise in its current lowly state.<br/><br/>Add to this that I am one of the vocal minority that absolutely hates writer Sorkin's previous effort, The Social Network, plus the fact that I never much liked Jonah Hill, and that leaves only the fact that it's set in Oakland as the reason I watched.<br/><br/>But I liked it. <br/><br/>A great deal of that admiration is for the screenplay. Not the story, which, although timely, is thin. And, just like with The Social Network, the characters don't involve me at all. So it can only be the script and acting that puts it over the top. A style of dialogue that seemed stilted and implausible coming from the mouths of teenagers in The Social Network, fits the hardball business culture of this movie perfectly. Plus, Beane's daughter's singing is brilliant, equivalent in role and effect to the song and dance in Blue Valentine.<br/><br/>I don't love Moneyball, but for a little over two hours Pitt & Co. kept me interested in the sport of baseball, and that's about two hours longer than the real-life A's can manage."

The storyline can be fully described in half a sentence. There is hardly any character building except tiniest elements shown (ex-wife, daughter, etc.). If you are NOT interested in baseball this movie is not for you and if you are, OK, here is some information, it is good but still not a movie.<br/><br/>Sorry to dissent from almost everybody else."

","Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is a sports film that is more about the struggle of ""rich -vs- poor than it is about the actual game itself. Pitt plays the lead character, Billy Beane who as the Oakland A's General Manager changed the way the game is played forever back in the 2002 season. After having his best free agent players swooned with big money by the Yankee organization, Beane is forced to re- build his team by using mathematical statistics introduced to him by Paul Brand (Jonah Hill.) The film emphasizes on Beane's struggle with the sport with occasional flashbacks to his past experience as a player in the big leagues in the 1980s. The narration of the film seems to dictate that his past history with the sport is one of the driving forces on how he manages the Oakland A's. The relationship with his ex-wife and daughter also play a key factor in his decision making process.<br/><br/>Pitt's performance is solid and charismatic and on track with his streak of solid work throughout the last few years (Inglourious Basterds,The Tree of Life.) Jonah Hill has stepped out from behind his usual comedy character role's to show that he has what it takes to be a serious actor.) Other co-starring roles are on key throughout the film; Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Team Manager Art Howe being one of them.<br/><br/>One does not need to be a sports fanatic to enjoy this film. Moneyball is a film based on a baseball team, but it goes beyond being a film about a baseball team and more about one man's vision and determination to change the system of how the game is played."
"JohnRayPeterson","7","0","0","31 December 2011"," It pushes the right buttons; it is routed I our deep seeded admiration for people like the hero in Moneyball
","The basic storyline is simple and based on real events and people; that is the story of baseball's Oakland A's team Manager Billy Beane. This movie pushes the right buttons in most of us, the ones that create followings for the likes of Steve Jobs, because he dared to say he had the better way of what technology had to be, or Richard Branson who affirms ""Screw Business as Usual"" in times when the world has had enough of just that. The hero in this movie, Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, is to a lesser degree, just that type of person. Billy says (and I'm paraphrasing) ""it's an unfair game and we've got to think differently""; he sets out to do just that, first by snatching Peter Brand from the competition when he spotted his unappreciated potential. Then, despite everyone from all his own staff to the media and especially his peers, he stays the course, putting his own future on the line. He eventually makes a believer even out of coach Howe, played by one of my very favorite actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>The movie depicts so realistically well how a great manager takes the pressure off his staff and onto himself, while motivating his players, making the tough decisions. The movie further reveals a man who places the right priority in his personal life, putting his love for his daughter and value of that love above his career to the point where he turns down the highest paid team manager contract offered to him by the Boston Red Socks (the details related to that are fascinating). This is the sort of traits that elicit a deep seeded admiration from people and is, in my opinion why the movie has had so much appeal if you go by the ratings.<br/><br/>Moneyball's character of Peter Brand, very well played by Jonah Hill (his best, and I liked him in 'Knocked Up' and 'Get Him to the Greek') , immediately brought to mind the August 3rd 2008 Morley Safer interview of and news piece on Bill James, which '60 Minutes' segment had fascinated me at the time. When researching the material Michael Lewis used for his book, I was very pleased to find out that it was indeed featuring the man's (Bill James) ground braking approach to evaluating players that '60Minutes' had reported back in 2008; sabermetrics, the statistical/analytical process is depicted in the movie. Coincidentally, another '60 Minutes' piece, this one by Steve Croft on March 14th 2010, was my introduction to Michael Lewis; following that reporting, I rushed and bought 'The Big Short' and have been a fan since. Oddly, in a relatively recent interview of Lewis on 'The Daily Show', he admitted he never thought his book 'Moneyball' would make an interesting movie and gave all the credit to Aaron Sorkin (and Steven Zaillian). I agree; Sorkin can write a script about almost any subject of interest to him and make it a hit. He does so frequently. No secret that I'm a huge fan of Sorkin; don't know a single actor who wouldn't jump for joy to play a part written by Sorkin. Brad Pitt's star power did not hurt the rating a bit either.<br/><br/>It's a pretty good movie; I sure liked it, but I have to say hype has influenced the rating to a certain extent. It is not the best movie of the year; it's safe to say most will like it. It's presumptuous to say it's the best when you've watched perhaps just a dozen or so. Let's wait for awards' season shall we."

","""Moneyball"" is about the very American sport of baseball and the objective science of statistics. It recounts how in 2001, ex-ball player Billy Beane, then general manager of the bottom-dwelling and budget-strapped Oakland A's, turned the fortunes of the whole team around by hiring lower-value but talented players based solely on their game statistics. It certainly took a lot of time getting to that main part of the story, but when it got there, you will be rewarded for your patience.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is admittedly too ""movie-starrish"" to really disappear into the role of Billy Beane. Put him in a room full of grumpy grizzled old baseball curmudgeons, and he would really stand out like, well, a movie star. While I understand why he is gaining awards recognition for this role, I feel the role may be too understated and underplayed by him. Pitt was effective, yes, but may be too low-key for the big Oscar prize. <br/><br/>Beane's ""side-kick"" here was Peter Brand (played by pudgy comedian Jonah Hill), a nerdy Yale graduate of Economics who introduced how statistics can be of use to Beane in scouting for players under a limited budget. Hill plays it like he was always in awe of Pitt. On the other side, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, who was disdainful of Beane's radically new scouting style. If he was supposed to be annoying, then Hoffman surely played it that way.<br/><br/>I watched ""Moneyball"" only because star Brad Pitt has been gaining awards buzz from it, and in fact had won a number of critics awards already. I had absolutely no idea what it was all about before I watched. Even as I was already watching, I had a difficult time getting into the story because it tells about something I am not very familiar with. But give this movie a chance to tell you its story like I did, and you will really get into its spirit and you will like it."

","I enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the fact that the 2002 Oakland a's were from my generation when I was a teenage baseball fan. the movie was entertaining because I can see the story of how a baseball team and different players of that time were built. I enjoyed thinking back to myself remember that player or remember this game or that game? Although the movie is based on a true story, a lot of it is fictionalized. Brad Pitt turned the character of Billy Beene into a smooth overconfident guy that he was not in real life.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie because of the time line of it, and overall it was a good baseball movie. However i don't understand the point of making this movie. MoneyBall is about a good baseball team that over-achieved and had a good season but went no where after. The billy Beane Oakland a's never won anything, so I don't even understand the point of making this movie. I think a movie about the 2002 angels who unexpectedly won the world series would have made for a better story.<br/><br/>Money ball is a watchable entertaining baseball movie, that appealed even more to me due to the time it's story took place. But in reality its just a glorified story of a team that had a good season but went no further."
"musanna-ahmed","7","0","0","21 December 2011"," If only I was American
","After I watched the film, I realised that Moneyball did not appeal to me, and I doubt it will appeal to other British audiences either. The screenwriters here have written a witty and very intelligent script for the film, adapting it from the general manager's book of the same name. And much of the dialogue requires a baseball head to understand. I do not have one and don't suspect many British people to have one either. <br/><br/>Those who are exceptions of this will be in for a delight. My personal response may have been that I found it to be difficult to be gripped by the subject matter but the American audience, the ones that are obviously the target demographic, will be in for this year's The Social Network. Two reasons why: number one – one of the screenwriters of Moneyball is Aaron Sorkin, who wrote The Social Network and has written something of similar quality here, and number two – director Bennett Miller has managed to take a simple subject matter and undeniably transform it into something far more interesting. This is a sports film that is not cliché-ridden. There's no sudden conflict that is a turning point in the narrative. In fact, there's a lack of equilibrium, just showing how chaotic and troubled Billy Beane is at this point in his career. And in fact, this isn't as much of a film about the sport as it is about the business of it all. Moneyball is a very talkative picture (which is why I don't recommend it to tweens or the frat house, because this is more artistic than entertaining) yet it manages to be somewhat intriguing when watching Billy Beane managed the Oakland A's just as they were hitting the lowest of lows.<br/><br/>The main reason for this was the Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt, who now looks to be a real contender for an Oscar nomination. This is a different role for Brad Pitt, he's taking authority – yes, he played a leader in Inglorious Basterds but this is better acting displayed by him. As well as delivering lines pitch perfectly (it's expected of any actor playing a 'formal' figure to act realistically when speaking), he brings a lot of humanity in the role, the key scenes being the ones where he is the only character in the frame and his facial expressions speak for him. The opening and closing shots, especially, of him are effective.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill, as Peter Brand, the Yale graduate with a major in Economics who assists Beane, turns-in terrifically as long as the expectations on him aren't for him to be the funnyman of the film. He is showing he has a broad range in this role, taking on a serious role as comic actors have done before him and done very well – Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine, Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love, etc.<br/><br/>All in all, the direction is superb. The acting is excellent. The writing is sharp. The editing is splendid, especially in the baseball match scenes where the film cleverly combines real time with archive footage. Moneyball is undeniably an incredible piece of filmmaking and smarter than most Hollywood films this year. Yet it can only be enjoyed thoroughly if you know about baseball. And alas, I'm British and don't know much more about baseball than the team names. I'd perfectly understand it if a similar film was released where the subject matter was football, and I saw an American reviewer writing about the same problem he had when listening to actors speak about ""the banter bus"" and the team's best ""holding midfielder"", like we heard of ""ugly girlfriend"" or a ""switch hitter""."

","I am literally have no any idea about baseball and cannot extract any gaiety or thrill from watching it (actually I am very much sport-immune). So the challenge of the film lies in the fact that whether or not it will be able to win over more spectators who are usually out of the range of the sport genre, just like two years ago THE BLINDSIDE (2009) did (I know nothing about American football either but I emphatically enjoyed the film).<br/><br/>Taking Pitt's role Billy Beane's words said to his assistant Peter Brand (career-best performance from Jonah Hill) in the film, ""he does not want to have any personal entanglement with any of his players, especially no emotion attached"" (not literally though) , the film also detaches from its audience by throwing mathematic formulae and analytic statistics at the audience and imposes a condescending stance to water down the scientific theory so as to be accepted by outsiders like me. Also the narrative process is no less median than other sport biopics (namely, INVICTUS 2009, a same 6/10 rating), an over-abused underdog victory with a middle- of-the-road taste. <br/><br/>The cast, I cannot deny it may be Pitt's best work so far (leaving THE TREE OF LIFE aside), but one hindrance is his subdued swagger almost pervasive in almost every film he stars and I have watched, which could be fitting in FIGHT CLUB 1999 or TWELVE MONKEYS 1995, even for OCEAN'S ELEVEN series, but in a biographic film, Mr. Jolie is not an acting chameleon like Meryl Streep, and he should drink the so-called ""make-up potion"" to camouflage himself behind his role he plays. Additionally among the small satellites revolving around Pitt, Jonah Hill is seriously rooting for his first Oscar nomination (congratulations on his dual nominations in both SAG and Golden Globe, the same to Pitt and the film has nailed 4 Golden Globe nominations in toto, BEST MOTION PICTURE-DRAMA and BEST SCREENPLAY). Another VIP star Philip Seymour Hoffman has nothing to sprawl out in his funny uniform. <br/><br/>Oscar nominated director Bennett Miller (CAPOTE 2005) may fall short of strong buzz to get himself into Oscar's consideration, however, the film is exquisitely made and the lengthy spiels which I shudder at may fare pretty well as the crowd-pleaser for those interlacing with both film and baseball domains."

","I thought this was a good movie...very plain however. It was all Brad Pitt here. The Jonah Hill praise was undeserved IMO. He was good, but not to the extent that he stole the film. It was Pitt's charisma that made this movie watchable. Without him, a very average and forgotten film. This is what star power does. His character's personality made the new system he was presenting believable. <br/><br/>Most of the secondary characters were underdeveloped. His relationship with his daughter, though moving, needed more depth. I think was a very difficult film to storyboard and present...but it worked.<br/><br/>Because the director blended a lot of actual film/video clips from the A's 2002 year, the movie had a strong documentary feel to it. I love doc films so no prob for me."

","To compare America's pastime with something more relevant in Britain would probably frustrate American's the world over, so I won't even attempt it. I thought the topic of the film would be lost on me considering my typically British upbringing, but there is so much more to Moneyball than just the sport of baseball.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill bounce off each other so well (I wanted to be sat in-between them chuckling to myself), especially during the introduction of Hill's character Peter, with everything he said seeming to sound like an apology and Pitt's Billy Beane basically telling him to man up. The supporting cast did a superb job of looking dumbfounded when the new strategy of baseball drafting was presented to them, created awkward moments even Woody Allen would be proud of.<br/><br/>The mix of archive footage with the newly filmed, brings an air of nostalgia that's really fitting. Without the back-story of Billy Beane creating the emotional connection we, as an audience, need, there would be no story at all (apart from that of which we could read on Wikipedia), but with this, there is enough narrative to entice even the most British of non-baseball fans."

","THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE: Full Disclosure: I read the book and I'm a fan of Michael Lewis' work (who isn't these days?). I enjoyed it, though I will say a lot of that probably came from curiosity of how they can take that book and make it a movie. How do you show the power of an idea when the main characters don't reach their goal? (In this case, a championship or even a trip the the World Series). The answer: hyping up a record win streak in the middle of the season the kind of meaningless stat that Moneyball adherents would dismiss as irrelevant and flukey. The highlight for me was the dramatic, slow-mo, ""The Natural""-esque shots of baseball players taking walks. It was the perfect metaphor for what Moneyball is all about.<br/><br/>THE PROFESSIONAL: Moneyball is one of my favorite books, and yet the movie version wouldn't be included in my Top 100 favorite movies. When I heard that they were going to make a movie greenlit soon after the success of The Blind Side I was worried. The people bankrolling the movie had to be looking for some sort of saccharine, tear-jerker human interest angle the likes of which made The Blind Side so popular. Indeed, you had a rather lame subplot about Billy Beane's daughter and far too many shots of Billy (Brad Pitt) staring off soulfully into the distance. Trim the movie by 10-15 minutes and it would be stronger. Read the book! <br/><br/>THE FUGITIVE: Wow, double whammy slam-ball. ""Moneyball"" wasn't THAT bad. I was thoroughly interested throughout the whole movie. It is a movie about a modern real-life baseball team; not about a bunch of neighborhood kids playing backyard ball, or about some magical bat, or some magical field, or even one baseball player trying for one last hurrah. It is a movie about baseball behind-the-scenes, with the main character not even being a player, but the general manager. It does have some emotional and perhaps over-the-top subplots or transitional scenes, like Brad Pitt sitting in his truck and looking off into the distance of an empty lot. It was not as statemental or ""epic"" as ""The Social Network,"" not analyzing our modern web 2.0 society mixed with traditional back-stabbing, but similarly a ""real-life"" (with artistic licenses of course) modern story about doing something different in a world set in traditional ways. I didn't read the book, and I haven't even watched ""The Blind Side,"" so maybe you will like ""Moneyball"" too if not jaded by book-is-always-better or going in hoping for a Brad-Pitt better than Sandra Bullock experience."

","O.K. so admittedly I throw the sports page away roughly 5 seconds after removing the rubber band. Knowing this, the appeal of this movie at face value did not interest me. The first scene didn't pull me in, the poor job of editing the scenes together didn't impress me either. (Dont you hate when the close up shows an actors ability then they back up and you can tell it was shot 15 minutes earlier?!) But pay all this no mind. This is a great movie. Yes, yes, I learned a bit about how the business of baseball works. I learned that the ""romance"" of the game has led to many experts and faux experts. I learned its tough to be a player and its tougher to be a coach. But this movie is not about just that, its about solving problems. Its about knowing that you have to play the hand you are dealt in life and is a tough lesson. A lesson that the little boy inside you with a dream will some day have learn and tears will be in his eyes. This movie left me knowing that its not about winning. Its about how to get to a win... and what a win really is."
"Lylescottlee","7","0","0","11 October 2011"," Nice story about an otherwise boring sport
","What I liked most about the movie Moneyball is that it's a feel good story within itself. It starts off suggesting that the reason the Oakland A's lost to the New York Yankees in the 2001 ADLS is because they were out-salaried. Then the team loses three of its big- name players to bigger markets.<br/><br/>The GM, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), can't convince the owner to increase the 2002 budget, so he takes it out on the team's collection of seasoned scouts. ""Blah blah blah,"" he mimics with his hand as they run through the usual criteria used for considering up-and- coming and free-agent players. ""He's seen in Vegas too much."" ""He doesn't have the confidence because his wife is a six, at best."" Billy offers no solutions, but only frustration.<br/><br/>It's by chance that, while going through his usual motions of horse-trading with another team, Billy stumbles upon a new methodology for ranking players. Enter Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a baseball aficionado and techno-nerd. The analytical data used by Peter is so in-depth it made me wonder where the human element of each player began on paper and the machine element ended.<br/><br/>The season starts out shaky as under-appreciated manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) holds firm on who plays what position in spite of the GM's insistence that an unorthodox approach needs to be given a chance. Since baseball is a business, Billy is forced to make some heartless trades that force the skipper to do things his way. As a result, the A's start climbing up the division ladder and even challenge the all-time record for consecutive wins. It's at this point where I felt the movie was trying to create a special moment. And it does. What's funny is I don't recall this historical moment from only nine years ago. (In fact, I think I'll probably be more apt to always remember that fictionalized moment in the movie Tin Cup where Roy McAvoy holes out, from 250 yards away, the final hole of the Championship tournament.) But for this movie's sake, the moment illustrates how a bunch of over-the-hill and no-name players can come together, rising above both the excessive commercialism and sanitized tedium that makes up the sport today, and make history.<br/><br/>The team's record in 2002 was only one win better than the previous season. And they once again lose in the ADLS, only this time to another small market team, the Minnesota Twins. It's this data that makes me appreciate the movie as merely a noble highlight of the game of baseball rather than as a tale of a revolutionary league-changing strategy.<br/><br/>Billy Beane's still the GM for the A's and the team's record has been average overall since 2002. After offering Billy the highest salary for a GM ever, the Red Sox go it alone, eventually breaking the Curse of the Bambino in 2004 while using both a big salary and sterile computer analysis. I suspect the romanticism of the movie hides the fact that big market teams can still make use of the new system of ranking players to help maintain their continued degree of big-payroll success. And, of course, once every team in the league has adopted this new approach, then it's back to square one, i.e., trying to find a way to beat a big market team with a low salary."

The cast is believable, I can't think of a single character I would have changed, and Brad Pitt has handed in one of his best - if not his very best - performance.

The song she sings will stick in your mind and, like me, will likely find you whistling this tune as you leave the theater.

","Professional baseball player Rocky Bridges has a famous quote that says the average man believes he can do three things...build a fire, run a hotel, and manage a baseball team.

Moneyball was the type of book no one would ever thought could be made into a movie, but it was and it is.<br/><br/>Now, before I go into depth about what I thought of Moneyball, the first thing I have to say is that this is Brad Pitt's best performance to date. With one of my least favorite movies of the year, The Tree Of Life being released this year, I was not looking forward to seeing Brad Pitt in another film, but I am surprised to see I absolutely loved him in this film. <br/><br/>Now, as for the movie itself, it's fantastic. The whole statistics vs. raw talent idea is smart and the movie is both funny and touching. It gets very funny when there is dialogue between Beane and Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), they park an irresistible and funny charm, and it is touching when Beane and his daughter, Casey interact.

","As we start heading into the commonly known ""Oscar season"", I just get more and more excited each weekend. There is always some movie sparking my interest just around the corner, a new film I've been reading about for months and trying with all my powers to not let the bar of hope get raised too high. There are always going to be disappointments, even when they are good films, because I was waiting for great, but what keeps me going are those films who look up at the bar and say, ""Oh yeah, not a problem."" Welcome to one of those films<br/><br/>Moneyball is based on the true story of Billy Beane, a one-time possible superstar in the MLB who turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After missing once again on his chance for the World Series crown, Beane went rogue, adopted a new system and went after players using a statistical model instead of banking on superstars. It threatened everything the game was built on, it threatened the way things were done in sports, and worst of allit worked.<br/><br/>Aaron Sorkin's name on the poster was the first thing to catch my eye. I sat there as the lights went down and wondered if he could keep his winning streak going (his last two, Charlie Wilson's War and The Social Network being two of my favorite all time movies). So without wanting to, my bar was already set high into the stratosphere, but as the credits rolled, I felt the film had touched the clouds. Maybe it didn't hit open space, but still miles above most of what we see on a week-to-week basis. You could feel his power in the dialogue; some classic Sorkin work. I could almost feel particular scenes the way they would have been played on stage. The film wasn't loaded up with as many quick witted tit-for-tat moments as his last two films, instead it flowed with much more subtlety, using a more even keel in order to lead the audience through an entire season of baseball. I don't want to give all the credit to Sorkin, since the writing credit is split between himself and Steven Zallian (an Oscar winner himself), but I really don't know how the work balanced out between them. That split might also be some of the reason why Moneyball doesn't have that normal Sorkin whip-crack pacing.<br/><br/>Yet, no matter how well the words are written, they still have to be delivered by someone with the skill and sincerity to make them land and Brad Pitt did not disappoint. Without knowing too much of the original story beforehand I was a little concerned with seeing Pitt in this role, which I previously only thought of as a general manager of a baseball team. What really saves him and grounds it in believability is the history of Billy Beane being a failed baseball superstar. Pitt brought the subtle sorrow, the underlying regret he always had nipping at his heels, which helps fuel his desire not only to win, but also to see the game fundamentally changed. What I found most impressive was somewhere along the way, I forgot I was watching Brad Pitt. He disappeared into a dip-spitting, hand-nosed gambler just trying his damnedest to pull off the greatest underdog victory in history. Those are rare performances and they should be recognized as such.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill came along for the ride, playing Peter Brand, the young economics genius who helped develop the formula Beane uses to build his new championship-hopeful team. It definitely is the most dramatic role Hill has tackled so far and put him toe-to-toe with a modern-day film legend in Pitt. Hill held his own and refused to settle for sitting in Pitt's shadow. In terms of the performances, my only disappointment was with one of my favorite living actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman. It has nothing to do with his take on Art Howe, the coach of the team under Beane. It was more to do with him barely being a part of the story. He got a precious few scenes early on in the film and then disappeared completely almost halfway through the movie. I just wish we could have gotten more of him and Pitt dueling, as he did so brilliantly with Tom Hanks in Charlie Wilson's War.<br/><br/>In the end, Moneyball did reach my bar of hope and expectation, but it didn't blow if off the chart as his past two films have."

","Joy Lynn: This movie is based on a book and the true life story of Billy Beane, General Manager of the Oakland A's.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane. The A's are struggling with losing their star players to teams with bigger budgets and Beane hires Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to help him pick players. Brand (Hill) is a Yale graduate with a degree in economics and his skill is player analysis; his first job out of college. Brand uses statistic calculations (the Moneyball theory) to separate out the strong players and to find the more undesirable recruits (misfits) that have talent, but have been overlooked. Unlike Contagion (2011) the statistical equations are not the focus in this movie, the relationships and characters in this movie are well developed with intriguing dialogue and interest thanks to writer Aaron Sorkin. (The Social Network (2010), West Wing TV, etc.) Brad Pitt is as handsome as ever in this film! Jonah Hill is an excellent counterpart as Beane's (Pitt) assistant. Both are great in this movie. They work well together as business partners and provide some humorous entertainment as you might expect.<br/><br/>Non-sports fans will like this movie—it's for all ages and genders.<br/><br/>TMG: Hey, it's a baseball movie. I let Joy Lynn take the lead on this because she loved the movie. Fine. But it's just a baseball movie. Some fun stuff, lots of macho and the slow pace of baseball.

Only thing missing for me was the smell of cigarettes, the sun in my eyes, a hard plastic seat and a guy shouting ""frosty malts,get your frosty malts."" On the plus side, is we get some real ""inside baseball"" insight. Baseball is 95% statistics and Billy Beane tried to exploit that reality. It worked, but probably was a fluke. The fact is baseball has great athletes and non athletes who make it to the top. Pro baseball has kids who were all stars and some guys who just get luckybut statistics follow them everywhere. Hitting a 98 mile an hour curve ball is about one of the most difficult things mankind can achieve. It exceeds flying to the moon and back. If you can do it well, you have incredible eyes and and incredible timing–that is purely a gift from God. Athleticism has much less to do with it. Ever see a picture of Babe Ruth? Mr. Athlete he was not. Most everything else in baseball is just superstition and luck. I think the story was fair to that truth. My rating would be more in the 7.0 range, statistically speaking."

","The Fat Man does not like baseball. No cheerleaders. Football's my game. For some reason though, I was drawn to Moneyball like a fat moth to a bacon flame. Maybe it's Brad Pitt's massive screen presence and acting ability heh. Or perhaps I really want to like baseball a lot and watching this, Field of Dreams, and Angels in the Outfield will finally bring me in to the fold. However, it's probably fellow fatty Jonah Hill's presence that made me feel welcome at a baseball movie.<br/><br/>Moneyball tried to explain Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) implementation of sabremetrics to improve the Oakland A's chances for a championship team on a shoestring MLB budget. He's struggling with his lot in life until fictional Peter Brand (fat fatty Jonah Fatness Hill) tells him to use the power of maths and win some games. Things turn around, but in the end, it's just not enough. Season and movie over.<br/><br/>While it's no Miracle  well it's no Miracle. That's the closest comparison I can make. Long shot hockey team wins it all. Long shot baseball team does not win. They go on a record-setting 20 game run, but even the movie tears itself down immediately by pointing out this means nothing. Nobody remembers the A's run except for die-hard A's fans that have no hope. While this is historical, what reading I've done about the real Billy Beane seems pretty far removed from the movie. Why not go full fictional and have them win the World Series? That wouldn't have sat well with a lot of fans, but would have made the movie more interesting. As it stood, the movie was incomplete.<br/><br/>Moneyball covered the beginnings of Beane's use of sabremetrics with the A's, but he's still there, still using the system. He's yet to win a World Series. This is a story – continual failure with a system that should be working correctly, convincing the league that there's merit to this system, and his loyalty to a franchise over money. Moneyball wasn't really a movie about the system either – that could have been pretty interesting for the nerdier types. Instead it used a fictional character to whisper little numbers in Beane's ear instead of crediting him with knowing the system himself. In all, the movie shows just a snippet of something that really does not matter and isn't that interesting. While Hill and Pitt are a great duo, they can't break through the tedious nothingness of the plot.<br/><br/>Great idea, but needed moresomething.

","I am ready to spill the beans on the baseball management flick ""Moneyball"". So let me pitch it to you, because it's a good one. Director Bennett Miller's film adaptation of the true story of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane's creative non-spending architecture of putting a winning team in the field without spending the big dough is sure to have its own winning streak during movie awards season. The Beane computer-generated player analysis technique has been a trendsetter that many other Major League Baseball clubs have used. ""Moneyball"" is set during the 2002 Oakland A's season who many thought was going to be an ""F"" graded one for the Athletics. Beane me up some Brad! Because Brad Pitt's exemplary starring performance as Billy Beane does not have to be computer-analyzed to prove that it's as solid as they come for a leading actor this year. Mr. Pitt is no longer the pretty boy actor, his work throughout the last few years have proved that he is one of the best actors in the business; besides being sought after by many Major League Studios in Hollywood. ""Moneyball"" sure had a lot of Miller time on it, maybe not personally on screen but on development; because Director Bennett Miller's acute management of the movie gets my vote as an all-star auteur effort for 2011; and Miller's fluid direction authenticated the fact that you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this film, because its major narrative hit is showcasing how to deliver a winning product with budget restrains. Hall of Fame screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian did threw a few curve balls and did change it up a bit in their ""Moneyball"" script enough to base it as what can be the premier screenplay of the year. The supporting players of ""Moneyball"" also brought their A game! Jonah Hill was spectacular as Beane's economic-wiz apprentice Peter Brand. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was a piece of art as A's Manager Art Howe. And Chris Pratt brought the right balance of nervousness and opportunity as A's player Scott Hatterberg. But overall this was mainly Pitt's playing thespian field and he sure made the best of every opportunity he got up at the acting plate. ""Moneyball"" may or may not roll large amounts of moneyballs in the box office, but it is definitively ""so money"" and I hope everybody knows it. ***** Excellent"

","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : MONEYBALL<br/><br/>ONE LINE REVIEW : A great sports movie that will appeal to a wide audience.<br/><br/>RATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time."")<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's 2002 and Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) must find a way to replace three of his team's great players. The players were traded away to other teams, gutting Beane's team, and his chances of going to the playoffs. Billy's problem is that he can't afford to recruit quality players on the $41M in his budget - especially when he is competing with teams with budgets in the $120 million range.<br/><br/>While visiting a competing team's front office on a deal, Billy meets young Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand has a degree in economics from Yale university and sees baseball strictly in statistical terms. He reasons that a player should be picked for his ability to get on base, not for how many home runs he hits. Billy does his research and realizes he may have found the solution to his problem and recruits Brand to help him reorganize the Oakland team.<br/><br/>But Billy is met with resistance on all fronts. The veteran recruiters are angry that Billy is listening to some young upstart with no experience in baseball. The team manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman) won't play the roster the way Billy wants, thus thwarting any mathematics that may improve their chances. Even the players don't believe Billy will last the season.<br/><br/>Also, Billy is facing some difficulties with his family. His ex-wife Sharon (Robin Wright) is married to a wimpish guy who doesn't understand sports, but tries to for Billy's sake. His adorable daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) is concerned he may lose his job. The way things are going, Billy secretly feels the same way. And we're off...<br/><br/>Those who know me know that I'm not a sports fan. I find most sports dull and avoid watching them as I think watching other people do something is a colossal waste of time - especially compared to actually doing it. However, watching Billy Bean resurrect the A's was a joy. The movie is structured nicely with elements of sports, relationships, and (especially if you are not a sports follower) suspense.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt seems to walk through this role effortlessly. I'm reminded of Robert Redford and his baseball movie ""The Natural"" (1984). While the roles are very different, they both require a kind of charisma that these actors bring to their roles. Pitt produced the film, which shows his commitment to it. We watch Beane exude confidence in front of his boss, sales savvy when making a deal,he reassures his daughter, and mentors Brand. But privately, we see his uncertainty when things are not going well.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is best known for his comedic roles (""Superbad"") but plays a very stoic, even stereotypical nerd here. His comic timing comes into good use in several scenes where Brand's naiveté serves as a contrast to Billy's bravado. However, the character is written very flatly. We don't see a lot of variation in Brand's emotions. Still, Hill does a good job of delivering the character that does the math, and still learns about baseball along the way.<br/><br/>The movie has some minor flaws. The relationships outside of the world of baseball are only lightly touched upon. There are really only 3 scenes with the daughter - one of which is delivered by CD. The relationship with the ex-wife is amounts to one awkward moment. But that's okay, as the movie is really about turning the team around and breaking with convention. Even so, Billy's relationships with the players is only lightly covered in a sort of montage. Without giving much away, we don't really see much growth in the man, only that he succeeds in what he set out to do.<br/><br/>As a non-sports fan, I was very entertained by this movie. I didn't know the outcome beforehand, as some baseball followers may have. We get to see a wonderful Rags-to-Riches story told very well. Most of the performances may have been underpowered, even flat. But that served to buoy the Brad Pitt character. For a suspenseful story that moved along at a comfortable pace, I recommend you ""see it in theaters."""
"mholtebeck","Null","0","0","25 September 2011"," I enjoyed, but went to the 20-win game.
","OK, I enjoyed this movie, but that may be because I was actually a fan of that team, and remember those players. Obviously there are the events portrayed that didn't happen exactly like it was portrayed in the movie (search Google to find them all- it is a lot). It is interesting because it is a sports movie without a climatic moment (the streak is actually down played in the movie- Scott Hatteberg hitting that home run remains the greatest sports moment I've witnessed personally). Brad Pitt is on the screen nearly the entire movie (much like Cast Away with Tom Hanks). Fortunately, he is enjoyable, and his witty lines are classic. Enough has been said how the movie doesn't really mention Miguel Tejada (MVP), or Barry Zito (Cy Young), while focusing on Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford, and Ricardo Rincon.<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't actually overplay their role in the team. It is mainly about using statistics to get value from players. The A's got a lot of value from Scott Hatteberg It also created the perception that the A's started using this analysis in 2002, and Billy Beane was at risk of losing his job by the fans. In fact the A's had been using this strategy for a few years prior, and by 2002 Billy Beane was considered a genius (his status is currently debated). There wasn't a lot of criticism of Billy Beane on sports radio, mainly because there wasn't a lot of discussion about the A's on sports radio. Oakland fans would never complain about the A's on sports radio, instead they tried to prove that the A's were better than the Giants. <br/><br/>That being said, it is enjoyable movie, but not not great. The climatic point of the movie was underscored- when I watched I though of the moment in Miracle. This time, you get the sense that winning 20 in a row meant almost nothing to Billy Beane, and there is a lot of dead space in the movie. However, as baseball movie about math, and a math movie about baseball, it is is not all that bad."
"dougwintersmusic","Null","0","0","25 September 2011"," Brad Pitt hits one out of the park.
","For those of you who may have forgotten that Brad Pitt is a great actor, welcome to ""Moneyball."" After what seems like a lifetime of being tabloid fodder for the paparazzi, it's easy to lose sight of Brad Pitt as one of our finest actors. Armed with a brilliant screenplay by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, Pitt shows us just how completely he can dominate a screen for what is essentially a two hour and 13 minute one-man performance. In terms of the writing pedigree, refer to Steve Zaillian's ""Schindler's List"" and Sorkin's ""The Social Network."" What is of particular cinematic interest is the confident ease of Bennett Miller's direction, who's only other directorial credit was 2005's biopic ""Capote,"" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. <br/><br/>""Moneyball' is not a sports movie in the traditional sense, but really the story of one man and his relationship to the sport that he loves so much. Mr. Pitt portrays Billy Beane, a ""bonus baby"" for the NY Mets in 1980 (drafted by the Mets the same year as Darryl Strawberry.) However his career as a player never amounted to much. He ended up playing on four teams in four years with an anemic batting average of 218, with a grand total of 66 hits in 5 years. Beane's ignominious failure as a player haunted him throughout his adult life, as we learn in a series of flashbacks and his comment that signing with the Mets was the ""last decision he would ever make for money."" <br/><br/>Instead, Billy Beane made baseball history off the field. Long after his playing days were over, he ascended to the job of General Manager for the Oakland A's, the team with the lowest payroll in the baseball. And with the help of a young man (Jonah Hill) in his first job out of Yale, defying all baseball logic, develop a new, mathematically inspired method of putting a competitive team on the field without signing a single high-priced free agent, known as ""Sabermetrics."" It is this ""front-office"" brilliance and foresight that has made Billy Beane the baseball legend that his prodigious athletic talents never could.<br/><br/>It was delightful to see Jonah Hill in his first grown-up, non-comedic role. Hill and Pitt have an easy, comfortable relationship that grows convincingly throughout the film until they are essentially peers. Also of note is the adorable Kerris Dorsey (late of television's ""Brothers and Sisters,"") as Billy's precocious young daughter ""Casey.""<br/><br/>But all praise goes to the extraordinary Brad Pitt, looking every bit the ex-jock, with a wad of chewing tobacco firmly implanted in his lower lip, feeling most at home walking through the locker room as someone who has grown up in just such an environment. His easy-going delivery, and nice-guy demeanor makes Billy Beane a charming, lovable rogue that you are more than delighted to spend a couple of hours with. This is not a sports story in which you sit at the end of your seat anticipating a ""9th inning home run"" or a ""12th round knockout,"" or a ""last second basketball buzzer-beater."" It is a thinking persons sports story about a flawed man haunted by his past failures, both as an athlete and a husband, who forever changes the game of baseball, long after his playing days are over. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt has truly hit one ""out of the park"" in Moneyball."

","The book was excellently written, suspenseful, and delightfully detailed. The movie script was almost nonexistent. The movie was minimalist: almost no script, often no sound, inexplicably dark lighting, little character development, no actual acting by the main characters, and almost no plot. I cannot understand how someone who has not read the book could stay with this film beyond the first third...or how someone who has read the book could forget the rich material it offered which the film ignores. This film spends money, 50 million, and possibly may make money, but its money-venture nature is almost the only way it connects with its source. The book was filled with characters and explored the inspirations and motivations of life; it illuminated an institution -- the film was devoid of characters and character development, explored nothing comprehensible or important, and illuminated nothing. It signified nothing and didn't even have sound or fury. What a missed opportunity."

","As a big baseball fan and someone who read the book of the same title, I was anxious to see this movie. Usually, in a case like that I get disappointed because my expectations are too high. Such was the case here, although I did enjoy the film. Not me wrong; it held my interest, but it was no match for the book.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was great as ""Billy Beane,"" as was Jonah Hill as ""Peter Brand."" It was kinda of shocking to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman playing manager ""Art Howe,"" but he was good, too, as were many of the actors who played the pro scouts.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly dialog, so the more you like baseball and its strategies and mental aspects, know what they're talking about (i.e. ""on base percentage"") the better you'll like it because it's a fairly long film to sit through. On the other hand, if you don't know a lot about baseball, you can still enjoy the great acting and dialog in here."
"MartinHafer","5","4","13","4 February 2012"," But what if you don't like baseball films?!
","I would sure think that ""Moneyball"" would have a very limited international appeal--especially in countries where they don't have professional baseball. And, even in the States, I can't see this as being an easy sell if the audience member is not a fan of the sport. While I have enjoyed some ball films, I am not a huge fan of pro sports--so keep this in mind when I say how underwhelmed I was by the whole thing. Much of this also is because the film has been nominated for six Academy Awards--one for Best Picture, one for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting Actor. So, I expected a lot and the film seemed to deliver less.<br/><br/>This film is based on the real life general manager of the Oakland A's back in the early 2000s. He came up with a statistical system by which he was able to replace big-money free agents with lesser players and STILL win--all by applying a lot of statistical analyses. For fans of fantasy baseball, this will be of some interest. As for me, I just didn't care--mostly because with the huge salaries, teams that move at the drop of a hat and various scandals, pro sports lost me as a fan long ago--and I just didn't care who won or lost. Now IF Brad Pitt's character had seemed like a particularly compelling person, I might have cared...but he didn't.<br/><br/>Overall, unless you are a big sports film fan, don't see the film or at least significantly lower your expectations. Pitt's and Jonah Hill's performances weren't bad...but both have done better work."

","Moneyball can easily compete with some of the greatest baseball movies and is arguably one of the best films of 2011. <br/><br/>I'm not a sports guy and I'm always baffled when people get so upset when their team doesn't win. However, I was able to understand the mindset and feel the agony of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt). <br/><br/>This true story based on the 2003 Michael Lewis book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, shines a different and less romantic perspective on the sport. With a strong theme of taking down the system and fighting the established order, Billy Beane takes a risky yet revolutionary step into combating the deep pockets of large baseball franchises. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt (Se7en) and Jonah Hill (Superbad) are outstanding together and develop an on-screen friendship that feels legitimate. Casting Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia) as Oakland A's manager Art Howe is unfitting. Art Howe has a physique of someone that could field a couple grounders whereas Hoffman would fall on his fat ass. Interestingly, Art Howe has expressed displeasure with the portrayal of his character in the book and the movie in which he is seen as a stubborn traditionalist. <br/><br/>Moneyball offers a multitude of entertaining facets with an exceptionally well-written screenplay that even non-baseball fans will enjoy."
"secondtake","8","2","5","3 February 2012"," Baseball? Don't even think about it. It's a great insider's view with human drama.
","Moneyball (2011)<br/><br/>An extremely competent film, with sharp writing and editing, convincing acting, and a great basic story.<br/><br/>That's hardly the words you would use for a great classic like ""Citizen Kane"" or even ""Fight Club."" Like that Facebook movie ""Social Network,"" you have here a gripping series of events with a hero and a huge opportunity and the movie makes it pop and crackle--even though on the surface it seems like it couldn't possibly be exciting. I mean, lots of board room or back room conversations, lots of brooding about the future. There isn't even a noticeable romantic line to add that personal layer.<br/><br/>All of this attests to the raw ability of the movie makers, mostly the director and writer. <br/><br/>The director is who, Bennett Miller? A relative outsider with two other movies to his name, I think people are starting to perk up to him. His first movie, ""The Cruise,"" few people have seen, but it shows his hand in its attraction to a true situation with insight into contemporary American culture. (It's free on Netflix right now, if you are open to a kind of straight up black and white documentary.) His second movie, ""Capote,"" takes us into heartland America and shows he can command a more complicated scenario, some high end acting talent, and edgy crime stuff already part of literary lore and make a compelling sometimes brilliant movie. (Part of the brilliance belongs to Philip Seymour Hoffman, frankly, but the movie is handled with unusual intelligence overall.)<br/><br/>So now ""Moneyball"" with Brad Pitt, who anchors it with yet another confident, believable performance from him. The world of professional baseball is automatically interesting to many people. And so is the idea of a lone renegade bucking the system, any system, and succeeding (or almost succeeding, at least). Then there is the astonishing winning streak that builds in the center of the movie with inevitable drama (like the one used by more than one movie when Joe DiMaggio was his streak decades earlier). This is great stuff, and it's hard to go wrong.<br/><br/>But Miller goes not merely avoid going wrong. He gives this just enough velocity and just enough breathing room to make it fast and comfortable. You inhabit the movie, you root for the heroes, and you feel the situation more than you thought you could, at least on paper.<br/><br/>The other main influence is the writer, or properly writers (two of them), though Steven Zaillian is listed first in the credits. Zaillian has a whole slew of highly regarded films on his resume--Schindler's List, Gangs of New York, the new Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, on and on--and he clearly has given ""Moneyball"" the slick, smart dialog and story line. But the other writer, for the usual reasons, has gotten the bulk of the attention because (I think) he's been recently associated with ""Social Network,"" and that's Aaron Sorkin. (His one other recent credit is the decent Mike Nichols film, ""Charlie Wilson's War."" He mostly known for writing much of ""West Wing,"" which is pure television, even if very good television.) <br/><br/>But it boils down to a handful of really talented folk putting together a modestly constructed, very smart and engrossing film about something far more fascinating that you'd have ever dreamed. It won't change your life, but it's a must see kind of movie for a quiet night."

","For the several billions of people who find baseball the most boring sport in history, this film very cleverly and with grace shows how baseball was made even more boring, using science. Brad Pitt, really, the entire cast is very good, very good. Brad Pitt could do a movie about the making of the first cereal box and it would probably be great. Brad Pitt as the leading character takes us inside the psyche of a very unique manager of corporate assets, which is what a baseball team is at the bottom line. The dedicated dinosaurs he must contend with are expertly played by a great cast, they seem like real sports managers, and perhaps they are. Hoffman does a great job of acting as an immovable object, and he does it with a minimalist approach that is really convincing and artful. In the end the boring sport of baseball plays back field to dreamers pushing at their dream against formidable forces of public opinion, corporate pressure and certain failure. The story transcends the sport of baseball and shows us what might happen when we open up to change and stand our ground. On a good day, Mickey Mantle would have approved, which is probably why the film opens quoting the legendary ball player."

Brad Pitt I can take or leave. In Moneyball I am more than happy to take Pitt who turns in a thoughtful performance that owes absolutely nothing to his celebrated good looks and everything to observation. This is one case where baseball really is a metaphor for the road we all travel on the journey of life and poses thoughtful questions such as can we deliberately choose to be a winner when the world - and possibly even our friends, family and ourselves, perceive us as losers. Only four names in the cast were known to me and one of them, Robin Wright, has less than five minutes of screen time but the other three, Pitt, of course, plus Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonah Hill, make a great combo and get strong support from virtually the entire cast.

","Bill James is lionized here by main character Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and cohort ""Peter Brand"" (Jonah Hill in the film's only engaging performance). However, only 4 main concepts are touch upon: On-Base Percentage, never intentionally walk a batter, avoid bunting, and avoid stealing. I agree with all four principles. Inly the first is dwelt upon at length. Other favorite categories of Bill James are ignored. As is the fact that the team had 3 great starters - Barry Zito, a certain Hall of Famer who won the Cy Young was not even mentioned. That said, as a lifetime baseball fan, I enjoyed the baseball angle of the movie as well as taking on veteran scouts and the establishment as rooted in the dark ages wedded to approaches that just don't work. All of this makes for a terrific sports debate and a very interesting book (Moneyball).<br/><br/>As a movie made for entertainment, however, it didn't really deliver more than some ironic humor here and there. Pitt played Bean as aloof and emotionally vapid even while talking passionately about his theories. That was a subtext to the entire movie as we spend a lot of time watching Pitt in his car keeping his family and colleagues at a distance with his Bluetooth. That may be accurate - one of the subtexts seemed to be that while Beane helped bring baseball thinking into a new era while overcoming obstacles, his own life remained rather inconsequential. His history-achieving 20th straight win which consumes about 5 minutes of film is immediately written off by Bean himself in 20 seconds. Again, probably an interesting observation and quite possibly true, but not very entertaining or rewarding.<br/><br/>The scenes between him and his guitar-playing daughter (or mostly her voice) are monotonic and just seem to be their to contribute to the subtext of his personal loneliness. Yawn! The scene where he discusses the daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright in a static performance that is little more than a cameo) and her new husband is even more clichéd and vapid. Phillip Seymour Hoffman who can be remarkably good in some roles (Capote, Charlie Wilson's War, Almost Famous) and remarkably bad in others (Punch-Drunk Love, State & Main) is neither here. He portrays Art Howe through Beane's eyes as a traditional chew-spitting, hard-headed, fundamentals-preaching manager. Hoffman's portrayal is more than adequate for a clichéd character that contributes nothing of substance to the movie. Thank goodness for Joanh Hill (who I frankly haven't liked in the other two kid-oriented movies I saw him in). Although the name of his character has been changed from real life, he lets us into his thoughts, feelings, and cares about his relationships. In this movie, that was a much-needed breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>If you are interested in the concepts of Moneyball, read the book first, then see this on basic cable or on Netflix (there's nothing special the big screen brings to this one). Unless she is really into baseball or Brad Pitt, do not make your wife watch it with you!"
"PWNYCNY","10","2","5","3 October 2011"," Excellent inside glimpse of the operation of a major league baseball team.
","If you want gain a better understanding of the operation of a baseball club, this is the movie to watch. This movie dramatizes the role of the general manager, the key front office person who seldom is in the limelight but whose decisions effect the operation of an entire baseball organization. No baseball club will be successful without an effective general manager, but even if the g.m. is effective, there is still no guarantee that this will produce a winning ball club because much of what the g.m. does depends on luck. In baseball, the g.m. is gambling on the players being able to play well, and often the gamble fails. The players get injured, they have emotional issues, attitude problems, labor-management conflicts, events outside of the g.m.'s control that effect the players' performances. It happens all the time. The field manager may be in charge of the players on the field but it is the general manager who has overall responsibility for the team's performance. <br/><br/>This is an excellent movie about baseball, as told from the the vantage point of the general manager, a vantage point that is seldom, if ever, dramatized. Yet, there is probably no job in baseball that is more critical to the success of the team then the general manager's. The GM is the guy (or gal) who is charged with the responsibility for putting together the team. The GM signs the players and makes the trades. The field manager is much more visible but it is the GM who provides the players for the field manager to manage. This movie is about one GM who is unique among GMs since he was actually once a baseball player, albeit a marginal player, who worked his way up the front office ladder. Brad Pitt does an admirable job portraying the field manager. The movie, however, asks the audience to accept a premise that is unsustainable, namely, that the GM hit upon an idea for putting together a winning team according to some kind of mathematical formula based on percentages. This idea, playing the percentages, is as old as baseball itself. Actually, the GM is effective because he can relate to the more marginal, and less expensive, players and believes that if properly managed, these players can get on base just as often as the higher priced players. This idea, too, is as old as baseball itself. Also, the GM's ""system"" fails, that is, his team loses in the playoffs, which sort of takes the wind out the story's sails. Nevertheless, this movie provides an excellent inside glimpse of the operation of a major league baseball team and the challenges confronting the front office in putting together a competitive team."

","This movie is cinema at it's finest. Many were skeptical of Bennet Miller's ability to take Moneyball, a bland story about an idea put together by baseball executives. Let me say this: they were wrong. I'm not one to hand out high ratings lightly, but this film goes above and beyond my expectations. The script, penned by Aaron Sorkin, Oscar winner for The Social Network, is brilliant. He works in comedic elements well still keeping the film as dramatic as it should be. The editing is clean and well thought out, greatly adding to the effect. Pitt delivers a heartfelt and honest performance as Billy Beane, A's GM and former major league dud. He fakes his cool well when discussing ball with his fellow higher-ups, but shows that he is really soft and emotional. Jonah Hill shines, showing Oscar potential as nerd Peter Brand. He shows he can be more than some high-school idiot from Superbad. Now, where the film shines is the direction. Miller captivates a sense of excitement out of a bland story without resorting to sex or violence. His suspense is shown through tension between characters and slow development. The excitement when Scott Hatterberg (the delightful Chris Pratt) hits his walk-off home run to break the winning streak record (Completely true to real life) was so great there were cheers in my theater. The film wraps up perfectly, showing the flaws with the idea of moneyball and wrapping up Billy's personal dilemmas. Miller expertly changes what was the story of an idea into a character study of a man with as many problems as his team. Moneyball is pure bliss."
"AustinInWonderland","Null","2","5","22 September 2011"," Pretty solid. Even for non-baseball fans.
","Three words: Moneyball was pleasant. More-so though if you know anything about or care at all about baseball. I do not. So there were several looooong moments where I felt suspended in stat and technicality limbo. I can't decide if I felt satisfied with how it ended. In particular, the song playing as the ending narratives were displayed made me feel sad for our antagonist instead of proud, as I should have. However, the overall movie was good. And it's based on a true story so it just is what it is. Kinda your typical underdog-athletic-team-triumphs-against- the-odds type movie. Though it was clearly more of a tale of Billy Beane, the team GM, than of one about the Oakland As. Which was the point. It's not necessarily about winning it all (though that would be nice). It's about challenging the status quo. <br/><br/>Where the movie loses many people in baseball tedium, it more than substantially makes up for in comedy. Clever comedy though. There's just no way the movie would have been the same without Jonah Hill. He was such a smart casting choice and if you're a fan of his, you won't be disappointed. It's really cool to see that he can still be hilarious outside of the Superbad/Forgetting Sarah Marshall type stuff we're used to seeing him in. So go see it, at your leisure.<br/><br/>austininwonderland.tumblr.com"

","""MoneyBall"" is drama/comedy directed by Bennett Miller. True story based on Michael Lewis's book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The director has done a good job combining a smart script with humor. Brad Pitt was a perfect pick for the role his dry humor adds a lot to the movie. I'm not a baseball fan and you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Bennett Miller kept his docudrama style adding comedy to keep it fun and interesting for all the different types of audiences. he's a great director, has shot numerous documentaries. He's best known for his biographical film ""Capote"" about Truman Capote released in 2005.<br/><br/>I wasn't very excited about this movie after watching the trailers; it seemed to be like any other sports drama where everybody wins and has a happy ending, but ended up been better than what I expected.

"charlytully","10","2","6","27 November 2011"," There's more to it than ""Show me the money!""
","Many of my regular readers occasionally have complained that a lot of the reviews I write are somewhat negative. I try to explain that most of the films I express an opinion about have gathered just a dozen comments (or less) from other people. I feel it is a greater contribution to the knowledge database of humankind to provide the 16th slant on PAINTBALL (4 out of 10) compared to the 99th critique of MONEYBALL (10 of 10). Apparently there are quite a few people who do not care to see movies meriting just 1, 2, 3, or 4 stars of 10, let alone write about them. However, I will make an exception in the case of MONEYBALL, a movie guaranteed to send shivers up the spine of anyone who ever played organized baseball, softball, or other-ball on a ball diamond as a youth. Unlike THE NATURAL (where Robert Redford wields his ""Wonder Boy"" bat to a few musical notes still heard each season in nearly every major league park, and more than a few minor league ones), MONEYBALL is based on the true history of former Detroit Tiger Billy Beane. There is a brick in front of Comerica Park in Detroit which reads ""Billy Beane, OF, 1988."" Everyone remembers 1988 was the season after the Tigers lost to the Twins in the ALCS, but led their division by about a 100 games before going a million-game losing streak. Well, in 2002 Billy Beane general managed the Oakland A's to a 21st Century record 20-game winning streak, against all odds. (Meanwhile, the Tigers had passed on hiring Beane to head their think tank, choosing instead the folks who would enable an American League record 119-loss season in 2003.) The only way MONEYBALL could be more perfect would be to subtitle it ""Cry of the Tigers."""

Yes, I get that he chose a team based on stats and therefore went against common wisdom, but that's about the whole movie summed up in a sentence. There's barely any actual on pitch action.

It's also long, so long - at least 30 minutes of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor.

"sblank-38422","8","1","2","2 April 2015"," Moneyball
","I highly recommend watching the film Moneyball if you enjoy underdog stories with so much more than the typical sport's movie clichés. Moneyball has everything a great movie needs. It keeps you interested the whole time, as you want (rather, need) to find out if Billy Beane's new method to choosing this baseball team will work. The statistics and mathematical side of it all isn't thrown in the audience's face—everything is explained so that the viewer will understand and follow along with each choice made. Peter Brand is a nice comic relief to the stress that Billy Beane is always under—there are even times when Billy Beane is hilarious, as well. Overall, the story is somewhat sad, yet inspirational and enjoyable at the same time. Billy goes through so much to prove that he is good at what he does, likely due to his first-choice career not going exactly as he planned. To watch this team that was ruled irrelevant at the loss of their major players even attempt such a comeback is inspiring. This is not your typical baseball movie—I don't think you even have to be that into baseball to enjoy it as much as a huge fan of the sport would. If you like movies that tug at your emotions ranging from happy to inspired to sad at times, Moneyball is the movie for you."
"ryklinker","8","1","2","2 January 2015"," The key to small-market success in Baseball
","The team has just lost. They lost their playoff round, they lost their spirits, and, most of all, they've lost their three best players: Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon, and Jason Isringhausen. Thanks to the prevalence of big-budget teams, smaller organizations like the A's are losing all of their best players; one could even go as far as saying that these lesser franchises could be considered farm systems for the big boys in New York or Boston. As is his job, A's GM Billy Beane is faced with filling three roster spots that the lost players once occupied. When he goes in the scouting meeting, all he hears is the same old jargon. Scouts repeat things like ""five-tool player"" and ""a great-looking swing"", which reminds Beane of when he was a hot prospect coming out of high school. Having been the target of these scouts' attention previously, Beane doesn't trust the traditional player evaluation process, and that is where Peter Brand comes in. On a visit to the GM for the Cleveland Indians, Mark Shapiro, Billy fails to find a single trade, and he sees a man whispering advice to Shapiro's assistant. As he leaves through the offices, Billy sees this same man at a cubicle, and he confronts him. The man's name is Peter Brand, and after a few minutes, we learn that Peter is fresh out of Yale with a degree in Economics. This first meeting is where Brand reveals his unique player evaluation system. Just like Beane, Brand sees that the big budget teams are suffering from inflated contracts for some players, and they're severely undervaluing others. Basing his idea off of a groundbreaking book by Bill James, Peter Brand uses a statistical data system that, in theory, will give the A's a chance against the big budget organizations. After ""buying"" Peter from Cleveland, Beane gets set to revitalize Oakland, and immediately he knows that it will be a challenge. <br/><br/>My Thoughts In an era where the contracts for major athletic talent are skyrocketing in price, the Oakland A's were one of the first teams to go against the grain, and this film tells their story. The concept of using statistical analysis to judge talent rather than the traditional way was an unpopular idea back a decade or so ago, but nowadays it is a major familiarity. Thanks to the idea, many baseball teams have earned championship hardware, most notably the San Francisco Giants. As I have said before, I am a fully devoted Giants fan, and I can attest to the fact that the concept made famous across the Bay Bridge has found success on this side. GM Brian Sabean utilizes Moneyball's key principles, and in turn has brought a trio of trophies home. The acting performances are very well executed, especially by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Pitt's role as the layered Billy Beane is great for the actor, and he played it perfectly. Pitt captures the troubling past that Beane had as a player, the difficulty as a divorced man with a growing daughter, and the rapid emotions that flow throughout a real-life baseball season. In a rare dramatic role, Jonah Hill is fantastic as the quirky Peter Brand, nailing both the serious and comical scenes throughout the film with relative ease. This film based on our national pastime received quite a lot of recognition from the public, including the Academy. Though it did not win any, Moneyball was nominated for six Oscar categories, most notably Best Picture, Best Actor (Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Hill), and Adapted Screenplay. I personally believe that Hill's performance and the screenplay were definitely deserving of an award. From the moment that some of you saw the basic storyline of this movie, you might have written it off as a sports movie; however, it is about so much more than just baseball. In this film, the baseball is simply the background setting, and the people behind the scenes are the real focus of the plot. Although quite a bit of the humor is baseball-related, it is still applicable to almost everyone. My one major disclaimer is the infrequent language. It's a PG-13 rated film, and the language is deserving of it. A couple F-words and some smaller curses (sh**, a**, etc.) are uttered, but they're applicable to their situation. <br/><br/>This is a fantastic sports-related movie, and I recommend to everyone who even remotely likes either sports or the people behind it."
"blanche-2","8","1","2","1 January 2015"," changing the game
","I'm not a baseball fan, but ""Moneyball"" from 2011 held my interest all the way through. In part, this was because of the acting, and in part, because the story is so intriguing.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is General Manager of the Oakland A's, and he's fighting some bad odds. He can't compete for the best players because the A's are financially constrained. He loses three stars to free agency after losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs.<br/><br/>Unable to squeeze more money out of the owner, Beane is then approached by Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an economics graduate from Yale. Hill believes people have been thinking about the game all wrong. It's not about stars, it's about statistics. Beane goes along with this and puts together a team that looks like a real loser, full of has-beens and players no one is interested in. But they get on base and score runs.<br/><br/>Beane's manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) thinks the whole idea is awful and refuses to use the players as intended. So they keep losing.<br/><br/>Excellent look at how thinking about things differently can give great benefits. This statistical approach has changed the game as other teams have picked up this method. It's not about the stars, the people who look good whom everybody wants. And no one knows that better than Beane, a baseball prodigy who gave up college and was picked up by a team as its new star and then choked, never living up to his potential.<br/><br/>An outstanding film, with Pitt giving a wonderful, understated performance. Pitt is an actor who, like many from Hollywood's golden Age, suffers from too-good looks and too much publicity about his private life. He's a solid actor who works internally and gives natural performances. Billy Beane is a perfect role for him, a man who, despite internal fears and doubts, stands up for what he believes in.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","11 October 2014"," True to the ideas behind the book. Inspiring in its own way. Interesting for nearly anyone.
","Considering what type of book this movie was made from, the filmmakers did quite a good job. I like the movie because I happen to be a big fan of the baseball stats logic behind it and the original book is probably my favorite book. The book is primarily geared for people who are interested in baseball, business, or logical thought. However, I have seen people who are interested in none of these topics enjoy the movie. The focus is mostly on Billy Beane and Peter Brand's (who's real name is actually Paul DePodesta, but they switched it for some reason) thought process and technique for building a successful baseball team with very little money. It's not your typical inspiring sports movie, which I find to usually be incredibly predictable and corny, but it is inspiring in its own way. Mostly it inspires thoughts of earth-shattering discoveries and introduces the notion that money is not the most powerful force in the game of success. The events behind this movie have changed baseball scouting and management drastically to the present, and it's pretty cool how to see how it happened. The movie is like the book in the ideas that it presents, but the presentation of the ideas is different. In the book, Michael Lewis could just put a table in the text or describe thirty years of baseball stat analysis in a chapter, but you can't do something like that in a movie. It just doesn't hold the audience's attention. The movie gets the same ideas across by using the head scout and the manager, Art Howe, as antagonists that don't believe in the ideas that Billy and Peter put before them. It also concentrates on how Billy relates to the players in ways that are incredibly unconventional for a GM. So it manages to get the results that are better shown by stats without stats, if that makes sense. The only scene that I felt like was not well converted into movie format was the trade deadline phone call scene. There are many external people involved and it is very easy to get confused by it. That part in the book is quite good, but it probably could have been left out of the movie. On the contrary, a scene that I thought was better presented in the movie than the book is the scene where Peter shows Billy all of the underrated data and players that they can use to build a team for a dirt cheap price. The idea itself is almost impossible not to believe in because the results of it are still being formed and there are a plethora of stats to prove that the system works. Results of it are even shown in the movie in the scenes that show actual games. It's a pretty good watch for anyone that doesn't mind having to pay attention for two hours, and overall, it's quite interesting. I would say to potential viewers, don't be turned away from watching this if you don't like baseball or if you don't like movies with a lot of debating, because there isn't enough of either in the conventional sense to turn away anyone. Overall Rating: 9/10"

","My family is somewhat agnostic about sports, meaning that we believe they exist but are not certain of the where or why of them.

","Have to say, I really liked this film! Initially I thought this wouldn't interest me since I'm not a baseball fan, but the movie is so well made you don't have to love baseball to appreciate it. The actors make you care about it, the camera pans of the grass and the stadiums are done with such care and reverence, it's hard not to get caught up in the romance of the sports. It reminded me a bit of The Wrestler from a few years back and how that affected a lot of people who didn't really care for wrestling. In a sense, the movie is not really about baseball, it's about rising above and not following the status quo, even when you put yourself at great risk doing so.<br/><br/>It was surprisingly very funny and true to the sport. Easily the best role I've seen Jonah Hill in (and yes, better than he was in The Wolf of Wallstreet). He's really solid in his supporting role and almost steals it from Brad. This movie has the best musical score I've heard from 2011 (or at least I can't remember a film that tops it); it's really effective in driving home some of the important parts of the film. And I found it pleasantly ironic that film called Moneyball ends up concluding on the fact that life isn't always about money.<br/><br/>I thought Brad Pitt was strong in this film. It was a very subtle performance, but I think he nailed it. As I watched the movie, I really believed he was a beleaguered manager, frustrated with his team's inability to complete with the big market teams; I really can't say that about a lot of his roles. For once, I actually believed he was this character (Billy Beane). His performance might not have been Oscar worthy (as he didn't win and I agree with that), but it was strong nonetheless.<br/><br/>One of the more memorable moments of the film is at the end when Billy Beane asks ""How can you not feel romantic about baseball?"".

Together they set about building a new team of cheap overlooked players. At first this doesn't go down well they hire what appears to be a bunch of has-beens and never-will-bes and not surprisingly they start to lose a lot.

"Desertman84","10","1","2","1 September 2012"," Moneyball Surprisingly Has Intelligence And Depth
","Moneyball is a sports drama film based on Michael Lewis's book of the same name which gives an account of the Oakland Athletics baseball team's 2002 season and their general manager's attempts to assemble a competitive team.It stars Brad Pitt,Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman.<br/><br/>Based on a true story,it is a movie for anybody who has ever dreamed of taking on the system. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who assembles the team, who has an epiphany: all of baseball's conventional wisdom is wrong. Forced to reinvent his team on a tight budget, Beane will have to outsmart the richer clubs. The onetime jock teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that the scouts call flawed, but all of whom have an ability to get on base, score runs, and win games. The team's scouts are first dismissive of and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players, most notably Grady Fuson – who is fired by Beane after insulting their approach, and takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on base percentage (OBP). By finding players with a high OBP but with characteristics that lead scouts to dismiss them,Brand assembles a team of undervalued players with far more potential than the A's hamstrung finances would otherwise allow. Despite vehement objections from the scouts, Beane supports Brand's theory and hires the players he selected, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford. Following the free agent signings, Beane finds that he also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them because of a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane and Brand's strategy and plays the team in a traditional style despite their unsuitability. Beane eventually trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Peña, to force Howe to use the new recruits.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics within and outside the team to dismiss the new method as a dismal failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course, and eventually the team's record begins to improve. Ultimately, the Athletics win 20 consecutive games, setting the American League record. Their streak is capped with a victory over the Kansas City Royals. <br/><br/>The movie is not a traditional sports movie, and indeed should be just as gripping for non-sports fans. It's not a series of Big Games. When it goes to the field, it's for well-chosen crucial moments. Its essence is in terse, brainy dialogue by the two accomplished screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. As in ""The Social Network,"" abstract discussions reflect deep emotional conflicts. There are a lot of laughs, but only one or two are inspired by lines intended to be funny. Instead, our laughter comes from recognition, an awareness of irony, an appreciation of perfect zingers — and, best of all, insights into human nature.<br/><br/>This is really a movie about business. None of the individual players have major roles. The drama all happens in the mind of a general manager and his numbers guy. They bet against tradition and in favor of numerical analysis. That goes against a century of baseball history, although for all of those years, fans have thumbed through their baseball almanacs and issued mind-numbing statistical theories on talk shows. What the numbers crunchers demonstrated is that a computer can assemble a team better than human instinct.Finally,what is surprising about this movie is that it has intelligence and depth as it presents a man who is about to redeem himself from his past failures and overcome the present challenges and obstacles that he is currently facing in the achievement of his goals."

","The Oakland ""A""'s major League baseball team post 2001 season, their General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is nursing a gut wrenching loss, to the big spending New York Yankees.<br/><br/>Realising that he is about to lose several key players, he asks management for more money but the pot is empty. Make do and mend is the advice, albeit pleasantly relayed. Baseball, like most pro-sports is all about money, if you have more, you can buy the better players, win more games, attract more fans, sponsorship and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>However, if you don't have much money to spend, your options narrow quickly.<br/><br/>On a regular trip to the Cleveland Indians to trade players, Beane notices a youngster who appears to be dispensing wisdom but clearly is not cut from the same cloth as the usual talent scouts. Most of whom appear to pick players based on a random and highly subjective criteria, including if their girlfriends are pretty.<br/><br/>Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), is a Yale educated Economics graduate who has developed and refined ideas put forward by Bill James and Craig Wright. Rather than looking at star power, players are evaluated on OBP (On Base Percentage) and Slugging Percentage. Because other teams are not utilising such a method, there were many ""diamond in the rough"" players that could be recruited cheaply. These players would theoretically play well, if assembled carefully in a team with the other required attributes.<br/><br/>A team built by a computer based on statistics if you will.<br/><br/>Testing Brand out by asking whether Beane himself would have been picked in the draft when younger, the honest response confirms the hire of the young man with the radical ideas.<br/><br/>Understandably this new approach does not endear Beane to the existing talent scouts. Initially, the theory is stretched to breaking point as the team fares badly. Will Management keep the faith and will Beane have the strength to see his vision out and change Baseball for ever? Time will tell and none of the above are spoilers, this is a fact based film and all of the information, results etc are well known to any fan with even a passing interest in the subject.<br/><br/>If the story sounds a bit dry, well known screenwriters Stephen Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have managed to craft an exciting, engaging and ultimately very human tale. The story has plenty of great scenes, an Oscar nominated performance from Pitt, coupled with excellent and extensive period detail, assisted and aided by direct help from the Professional Baseball tour.<br/><br/>Pitt is not alone, he has sterling support from Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Oakland's long suffering coach, Robin Wright as his ex-wife and Jonah Hill who surprises, with a Oscar worthy nuanced performance.<br/><br/>The story flows very well and we experience the highs and lows that only professional sport can demonstrate so well. The scene where Brand is taught how to provide bad news feels realistic, as is the players response to the news. There is enough humour to lighten the mood and certainly knowledge of baseball is really not required.<br/><br/>Beane's relationship with his daughter and ex-wife are also realistically sketched. The whole enterprise by Director Bennett Miller has been handled with love and care, in keeping with a sport that still manages to maintain a romanticized place in the hearts of many.<br/><br/>The film uses real locations where possible, dressed to resemble the correct time period. The dressing rooms are sets but are meticulously created to replicate the facilities, uniforms and equipment of the time.<br/><br/>The film credits list extensive ""effects"" which are hard to spot, as the real and archival action are merged seamlessly, to create a very believable period set whole.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>An excellent sports film which like the best in the genre is not really about sport at all, merely using the structure as a metaphor for life itself.<br/><br/>All round excellent performances, led by an exceptionally naturalistic performance from Pitt who has arguably never been better.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
"Buddy-51","9","1","2","26 June 2012"," Top-notch sports drama
","Billy Beane has a problem. As general manager for the cash-strapped Oakland A's, Beane is having a hard time recruiting quality players, mainly because, with the limited budget the owner has given him to work with, he can't possibly compete with the multimillion dollar contracts being proffered by A-tier teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox. To add insult to injury, those teams keep pilfering the few decent players Beane's already got. Into the breach steps Peter Brand, a 23-year-old numbers-cruncher straight out of Yale who's devised a complex algorithm out of players' statistics that will allow recruiters to focus in on the less obviously flashy - and thereby far less expensive - players whom the Big Boy franchises have managed to overlook. The skeptics question the wisdom and efficacy of reducing team-building to mere mathematic formulas and science, but Brand's method winds up working so well that it forever revolutionizes the way major league baseball teams recruit their players.<br/><br/>Based on the 2003 book by Michael Lewis, with screenplay by Steve Zaillion and Aaron Sorkin and direction by Bennett Miller, ""Moneyball"" provides a literal inside-baseball glimpse into the inside of baseball. In many ways, ""Moneyball"" is a kind of grownup version of ""The Bad News Bears"" and every other tale of a coach who pulls together a motley crew of misfits and second-stringers and, against all odds, transforms them into a winning team. The difference is that this story has actual history behind it, recounting the 2002 season in which the A's won a record 20 games in a row (yet still lost in the playoffs). Plus, the movie finds its drama more in the behind-the-scenes wrangling among the highly skeptical managers, owners, coaches and staff than in the action on the field (indeed, most of the ballpark scenes appear as grainy clips from actual games). The intelligent screenplay avoids most of the clichés inherent in the genre - and those it doesn't avoid it somehow manages to make seem fresh and vital again. The writing also adds depth and dimension to Beane's character by occasionally flashing back to his own somewhat underwhelming career as a player in the big leagues, showing how that disappointment helped to mold him into the man he is today.<br/><br/>Despite the sterling quality of the writing and direction, ""Moneyball"" is clearly an actors' picture, and the filmmakers have recruited a first-rate cast to carry out the drama (I wonder if they used a similar algorithm for that). Brad Pitt has probably never been better than he is here as the Quixotic visionary who's such a bundle of nerves that he can't even bring himself to watch his own games. A mixture of pragmatist and romantic when it comes to the game of baseball, Beane is the perfect person to serve as iconoclast for a game whose roots lie deep in the American psyche but a game that has lost its way in recent times with its huge salaries and uncompetitive money advantages among teams. Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, as is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, the A's highly skeptical and understandably disgruntled manager, who initially balks at what he believes is the disastrous direction in which Beane is taking the team. Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation"") and Kerris Dorsey (""Parenthood"") also score in small but important roles.<br/><br/>There's drama and suspense aplenty in this film, with literal edge-of-the-seat excitement generated by its re-creation of the nail-biting 20th game that got the A's into the record books. But ""Moneyball"" never overplays its hand, never indulges in corny melodramatics or cheap sentiment to win us over to its side. In fact, it is its very restraint and subtlety - both in performance and execution - that draws us so deeply into the tale it's telling."
"michaelRokeefe","9","1","2","3 May 2012"," Maybe Brad Pitt's most believable role.
","Most everyone with any knowledge of baseball has heard of ""Billy Ball"", ""Whitey Ball"", ""small ball""...what about moneyball? Billy Beane(Brad Pitt)at a young age began getting his training to do what every boy dreamed of...play Major League Baseball. Yes, once he had what should have made him a superstar; but reality is that Billy failed to live up to all the heady expectations. Being a natural born competitor, Billy moved his talents to management. In 2002, Beane found himself the General Manager of the small-market Oakland A's, a team losing its major players to richer ball teams. Driven to win, Beane was under the gun to replace major stars with lesser known players that would not command a significant salary. He would in almost desperation team up with a number-crunching economist Peter Brand(Jonah Hill), who had a sharp insight at comparing ballplayers by statistical analysis. Billy and Peter would begin defying odds by assembling a roster of misfits and smart trades of higher dollar players. This method of putting players on the field did not impress the A's field manager Art Howe(Philip Seymour Hoffman), nor the baseball media or even faithful A's fans. But ultimately this bargain basement approach of building a team would change the way the game is played and approached. Beane in a way did become a superstar, but not for his playing...his unconventional thoughts of the game he loves. Not a lot of baseball action on screen; but looking at the inner-workings of the game. I believe Pitt deserves a lot of credit for his role considering he claimed to know nothing about baseball before seeing the script. Kudos also to Hill playing a role completely out of his element. Others in the cast: Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop, Adrian Bellani, Casey Bond, Nick Porrazzo and Robin Wright."

","When the credits began to roll, I was like: Of course it was Aaron Sorkin. I should have known. While according to IMDb he didn't write it alone (I guess he was the last to ""temper"" with the script), I'm pretty sure he had his hands on most of the dialogue in the movie. Really great stuff. And whoever thought Jonah Hill can't do anything ... well watch this movie and start believing.<br/><br/>Of course the bigger name is Brad Pitt and he shows his love for the game by really sticking to this concept and getting it made in the first place (the four credited writers here are an indication that it took some time to get it off ground). Even a side-/sub-story that get thrown in halfway through the movie does not really temper with the mood or distract you too much (which was something I was afraid of, when Robin Wright came into the ""play"").<br/><br/>Don't watch it though if you wanna see the game itself. There is not much of that happening. But the movie does not need any of the sports scenes to work. It works perfect as it is ..."

","In the late 19th century, a baseball team was introduced to a up-and-coming young America as pastoral fun and leisure entertainment. However, someone from a rival town took to betting on that unimportant, non-descriptive game and promised to return with a better-team. That created a rivalry and up sprang a dozen teams all believing their's was the best. Fast forward to the present and anyone with a T.V. can see a baseball game being plays with a variety of teams, players and managers earning vast sums of money. Records and statistics are kept, revamped and stored, none of which can add one ray of sunshine to the original pastoral intent. This movie staring Brad Pitt is called "" Moneyball. "" It tells the story of Billy Beane (brad Pitt) who is a General Manager told by the owner that he is charged to create a winning baseball team with the funds already allocated to him. Despite his pleas for additional monies, none are forthcoming. Forced to accept that, he decides to hire Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a statical researcher who believes the best way to win is to select players based on accumulated untapped statistics. Upon assembling said team, they are primed to win games, but are prevented by Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an old style coach who does not believe it's the way to run a team. Thus, it's a test of wills and therein lies the heart of this movie. In addition to his on the field problems is Beane's personal life and his growing teenage daughter. The film is a reminder of what's important, the game or the money? For the audience, it's a reminder of what becomes important to a man, his family or what he does to it? Something to remember when seeking a fun game. ****"
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","12 February 2012"," ""You may not look like a winning team, but you are one.""
","If you're a sports fan, then you've probably thought about this question - Would you rather have a team of low priced players that had a lot of heart and could perform the basics well under a team leader type of manager, or one put together of the highest paid players who had the best stats for their position and were the best at what they do. The New York Yankees are generally acknowledged as representing the latter (at least in baseball), while any lowly club in the standings will do for the former. Now comes along a film like ""Moneyball"" that introduces a new element - how can statistical analysis be used to insure that the fundamentals of the game attain their best percentage of success for a winning season?<br/><br/>My personal interest in baseball pretty much coincides with the teams I played on when I was a kid way back in the day. When professional player salaries entered the stratosphere and personal appearances required a fee for the honor of an autograph - well, the idea of playing for the love of the game simply went out the window for me. However on the flip side, I can enjoy a good sports movie if it engages on an intellectual AND entertaining level, and ""Moneyball"" fits the bill on that score.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware that the Oakland Athletics achieved their oh so close season in 2002 on the basis of the statistical analysis at the heart of the story. Forced to contend with a budget that didn't allow for extravagant salaries, A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) was inspired to dig just a little deeper using the methods of a young, twenty five year old Yale graduate who had this numbers thing down pat. Not very different actually from the kind of number crunching that Fortune 500 companies do on a day to day basis. As with all endeavors that are brand new in a given field, Beane and his wunderkind Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), are met with derision and disappointment in the early going. However when the team catches stride in mid-season, they go on a tear that sets a Major League baseball record for consecutive wins at twenty games.<br/><br/>For the casual movie goer, the Cinderella story that was meant to be never occurs, because in life, sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't. The magic of this movie, and I don't want to overstate it, is that people of conviction, no matter what their field of endeavor, must often face overwhelming odds to have their ideas vindicated. Sometimes they win and sometimes they lose. The winner is the one who perseveres when others are casting doubt and ridicule, and are eventually exposed for not having known any better than the next guy.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a baseball fan, or even a sports fan to get something out of ""Moneyball"". The idea of keeping an open mind and trying something new when something old just isn't working is what makes the story interesting. Even when Billy Beane's methods were shown to be effective a couple of years later by a Boston Red Sox team that tried to hire him, there are still those old time managers and coaches that will give those concepts short shrift just by a refusal to change. I find that to be similar to reviewers on this site who disparage a movie who admit to not watching the whole thing because they didn't like the story line or found it boring."
"paudie","8","1","2","10 February 2012"," Excellent movie about baseball and business
","Moneyball is as much about business as baseball. It tells the story of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Major League Oakland A's. It is the early 2000's and the team have had a great season, getting to the playoffs and losing to the star studded New York Yankees. He would like to build on that success but the owner tells him he can't increase the team budget and three of his best players will be moving to bigger teams where they will get much bigger salaries.<br/><br/>The owner is fair and doesn't expect Beane to perform miracles. He knows his GM will try his best to unearth diamonds through his scouting team. Beane himself is very unhappy. He knows that, no matter how well he scouts and how hard he bargains; the sport is weighted in favour of the big clubs with the most money and in the long run, the odd good season apart, the A's will always be one of the runts of the MLB litter.<br/><br/>It is with this mindset that he holds the first meeting of the offseason with his scouting team. Like every other year the scouts (who are portrayed as much older than Beane, played by Brad Pitt) will try to find cheap talented players, using the tried old methods they have always used. Beane is not happy with this and tells the scouts that the old ways ware no longer good enough, as the A's can't compete with the richer teams without trying something different. He doesn't even know what this ""new way"" is but he knows he must try something.<br/><br/>By chance Beane meets Peter Brand, a young man who seems to have a lot of influence in the Cleveland Indians players selection. Beane is curious and Brand reveals that he uses a statistical method of grading players that, basically, grades players on how many runs they get, not on their style of play or their reputation. Brand is convinced that most baseball times don't look for what is really important when they are scouting for players. Beane thinks that this could be the angle he needs and hires Brand as his assistant, much to the chagrin of some of the scouting staff.<br/><br/>Beane and Brand bring in some new players that no other team seems to want. The season starts poorly and the manager doesn't want to pick some of the new players. However they stick with the new system and it starts to pay off as the team go on a record breaking unbeaten run and end the season in the playoffs.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie. It seems to be a real underdog story but in the end baseball is shown to be a business first and last. The ending reveals the megarich Boston Red Sox won the World Series a few years later, using the system that Beane used in 2002 with the A's. It seems the richer teams just copied the new scouting system that worked and still throw a lot of money at players. So, again the smaller teams can't really compete! The acting is good. Jonah Hill is excellent in a rare non-comedy role. I thought Pitt was trying a bit too hard. Perhaps he had Oscar night in mind.<br/><br/>There are some great scenes, especially at the start of the movie when Beane confronts his old scouts and when he visits a player he wants to sign, knowing the player has received no other offers due to injury problems. There are a few ""Hollywood"" moments that jarred a bit, such as the match they broke the consecutive wins record (too much slow motion) and a few scenes with Beane's daughter (too much singing).<br/><br/>There isn't much actual baseball shown, so don't be put off from seeing this if you aren't a fan. This movie, like most good movies is about people and how they react to changing circumstances in their lives."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","29 January 2012"," Slow-paced but engaging story that benefits from charismatic performances from the leads
","The Oscar nominations this week just added to the reasons I had for wanting to see a film that had been surprisingly praised in the UK when it first came out. I do like baseball – not enough to watch it for hours and hours every few days but enough to go see a game when I'm in the US or sit in a bar there for the important games, but with Moneyball the subject is less the action on the field but more the discussions in the offices. The result of this is a film that lacks the big emotional moments of action that you'll get with other baseball movies, but instead produces a really nice slow-burn that satisfies and engages throughout.<br/><br/>The way it does this is deceptive because it seems all very easy because it doesn't have any moments of ""big"" writing, no dialogue that soars above the audience, no one moment where the film is all tied up or where the audience feels the urge to applaud. Instead it is really quite natural throughout and it makes for an engaging way to tell the story. The stats are made accessible and the viewer is brought inside the day-to-day of making the approach work but where it really succeeds is in the telling of Beane's story – of him overcoming doubters, sticking to his gut (ironically given his approach) and making it work. He is the heart of the film and he is the reason why I didn't mind spending the games with him, unable to see what was happening but still feeling like I was in the right place.<br/><br/>Pitt is a massive part of this working as well as it does and it is why he got the acting nod. He is natural, charismatic but uses his star-power well to have presence but not to be distant from the viewer. As he has gotten older he seems to have added layers to his acting ability and this and Tree of Life marks an excellent year for him. He is well supported by Jonah Hill who doesn't play up the comedy fat-guy role he so often has, but instead is nervy, insecure and intelligent and the pairing makes for a good combination throughout. Supporting roles are equally good and the film generally has a natural and engaging feel of reality.<br/><br/>It must be said that Moneyball is a slow film and those expecting big moments or something thrilling will be prone to disappointment but this will be to do with their expectations, not the film. In place of this the film produces great performances, a natural air, an accessible tone and a roundly satisfying and engagingly-told story. It won't blow you out of your seat, but it is a solidly strong film from start to finish."

Moneyball is a fine film and enjoyable for fans of the game and even casual baseball fans. The somewhat gritty story of a GM, played very cleanly by Brad Pitt, who looks for ways to win without a huge budget, is entertaining and inspiring.

"Andy-296","9","1","2","28 December 2011"," Great film, even if you did not agree with everything in it
","I know little of baseball, but I quite liked this movie. It is the true story about how Oaklands Athletics manager Billy Beane (a fine performance by Brad Pitt), facing the loss of some of his best players after the end of the season, and with very little budget to hire good replacements, decided to apply statistical methods to find good but undervalued (and therefore, cheap) players. By traveling this path, he gets the opposition of much of the official baseball establishment (though this should not be exaggerated). To help him in this endeavor, he hired a young university graduate (played by Jonah Hill) to whom he soon becomes a mentor, introducing him to the business side of baseball. With these methods, Beane assembled a team for the following season that, while was unable to win the championship, did make it to the playoffs, and generally did much better than expected initially.<br/><br/>The filmmakers are honest enough not to show Beane as a completely nice guy. He has a bad temper. He is cold and aloof with the players (he never travels with the team), refusing to become friends with them, in order to be easier to fire them. It is hinted that he wasn't that good as a husband. Despite these flaws, he is a compelling, generally sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The movie basically believes that human intuition (in the form of the aging scouts) is no match for the mathematical and statistical methods of young nerds. If one has the romantic notion that not everything in life can be quantified, and that in some fields the human brain can still do better than a computer, then one feels oneself to be on the other side of the argument proposed by this movie.<br/><br/>Also, although I'm not very knowledgeable about baseball, it seems to me that the changes proposed by Beane (no stolen bases, emphasis on reaching first base and not taking unnecessary risks) makes for a duller, if more standardized, game. So whether the end result of these changes he proposed made for a more entertaining game, it is debatable.<br/><br/>But despite the fact that I was a bit uncomfortable with its thesis, I did like and enjoy the film."

","I love inspirational sports movies, who doesn't? But Moneyball is not that kind of movie - Moneyball is about the reality of big money, corporate sport - where millions buy the players - and results mean careers; and what we get is complex, satisfying, and interesting as a result.<br/><br/>Moneyball is the true story of the league's ""poorest"" baseball team, with a team roster bill of $37 million, one fifth of the big boys budget. It is also the tale of how the game changed forever through the smarter use of statistics.<br/><br/>Shot in a style that is very reminiscent of The Social Network, semi-documentary camera angles (distance on speech for example, which traditional film narratives will cut in close-up, and close-up on non-narrative etc;) , this is smart film- making that doesn't resort to devices to drive it - it is a subtle piece of filming that compliments the story well.<br/><br/>Above all though, this is a film of performances, and not just the excellent performance from Pitt, who rewards the viewer willing to try to understand what a General Manager must go through, and his team of coaches and players who really ring true.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of the better films of 2011, it rewards careful, thoughtful watching, and breaks from the Rocky style of sport films that have dominated the genre."

","The first genuine Oscar contender to land on our screens, this ostensible sports flick has set the bar very high indeed. Based on real events (and adapted from Michael Lewis' book ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"") Moneyball recounts the ground-breaking approach that General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) took to enable the Oakland Athletics, with their $40m payroll, to compete against sides like the Yankees who had $120m behind them. With only a handful of actual baseball scenes featured – mostly from the 20th match in the A's record-breaking 20 game winning streak – director Bennett Miller wisely sticks close to the utterly gripping off-field drama that screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian have superbly eked out with their pens. Brad Pitt proves his sense for picking career propelling roles is still flawless; his turn as the arrogant, charming, stubborn and intelligently forward-thinking Beane is a revelation, surely placing him as the early frontrunner for Best Actor come the awards season that's just around the corner. Throw in a well-measured, heartfelt performance from Jonah Hill and you have a film that will undoubtedly be tagged a classic in the not-too-distant future."
"webmaster-3017","9","1","2","4 December 2011"," HK Neo Reviews: Moneyball
","Moneyball is just another one of those inspirational sporting flicks, but rather it is a movie about the running of a business in sport, the implications of questioning and doing something against the norm and at its very core a character drama about Billy Beane. In fact the film being adapted by Aaron Sorkin at times felt like The Social Network in the way it analyse the human condition through some smart dialogue and interchange. The casting of Brad Pitt as the complicated, passionate, yet lonely Billy Beane is pitch-perfect. Years ago, Pitt would need been able to pull this off, but he is now a matured and reformed actor and a far cry from his Troy's days. The chemistry between Pitt and the polar opposite in the nerdy Peter Brand (played by Superbad's Jonah Hill) is fascinating and involving to watch. The way the two persist on their vision against the odds is both inspiring and rewarding for the audience. Baseball like most other sports have become part of the money game, therefore it is always refreshing to see the underdogs match it with the big boys. Still, Moneyball isn't just about a small team going on a 20 game winning streak and matching it with the big boys, but about the difficulty to influence change and the hardship involve in going against tradition. Fortune flavours the brave as the saying goes and for Moneyball it very much rings true.<br/><br/>All in all, Moneyball is a realistic look at the baseball industry and how it operates and the dynamics that goes on behind the scenes. It may never be an outright successful film, but Moneyball works on all levels and go the extra mile to take the audience along for the ride and eventually winning the audiences' hearts along the way. Great acting, wonderful direction and terrific multi-layer film that ends up working wonders. A film to beat for 2011 <br/><br/>Neo rates it 9/10"

","An article on Cracked.com states that we don't know how bicycle work, and that they were first created by trial and error. Nowadays, they say: ""Even modern bike design schools admit that it's not engineering or computer knowledge that make a good bike designer, but instead ""intuition and experience.""<br/><br/>Moneyball is about the exact opposite of that.<br/><br/>Billy Beane is the GM of the poorest team in baseball, the Oakland A's in 2002. With Peter Brand, an Economics graduate from Yale, they devise a new way of making a team- not with scouts, but numbers and formulas. The story is fairly plain, and the ending isn't what I expected (don't know my baseball history)- for the worse, but for 2 hours Moneyball is an enjoyable film with a great main character, witty writing, and generally the qualities of a good film.<br/><br/>This is not a dramatic baseball film, it's a drama film with baseball. I thought I knew how the film would end before I went in, so I thought, ""It's not the what, but the why and how"". However this was not the case. The film didn't end how I thought, and the true story isn't as good as what I thought would happen. The true story is much less inspiring, and the filmmakers tried very hard to make it seem like the A's did change baseball. I don't know if they did, but the facts are more convincing than words.<br/><br/>Asides from the plot, the film is about the man who makes it happen. And the man who really makes it happen. Brad Pitt gives an excellent performance as the winning- driven GM. Through a few flashbacks, we see why Beane is so ready to embrace this radical system everyone else sees as crazy. These scenes give him personality and depth. He's the dreamer in a world full of Suits, with one hilarious cameo by Bobby Kotick, archenemy of gamers everywhere. <br/><br/>Beane learns of the stat method from Peter Brand, in a dramatic role by Jonah Hill, who more often than not plays the funny guy. It's interesting to see him play a quiet, new-to-business person where everyone makes jokes (some quite funny) while he can only sit and look scared. It would be like if Robert De Niro or Al Pacino were the guys being shaken down by the mobsters. <br/><br/>The film is quite funny, but it has to be. It isn't a serious drama, so it goes for the lighthearted approach to avoid being flat. The writing is great, and steers away from the potentially fatal baseball slang/terms. Such gems as ""Yeah, but his girlfriend's a 6..."" and ""This'd better work."" will keep you laughing. <br/><br/>So the film is pretty safe, with a strong lead and universal ""think differently/ stick to your guns"" message. Moneyball isn't going to be remembered for its uniqueness or innovation, and in fact unless it wins Oscars it won't be remembered at all. It's a good film, just not special. I only have one complaint, which is his relationship with his daughter is out-of-place in such a work-focused film. Their scenes are silly, with one ridiculous line so close to 9/11. (The movie takes place in 2002.)<br/><br/>Moneyball is a well-made and well-acted film that doesn't push any boundaries but plays comfortably within set ones. 8.0/10"
"festivalfolly","7","1","2","10 October 2011"," Even if you're not a baseball fan, ""Moneyball"" scores.
","Even if you're not a baseball, go and see Moneyball. I saw it recently, and though it's taken me a few weeks, I am here writing a review. Why? Because I thought it was a fun film with some great performances.<br/><br/>Start with Brad Pitt, playing Billy Beane, the GM of the bargain basement Oakland A's. Beane has to find ways to seek players that are in the bargain bin of free agency, and get results out of them. Pitt conveys both Beane's frustration with his situation, and his ability to ""adapt or die."" As the real-life Beane did, Pitt adapts.<br/><br/>How about Jonah Hill playing the fictitious Peter Brand character (loosely based on Paul DePodesta, who was Billy's assistant GM and now in a similar role with the New York Metropolitans)? This was a different role for him - not slapstick - and he shines in it. As I saw one other IMDb reviewer say, not many other actors could have pulled off the closed fist. See the movie.<br/><br/>Then, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing the stubborn Art Howe - the manager that just won't give in to Beane's ""Saber-Metrics"" philosopy. He is so staunch in his ways, makes you frustrated to watch ... but in a good way.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, this movie does not candy-coat. It shows Beane's strengths, and his failures (both as a player, and in some of his goals), although the movie itself is anything but. See it, as I think it will be up for a number of awards at some point next year."

","I truly found this movie to be engaging and thoroughly interesting all the way through. Knowing a lot about baseball and the era represented certainly helps. While it certainly can deliver for the non-baseball fan, a true die-hard will enjoy it the most as long as they can reconcile the exaggeration, Hollywood treatment and overselling of the concept (the Twins team that beat them spent nothing as well but they didn't crunch any OBA numbers themselves). Baseball facts aside, it's a well structured and well acted film.

","I use to watch baseball! I liked watching baseball, but became tired of watching the Yankees winning over and over again. The Jays etc became feeder teams for the richer teams. ""Moneyball"" addresses the free agency issue of how does a poor team compete with the Yankees. <br/><br/>After the A's lose to the Yankees, Pitt's character Billy Beane asks how can the A's compete. The part of the movie I like is Billy keeps asking why? The scouts have no answers. Billy knows, as a manager, he needs to recruit players a different way. Billy needs to replace three top players, and runs across this accounting type guy from the Cleveland Indians and implements money ball. A great theory. One recruits less quality players, which cost less to pay, who get on base often, and score. The team might have more errors, and their mistakes will cause runs. These same players will create more even greater amount of runs and win the game. <br/><br/>The best part of the movie is with such a radical idea, Billy faces much opposition from the establishment. People in control hate new ideas. People get fired, they trade players,(my favorite part) Billy trades and demotes a huge chunk of the team to force the coach to play his players and system. The movie shows Billy as a maverick, a 3 D thinker, straight shooter, tests people, who loves the game. Loves it so much that he stays in Oakland, which show Billy's character. The movie was a joy to watch."
"cholmes58","Null","1","2","25 September 2011"," Moneyball, A Baseball Story That Doesn't Totally Fill the Big Screen
","It's a movie that begins and grooves (for a while) with a promising premise – that is based on a true story of a then-novel way to determine the true value of major league baseball players and how the Oakland Athletics' used that approach to fill three critical departures.<br/><br/>Starring Brad Pitt as real-life general manager Billy Beane, the movie gets off to a intriguing start with a compelling conflict during a meeting between the team's general manager, Billy Beane – played by Brad Pitt – and a group of seasoned scouts and player development officials. The off-season focus of the pow-wow is to determine how to fill the void created by the free-agency departure of three star players – Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen.<br/><br/>The solution – much to the incredulity of the old guards – begins with the stealing of a young Cleveland Indians official, a recent graduate from Yale with a degree in economics, who is a devotee of the Bill James statistical school of thought that revolutionized the value we attach to ballplayers. Portrayed with nerd-perfection by Jonah Hill, it doesn't take him long to get Beane to wed himself with a religious fervor to this novel approach.<br/><br/>Leading to the acquisition of three castaway players who nonetheless statistically equate to comparable replacements in place of the departed top-dollar players, the approach is initially stymied by the team's manager Art Howe (played by Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hofffman) who doesn't buy into it and is determined to manage the team – such as it is – as he sees fit.<br/><br/>While he is clearly one of the greatest actors to walk the earth, Hoffman is cast in an understated role. If before seeing this movie you make the mistake of watching a DVD of him in previous raging roles such as his turn as a beleaguered priest in Doubt, you will truly be frustrated by the emotional leash he wears throughout the film. Although the conflict between the manager and Beane leads one to believe that one of Hoffman's patented furious and always entertaining explosion performances is in the offing, it disappointingly never happens.<br/><br/>For knowledgeable baseball fan, it doesn't take that good of a memory of this not-so-distant sports history to recall that the A's have not been in a World Series since 1990, and that makes for an inherent spoiler from the start. The otherwise success that takes place during that 2002 season offsets that somewhat, but the last 40 minutes of the movie is anti-climatic to that which came before (and really never reached a climatic point).<br/><br/>Far from being spoken in the same breath as the greatest baseball movies of all-time, its main value is in telling the somewhat true story of the innovations pushed by Billy Beane, who is still seeking a real-life World Series appearance and championship. Brad Pitts does the best he can with the role and script he has been given, as do the rest of the actor. However, at the end of the movie, it is an interesting question that begs – without the overhead cost of the stars and production values, would the filmmakers have made a more compelling and profitable movie if they had done it as a documentary? Such a question leads to the conclusion that the talents of Pitt and especially Hoffman were largely wasted in Moneyball.<br/><br/>While a documentary could have expanded further on some of the more illuminating revelation of the latest in statistical number crunching and thereby possibly make a thought-provoking film, pouring the 2002 Beane/A's story into plot glass leaves it less than half empty."
"EmmaDinkins","Null","1","2","25 September 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: Moneyball, the mathematics of baseball.
","There have been so many films dedicated to Baseball that they are too numerous to count, but this has to be the first that I have ever seen that was based on the mathematics of the game. I tend to get a little bit bored with stories that are based on true events and I did yawn at one point during this film, but overall it was such a fresh take on how desperate times call for desperate measures that I quickly perked up. Watching the on screen wheeling and dealings of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) as the Oakland A's general manager was very educational if not a bit disconcerting. The players are basically treated like livestock, which just made me a little sad. Jonah Hill (Peter Brand) consistently proves himself as an amazing actor, it doesn't matter if it is comedy, drama or animation he just transforms. I have repeatedly watched Megamind with my grandson recently, so immediately I thought of Metroman and Titan together again! I place this film right up there with the timeless A League of Their Own since it is based on true events. This was one of the best baseball stories that I have seen played out. The human element of this story with the autobiographical content of who Billy Beane is was interesting and entertaining. I couldn't help but to relate to Billy Beane, as I too made a decision based on money and opted to enter the workforce directly out of High School rather than entering college, the decision played out well for him and I have to admit that for me I have no complaints. The relationship with Billy and his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey) was so heartwarming that it was obvious what or better yet who motivated his future decisions, but aside from that it seemed that all other elements of his life were centered around baseball, that aspect of his existence I could not relate to at all. I did have a lot of respect for Billy in how he dealt with Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), I just don't know if I could have been so patient. You cannot institute a paradigm change without having your core team (no pun intended) on-board. <br/><br/>I caught this film on the same day that my very own Texas Rangers won the AL West Division, so in my opinion this was an awesome day for baseball, I have to give it a green light. - Emma Dinkins"

","Rating: 4 out of Fordyce (perfect) By Jim Fordyce AmericanEntertainmentReport.com Sept. 24, 2011 7:31 am EDT<br/><br/>Chat it up everyone, ""Moneyball"" is a really good movie. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A's and the guy who rejects baseball's conventional wisdom after he is forced to rebuild the Athletics on a tight budget. He teams with Ivy League grad Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, in an unlikely partnership, recruiting bargain players that make the scouts cringe. We watch as this story takes some predictable and unpredictable turns. Pitt and Hill are both perfect in their roles, as is the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman in another one of his spot-on character roles as manager Art Howe. The insiders know I am not a big fan of sports movies and usually get offended when people say things like it isn't a sports movie, it is a people movie, a movie with a message, an inspiring tale or some other such cr*p. I won't even buy that this time. It is a sports movie pure and simple, but a great one that tells a well-crafted story based on true incidents. It holds your interest and is well produced. This is also a movie where many of us know how it ends. I remember the A's winning streak in '02 and everything else about that amazing season. In the tradition of ""Apollo 13,"" which is another great movie, in ""Moneyball"" we know the ending, yet the writers, producers and directors keep us right on the edge of our seats. That edge earns ""Moneyball"" a perfect 4 out of Fordyce. Credit Check: Nothing happens after the credits roll."

","""Boringball"" seems to be the perfect title for this movie. When I watched this biopic with my dad one night, I felt dragged by the tedious drama and I was not emotionally touched by it. The reason is because Brad Pitt's character did not really support his ""hand-picked"" team. He wasn't there for them at the game during one of the final scenes in the movie. That threw me off a bit because it made me pondered about support and obligation. Conversely, Jonah Hill's character was at least a bit more interesting than the main lead.

"lloydhammett715","8","1","3","20 November 2013"," Billy Beane looks to change the rules of Baseball
","""If you lose the last game of the season, nobody gives a sh*t."" – Billy Beane<br/><br/>The tried and tested method to creating a winning team in baseball was simple; whoever spent the most would eventually come out on top. This was the pitfall of modern baseball and the inevitable cycle that Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the General Manager of the Oakland A's found himself in. It was the attempt of Billy Beane to change all of this by creating a team on a computer- generated analysis of stats rather than the players themselves.<br/><br/>In essence this is a sports movie, it follows a team through its highs and lows and watches the underdog try to beat the system. These are components of a good sports movie and it is generally conceived that it is the actual sport that creates the feelings of tension. The interesting thing about Moneyball is that it does not follow the players within the sport as much as a regular movie in its genre. The bulk of it follows the back room grind of Billy Beane and Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), the young economist student that brings the new way of player picking to Beane's attention. With a general lack of sport, or sport being the secondary aspect, it may seem that there will be a lack of thrills for its genre. However, this is ultimately not the case, as the boardroom meetings and telephone calls for trades create true excitement. <br/><br/>It is a film that looks to break one simple fact, that money is not the only thing that can bring success. It is unchartered territory for Billy Beane who throws all caution to the wind at the start receiving hostility from those around him. A film that centres on numbers and graphs perhaps should not hold such electricity around every decision, but it does. You do not have to follow baseball to understand the goings on, as most is explained clearly and is created through the interaction between Pitt and Hill. <br/><br/>There is a lot on the shoulders of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill to carry this film that, as acknowledged, does not have a huge amount of sport within it. Pitt plays a more brash up front and in charge character that could easily overwhelm the quieter, geekier Hill as Brand. However, as the film develops you begin to see the real relationship between the two, as partners in this audacious attempt to change baseball. The dialogue is written to perfection to keep the action shooting along, even off the diamond of the baseball pitch. Pitt has stuck with the role through several directors (Steven Soderbergh and David Frankel) and is really allowed to shine under the eventual direction of Bennett Miller.<br/><br/>The film is gripping to the end as the authenticity of the story holds true over the year that Billy Beane worked on his lean budget in an attempt to show up the world of baseball.<br/><br/>4 Stars."
"freemantle_uk","8","1","3","5 May 2013"," A sports film for people who do not like sports films
","Moneyball was a successful film with both audiences and critics, working as a strong piece of entertainment for sports fans and non-sports fans alike. Based on a book by journalist Michael Lewis, Moneyball tells the story of the Oakland Athletics, one of the poorest teams in Major League Baseball who have to rebuild after the 2001 season after losing their three best players. General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) has to rebuild with limited resources and he takes a controversial approach when he hires a young Yale economics graduate, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to use a statistical approach to find the best undervalued players and create a winning team with the players no one else wants. But the pair are up against a sports establishment within the media and within the team and it seems like a highly risky experiment that could be doomed to failed.<br/><br/>Moneyball works as both as sports film of an underdog going against the odds as a small team attempt to become contenders and earn a massive record and as a drama as Beane and Brand attempt to go against the system so they can cause a revolution. For someone who does not know much about baseball it was easy to follow and I could easily make comparisons to Premier League football.<br/><br/>For a film about statistics and mathematic calculations it still interesting and direction by Bennett Miller does inject a lot of style when looking at formulas and spreadsheets. Throughout the film it has a similar style and look to The Social Network and can work well as a double bill.<br/><br/>There is a find cast, Pitt, Hill and Phillip Seymour Hoffman being the biggest names and the highlights of the film. All of them give strong performances and along with the writing they all felt very real. They did seem to act like real people in their situation and we do get to dig deeper into Beane's character, from his relationship to his daughter and his ex-wife to his past where he was seen as a great prospect and how he is a betrayed by the traditional scouting system.<br/><br/>Moneyball was a very well written film, with a great look at its characters and how they acted. It was great looking at the sport for fans whilst allowing non-fans to understand the sport. It feels organic as it processes and does not have the typical ending. Whilst it does seem to have some sports films clichés of the team seeming to be useless and bad and they turn good when they are up against, but in the context of the film it works and it is based on real events. Moneyball twist the conventions of the evil statisticians trying the rip the heart out of sport and instead shows how sport science has changed, whilst still acknowledging the fans and other factors like personal characteristics. This is also a film that looks at the back room staff of a sports club, showing the detail the scenes elements instead of solely looking at the on field activities. Even if you do not like sports films it works as a look at internal politics within an organisation and as a story about defying conventional or outdated thinking.<br/><br/>The trailer for Moneyball marketed it as a witty, dialogue driven film in the vain of The Social Network and other Aaron Sorkin projects; but it was more a character driven drama and as a wider story about achieving with the resources you have. There are some fun lines, but on the whole the dialogue is mostly natural and down played.<br/><br/>Moneyball is a solid drama and it shows how filmmakers can make a project about a subject they love whilst making it accessible to people who do not know much about Major League Baseball."
"Wellenstock","6","1","3","24 March 2013"," Not a bad film but the point was strange
","Not a bad film but really the point was kind of strange and seemed to promote statistical marketing which has really limited our selection of restaurants, stores etc... It also demonstrates that budget isn't everything to the game either.<br/><br/>Production-wise this film must've been on some kind of budget where they couldn't afford to do a lot of lighting. Over-all the cinematography is very dark, flat and uncomplimentary to the story. This includes outdoor shots. Compare it to the cinematography of ""The Natural"" or ""Field of Dreams"". This seems like a strange place to cut from when your film is on a budget."
"itamarscomix","7","1","3","6 February 2012"," The Game of Numbers
","Moneyball came out of left field for me (har, har) and surprisingly became one of my favorite films for 2011. I say surprisingly because I've never been a fan of sport films in general, and in particular I know very little about baseball, living as I do in a country where it's much less popular than sports like soccer, basketball, tennis etc. However Moneyball proved easily to be more than a mere sport film or a baseball movie. Though it has a lot of elements familiar from the 'underdog team wins against all odds' school of sport movie, that's not the center of the story.<br/><br/>Unlike Bennett Miller's previous movie, Capote, which relied on one very strong performance to cover for a weak script, here Aaron Sorkin's wit is easy to spot in the excellent screenplay, and though Brad Pitt does deliver a solid performance - one of his most subtle and understated - he doesn't steal the show. He does overshadow the rest of the cast, including Jonah Hill who makes an impressive foray into serious drama which, unfortunately, falls to clichés as the film goes on, and the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman whose performance is good but almost too understated to work.<br/><br/>Moneyball is an effective movie, skillfully directed and very well paced, that manages to stay interesting throughout its over-two-hours run. It gets extra points for being communicative enough to allow a non-baseball fan to enjoy it and understand what's going on, though it loses some for not quite succeeding in showing just how important Beane's contribution to the sport was. Definitely worth a watch."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","3","30 January 2012"," Perhaps its not about the movie interesting subject but it's a well made movie.
","This is a sports movie without sport really. It's more a movie that shows you what is going on behind the scenes, instead of on the field. And luckily the movie is getting told in a good and interesting way, though the subject itself still wasn't all that interesting to me.<br/><br/>It's a movie with lots of talking back and forth between different characters, mostly about numbers and statistics. And it's all good to watch, just not all that interesting or involving to follow. Seriously, I couldn't ever really feel involved with any of the characters and quite frankly I also couldn't have cared less about the Oakland A's winning or loosing their games.<br/><br/>Then why am I still being mostly positive toward this movie in its rating, you might wonder. Well, simply because technically this is a really well made movie. There is no denying it that the movie has a good directing approach to it, which keeps the movie going at all times and prevents it from ever starting to drag or become a boring one to watch. Which is quite an accomplishment really, considering the movie its main premise. It's a bit of a shame director Bennett Miller has only directed 2 movies as of yet, since I definitely want to see far more done by him.<br/><br/>I believe you also really could say that the story has such a good pace to it, thanks to the way it's written. It has good dialog in it and the movie doesn't ever dwell or goes for any cheap and false sentiments, or other Hollywood like developments with its story and drama. It's a movie with a real realistic and human approach to it, which is of course also due to the fact that it's based on a true story and true living persons.<br/><br/>And it's also really being an actor's movie. I really wish Brad Pitt would play in more movies like this and more characters like this as well. He's simply really a great actor and he doesn't need his looks to get a leading and carrying role, in a heavy or serious movie. Jonah Hill was also good, in a rare non-comedic role by him. Both actors even received an Oscar nomination for their work in this movie.<br/><br/>So while it's not being the most interesting movie to watch, it still manages to be a great watch nevertheless.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"EephusPitch","8","1","3","12 October 2011"," A pleasant surprise
","I used to love going to the Oakland Coliseum. Maybe it was only in comparison to Candlestick, but the Coliseum was a pleasant place to watch a ballgame. Then the Haas family sold the team, Al Davis moved the Raiders back from L.A., the Coliseum was enclosed and became an airless mausoleum with the ambient of a toiletbowl; since then, I have been to about half a dozen games in Oakland. Since being swept by Detroit in the 2006 ALCS, the A's have been caught up in a swirl of ineptitude. The current ownership, saddled with an inadequate facility and no clear prospect of finding a new home, have (unlike the Giants' management of the '80's, who brilliantly promoted a substandard product) spent the past few years actively discouraging people from supporting the team.<br/><br/>Billy Beane is part and parcel of the A's malaise. Beane was a scout's dream, a blue-chip high-school prospect, who was drafted in the first round of the amateur draft by the New York Mets (who used the first pick in the draft on another SoCal high-schooler, Daryl Strawberry); he might have gone higher in the draft, but teams were leery that Beane might accept a baseball/football scholarship to Stanford, where he would have had a chance to succeed John Elway at quarterback. The players chosen around Beane, Terry Francona and John Gibbons, would go on to become successful Major League managers, a class of people for whom Beane reserves his greatest contempt. Beane has increasingly made moves which have left the team in a constant rebuilding cycle, haphazardly dealing game-ready, club-controlled players for prospects, with the glee of a ten year old swapping baseball cards, or my coke-addled former roommate rearranging her bedroom. How acquiring Milton Bradley and Matt Holliday for Andre Ethier and Carlos Gonzalez fits in with the precepts of ""moneyball"" quite escapes me.<br/><br/>The scene in this movie which most adequately captures this ""I'm more clever than anyone else"" aspect of Beane is the four-way phone conversation between Beane, Ed Wade, Dave Dombrowski, and Brian Sabean (actually, a five-way conversation, counting hapless owner, Steve Schott, who is left on hold), during which Beane snags Ricardo Rincon. This is a high point. The somewhat more questionable trade which netted the A's Ted Lilly, and for whom they gave up Carlos Pena and Jeremy Bonderman, is glossed over. Brad Pitt does a very commendable job showing both Beane's arrogance, and his insecurities. Jonah Hill is sterling as the Paul DePodesta-based assistant, hiding from the realities of the game behind his glasses and his lap-top. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a surprisingly nuanced turn as beleaguered and out-of-his-depth manager Art Howe. While looking nothing like Howe, he ably suggests Howe's befuddlement, humor and basic decency. And the narrative peak of the movie, the wildly improbable 20 game winning streak, was very deftly constructed. As a side note, a 20 game winning streak is almost the antithesis of ""moneyball"", and it's strange that it was spearheaded by non-""moneyball"" players such as Miguel Tejada and Eric Chavez, the year after the A's lost the ultimate ""moneyball"" player, Jason Giambi,to the Yankees. Also, hearing the late Bill King's voice over the reconstructed game footage brought tears to my eyes."

","I just saw this movie, and I have to say, it's one of the better sports movies that I've seen. It starts off with a brief glimpse at the Oakland A's demise in the 2001 playoffs vs the Yankees, in which they coughed up a 2-0 series lead in the best-of-5 ALDS. Following this heartbreaking defeat, the team is essentially dismantled. They lose their top players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen), and are forced to rebuild.<br/><br/>Like most sports movies, it at least partially focuses on every MLB player's main goal: to win a World Series. But it's also about more than that. In ""The Natural"", it's about an old, injured coulda-been that strives to meet his former potential. In ""Field of Dreams"", it's about the love of the game, and how it unites people. In ""Moneyball"", it's about one man's apparent desire to change the game by looking at nothing but On-Base Percentage. It's also about Beane and Brand's new ideas going up against the purists of baseball.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt can add yet another great performance to his resume with his portrayal of Billy Beane, the A's GM. And Jonah Hill proves (to me anyways) that he is an actor capable of much more than raunchy comedies. I didn't once think about his previous characters from Superbad and Knocked Up when I watched him. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds instant class as A's manager Art Howe, as well.<br/><br/>The film is also completely devoid of sports clichés. It helps to know that it's all based on true events, I suppose. But you don't feel like you're watching a recycled film. I was captivated from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I suppose my one complaint would be the small amount of real-live baseball footage. Most of the baseball is old footage of the actual events, with the actors integrated in for close-ups. But the film is seen from Beane's perspective, and he doesn't like to watch the games.<br/><br/>Don't be surprised if it gets some Oscar nods.

","Brad Pitt hits it out of the park in the new blockbuster ""Moneyball."" He plays a man named Billy Beane who is a former major league baseball player. He is now the general manager of a low budget team called the Oakland A's. The Yankees beat the A's in the playoffs, causing them to lose their three best players. Billy now has to rebuild the team without the money that the other teams have.<br/><br/>When Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), everything changes. Peter studied economics at Yale and he has a strategy that he believes will give Billy a winning team. Even though everyone around them disagrees, they are headstrong in their theory and refuse to give up.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of baseball or sports movies in general, but ""Moneyball"" kept me glued to the screen. It's extremely interesting and it makes you think. There are multiple 'laugh out loud' moments and others that may make you cry. Moreover, it's based on a very touching, true story.<br/><br/>I was astonished at Brad Pitt's performance. In my opinion, this is his best movie. He is incredibly believable in this role. In addition, it was great to see Jonah Hill play a more sophisticated role; he was very impressive as well. This film was cast impeccably. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that it can get slow at times. It's a very long movie and a couple scenes seem to drag on. But the change of pace does fit with the tone of the storyline.<br/><br/>This film is definitely timeless and appropriate for all ages. I give ""Moneyball"" a 9 out of 10 for its amazing acting and original story. You don't have to love baseball to love this movie."
"emilyjmalbon","1","2","12","15 January 2017"," The most boring film I've seen in ages
","I decided to watch this film because it had good reviews. I admit that I don't know anything about or have any interest in baseball, however I have watched and enjoyed other similar films with a sports theme before so I wasn't too put off. Unfortunately I think watching nearly ANYTHING else would have been better than sitting through this film. I can only describe the whole thing as bland. Bland characters, bland visuals, bland dialogue, bland music. In fact there was virtually no music accompanying the film, which I think is one of the big reasons it feels so flat. In fact, large (and I mean huge) swaths of the movie are carried out in complete silence. Everybody talks slowly and in a monotone. The sets are dull and grey. I felt nothing for the characters and was drifting off to sleep less than half way through the film. Maybe if you are an avid baseball fan you will enjoy this movie? Otherwise I honestly can't see why anyone would sit through it. Avoid!"

","Whatever problem you may have with the accuracy of the history of the A's ascendency in baseball in the Billy Beane era, the movie rates as one of the finest films about the game—and that's saying a lot because there are a hell of a lot of good baseball movies. They certainly over-played Art Howe as the bad guy but fiction needs a villain, or something close to it. With the truth put aside the story is a great one and the major points are history. As James Thurber says, you can look it up. What makes it even more exciting for me is the fact that I was right there in Seattle watching—like a train wreck—as the A's took the lead in August with their spectacular 21 game streak.<br/><br/>The acting and writing in the movie are sublime at every turn and some of the best examples come in the form of one-ended phone calls—usually with Brad Pitt shoving some sort of junk food in his pie hole.<br/><br/>Just because the A's didn't win the World Series doesn't mean that moneyball doesn't work. Every team loses every yearexcept one, and that team is always a rich club. More than anything this movie screams out for revenue sharing in baseball because without the A's there can be no NY Yankees. Spanish soccer could definitely learn something from American football as 2-3 clubs seems to dominate here year after year (it's mostly Barça and Real Madrid).<br/><br/>This is a brilliant observation I found in the forum from user tricksoftrade01: ""Rooting for the Yankees or the Red Sox is like cheering on the schoolyard bully who knocks down a smaller kid, steals their lunch money and then kicks them in the balls."""

"fellow456","8","1","4","10 March 2013"," A Little Too Dramatic?
","Pros: I'm not going to say that I'm in love with Brad Pitt or anything, but... isn't he dreamy? Sadly, we aren't treated to any shirtless Brad, but he is shown working out a few times and is generally wearing form-fitting shirts. On the flip side, we are also not treated to any shirtless Jonah Hill, so... That's always appreciated. I don't really know anything about Billy Beane, but as far as I can tell, Pitt's character is how I would want Beane to be. He does a quality job of breaking out his dramatic chops of yesteryear while still including some of that boyish goofy charm that he has more recently developed. Speaking of acting, for all of you wondering what Jonah Hill's name is doing among the nominees for best supporting actor, please allay your fears. While I can't speak for every single supporting actor who appeared in a film in 2011, I can say that Hill's dramatic skills are indeed present, and I don't think he is misplaced with his nomination. He portrays the intellectual baseball nerd affably well (I didn't use ""affably"" correctly there, so don't bother looking it up to check me), and the only thing I would have liked more is if the movie had dived more deeply into the new age baseball metrics. But that's probably just the nerd side of me talking; I'm sure I don't speak for everyone.<br/><br/>Cons: Does Brad Pitt have a bet with someone about the number of times he can be seen eating on camera? Not just in this movie, but in all of his movies of late. And not just any food, but generally junk food that he's just shoveling into his mouth... Is he trying to brag about his metabolism or something? I don't really get it.<br/><br/>What I do get, however, is what a five tool player is. And I understood that after the first time those five tools were listed out. The next couple dozen listings weren't really necessary for me to grasp the concept. I suppose it's the point of the movie that baseball scouts and executives focus on the wrong things, but aren't there any other wrong things for them to focus on, other than fielding, running, throwing, hitting, and/or hitting with power?<br/><br/>And while we're at it, let's remember that we're talking about scouts who have been doing this thing for decades, and who have known those same five tools and been making the same assessments about kids for many years. Why do they need to stumble over their words? Shouldn't they know all this by now? I'm assuming there's a desire by some directors of ""true stories"" to have spoken lines be a little more clumsy and sputtered, because, you know, that's how real people talk. This makes me a little torn. Yes, I like realism. But at the same time, I go to the theaters in part to escape reality. If I want to listen to old men stumble over their words while they describe in broad, sweeping statements how good a ballplayer is, I'll go to the Polo Grounds. In the meantime, I'd like to watch these highly skilled actors deliver their lines with a greater degree of comfort (within their roles, of course), while I, as a responsible movie-goer, bear in mind that I am not, in fact, looking through a window on the real world.<br/><br/>While I'm not looking through a window at the real world, though, I am looking at a portrayal of it. And in this particular case, I'm looking at a portrayal of a baseball team that has been ""gutted."" Who did they lose again? Oh right, I should remember since they repeated the names Giambi, Damon, and Isringhausen even more often than the five tools mentioned previously. Even with this gutting, the A's still had the best starting rotation in baseball along with one of the elite shortstops in the game. And despite this flash back to reality, the screenwriters and director feel the need to hit you in the face with a dramatic 2x4 when you watch their movie.<br/><br/>Overall: That being said, the movie did suck me right in. It was well-made, with good pacing, compelling characters, an interesting enough story, and a thoroughly woven theme. And when some of the dialog wasn't awkwardly stuttered through, it was sharp and entertaining. Oh, did I mention the movie has Brad Pitt? I'm sheepishly giving it an 8 out of 10, while taking a step back to remind myself that I just saw a movie about generally managing a baseball team, not about curing cancer."

","The Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane finds himself in a very unfortunate position of losing the three star players to other teams. Now he has to assemble a new team on a limited budget, and he employs young Yale graduate Peter Brand to employ statistical analysis to find the undervalued players.<br/><br/>The story is based on the real events and tells us about the real Billy Beane, making it almost semi-documentary. The case study of Moneyball technique is pretty common in business schools and in general on economic courses, and thanks to the book by Michael Lewis it became known to wider audiences.<br/><br/>Hence what is interesting about this movie is not the actual storyline (albeit pretty good), but the fact how different the Moneyball is compared to other movies of 2011. Apart from definitely being nostalgic (have a look at the Artist, Drive and Hugo), 2011 was full of fictional worlds. The entire buzz was going around films which one way or the other recreated parallel universes of some kind: Melancholia, Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes, as well as the already mentioned Drive and Hugo the list just goes on. That is why the Moneyball is so refreshing to watch: you actually see that the world depicted is the world around you, without massive alterations.<br/><br/>As all real-life stories, this one is multi-layered and sad. You may know the entire storyline from the book, but that will not prevent you from empathizing with the main character, from trying to understand his decisions and from admiring his courage. The exact fact that you know that the real person stands behind the story makes the film look and feel like biography, prompting some thoughts about the motivation, peoples' aims and desires and achievements. Something that starts as the usual (even though interesting) story about baseball ends up being metaphorical parable. This is the biography to be jealous about.<br/><br/>The choice of actors was crucial in order to create the documentary style of the film. A lot can be said about the brilliant performance of Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, and the nomination on Oscar 2012 as the best actor sums it up perfectly. However, I believe that it is the duo of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill as Peter Brand which makes the whole film so great. There is some understanding and dynamic interaction between the two, they perfectly complement each other. I don't think that Pitt should get Oscar for best actor without Hill getting the Oscar for best supporting actor – the support was crucial to the success.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Brilliant adaptation of the original story, it is difficult to remain untouched by the difficulties the main characters face WATCH: if you admire baseball or Brad Pitt, or generally want to watch some biographical movie. <br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"urbisoler-1","9","1","4","19 January 2012"," Moneyball with ***Spoilers***
","There is a particular reason why I thought this film was absolutely terrific.<br/><br/>It is based on a philosophy of statistics called Sabermetrics created by Bill James, that the Oakland A's utilized for the 2002 MLB season after the A's lost 3 key players and were forced to rebuild on a low budget.<br/><br/>(It is this statistical analysis that was responsible for my baseball hero, Eddie Yost, being named the best third baseman in the AL for the decade 1950-1959.) It is exciting to see how the stats are introduced in order to build a winning team.<br/><br/>There are some problems however. The Assistant GM, Peter Brand,(in real life Paul DePodesta) is the guy responsible for furnishing the GM with the stats that are used to rebuild the team. As the film ends, it is the GM that gets all the credit, not the assistant.<br/><br/>Another problem is that we never hear the MGR eat his words since he has been critical of all the changes thruout the film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is definitely a film worth seeing."
"Hellmant","9","1","4","27 September 2011"," 'MONEYBALL' is to baseball what 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is to social networks.
","'MONEYBALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sports biopic based on the Oakland A's 2002 season in which general manager Billy Beane used statistical data (for the first time) to assemble a winning team, overcoming the team's financial drawback. It was co-written by two of the best writers in the business, Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, from a story by first time writer Stan Chervin which was in turn based on the book 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' by Michael Lewis. The film was directed by Bennett Miller and stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane (as well as Jonah Hill in a great supporting turn). You don't have to know a lot about baseball (and Pitt claims to know very little) or even enjoy it at all to enjoy this film; it's more about the business of the sport as well as following the passion of one's dreams. It's a very well made and effective film on that level.<br/><br/>The film starts out recapping the Oakland Athletics loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. We very quickly learn the team's financial handicap as it's explained to the viewer that the A's had to make do with about a third of the budget as the Yankees. They lose their three star players as a result of this and Billy Bean's dreams of winning a World Series seem almost out of reach as he asks the team's owner for more money and comes up empty handed. Then he meets Peter Brand (Hill), a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. Brand's ideas on building a team based almost solely on the players' 'on base percentage' value impresses Beane and also represents new opportunities for his team despite their lack of money. He hires Brand and the two follow Brand's plan wholeheartedly despite running into a great deal of opposition from the team's scouts, coach (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and just about everyone else in baseball. <br/><br/>You don't have to know a lot about baseball to enjoy the film because there's not a whole lot of baseball in it. This film is about as much about baseball as 'BULL DURHAM' is. It's much more about the business end of baseball much like the writer Aaron Sorkin's last film ('THE SOCIAL NETWORK') was much more about the business of facebook than actually about facebook. I found it very interesting as well as informative and entertaining. Sorkin and Zaillian's script is very witty and packed with clever dialogue. It's also strong in character development and Pitt shines in the film. He and Hill have awesome chemistry together as well and Hill, like always, is a scene stealer. The rest of the cast is pitch perfect also and the directing is perfectly fitting too. It's one of those films that just hits all the right notes and leaves an impression long after viewing it (or should, I predict). If you're a baseball fan you'll probably get a kick out of it, even so, too (especially if you're an Oakland fan) for it's history and nostalgia.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOH74YX2UKA"
"jtprius510","8","1","4","27 September 2011"," Best Written Sports Film
","While Moneyball is by far the most original take on America's favorite pass time, it is not exactly what you would expect from a movie about baseball.<br/><br/>Two things Aaron Sorkin knows how to write are controversial figures and excessive amounts of jargon.<br/><br/>If you have ever tried playing a video game of baseball with your friends, but then gave up trying to play after you noticed how long they were taking and how excited they were getting to build up an empire in the franchise mode, then you should know exactly what to expect from Moneyball. The language and mathematics of Americas favorite pass time is put before everything including the actual game itself, which is both the solution and problem to the film in general. The writing of the script does not loan itself as much to the game as it does to the politics behind it.<br/><br/>Therefore the commitment Sorkin makes to the characters of Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonas Hill as his assistant Peter makes this a lot more of a sports drama than an actual sports movie, which almost makes for poor casting of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the head coach of the Oakland A's. All Hoffman does as the head coach in Moneyball is pout around the office over every decision Pitt makes, which he does well. But Hoffman could've played anybody else besides the head coach while anybody else, including the actual head coach who was actually considered for the role could've played the head coach because the head coach doesn't really do much in Moneyball.<br/><br/>However the story of Moneyball isn't about the head coach of the Oakland Athletics. Moneyball is about the Oakland Athletics Manager Beane and how Beane replaced three key players in his franchise. The kind of pressure that position comes with is a side of the game that fans of baseball do not get to see and either that's entertaining to you or it's not. For me this is probably one of the best written major league baseball movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Every decision made by Beane is made with an authoritative confidence that is difficult to argue. The only person backing Beane's decisions in Moneyball is the assistant, helping him make them with his thorough evaluation of statistics. These two together are what also makes Moneyball fun to watch for the risk factor involved in every decision they make as a bizarre series of trial and error. With Peter as Beane's assistant and Kerris Dorsey as his daughter, Pitt as Oakland Athletics Manager Beane has more than enough support, on or off of the field.<br/><br/>Both of these relationships are what allow us to like Pitt as Beane, an under dog in this game of Moneyball, even though nobody else does. And that seems to be a characteristic trait of Sorkin's hand in script writing so far besides politics.<br/><br/>Nobody close to Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network liked any of the decisions he was making neither. But Zuckerberg's decisions are exactly what gave birth to Facebook while the movie about him written by Sorkin got him nominated for an academy award."

In this case, a player that was at the pro level because he is liked and probably, there because the team's were short handed and/or desperate.
So fast forward, this guy is a minority owner and executive for being a double A level, if that, athlete, and in baseball in the 80s, so he was much of an athlete and they make a movie about him and now, this ""former player"" is doing as well if not better than all the star athletes when he played and he was a double A player. Unbelievable.
No championship, ever and again (and this is why the world loves and hates this country) a person, not even at the mid level of playing or managing, but at the low , low levels and should not even have been in the majors makes GREAT.
Again we reward mediocrity and the funny thing is he was below ""mediocrity"" and still sits pretty.

","Look I liked this movie, I of course knew everything about the team before going in so I had some insight that most won't, but I have to admit that turning Scott Hatteberg into a first baseman is not what won that team 103 games. They make a big deal about not being able to compete with the Yankees, but this team had the best pitching staff in all of baseball. I mean statically, not just in my opinion. Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder all pitched over 200 innings with ERA's under 3.50 and this is during the steroids era. In the field they had Miguel Tejada 34 HR 131 RBI MVP winner, and Gold glove winning third baseman Eric Chavez 34 hr 109 RBI. But they try to claim that David Justice is there only star. And he was the one getting the screen time with Jeremy Giambi. They didn't look at why that team won, and who the key components were. They tried to play them off like a second rate team which just wasn't true. They never brought up what that team had to work with. Half way through the movie Brad Pitt trades away Carlos Pena for a pile of beans to make a point to the Manager. This in hindsight is one of the dumbest moves Oakland ever made, Carlos Pena went on to be an all star while Hatteberg stayed mediocre at best. The movie is funny and it shows the casual fan what baseball is about statistically, but they really missed out on some great characters on that team."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","8","22 September 2011"," A humorous and insightful sports movie that avoids the clichés
","Sports movies have always been preoccupied with what's happening on the field, the court or what have you. They tell stories of underdogs defying the odds and champion values of honor, courage and determination. ""Moneyball"" peels back that obvious first layer yet achieves all those very same ends. The sport of baseball is essential to this story, but the story isn't dependent on baseball. <br/><br/>Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) faced a debacle after his team lost the 2001 ALDS after being up on the New York Yankees, a team with three times the payroll. His star players, Jason Giambi, Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen, were all free agents that the team would never be able to resign. Knowing that fans and the owner would expect another winning season, Beane turned to a young man named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an expert in sabermetrics, or boiling down statistics to evaluate players' value rather the traditional scouting techniques and intuition. Together, Beane and Brand scraped together a team of undervalued players and made an improbable run at a pennant.<br/><br/>Foremost, ""Moneyball"" tells Beane's story and the emotional ups and downs of trying to change the game. He didn't care about championships or winning in the figurative sense, but about changing the game so that smaller teams would no longer be ""organ donors"" for wealthy clubs like the Yankees. Pitt continues to impress with his comedic abilities as Beane, playing him not all that dissimilar from Lt. Aldo Raine (""Inglourious Basterds"") in terms of charisma and humor, but obviously Beane is a much more believable and compelling character.<br/><br/>Hill works as a terrific compliment, going for understatement and never so much as attempting to take any comedic reigns. He opts instead to wait for and pick his moments and then nails them. Whatever ounces of humor veteran writers Steve Zaillan and Aaron Sorkin's screenplay chooses to toss at us, none of it falls flat, especially thanks to the splendid delivery of Pitt and Hill.<br/><br/>Baseball has a key role in the film and fans of the sport will enjoy the feeling of being behind- the-scenes, but ""Moneyball"" never gets lost in a preoccupation with the outcome of the games and whether the A's win or lose. Natural curiosity will be there for those unfamiliar with their early 2000s baseball history, but the story generates much more interest in how losing or winning will impact Beane. Devout baseball fans are used to only media portrayals of GMs that consist of either great praise or blame for the level of talent on the field, so this narrative perspective wherein Beane is a protagonist we actually like constitutes a drastic change. <br/><br/>The underdog team element that permeates most sports movies exists in small doses in ""Moneyball."" Director Bennett Miller shows us just enough in-game action to raise the stakes and improve the suspense — no more, no less. The players depicted in the film, such as Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop) and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), are supporting characters that enhance the story on the periphery instead of through needless subplots. We still feel what's at stake for them and appreciate the ""second chance"" of sorts that Beane has given them. Philip Seymour Hoffman as disgruntled A's manager Art Howe shows the unflattering side of coaches and serves as an effective roadblock on Beane's road to success.<br/><br/>If anything, there's a bit of a disconnect in the film between the philosophy of what Beane and Brand did and how it actually translated into success. There's talk of taking more pitches and montage scenes of Beane and Brand coaching the players to an extent, but we're asked to take the film's word for it that the theory was in fact responsible for the on-field results. In the end it just limits the magnitude of the accomplishment. Instead of measuring our satisfaction on the success of the entire team, we measure it on whether Beane is happy or sad.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" amounts to insightful, character-driven drama with a lighthearted sense of humor — a refreshing departure from most baseball or sports films period. One game gets the reenactment treatment, but otherwise no genre clichés hang around in hopes of being used as a feel-good safety net. ""Moneyball"" spreads the sports message that all those sports values of courage and risk-taking still mean something even if they don't culminate in a scene utilizing uplifting music and slow-motion celebrations. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site, moviemusereviews.com!"

When the 'boss' informs Beane that no more money is available Beane must try to build the best team that he has with the money that he's got; fortunately he is able to recruit stat-man Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who teaches Beane to look at baseball scouting from a completely different angle...<br/><br/>What I know about baseball could be written on the back of a postage stamp and therefore I decided to watch Moneyball hoping that the film would educate me somewhat whilst also providing me with an uplifting story. Whilst it does a little of both, I didn't find Moneyball to be an entirely satisfying product...<br/><br/>One thing I did notice about this film is how cold and clinical it feels; for the most part it's quite dour and depressing and at times it plays out more like a cold documentary than an uplifting piece of cinema. This is further extended to the baseball players within the film; there's no backstory to any of them and no real development to them as people which makes it impossible to root or care for any of them - this is made worse by the rather unceremonious way that they are traded to other teams (again made worse by how accepting some of them are of their dismissals which doesn't sit well with the flow of the film given that Beane had to give Brand a pep talk on how to deal with players reaction to being dismissed). Perhaps Director Bennett Miller wanted to keep the film low-key to avoid it being too melodramatic, but there has to be at least a degree of melodrama otherwise the film can come across as being rather flat and unengaging which is what happens in Moneyball. These things do give the film a rather heavy going feel about it which makes it a bit of a mare to sit through. <br/><br/>I confess to knowing nothing about Baseball so the various stats talks and tactical discussion went over my head (this may cause a problem to non-Baseball fans who choose to watch this film as it does take up a good chunk of the running time and this aspect of the film may be boring to some people - it certainly was for me). I think what makes things worse is that I didn't feel that the film did much to uplift me; I never felt a sense of euphoria at any point and wasn't cheering the Oakland Athletics on in the way the filmmakers wanted me to - although I'm prepared to acknowledge that what they achieved with the money/resources they had was quite a feat. As mentioned, it is a combination of the flat way the film is presented, the weak characterisation, and it's general failure to truly uplift me that were the biggest factors working against the film (the film even finishes on a slightly negative note when providing its summary at the end).<br/><br/>If there are any positives to this film then they lay with the acting; Brad Pitt does really well and is perhaps the only person it is possible to be behind throughout the film; his Billy Beane has the charisma and desire, but his flaws are shown as well which did give me some investment in the film. Jonah Hill is surprisingly low-key, but does well with what he has to work with - my one criticism is that he doesn't develop much of a working chemistry with Pitt which only adds to the multitude of problems I had with this film. <br/><br/>Those with an interest in Baseball may get something out of this, but it did little for me I'm afraid."

","Do you have to like Baseball to enjoy this Movie?, you ask. Well, sort of but not really. It is a David and Goliath Story at Heart. Some claimed that the Statistical Emphasis that was put on the Game with Spreadsheets and Algorithms removed the Heart and Transplanted another Head.<br/><br/>But, the Truth of the matter is that Baseball and most Pro Sports have been doing that in varying degrees ever since Yankee Manager Casey Stengel invented the Platoon System and Baseball Managers started bringing in Relief Pitchers to go Righty against Lefty and vice versa. In the NFL, Dallas Cowboys' Coach Tom Landry was Famous for his Stat Sheets, and so forth.<br/><br/>So really nothing new, just MORE emphasis on Stats and a redefining of a Players Worth versus His Salary is what Moneyball, the System, the Book, and the Movie lays out for us to take or leave as a Viable Visionary Format to Embrace Wholeheartedly. Funny thing is, the Jury is still out.<br/><br/>But in a sense it doesn't really matter anymore, because the Money Teams, now Privy to the Method have the Resources to use it and still Buy Whomever they please. As a Movie this Dry Number Crunching may have Limitations as Entertainment, but that didn't stop Wall Street (1987) and while in a Sports Movie, it does manage to be a bit Wonky but still Entertaining. <br/><br/>There is much Back and Forth about Romanticizing the Game, and Winning doesn't matter, unless You Win the Last Game and so forth, and it all gets a bit Ambiguous.

","One of the better baseball movies, this has almost the feel of a documentary, with a realism as it shows how real events played out, resulting in a new modern strategic mindset in baseball.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill steals the show here as the brilliant tactician and statistician who figures out how to put together a great team on the cheap. His performance raises the movie to a cut above. This is his movie, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Bratt Pitt is OK, but familiarly one-dimensional as the man, Billy Beane, who had the guts to run with Peter Brand's revolutionary untested theory on how cash-poor teams like his Oakland A's could compete with the better funded teams. He almost phones in his performance, I feel (some may disagree), but he does enough to represent his character in a way that doesn't take away from the story.<br/><br/>But the real star of this movie is the story. It's intriguing enough and well-told enough to make you want to watch the film to the very end to see if the theory worked.<br/><br/>Those who are not into baseball might find this a hard film to watch, but baseball fans absolutely have to see it if just to see how these guys changed the face of baseball.

","With one of the most anticipated films of 2011 Brad Pitt has hit a home run. Proved talent like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Wright add their talents to this incredible film. In addition Jonah Hill proves himself in a serious role with a great performance. All of the remaining cast members take on their roles with great success and put together a great movie.<br/><br/>The film Moneyball is the story of the 2002 Oakland Athletics and the unconventional methods used in putting together their team. Based on the book by Michael Lewis this film focuses on the loss of their star players to teams with bigger payrolls. Billy Beane (Pitt) enlists the help of Peter Brand (Hill) to find hidden talent with unpopular statistical methods. Hill is normally known for his sarcastic tone and comedic relief but this time he plays it straight and fits right in as the young statistics nerd. Beane's clashes with the manager (Hoffman) also make for some great dialogue as they spar over the old school and new schools of talent evaluation. The writing in this film is wonderful overall.<br/><br/>Another one of the major successes in the film is their ability to explain the different schools of baseball thought without being overly detailed. The game of baseball has a rich tradition and the film does a wonderful job showing the backlash that comes from pushing against the grain. This is done throughout the film without slowing the pace or taking away from the story.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone. Despite being a sports film I believe that you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this amazing story. I also expect this film to gain some major attention when awards season begins. I give Moneyball a 4.5 out of 5 stars."

The film chronicles how Beane is helped by an Economics graduate, who helps Beane assemble a strong team with his paltry budget with some serious number-crunching. Hence, Moneyball is a sports film with a twist, where off-field events get pride of place.<br/><br/>Short on human drama, perhaps deliberately, the film can fail to tug emotionally, but the taut plot pulls it through.

","Brad Pitt portrays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane in a semi-accurate rendition of the A's 2002 season. The A's have lost three key players from a 102 win season and Pitt challenges his manager and scouting staff by using statistical analysis, rather than traditional scouting, to select his new players. Pitt's portrayal of Beane, a one-time top prospect as a player who failed miserably in the big show, is Oscar winning stuff. The rest of the cast is equally good - there is top flight acting throughout this movie, including a truly engaging performance by Kerris Dorsey as Beane's daughter. Beane himself is portrayed as part recluse, part prick, part realist, but always committed to winning despite his small budget. Not that this movie is without concerns. Doing something like this with characters from real life raises a real issue - this is not a completely accurate portrayal of the 2002 Oakland A's. The movie ignores the stars on the A's at that time and makes it look like Beane did it all with smoke and mirrors. In fact, he had two of the best young pitchers in baseball and current or future all-stars at shortstop, third, and in the outfield. So sit back, enjoy the movie but accept that there's some Hollywood mixed in there."

It's a shame that the baseball and Bennett Miller angle put me off for so long. Capote was good, but forgettable and so dry. And watching Moneyball, those downsides did drag down the potential. It's quite a dry and cold film with a lot of the baseball jargon just losing me. It lacks the sharpness and humour captured in The Social Network, The West Wing and Studio 60, even if there are odd shards of it throughout. It's a good film with great montages but it's nothing special until its final act.<br/><br/>Its true tenderness comes out when Billy reacts to the record and he states his true ambition. It's a pure Aaron Sorkin moment, especially in the beautiful ending. It's a fascinatingly elegant film regardless of the content and worth it for when it gets to the heart of the film. Also watching Brad Pitt and Philip Seymour Hoffman on screen together was like watching universes collide.

"Tanay_LKO","8","0","1","14 June 2013"," ""Baseball Blues - How To Play An Unfair Game""
","Moneyball.......that's what the idea of assembling a team of Baseball players based on statistics and analytical knowledge of the sport (known as ""sabermetrics"") was termed by sports-journalists. The method was unorthodox and controversial as it challenged the analysis of the Baseball insiders (viz. the players, the scouts who are like the 'selector-consultants,' the managers) by talking of solid numerical terms, like - ""base point avg."", ""runs batted in"", ""batting avg."", ""stolen bases"", etc. something similar to Cricket's ""avg. score"", ""run rate"", etc. <br/><br/>The idea, though vague enough to be discarded, had some very strong points in the matter of predicting a player's on-field performance and of the team as a whole. ""Runs win the game...."" that's what was important for an under- performing team and that's what was in the mind of the Head GM of Oakland Athletics Baseball Team, Billy Beane. So, he began assembling a team, that too in under-budget, to get the Oakland A's the wins it was missing. <br/><br/>However, that was not all the reason Billy had in his mind for this unconventional approach. In a scene, Billy is arguing with the then Head Scout of the team on his approach. He says, "".....You don't have a crystal ball. You can't look at a kid and predict his future any more than I can. I've sat at those kitchen tables with you and listened to you tell parents -'When I know, I know. And when it comes to your son, I know.' and you don't.'"" The thought emerged from Billy's early day experiences as a player, when he was recruited by scouts, who talked about conventional approaches of efficiently hitting and throwing the ball and told his parents that he would be a good player, in a similar fashion as the dialogue goes above. So, Billy declined a university scholarship and with a high-school degree went on to play professional Baseball. But, alas, he performed badly in further matches for several seasons with different teams and thus, dropped away soon to become a scout himself; followed by the General Manager. <br/><br/>Hence, Billy started assembling players based on pure analytical wisdom, along with his Asst.GM Peter Brand, an economist, who was good with the knowledge of statistics of Baseball. He esp. took undervalued players to fit the criteria of place on the field and needs of the team, more often on a player's capacity to ""steal bases"", which are like taking runs in Cricket. Though, unfruitful initially, the team started to pick up by and by, with continuous cautious trading of players in the time. Billy personally motivated the players to concentrate in specific areas and also maneuvered his ways with the team's on-field manager, who was highly disgruntled with all the player selection. All this started to work out, little by little. <br/><br/>Later, the Oakland A's became the first team to hold the American League Record of 20-consecutive wins. All done by an underdog team, full of underestimated players. Though, Billy wasn't able to win the last game of the championship of the year 2002, which was his sole modus operandi as that was the only thing that meant eventually according to him, still his efforts were appreciated in general in the Baseball world. In the aftermath, it was shown that Billy was offered a GM post in another major Baseball team, Boston Red Sox, with the highest pay till this time, of $12.5 million which he cordially declined to stay as the GM of his former team. He is still the GM and waiting to win the Championship match. Also, based on his ideas and analysis methods, the Red Sox won a championship in the years to come. <br/><br/>The film in general, concentrated on the idea of managing a Baseball team or management in general with all the tactical ways of choosing and ""buying"" players. This was definitely a new approach in film-making, as usually the films concentrate on the sport or game in specific and its ""spirit"" and not much on managing. Also, the film didn't lose its sheen in ""managing"" the overall drama, anxiety and emotion associated with the sport. In a few scenes, a metaphor is used ""How can you not be romantic about Baseball?"" Brad Pitt (who played Billy Beane) and Jonah Hill (whose role was written as a complex character based on real men associated to the sport) played their parts excellently as the GM and Asst.GM of the Oakland A's. Not to forget, the director Benett Miller who did his job well in displaying such an excellently directed film. Also, the story writer Stab Chervin and the screenplay writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and of course, Michael Lewis the author of the adapted book, were pretty good with the display of in-room discussions and all the sport management tactics. Overall, this was a clear cut excellently produced film and no wonder, that it got this year's Oscar nominations in 5 categories including Best Picture, for which Michael Di Luca, Rachael Horovitz and Brad Pitt himself are nominated. <br/><br/>On a personal note, I would like to mention that I knew hardly a thing about Baseball as a sport. Still, this film managed me to stick through my seat for all the time I watched it and above all, helped me understand the sport. I didn't feel bored, not for a moment while watching it."
"Okonh0wp","8","0","1","7 June 2013"," Very Sorkinesque, Pretty Good
","Moneyball is all about Brad Pitt. Because the film ties Billy Beane's journey of self-discovery to that of his sport, and because there's a surprising amount of psychological depth to Beane himself, this film transcends the typical sports film. At the same time, it's a very exciting sports film in and of itself.<br/><br/>The sad thing about professional sports today is that to spectators and players alike are excited by the whole phenomenon up until the point where they lose. This is a film that deals almost exclusively with how to deal with defeat and how victory itself is tenable. That says more about life than much of sports does today.<br/><br/>This is Aaron Sorkin's third movie (Charlie Wilson's War and The Social Network) since making the abysmal television show ""Studio 60"" and committed every sin imaginable in the TV writer's bible (don't have all the characters sound alike, don't use the show to air out your dirty laundry, try to at least pretend to care about where your story is set, etc.) and he's been using more and more restraint on those Sorkinisms. Occasionally, Sorkin still gets cringe-worthy as in the conversation between scouts about how they shouldn't put in a pitcher with an ugly girlfriend.<br/><br/>Another weakness of Aaron Sorkin seems pretty subverted in Jonah Hill's shy and introverted character of Peter Brand. Unfortunately he drifts a little towards Sorkinish territory towards the end. On my top ten list (which I'm working to rapidly construct a couple weeks later than everyone else), this lands at #2. Not as profound as ambitious as ""The Tree of Life"" but it's more intense and kinetic than anything else I've seen this year and it marries that intensity to a stronger story than a typical action or sports film"

","Brad Pitt is Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland Athletics. I add, for our overseas friends, that the Oakland Athletics are a baseball team in California, distinguished chiefly by their outer uniforms of dull gray and their jerseys of putrid green. And I will take a guess that this story is based on fact because no writers would deliberately give a baseball manager a name like Billy Beane outside of a comedy.<br/><br/>It's directed by Bennett Miller, and a very nice job he's done too. Here we have a story about the tense decision-making that goes on behind a game in which there is plenty of suspense and action, and yet Miller uses a classic approach to the narrative. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly. The cuts aren't instantaneous. The speech has the rhythms of real life with hesitations (""umm,"" ""ahhh"") and pauses, either awkward or thoughtful, between utterances. Viewers used to crackling commotion and ballbreaking bustle may be disappointed to find that most of the important stuff takes place in offices and the facilities of a stadium. Nobody wrenches anybody else's head off. And there's no sex and little sentiment.<br/><br/>The acting is on a par with the direction. Brad Pitt is pretty good, despite his conventional good looks and muscles. His job is to figure out how to turn a losing team with no money into a winning team with no money. The rest of the cast is fine, including Philip Seymour Hoffman in a relatively minor role as Pitt's antagonist. Pitt has a teen-aged daughter too, but she's not a modelesque beauty, thank God, just an ordinary looking kid. Jonah Hill plays a chubby economics graduate from Yale, one of those freaks who has really gotten seriously into baseball stats, along the lines of Steven Jay Gould. By means of complex mathematical equations that are never explained, and which you and I wouldn't understand anyway, Hill has computerized every player's potential, based strictly on performance, and scored them on a ratio scale. The human element is not quantifiable so it's dropped. Pitt decides the kid is onto something and adopts the anfractuous and inhuman rating system wholesale, dumping some players, trading others, buying still others who look oversold.<br/><br/>It's not entirely successful though. Again, the colors are drawn from the ghoulish end of the palette, no help to those sleeves. And the writers have made a big mistake. They've assumed a certain level of knowledge of the game that some viewers simply won't have. Take my brother, for instance. Here he is, sitting in the living room with Dad. Dad's in his usual undershirt, guzzling his beer, and watching a ball game on the tube. My brother shows no obvious interest in the goings on and Dad asks if he, Dad, is correct in assuming my brother is bored. ""Yes."" Then Dad asks whether Bobby is interested in the game, and my brother says, ""Not as far as I know."" Okay. The game proceeds for a minute, then Dad turns to my brother and asks, ""Are you guys faggots?"" <br/><br/>A second error, though I don't know that it could easily have been avoided, is that the script tells us nothing about the tactical details of the game or, indeed, about the players. I couldn't tell one from the other. At one point, Pitt advises a player to stop stealing second base. ""That's what I do."" ""Well, don't. You're paid to get a hit, not to get thrown out at second."" The exchange is meaningless because it lacks context. We don't know the player; we don't know that he tries too often to steal a base. Nothing. All the tension is focused on Pitt's character as he desperately tries to implement Hill's computer theory before -- wait for it -- he discovers that ""winning isn't everything"" and that ""money isn't a good way of keeping score."" <br/><br/>Yet, those weaknesses aside, this a refreshing movie, innovative in its naturalism and in the apparent spontaneity it manages to capture. If only the narrative weren't all so awfully foggy."
"sayloroct","9","0","1","1 December 2012"," It's Not A Basebal Movie; It's A Michael Lewis Movie
","Judging from some of the reviews, many viewers did not get this movie. It isn't a movie about baseball any more than ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is a movie about gold mining. The baseball is just a canvas that Michael Lewis used to paint his familiar themes that he has more commonly expressed in stories about Wall Street.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read Michael Lewis's other books, ""Liar's Poker"" and especially ""The Big Short"" and who has seen his extraordinary 2012 Yale commencement on Youtube address will have found the same themes running throughout his work; that people are often mis-valued because of luck and circumstances outside their control; that people are too easily fooled by appearances; that ""convention wisdom"" is often no wisdom at all; that it takes an outsider to see through the arbitrariness of ""conventional wisdom; that the outsider going against the tide will be ignored or treated as a fool; that it takes an unusual person driven by some personal flaw or demon to stand apart from the unthinking mob and to persevere against the opposition. It is this last theme that is the real focus of his work what makes his stories so compelling.<br/><br/>The story of Bill Beane personifies all these themes. He is another version of the oddball lot in the 'Big Short"", Mike Burry, Steve Eisman and the Boys from Cornwall capital who saw through the facade of the big Wall Street Banks went all in against them, and even the story of Lewis himself, who walked away from a sure multi-million dollar Wall Street career because he thought that it was all nonsense and would rather find a new ""senior thesis."" Billy Beane is another oddball outsider with the character flaw. Billy was a great high school talent, 6-4 the perfect picture of a baseball player. but was missing something that kept him from being the star that he was supposed to be. (The book explains much more of this when contrasting him with Lenny Dykstra, a small, 13th round draft pick who managed to make it big). At age 30, when still in his prime as major league player, albeit a fringe one, he quit and asked for a job at a scout, shocking just about every one from players to management. What character flaw leads a person to trade the wealth and fame of playing in the majors, the dream of players, fans and management, to become a bush league scout? It's easy to see why Lewis fell in love with the story.<br/><br/>Billy knows that appearances deceive because, after all, he was the perfect example. He was everything a star player was supposed to be in the eyes of the scouts - except he wasn't. He has suspicions about conventional baseball wisdom, but he himself has been baseball too long to completely come free of them. Then he meets a real outsider, Peter Brand, a Yale economics major who never played baseball and doesn't look like he ever could. Brand confirms Beane's misgivings about traditional wisdom when he explains precisely why appearances are so often wrong and why scouts and their conventional wisdom are based on a superficial understanding of what matters in winning. It all boils down to what Beane later describes as ""selling jeans"" - finding the right body, even the right face. Judging by appearances and ignoring real performance. Better yet, Brandt offers an alternative, using one of Lewis's other themes, they players are often mis-valued because of luck or other irrelevant circumstances, they pitch funny or they hang out at strip clubs, etc. Beane buys in, partly because of necessity and partly it confirms his suspicions. He not only selects players based on Brandt's ideas, over the vehement objects of old guard scouts, but he also goes so far as choosing a new head scout precisely because the man never played baseball and was untainted by conventional wisdom.<br/><br/>Then comes the next phases of Lewis's storyline, the scorn, laughter, and conflict with the insiders who see their position and self worth being questioned. Finally, there is eventual, if not complete, vindication. This leads to the film ending in two wonderful scenes. The Jeremy Brown video scene and his daughter's song both captured the spirit and the message of the film in a graceful ways.<br/><br/>In sum, it's a very nice movie of ideas. It certainly isn't about baseball. It's about how our view of the world and our judgment of other people and even ourselves is so often based on the wrong things, the surface things.<br/><br/>Note added: Most of the ideas that Beane used to select players in the movie had been learned from his predecessor as GM, Sandy Alderson, who is never mentioned in the movie. Alderson got them from reading Bill James, the godfather of the new statistical analysis who was contemptuous of standard baseball thinking. He wrote some really interesting and philosophical books on the subject of statistics and baseball while working as a night security guard at a pork and bean factory. He is also mentioned once, although Peter Brand is presumably meant to represent James+Paul DePodesta."

The coach, Art Howe was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who I felt was a little underused. I will give honourable mentions to; Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg and Stephen Bishop as David Justice.<br/><br/>Quite a slow pace to this one gives the audience time to get to know the major players and figure out just what Beane and Brand are doing. To me, the fact they didn't include the coach in their plans was a major flaw; he's the first one you have to convince! Putting that aside, I did find myself rooting for the team as the season came to its conclusion and that's testament to the writers and the filmmakers.

I am an avid baseball fan and saw this film about the inner working of the front office to be extremely interesting and just plain awesome. The Oakland Athletics are a small market team and can't afford to put a hundred and fifty million dollar team of stars on the field every years, so how can they possibly compete? It's a problem faced by almost half the teams in Major League Baseball, while teams the Yankees and Red Sox win year after year, teams like Royals haven't made the playoffs in twenty-five years! In sports, if you can't win, you can't draw fans and make a profit, so when you can't afford a winning team, you were just screwed, until Moneyball. Based on the true story of Oakland Athletics General Manager, Billy Beane, the film follows his creation of a system to judge players on more than just the basic scouting and numbers that have been used for a hundred years. Using this system, Beane and others who followed, have been able to compete with much lower payrolls, changing the face of Baseball. Brad Pitt is terrific as Beane and most definitely earned his Oscar nominations, but where did Jonah Hill's come from? I love Jonah Hill, but his character was as generic and boring as they come. In Moneyball, Hill plays Brad Pitt's sidekick, and is nothing more than a boring statistician, I've seen B-Movie performances that upstaged his in this film! If you love sports and want to know more about the behind the scenes aspect of it, Moneyball is a terrific film to use, but if you're not much of a fan and don't really care about sports, that you will just find this film boring. It's geared to a very specific type of moviegoer and if you're not into sports, you won't be into Moneyball."

","Year in and year out, I always get a lump in my throat when I see a sports underdog story about a team or player who must claw and scratch their way to insurmountable odds to be the best that they can be. Sure they're inspiring and heartfelt in its intentions, it seems like it follows on a routine outline that has been emulated over and over and offers anything new to the story. And granted ""Moneyball"" doesn't attempt anything new to the underdog sports story, but it's execution to the phenomenon from a contrasting perspective. Based on the non-fiction novel by Michael Lewis as we are more inspired by the business side of the baseball industry contrary to the facets of the game itself. Which to me is new and curiously refreshing. Award nominated director Bennett Miller collaborates with script writing giants Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian to bring to us one of the least tearful and melancholy baseball films since ""Major League II"". ""Moneyball"" tells the actual events that transpired in 2002 when Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) almost resurrected this franchise from the dead with the supportive usage of computer statistics and analysis. Sure it's not really a high-strung story, but this was a major milestone in baseball history and why not bring it to the big screen.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" makes noise about the unfortunate unfairness that was manifesting in the baseball industry as franchise giants like the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees can dominate the MLB by acquiring the big name stars and conjuring up the most wins. When Oakland started losing their top ranked stars, the team was out scurrying for suitable replacements. Breaking away from the traditional negotiations, Beane hires a Yale graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who found a potential loophole in the attempt to find new players. by examining statistics to get undervalued players a chance to have their well-deserved moment to shine. So Mr. Beane recruits a group of highly unlikely superstars that looked like they had a snowball's chance in the microwave to break out of their eleven game losing streak including the manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who always contradicted everything that Beane sets out to do. At first the team becomes the laughing stock of the MLB as fans continually chastise at Beane and all of his intentions of regrouping. But as things start to unravel, a monumental milestone starts to take shape.<br/><br/>Pitt plays Beane as a man who truly cares about his team and Pitt like Beane plays his respected performance by heart. Oblivious at first, we look first hand at how he defies his own beliefs at being an invaluable commodity in the franchise. The flashbacks in the movie and his moments with his daughter we see a man who practically eats, breathes and sleeps the sport of baseball. Johah Hill plays a pivotal role as a guy who possesses a original methodical approach to rectify a team from the doldrums to winning 20 consecutive victories Hill was in excellent form and the chemistry between him and Pitt was quite flawless. Hoffman played a small role but still every effective and right on the moneymaker. Even the ragtag team of players were not just a bunch of one-dimensional caricatures, they played ball like they played the sport for years. This movie had it all, a brilliant script, a compelling subject, well-oiled performances, and the tearful moments are minimal By looking into the business side of baseball in contrast to the actual sport, ""Moneyball"" is a one of a kind unique. It's where understanding the game exceeds from just the love of the game. This is one diamond of a film you should check out."

","Without saying to much this film has everything you could ever want in a film great action, great acting, and a beautiful and wonderful story. The only reason I give it 9 instead of 10 was due to the way they spoiled the girls song with additions at the end. And the fact that he didn't make some decisions which could of helped him achieve more. But it is understandable some people are idealistic and place greater things, above the value of money. Which I think adds another level of depth to this well named film title.<br/><br/>Iam from the Uk so baseball is not one of our main sports but I loved this and all the other big baseball films I've seen such as The Natural, The Babe, Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own and Mr Baseball .

","I was quite sure of witnessing a sweep in this year's Oscars but didn't anticipate such a snub for a stupendous film on Sports. The Editing, the Sound Mixing deserve Oscars.<br/><br/>Billy Beane is a baseball player-turned-general manager. He is cool-headed and cares for none, not even his players. He is the general manager of a team that trades out the men who performed the best and is left with a new selections to make with the paltry sum of money they have. He finds a really interesting person on his visit to the Tigers' office and hires him. They prepare a list of players who are well within their affordable range but with minor ailments, for which they are often ignored. They get into a heated argument with the scouts and coach over what they call a brazenly audacious move that could further slim down the chances of the team performing well. All the scouts leave the team and Billy is left with the coach, though reluctant to stay for another season, and Peter on his side.<br/><br/>At first, the obvious happens. The team performs miserably. After a few games, Billy Beane changes his attitude towards his players, treats them well, exhorts and edifies them and even trades the ones who have been corrupting the others and the ones who haven't lived up to the expectations and all these bear fruit.<br/><br/>They win one game after the other and the winning streak extends to a record 19 and a chance to re-write history beckons. They win the game, shatter the long-existing record and make it to the playoffs and falter once again. Billy is the subject of scathing remarks and is ridiculed for his adoption of an economics theory to draft players. He is offered the highest emolument by the owner of Red Sox but turns down the offer.<br/><br/>To talk in terms of Baseball, the movie is a 4-run homer: 1- Sorkin's brilliant screenplay. 2- Brad Pitt's and Jonah Hill's acting. 3- Sound Mixing. 4- Film Editing."

Moneyball has a great score, impeccable acting, and has a consistent pacing.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are remarkable as their own respective roles. The music fits in perfectly and ""The Might Rio Grande"" plays a lot in the movie. <br/><br/>I was never interested in baseball. But this movie, well, it didn't make me a fan, nor did it make me hate it. I just enjoyed all the baseball facts and stuff. Truth is, what really makes this movie shine would be it's lesson-- Never give up on what you believe in. <br/><br/>I know, you guys have probably seen many movies with this kind of lesson.

","This film does a great job of introducing us to one of the most unconventional factors in the world of baseball. That is, the career of Billy Bean, who was the kind of general manager who had the gift of putting a team together based on normally overlooked talents. Along the way he and his financially gifted cohort (who really knows baseball) must face a hundred years of baseball tradition. They are cut off at every point by the manager who selfishly plays it safe, looking only after himself. The point is that a baseball season is longer than long and a great many nuances contribute to success. The strength of this movie is the realistic portrayal of the baseball world, particularly the relationships among the players and the front office. It also shows that a general manager, despite a position of importance, can still be seen as an insignificant person when things don't go well. It's truly, ""What have you done for me lately?"" The interesting thing is that a mediocre ballplayer and unknown GM made changes that affected baseball forever."

","KNOCKED UP, SUPER BAD, FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL all have one thing in common and that factor is Jonah Hill. The almost lavishly round Jonah Hill is widely known for his appearances in movies with involving teen seduction, intimacy and drugs abuse in some degree. Jonah Hill who is now 28 years old is seeking to stretch his talents as an actor and reach out to a more diverse arena of motion picture. If I am not mistaken this is the 2nd time Jonah Hill is taking on a role of this caliber following his performance in CYRUS. Playing the character of Peter Brand in the bio-pic MONEYBALL alongside Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt came to me as a surprise. Now that I have seen the movie, it is a crime that I do not highlight his sheer brilliance. If there was one thing the reader needs to know about Jonah Hill is that he is versatile and he is no more the young boy who is in search of intimacy, instead he is a grown man now with an Oscar Nomination to his name for the Best Supporting Actor category for this performance. <br/><br/>Furthermore MONEYBALL is by far my number one movie when it comes to a Brad Pitt performance. With 4 Oscar Nominations to his name, words would fail me in case one would not know who Brad Pitt is. Whilst Pitt has taken on some quite challenging roles during the past 4 years this indeed is his best. Portraying Billy Beane; the man who changed the game of baseball management, he plays it with utter precision that I am now convinced to take up learning baseball. Baseball as a sport never has been my forte; however MONEYBALL to me speaks beyond the umbrella of baseball. It is how decisions are made in the business of sports. Sports of today are a multimillion dollar industry and Pitt's performance makes it so much interesting to learn. At glance Billy Beanes character seem to be just a bland angry general manager who is stubborn and yells at everyone on his payroll. As the movie unfolds its 130 minutes the audience begins to learn who the man Billy Beane is and why he is the man he is. In fact Brad Pitt's performance is convincing that now when I Google a picture of Billy Beane it's as if I have known his work all my life. Brad Pitt adds character to his face in the viewer's eyes.<br/><br/>Biography movies are director Bennett Miller's strong suite. With only 2 motion pictures (CAPOTE & MONEYBALL) to his name (Both Bio-Pics) Miller has convinced me that he is strangely talented. 2 movies, 4 Oscar nominations including 1 win for the actors he has directed is a trademark of Miller being a ""no nonsense"" director. Obviously characterization is paramount in Millers to-do list whilst in the director's chair. It now isn't a mystery as to why MONEYBALL is as successful as she is. The time spent on minute details is fantastic. The scene in which Peter Brand informs a player that he is been traded to another team is one fitting example of attention to detail. Another would be when Billy Beane and Peter Brand are in the office making choices on what player to recruit. The mentioned aren't scenes with any dramatic events; they are instead straightforward situations where Miller utilizes it as a point to tweak the characterization. It sounds corny what I am about to say, it seems so wrong how he does it, but yet it is so right!<br/><br/>In a readers perspective one may wonder why I rambled on for half a page on the acting and the directing and avoided discussing the movie on its own. The answer is quite simple, not everyone watches a bio-pic. A bio- pic isn't necessarily the most entertaining movie of the year. Those who watch a bio-pic are mostly interested in finding out what exactly happened during the time the person lived or did what he/she did that ended up with him/her having his/her own movie. Hence what is critical is the acting and how the story unfolds. This movie enthusiast enjoys savoring his movie experiences and basking in the gloated detailing of characterization done by the director and his cast<br/><br/>A fantastic bio-pic direction with brilliant performances for the serious audience. The story of Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics General Manager. A man whose methods were considered unorthodox by the industries best during the time, a man who has been questioned about the decisions and the choices he has made and a man who proved himself right!

","...since its dramatic elements are universal: an underdog takes on the established rich and the comfortably smug and beats them by changing the rules of the game. <br/><br/>Baseball was fertile terrain for this, since sport even at the highest professional level is notoriously anti-intellectual and conservative. Baseball men would rather underachieve than face ridicule from their peers by rejecting common practice. This is made clear early in the film. Baseball scouts and front office personnel are shown to be making decisions on team makeup in an ad hoc, seat of the pants fashion that disappeared in most other enterprises with the coming of the information age. But any battle against established wisdom and entrenched power has heroic qualities and makes for compelling drama. Baseball just happened to be the venue this time out.<br/><br/>The story: after losing key players to richer organizations after the 2002 season, Oakland GM Billy Beane faced the same to succeed as them but with less resources. He needed a cheaper product. His response quietly revolutionized baseball by challenging conventional wisdom about player evaluation and showing it up. The fact that the 'moneyball' approach is now almost universal in pro baseball gives the film's subject the weight of historic interest, but even if the experiment had failed the mission itself was heroic and historic.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, creates a full bodied performance as Beane, a man risks his career and reputation to implement his quiet revolution, while dealing with the fact of a failed playing career and a failed marriage with as much dignity and practicality as he can, and without turning his experiment into a quest. Beane's passion for the game drives him forward without blinding him to the fact that he is running an experiment that might fail. He weathers a storm of opposition and ridicule from others around baseball, from a skeptical and misinformed media, and even within the ranks of even his own team, while he (and the audience) watch the season play out.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill successfully underplays a bright outsider on the fringes, whose insights into the game career baseball men won't admit exceed their own, and who serves as the catalyst and caretaker of the Moneyball experiment. Robin Wright strikes the perfect note as the ex-wife who bears Beane no ill will but who has nonetheless moved on with her life. Beane's personal drama is past, but the big public one playing out everyday in the sports pages should be enough conflict for anybody, including the audience."

","Moneyball examines a deeper premise than how the 2002 Oakland A's managed to form a contending baseball team with a small payroll. While there is a lot of baseball in the story, it is not the whole story.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's (still is) during a time when it appeared baseball was ruled by large payrolls. Right away, you are shown how the Oakland team loses three big talents to the more well-healed baseball teams (Yankees, Red Soxs) and now they need to find players to stand a chance to compete but at one of the lowest payroll levels in Major League Baseball. Billy discovers Grant (Jonah Hill) who uses a different, more calculated approach to evaluating talent than the old tried and true method of subjective evaluation by long-time scouts.<br/><br/>The story is crisp, the movie cleanly presented, and well-acted by the two principle actors. Aaron Sorkin's writing fingerprints are all over it. It is fine movie making.<br/><br/>But the story isn't just about baseball, it is about how objective tools are used to decide how the talent is acquired and used. We are seeing more and more of this in our daily lives. If you work for an employer, there is a strong probability that how your efforts are graded are done using a scale that is cold, hard, and unmoving. What was once a series of perceptions and opinions by your boss are now hard straight facts. It is because the humans that manage other humans have a series of preconceived notions of how well you do your job. Humans are fallible, so our evaluations are flawed too.<br/><br/>I once created a computer program to play the board game Monopoly with me. I figured that I should be able to beat it more than it beats me because I wouldn't be able to construct a rich set of logic rules that would beat my cognitive abilities. After playing against it many times, I was surprised to find that it could beat me six out of ten games. Reason? I was subject to making decisions based on gut feel instead of cold hard logic and I made faulty decisions. The computer didn't, so it won more times than not.<br/><br/>Moneyball is the same thing. A roomful of scouts deciding on which players they should go after is flawed and will ignore those that deserve consideration while accepting those that don't. This is expanding to our workplaces as well and we will be accepted or rejected based on firm data than someone's opinion. As a teacher in a high school, that is exactly what testing has done for schools. It is probably coming soon to a workplace near you."

In life, we should examine everything, there are no sacred cows.<br/><br/>The story also demonstrates that with radical change comes strong resistance and one must always have the inner strength and belief to withstand the inevitable criticism that comes when implementing change in order to succeed.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Bennett Miller deserve plenty of praise for this film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good story with substance."

","I really fell in love with this one. With the advent of instant global communication and the wealth of information that's available at the speed of thought today, the focus of our collective interest in sports has shifted and deepened. While the contests will always be the main focus, rightly, there's also a sweeping undercurrent of interest in the games behind the games. Player swaps, contract negotiations, deep statistical analysis; these are as formidable an arsenal for the modern team as a bat and glove, and it's about time Hollywood made the effort to examine that fundamental shift. Moneyball does it exceptionally well, delving into the theories and risks behind this new way of thinking without going too far into the realm of obsessive over-explanation. As the team's roster and strategies begin to change shape and coalesce, the film shifts into something larger than a mere underdog sports story, interpersonal drama or heady mathematical essay. It's all of those things and more, with an ambitiously large toolbox and the confident knowledge of how to most efficiently use each implement: an evolution of sports-themed material on film. It's the rare film that non-fans can enjoy just as much as season ticket holders, and a justified candidate for the Oscars' top honor."

","It's pretty safe to say that what little knowledge us Brits have regarding major American sports like Baseball, Basketball, Ice Hockey and American Football tend to stem from cinema. These titanic past times that comprise a lofty part of US culture and identity just don't get the coverage they arguably deserve over this side of the pond. They're still more or less exclusive to our star spangled cousins who, to their credit, have actually given the world some credible films centred on their beloved four like Field of Dreams, White Men Can't Jump, The Mighty Ducks and Any Given Sunday. So what about Moneyball? Capote director Bennet Miller's rousing and inspired semi-biopic about a pivotal period in contemporary Baseball starring major league thesp Brad Pitt. Well, it's good. Very good, in fact. You could even go as far as saying it's a little bit special.<br/><br/>Nominated for six Oscars and based heavily on a true tale that unfolded around the early noughties, Moneyball is a character based docudrama that even those with zero Baseball knowledge can be taken in and moved by. Pitt plays Billy Beane, a former ball player who's now the haunted general manager of the Oakland A's; a cash strapped major league team who are down on their luck. They've just lost their final and most important game of the season and look set to lose their 3 best players with no financial gain as a result. Bean must now rebuild the team for the upcoming season with next-to-nothing in the way of cash and appeal. Despite resistance from his staff and the media, Beane enlists the help of a Yale educated economist (Jonah Hill) and begins to assemble a team of misfits based on stats, facts and figures and forever changes the way Baseball is played.<br/><br/>If, like me, you're unfamiliar with Baseball politics and procedures, a general manager answers only to the club's chairman and is required to broker deals and contracts for current and would be players. It's basically his job to pick the players that make up the squad. It's then down to the head coach and staff to field the team for a given game and implement tactics. Got it? Right, back to the film.<br/><br/>Despite revolving heavily around everything Baseball, the lasting impression Moneyball leaves is that it is more of an honest and thoughtful meditation on one man's desire to make amends and restore a level of personal pride and dignity. As the volatile Billy Beane, Pitt brings his A-game to the field and exhibits all the charm, wit, skills and natural talents that have made him one of the most diverse and commendable actors at work in Hollywood over the past 3 decades. When Pitt's not dabbling in conventional pieces of high-concept dribble like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Ocean's Twelve, he can act up a storm and does so with Oscar- worthy ease in this: his latest and, perhaps, greatest pitch. His portrayal of the bitter and quirky general manager hell-bent on re-writing the rule book ranks easily amongst some of the 49 year old's best work. As a teenager, Beane was prematurely lured into the pro-leagues with promises of fame and glory. It didn't work out. Neither did his marriage. So, he turned to scouting in attempt to right wrongs.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill's assured, Oscar nominated turn as Beane's studious assistant is also worth a mention for this may signal a break away from the funny fat guy roles that have comprised the bulk of Hill's career so far. Make no mistake about it though, it's Pitt who steals the show in what some believe was ""the"" performance that should've bagged him that long overdue best actor gong.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the facade and grandeur of an underdog Hollywood sporting film starring an A-list star or two, Moneyball isn't your typical sports film. Think Any Given Sunday without the testosterone: very well acted, scripted, shot and peppered with bouts of humour and heart. You don't have to like Baseball or even sport to enjoy Miller's Moneyball. In only his third film, he has steered a total of 4 actors to Oscar nods now which is an impressive feat to say the least. His heartwarming spin on Steven Zailian and Aaron Sorkin's adapted screenplay deserves its place alongside both this year's best pictures and the all-time greats of character based sporting pictures."

Coming to my favorite actor since ""Sleepers"" and ""Legends of the Fall"", Brad is absolutely fantastic in this role which is quite difficult to portray. There are only few emotions to express in this non violent, non romantic, non bete-noire, non-scifi, non-action drama. But, Brad scores a perfect 10 in portraying his emotions, his sorrow and single minded focus towards his goal. I've resisted seeing this flick for many weeks until now just because i thought it was a baseball drama and i don't understand a word of this game..:-). For baseball lovers, it would be a great movie. For guys like me, its a lesson in every facet of life.

","The movie was a pleasant surprise I find most sports movies are trite and predictable, but Moneyball was extremely watchable and held my interest for the two hours. Brad Pitt obviously dug into the role of Billy Beane. He knew he really did not have much in Oakland either with the players or the stadium,but he stayed true to character by turning down the Boston GM position. I wondered why he did not fire Art Howe when he caught the team 'celebrating' in the locker room after a loss. Terry Francona got fired in Boston last year for the team doing similar behavior as Oakland was showing but Beane was not seen as taking Howe to task for allowing this to occur doing the season. As Howe was unhappy with his one year contract, I would have taken this as a personal affront and dumped him Beane had a short fuse and attention span as his actions proved. He wanted easy, short answers to questions The long winded responses the scouts came up with as to player development and acquisitions was not his style The more he heard, the more he saw it was to be his way or the highway He did not need or care to field input from the scouting organization. Overall, the movie was about a strong personality as well as baseball."

","Here is a sports film that talks about more than just the players. Brad Pitt gives us a stellar performance as Billy Beane, a General Manager who started out as a player who never reached his potential. He gives us not only insight into the professional life of Billy Beane, but the man himself. We learn he is divorced, involved in his daughter's life, and trying to remain civil with his ex's new partner. He has ideas that he can't support in the accepted method, but with his reputation, he has a lot of leeway with the owner, and when he discovers Phillip Brand (Jonah Hill), he sees a way to make the kind of team that has the potential to win a championship. Jonah Hill is excellent as Brand, developing his character from the fresh out of college statistician with little self confidence to the man who learns to accept the responsibilities of management. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is strong as Manager Art Howe, but I get the feeling there are missing scenes because we just don't get enough of him in the film. Kerris Dorsey is impressive in the role of Casey Beane, and also co-wrote the song ""The Show"" and performs it for us in a touching scene where Billy is buying his daughter a guitar. For baseball fans, this is a movie about a pivotal moment in baseball history. For Brad Pitt fans, this is a chance to see Brad in a role that doesn't involve spies, cons, wars, and explosions. For the rest of us, this is a film to watch and enjoy. Rated PG-13 for a few scenes with harsh language, I'd recommend it for the entire family. Collectible for sports fans and lovers of good ""slice of life"" films."
"Turfseer","5","0","2","4 March 2012"," Computer geeks win acceptance in beer-swilling, baseball jock fraternity
","In many respects, 'Moneyball' is not any different from most 'baseball' movies that place the national pastime on its ubiquitous, saccharine pedestal. That can be expected. Where 'Moneyball' differs, is that it seeks to invite a new 'player' to the table—the computer geek. Now all the aspiring Bill Gates' of the world can take a seat with the battle-scarred, beer-swilling veterans, who've been analyzing the game for years, utilizing an intuition grounded in their 'gut' perceptions, instead of a set of statistics, organized by a computer program. This is the basic premise of Brad Pitt's overrated Academy Award nominated film, which is more about the business of baseball, than the game itself.<br/><br/>For awhile, the story of Billy Beane, the former mediocre baseball player turned general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team, proves to be fairly interesting. After failing to beat the NY Yankees in the first round of the playoffs in 2001, the owner of the As gives Beane an ultimatum: win the World Series next year, but with a vastly reduced budget (as the A's principal players, such as Jason Giambi, have been traded away). Beane meets with his staff of scouts (played by former professional baseball players and scouts), who lend a real air of credibility to the proceedings. That group appears to be clueless and sends Beane in search of a new approach to resolve his quandary of finding underrated baseball talent, without the aid of the big bucks.<br/><br/>While attempting to negotiate a trade with the Cleveland Indians, Beane discovers a low level Indian employee, statistician Peter Brand, a Yale graduate, who picks players by means of sophisticated computer analysis (Brand is a composite character based primarily on Beane's real-life top assistant, Paul DePodesta, who refused permission to use his name in the film). Geeky Jonah Hill plays Brand, and for half of Act 2, he advises Beane on which bargain basement players to trade for. Brand looks primarily at 'on base percentage' and Beane (with Brand in tow) makes a house call , on one occasion, to fading major league catcher, Scott Hatteberg, asking him whether he'd be interested in converting to playing first base (the answer is of course, affirmative!). Beane manages to pick up more bargains, including submarine hurler, Chad Bradford, with the aid of Brand, and by the time spring training rolls around, Beane is confident that his motley crew, can compete against the more financially endowed teams, including their ultimate nemesis: the Yanks! <br/><br/>The drama (and one's interest), only lasts for a little while longer. There's an effective scene where Beane comes into conflict with his scouting crew, who resent the presence of Brand, and his disdain for their 'intuition'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, manages to acquit himself nicely as A's manager, Art Howe, who doesn't like Beane telling him how to manage his team (but his part is all too brief). Sadly, the narrative eventually has nowhere to go, as there's virtually no additional interesting enough conflict, which propelled the characters so fitfully along, in the film's first half. The A's 20 game winning streak is attributed to Brand's highly questionable miracle system (it should be noted that the A's still had some 'big money' holdovers, such as pitchers Zito and Hudson, who were not selected as a result of Brand's machinations). Brand has little to do in the second half of the film, except act as Beane's glorified cheerleader, with Beane, now wheeling and dealing on his own, sometimes acting outside the purview of his brainiac assistant. Nonetheless, the film's scenarists afford the geeky Brand, with his own hagiography, now allowed to sit at the table with 'the big boys'.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, 'Moneyball' has perhaps the most anti-climactic climax, in recent film history. Not only do the A's fail to make the first round of the Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring. Even more embarrassing (and this is supposed to be impressive), we're told that the Red Sox, utilizing Beane and Brand's statistical approach, win their first World Series since 1918, a couple of years later. Beane's consolation prize is thus held up as some kind of great victory for humanity! <br/><br/>'Moneyball' is one of the few baseball films, that refuses to fictionalize the characters they are portraying. Unfortunately, we learn next to nothing about any of them, except for the fact that they have hearts of gold (again, as to be expected). Some time is spent portraying the aging David Justice, as a surly, 'non-team' player. But after a pep talk from Beane, he agrees to 'step up to the plate', and provide guidance to the 'younger players', who soon come together and accomplish the miracle 20 game winning streak.<br/><br/>All-Star writers Sorkin and Zaillian fall flat in attempting to infuse Beane's character, with a meaningful internal arc. Beane must not only overcome his past failure as a player (which we see in a series of flashbacks), but also must bond with his teenage daughter. Beane's nobility is undercut by such pretentious pronouncements as ""money is not important"", even though he's portrayed as a ruthless wheeler dealer, who uses shady tactics to gain an advantage over his rivals. According to Beane, introducing the new dry world of statistics, is what he wants to be remembered for, not earning a World Series ring.<br/><br/>'Moneyball' must also contend with the additional deficit of another 'phone in' Brad Pitt performance. No matter how hard he tries, Pitt invariably cannot play anyone but Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Pitt should not be completely blamed for attempting to elevate Beane (and baseball) to mythic status. In the end, however, it's the general public, who, year after year, places the 'national pastime', on that saccharine pedestal. After all, baseball, is nothing more than a business and entertainment spectacle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is, I believe, trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge."

","I have been a Dodger fan since I was five years old. And I have the emotional scars to prove it. And because I'm a fan of baseball I've seen a ton of baseball related movies, everything from ""Fear Strikes Out"" and ""The Stratton Story"" to ""Bull Durham"" and ""The Natural"". Moneyball is right there with the very best of them. <br/><br/>But Moneyball really isn't about baseball; rather, it is about business. The film uses baseball as a parable, much like Peter Brand, marvelously played by Jonah Hill, uses a video of a player who doesn't know that he has hit a home run to make a point for the Oakland A's general manager, Billy Beane, portrayed, in case you haven't heard, by Brad Pitt. The f<br/><br/>The film skillfully and poignantly demonstrates that, in business, if something doesn't work, you should try something else. And then tweak that something else until you get it right. And don't be afraid to challenge prevailing thought. In fact, this film encourages everyone to challenge the status quo and business as usual concepts on a regular basis. And it does so with an exclamation point. It also makes clear that you have to have a standard by which to judge your success. In Moneyball, Beane states that if the A's don't win the last game of the season, meaning the world series, then anything else they accomplish is meaningless.<br/><br/>Moneyball's storyline is simple enough. The Oakland Athletics lose three key players. The team subsequently has a lot of holes in its lineup and little money to fill them. Brand convinces Beane that he can get better players at rock bottom prices by properly analyzing the right statistics. No other team in the sport had ever engaged in such analysis. Beane ends up challenging over a hundred years of ""sound"" baseball scouting practices that consist primarily of instincts and gut feelings. <br/><br/>All of the performances in the film are extremely believable. Brad Pitt, gives a quietly effective performance. I admit that the first time I saw Jonah Hill in this movie I laughed. I mean you can't help it if you have seen him in ""Knocked Up"", ""Super Bad"", or the ""40 Year Old Virgin"". But I shouldn't have because I saw him in ""Cyrus"" and was impressed by his non-comedic performance in it. In Moneyball he does a commendable; but as it turns out, not an Academy Award winning job of playing a computer nerd who, in his first ever job, implements theories he discovered as a undergraduate student at Yale.<br/><br/>Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, is excellent as manager Art Howe. Has Hoffman ever not been stellar? Even in a movie like ""Along Comes Pollly"" he was effective. You would think that he would no longer accept supporting roles. But, to his credit, he did. And Moneyball is better for it.<br/><br/>The A's don't win a world series with Beane as its general manager. But the Boston Red Sox, using the business model Beane developed, do two years later.<br/><br/>As a die-hard Dodger fan, I hope the people who make personnel decisions for the Dodgers have spent the money to see Moneyball. But knowing its soon to be ex-owner (I hope), Frank McCourt, I doubt it."

","When it comes to rating a film, I look at 3 things: Storyline, script, and acting. The storyline for Moneyball was intriguing. The funny thing is you do not have to be a baseball fan to appreciate the story because it lines up more with an underdog overcoming the odds scenario. However, if you are a baseball fan, it is definitely a plus! Aaron Sorkin is a genius. Everything he has written or created is always witty and brilliant. I think of the Social Network, A Few Good Men and The West Wing series. Moneyball lines up quite well next to all of those films. As far as acting goes, Jonah Hill was fantastic. I had a hard time wrapping my head around him being in a more serious role, but he pulled it off with flying colors. Brad Pitt has had better acting roles, but he did a decent job portraying his character. This film is a must see and I expect it to win some academy awards."
"seaview1","10","0","1","24 February 2012"," The Remarkable Lessons of MONEYBALL
","Truth may be stranger than fiction, but when the sports world is shaken by a methodology that will revolutionize the business of baseball, it becomes an amazing story born out of need. Adapted from the Michael Lewis' bestseller by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and directed by Bennett Miller (Capote), Moneyball is a fascinating look at how the sport of baseball was turned on its head and its implications that reverberate to this day. It's also about the bond a father has with his daughter that is stronger than any contract.<br/><br/>In 2001, Oakland Athletics general manager and former player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is trying to keep his star players from being bought by financially wealthier teams like the New York Yankees. Desperate to field a winning team with a hopelessly limited budget, he happens upon an analyst for the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (a winning Jonah Hill) who has statistics to back up his theory that the best players are not necessarily the costliest ones. Rather than compete with the big teams, Beane realizes that the underrated players who are statistically on base the most will translate into runs scored and ultimately wins. The remarkable thing is that these players can be obtained at bargain basement salaries. The concept goes against conventional wisdom and immediately creates friction among the veteran scouts and even the A's manager (played to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman). A former star recruit himself, Beane blew his chance for stardom at an early age and is now sharing custody of his teenage daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright). He loves his girl and fears that losing his job will force him to move farther away from her. As the team begins to show signs of becoming a winning organization, a remarkable string of wins begins that will make history and have far reaching consequences for the game of baseball.<br/><br/>This is one of the best roles Pitt has ever had. The dialogue is perfectly suited to him, and he delivers flawlessly. It's the kind of role you could easily picture with a younger Robert Redford. When he says things that stun his personnel staff by deviating from common practice and status quo, it is a hoot. I mean he really shakes things up because he is willing to try just about anything to win games, and it also means changing a culture of losing into a winning attitude. Just watching the negotiations and deal making behind the scenes is fascinating. You also get a realistic perspective from the clubhouse as players come and go, but these are people too with families, and the film does not shortchange this point of view.<br/><br/>What elevates this film from its novel plot line is the genuine relationship between Billy and his daughter that influences his priorities. He isn't just a general manager but a father, and the film never loses this perspective to its credit. When the team's fortunes change dramatically by the end, an astonishing opportunity presents itself to Billy that puts him at a career crossroads, and the baseball world takes notice.<br/><br/>Even non-baseball enthusiasts may find this a fascinating story because it is character driven with strong performances by its cast. (Sports movies get made with semi-regularity, but when did a studio make a film about personnel management of a major sports team?) When you think about the recent championship success of teams like the Boston Red Sox and look at this film, the connections are mind boggling. And while this new age in personnel management is a story onto itself, the one constant through it all is a father's love for his daughter. Top notch all the way."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","18 February 2012"," Intelligent docu-drama
","Unlike ""Field of dreams"", the iconic baseball fantasy cum feel-good melodrama, ""Moneyball"" is a serious dramatized documentary on how an idea culminated in revolutionizing the entire business of managing Major League Baseball. The old school scouts who pride themselves on years of experience and intuition are pitched against the 25-year-old Yale computer wiz Peter Brand's (Jonah Hill) ""sabermetrics"" - mathematical models and absolutely nothing else. Mentoring Brand is Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who has a story of his own – giving up a Stanford scholarship (baseball players are not as lucky as NFL players for whom college is part of the standard career path) to become a MLB player, only to fail at the field and went on to become a baseball GM. The time frame of this movie is the beginning of the millennium when he finds himself at a crossroad. As the manager of the pathetic Oakland A's, Beane is at the verge of losing his job right at a mid-life crisis. Brand's scientific method can be his salvation, or undoing. This is sort of a variation of the ""You and me against the world"" theme (thanks Helen Reddy). The story is told in a very engaging way but delightfully free of any genre cliché.<br/><br/>While the primary premise of managing a Major League team by mathematics is quite novel, this movie has many familiar themes. It is definitely an underdog story. As well, the ruthless world of the MLB ""slave trade"" (I coined) is clearly depicted – it's bad enough to be traded (for whatever reason) to a team a thousand miles away with hardly any advance notice, but be thankful you don't get fired outright on the spot, just like that. On the intimate scale, Beane is on reasonable friendly terms with his divorced wife (Robin Wright) and her remarried husband who have the custody of the his 12-year-old daughter (Kerris Dorsey). Father and daughter are very close and seem to be able to spend time together whenever feasible.<br/><br/>Casting is top-notch and performances are brilliant. Pitt continues, year after year, to demonstrate his amazing range. Staying right there with Pitt (and they have quite a few scenes together) is little-known Hill whose portrayal of the somewhat bulky, introvert, unimpressive wiz kid impresses in a way nobody can. Although billed as the female co-star, Wright appears in exactly one short scene where Beane goes to collect their daughter. A little more than cameo is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the team's manager who is always at a collision course with Beane. There is still not much screen time to speaks of but whenever you see Hoffman, his is always brilliant. Dorsey who plays the 12-year-old daughter is a darling in every single way.<br/><br/>The only bit of melodrama is a game against Kansas City which, if won, will give the A's an unprecedented 20-game streak. Beane who never stays in the stadium to watch his team play but drives around aimlessly relying on the cell phone or radio to follow what is happening, breaks routine by turning the car around upon hearing that his team is enjoying a formidable 11-0 lead in the fourth inning. But the tides start turning when he is back in the stadium as KC comes back with run after run to tie the score at 11-11. To make things easy for of the audience unfamiliar with the game of baseball, the movie makers follow a path that leaves much to be desired for people who understand the game. While for the NFL, the team on defence still has a small chance of scoring (i.e. offensive fumbles) a MLB team on defence simply does not score. When we see the A's batting at 11-11 in the last inning but are not told if that's the top or the bottom of the inning. If that's the bottom, they are loss-proof, even though a tie is not quite as sweet as a win. If that's the top, whatever they score does not guarantee a win. Either way, the dramatic effect of the homer shown is much reduced.<br/><br/>But as I said, this movie anything but melodramatic and the above scene is not the final climax, but something added presumably to please those who would like to see a bit of melodrama. There is another 25 minutes of thought-provoking movie after that scene."

","American underdog sports movies are far from a new concept, but rarely does one come together as well as Bennett Miller's MONEYBALL. It's something of a hard sell, given that the film more concerned with statistics and percentages than the game of baseball itself, yet writers Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin craft a surprisingly compelling story, and Miller's understated, almost old-fashioned direction allows the beauty of the story to play out naturally, despite a slightly overlong runtime.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, MONEYBALL is more of a business film than a sports film, telling the story of the under-funded Oakland Athletics' 2002 Major League season, a season where general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and freshly graduated economics major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) shook the game's backroom strategy to the foundations. Brand's radical approach (selecting a team based on statistics rather than individual performance) isn't exactly the most cinematic of concepts, yet Zaillian's excellent story construction coupled with the wonderful dialogue from Sorkin simplifies what could be a densely intimidating and complex subject, with breezy, relatable, and very entertaining results. Much like Sorkin's Oscar-winning THE SOCIAL NETWORK screenplay, MONEYBALL uses the real-life events as a frame to hang much grander ideas on, and even for viewers unfamiliar or uninterested in the sport, there is much here to enjoy.<br/><br/>No discussion of MONEYBALL would be complete without special attention being paid to the fabulous double act of Pitt and Hill, both arguably delivering the finest performances of their careers. The two play so well off of one another, with Pitt in particular revealing a little seen everyman quality which fits his character, and the film, perfectly. Beane lives everyday with the spectre of past failure hovering around him, yet his ambition is never shaken, even in the face of tremendous adversity. It's a remarkably mature performance from Pitt capping off a very strong year (inculding similarly solid work in THE TREE OF LIFE), suggesting that he has finally shaken totally free of his pretty boy 'star' image to become a vastly talented actor, the Robert Redford heir apparent which many have been foreseeing for years. Hill also surprises in an against-type role, but is unquestionably second fiddle to Pitt.<br/><br/>There is strong competition from several films in this year's Oscar race, yet MONEYBALL more than deserves to stand alongside the best of them. Subtle, heartfelt and inspiring with perfectly pitched performances, Miller, Zaillian, Sorkin and Pitt knock it out of the park.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"

","I was a great fan of MLB (major league baseball) as a kid growing up. In the deep south we had no MLB in the 1950s but my dad cheered for the St Louis Cardinals, and listened to their games on the radio at night, as they were the only ""southern"" team. For no reason that I can recall, I cheered for the Brooklyn Dodgers. One year around 1959 or 1960 we drove to St Louis and spent several days there, going to the St Louis and Brooklyn 3-game series. <br/><br/>With that as a background I had no idea what to expect when I popped the ""Moneyball"" DVD into the player. I knew it was about the Oakland As, and I like Brad Pitt, so I figured it would be a worthwhile two hours. I got a lot more than I was expecting, a fascinating true story of how they changed the way baseball is run as a business.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is Billy Beane, former MLB player who had been highly prized coming out of high school, was signed, but never really cut it. So he became a scout, and eventually worked up to General Manager of the Oakland team. After going to the world series, and losing to the Yankees, their three best players left, bought off by bigger salaries that Oakland couldn't afford. So Billy had to do something different to win, but what? <br/><br/>The fateful day came when, on a recruiting trip, he happened upon Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, recent graduate of Yale, who looked closely at years and years of MLB statistics. He had developed formulas based on the concepts foreign to MLB scouting up to then. He had a system to attach a value to a player based on such things as percentage ""on base"". That is, a walk counted as much as a line-drive single to center field. So Billy hired Peter away, and soon made him assistant GM. <br/><br/>The system worked because of the synergy, Billy couldn't do it without Peter, and Peter couldn't get his ideas implemented with someone like Billy, whose only goal was to win. In fact his outlook was (and I assume still is) ""If you don't win the last game of the season then no one cares.""<br/><br/>Always superb Philip Seymour Hoffman in a role I would not have predicted for him, in crew-cut hair style, is Manager Art Howe. <br/><br/>Really good movie, one of the better ones I have seen recently."

","t has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in ""Moneyball"" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's 2001 and Oakland has just lost to the New York Yankees in the playoffs, not surprising, seeing as their payroll was 76 Million dollars less. The humour of ""Moneyball"" starts in the off-season when the team can't afford to keep their top players and Beane and his experienced scouts start tossing around some free agent ideas. One guy is no good because he frequents strip clubs too often, another guy is no good because his girlfriend is ugly, and on down the list they go. But then Beane meets Yale-educated, economics-, mathematics-, and computer-whiz, baseball fan, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). He has no experience and he doesn't know these players. He doesn't know if they stand funny or if they swing ugly. He only knows their stats and their salary."

Its a perfectly smart movie that keeps you watching until the very end.<br/><br/>What really impressed me was the baseball game sequences. The lighting, the intensity, and the suspense made it more entertaining than a normal game you would watch on the sports channel at home. Even if the A's aren't your favorite team, you still feel a desperation for them; you want them to come out of their slump and succeed.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill made a great sort-of duo. Brad Pitt's character was charming and sarcastic, and Jonah Hill's character was quietly funny and surprisingly intelligent. I enjoyed their conversations very much.<br/><br/>Most of the movie, I thought, was like watching a very close baseball game at home. You sit on the edge of your seat, and hope that everything can work out for this team, and that they can score a couple of runs before the game is over. You can also enjoy a few well-placed laughs in between. It's a pleasantly intelligent movie, with good characters, a good portrayal of a true story, a baseball-game-like suspense, and if it loses to Hugo in the Oscars, I will be very upset."

","I love sports movies and this one was no different for me; it was a really engaging and interesting movie and even more so since it was based on true events.<br/><br/>This film can engage viewers who are familiar or unfamiliar with the sport since it really focuses on the stories of 2 men and their pioneering vision.<br/><br/>Also thought Brad Pitt was excellent; he has a quiet silence about him in some scenes and in other scenes, he is talking a mile a minute while wheeling and dealing.<br/><br/>Overall, found the movie to be entertaining, exciting, and engaging."
"dfranzen70","7","0","2","26 January 2012"," On the money. Ball.
","I think the first thing you need to realize about Moneyball is that it's not really a baseball movie at all. It's about innovation in the face of intractable, tradition-bound, go-by-the-gut senses. New thinking versus old thinking. In presenting the view that concentrating on why a particular player is more valuable to a team than another, rather than on his star power or high-profile personality or the number of home runs he's hit is not only prudent but necessary when a team has little money to spend, the movie is an unqualified success. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt, nominated for an Oscar) is the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, a team with a small payroll that must compete with bigger-market teams like the Yankees and Red Sox. The Athletics are not unsuccessful, but they can't quite win it all. When three of their big stars leave via free agency one off season, Beane decides to replace them with players who are not only affordable but who can offer, in composite, more return than the departing trio. Beane's reasoning is that in order to win, a team must score runs. To score runs, a player must get on base. Getting on base is the single most important part of winning. So while other teams make use of players who can hit home runs and steal bases (and pay said players countless millions), Oakland goes after players who can simply get on base.<br/><br/>That this is anathema to the Way the Game Is Played would be an understatement. No one's really paid attention to the more obscure statistics, like OBP (on-base percentage), because who cares? Give me 40 home runs and a 120 RBI, and we'll win. Well, Oakland can't afford that guy, so how about three guys who combined make less than that guy but get on base more often. That's more practical.<br/><br/>Beane is assisted by virtually no one. His manager, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffmann) despises Beane's attempts to manipulate the batting order to his liking. His scouts are all stuck in the mud of 1932 and refuse to change. Even the players are a little skeptical. But Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, also nominated for an Oscar), gets it. A true stats nerd – he majored in economics at Yale – Brand understands the weaknesses and strengths better than any general manager, field manager, or player ever could, because he's crunched the numbers and has data to back up his assertions.<br/><br/>Pitt and Hill are both amazing and have excellent on-screen chemistry. That's not a sentence I figured I'd ever type. Hill isn't playing just some nebbish who cowers in front of Beane or a player; he's his own man, just a little withdrawn and seemingly out of his element. Both actors take great pains to involve the audience in their stories; otherwise, this would be just a movie about pencil-necked geeks playing simulated games on a computer and expecting the real world to do the same.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 2002 and is based on fact, but even so I won't spoil the ending for you now. But I will note this much for sure: Beane's overall philosophy has been adapted to such a wide extent over the past decade that Oakland now must find a new angle to exploit that the bigger teams haven't yet found. The very idea that there are more important stats than the typical power numbers turns baseball upside down, shakes it hard, and collects the loose change. To use a cliché, this was a teachable moment for baseball executives across America, and although it took a while for many to catch on, catch on they did.<br/><br/>Even if one removed the many baseball scenes, the movie would still work. It's honest, true to itself, and doesn't digress into meaningless side plots, like forced romance or witty banter. But the baseball action, the result of Beane's work behind the scenes, sells it completely."

","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>Going into ""Moneyball"", it was moreso dependent on my absolute Aaron Sorkin fetish and a quite intrigue in digesting all the Oscar-buzzing films I could possibly take in. I was never a fan of Pitt. Don't get me wrong, the guy has the chops, but he never astounded me before. Well... now he has. In this 2011 baseball extravaganza, Pitt gives it his all and Sorkin knocks this one out of the park (pun-intended), with his incredible script. But let's not have director Miller's thunder stolen away with this very competently directed picture.<br/><br/>The story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.<br/><br/>Solely looking at the premise, I merely just copied and pasted, seeing as how I couldn't summarize it better than if I tried. Anyway, what's interesting for this review is that I've never been drawn to sports. Being a heterosexual male, you'd probably revoke my penis card, but in all honesty, I really haven't, especially baseball. But you know what? With the way the story was presented, I actually was indulged in the premise. That and having some spectacular performances didn't hurt either.<br/><br/>The cinematography is just the icing on the cake. The scenes in this film are just beautifully shot and all around are an enhancement to an already solid movie. However, this isn't the movie I expect to either get an Oscar or create an earth-shattering hoopla. The film does take awhile to get the ball rolling and the resolution isn't entirely all that satisfactory, but what we have for the bulk of the movie is good.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Moneyball"" is not entirely what I expected it to be. Coming from a non-sports addict, it impressed me in more ways than most films of this genre did. That truly says something about the performers, the director, and the writer(s). This movie isn't going to be the best of the year or break records, but so what? In a time of lackluster sport movies and clichéd barrels of boredom, ""Moneyball"" is a nice exception."

The presentation of this movie is a traditional approach, but that was probably the best way to go. The true story it tells of is inspiring. Who wouldn't be inspired by the story of the Oakland A's, who defied the logic of baseball, and utilized unconventional methods to lead them on a string of back to back victories.<br/><br/>The script is very funny, heartfelt, brimming with snappy dialogue, and filled with good characters. Brad Pitt is aces as Oakland A's manager Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill refreshingly plays against type as Peter Brand.

","Since I have an interest in the sport of baseball, and I hear that ""Moneyball"" is one of the best movies of 2011, I obviously had to check out this movie! I know it may be difficult to make a movie about a baseball team that never made the big game, but the way this movie was made proved that the theory is wrong. From the super well acting to the incredible writing, ""Moneyball"" is one of 2011's best films. Based on a popular novel of the same name, ""Moneyball"" follows the true story of the Oakland Athletics baseball team during the 2002 season, and general manager Billy Beane, portrayed brilliantly by Brad Pitt, makes attempts to assemble a more competitive team. With the help of a GM college graduate, portrayed by Jonah Hill, Billy Beane must hit the numbers and face with the most unfavorable financial situation, to take a sophisticated approach towards analyzing players, which all leads to making an American League record. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Billy Beane, and I hope he gets total Oscar consideration for his work in the film. I enjoyed the way Pitt brought Billy Beane to the screen, and he steals the whole movie easily. Jonah Hill, who has just lost a lot of weight, delivers some fine sequences as the GM Yale economics graduate Peter Brand, and there may be a good chance for some Oscar buzz. Philip Seymour Hoffman also delivers excellent work playing the Athletics' manager, Art Howe. But I just wished that this guy should have received more screen time. Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, and Stan Chervin writes one of the best, well-written scripts ever put on paper. They deliver sharp dialogue, smart characters, and perfect writing material. Director Bennett Miller knows how to make a baseball movie that focuses more on the characters. I was just distracted on the many moments that make this movie so fun to watch. There are scenes that show impressive flashbacks of Billy Beane as a child baseball star, and the moments with him and his daughter are touching. The characters are sharp and memorable, the script is super well-written, and the whole movie is just super fun to watch. This movie also has some light-hearted laughs, and some heartwarming moments. I honestly hope that this movie gets nominated for a few Oscars. ""Moneyball"" is a well-written, well-acted, and well-directed biographical sports drama that really stole my attention from beginning to end. I love this movie so much, and this is one of the best of 2011. ""Moneyball"", in my review, ""a well-written underdog baseball story""."

","Pleasant enough, this film works well as Pitt brilliantly portrays Oakland A's GM Billy Beane in his ongoing futile quest to put together a championship baseball team despite having a lower tier budget to work from. Realizing he can't afford Jason (Mekka Lekka Hi-Mekka Hiney Ho) Giambi or Johnny Damon, Beane turns to a naive but portly young Yale grad, Peter Brand, ably played by Jonah Hill, to pick players for him. Brand's unconventional method is based on fancy-schmancy computer modeling which predicts that bargain basement has-beens like Scott Hatteburg can be effective ballplayers based on their willingness to reach base by walking often or taking-one-for-the-team. The whole madcap situation worsens as Beane's scouting staff and head coach refuse to get on board. (BTW - DO check out Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of A's manager Art Howee in a patented Don Zimmeresque ""manager's cut"" uniform!) Beane's many managerial worries are compounded by haunting memories of his own failed major league career and his young daughter's unexplained yet prodigious ability to sing and play pop songs on her guitar that will neither be written nor become popular for at least 6 years in the future. This film is well worth watching for any baseball/mythical time-travel fanatic.... Loved it!"

","This is based upon a true story.<br/><br/>As General Manager for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Billy Beane (Pitt) decides to revamp the game of baseball using statistics to select players. The stats are provided by Peter Brand (Hill), a numbers cruncher, Billy hires away from the Cleveland Indians.<br/><br/>This gives us a pretty good view of how baseballs' General Managers operate and what they have to deal with. In this case Billy has to deal with more than most since he and Peter go against baseball lore, wisdom, history, scouts' analysis, long time baseball men and, of course, his manager on the field, Art Howe (Seymour Hoffman). And, the way things start out, these new ideas don't have the fans on board either.<br/><br/>I did expect this to be more emotional as you would find in most true sports stories. I was hoping that it would not change me from the team I sometimes root for to be a Oakland Athletics fan. <br/><br/>The pacing, dialogues, and good acting by all held me and I didn't need the Kleenex tissues by my side that are mandatory for watching true stories. You just know you are going to need them. But not this time. Although, I almost reached for the box during one of the last scenes when Billy was driving aimlessly (he does that) and listening to his daughter singing a song for him on the CD. I thought: here it comes as he has a big decision to make.<br/><br/>This is a very good baseball story, but I don't see any Oscars for anyone in here. However, I am sure Brad Pitt will be nominated anyway. He is a terrific actor.<br/><br/>There is a statement at the end of the movie that says when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series two years later they used a statistical system similar to Billy's.

"MikeyB1793","7","0","1","13 January 2012"," Winning on the Cheap
","This is a fun movie provided you like sports and/or baseball – and a basic knowledge of baseball will add to the enjoyment. Its' more about the management and business side, than about the game – buts its' also about winning and how to win – in this case on a spartan budget. Baseball is more of a statistical game than others – there are numbers all over the place – innings, strikeouts, walks, hitting averages, on- base averages <br/><br/>So it starts with general manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) getting a ""Google-boy"" (played by Jonah Hill) to give him masses of statistics on players from other teams with the all-important dollar value (current player salary) in one of the columns. Using the data from these spreadsheets, along with the significant dollar column, Billy Beane wheels and deals. A dream team is built on the cheap.<br/><br/>It's all pleasurable and funny with tantrums, business meetings with old baseball codgers eyeing Google-boy most suspiciously, and the recruitment and abrupt dismissal of players. I felt Philip Seymour Hoffman under-used (but did he ever look like a baseball coach!!) There was even some syrupy stuff of Billy and his daughter which kind of worked – this was probably tossed in to distract away from the predominant male element in this film.<br/><br/>For a 2 hour plus movie Moneyball plays well and entertains."

","As a huge baseball fan, I enjoyed Moneyball very much. I even found it more interesting because it is a part of baseball history that I not only was alive for, but actually remember happening. Moneyball is the story of Billy Beane who was General Manager (and still is) of the Oakland A's in early 2000. The A's at the time had a very small payroll and Beane had to some how come up with a winning team with no money. I'm a Texas Rangers fan and since the A's are in the same division as the Rangers, I saw several of these games and remember some of the players. I even remember the 20 game win streak as it happened. Brad Pitt is a very likable Beane and Jonah Hill plays the man who developed the formula that Beane used to select his players. I can easily see this movie picking up some Oscar noms/wins for 2011. This is a must see for any sports fan!! Co-staring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Art Howe, A's manager.<br/><br/>To read more movie reviews by Reel and Unscripted check out www.reelandunscripted.com"

","MONEYBALL is gathering a lot of acclaim as an Oscar potential contender on several levels, so much so that for those who have little interest in baseball in general have overcome that inertia and have watched this film primarily out of devotion to the work of Brad Pitt. For this viewer the film is long on tedium, lacking in excitement and character involvement and focusing on the financial background of a sport that is supposed to be for the pleasure of the public. Yes, there are moments of interest in the concept of building a team based on saving money by hiring players who by statistics realized on a computer program show potential for building a solid team (as opposed to scouting for popular 'names' with the public and the media). These moments are underlined by the strong performance of Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the Yale Economics graduate who comes up with 'the concept'.<br/><br/>The story is based on Michal Lewis' book 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' and adapted for the screen by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. Bennett Miller directs. The story is basically a docudrama about the Oakland Athletic's General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the loss of the best payers of his team to scouts from other clubs with bigger dollars.

The rest of the film is a push pull game played in the boardroom, with the manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and with certain players (Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop et al). Tossed in for some reality testing is Billy's daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey), ex-wife (Robin Wright), and a few encounters with reappearing people.<br/><br/>The idea for the film is solid but it wears thin because it is so insular to Oakland. The fact that it is a true story (with a less than satisfying ending) probably will attract some viewers. It certainly is not Brad Pitt's best role to date, not does the film seem that it will have much holding power. But, if you are a fan of baseball it just may ring your chimes. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

He doesn't have to cry, he doesn't have to express any extreme feeling. He just needs to act a little crazy and a little angry from time to time, make women take a deep breath, and that's it.

","With the hype surrounding Brad Pitt's newest offering, I took it upon myself to venture down to the cinema to take in ""Moneyball"". What drew me in wasn't the story - I know very little about baseball - but a cast including the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonah Hill in a serious dramatic role. It had a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) is desperate to have his team make it to the top when young Peter Brand (Hill) offers an innovative system of hiring (and firing) members of the team based on their individual skill instead of overall talent. Beane sees something that could re-define the game and implements his and Brand's idea, to the chagrin of the A's manager Art Howe (Hoffman) and the rest of the scouting team.<br/><br/>""Moneyball"" is the second outing by who I considered to be one of the very best in the business, Bennett Miller. Miller gave us Philip Seymour Hoffman's finest (so far) performance in a similar historical film, Capote, which also looks at a flawed man and how his actions affected history. But that's where the similarities end. ""Moneyball"" is a ploddy, angsty look at something that could really make an amazing film. Ultimately, it falls flat.<br/><br/>All too often, I would catch myself interested in the upholstery of my chair or the size of the screen instead of what the characters were talking about on screen. It's rare that the film offers any analysis of why certain members of Beane's team were good. Instead, the audience is just told that they're good. That's that. I bet I would have loved this film if I knew who the ball players Pitt and Hill spend so much time talking about were. There's no explanation. I'm just expected to know who was a great player on the Oakland A's that particular year.<br/><br/>I'm giving Bennett Miller's film five stars because of exactly that: Bennett Miller. I could tell that he was genuinely interested in Capote, but for most of Moneyball I was wondering if I was more interested than he or Pitt or any of the others were. The strongest performance comes from Jonah Hill, who effectively plays a very boring person. I belived that he was boring enough to come up with this system, and boring enough to not really care how everything turned out. Hoffman sleepwalks through a ten minute performance and about one line for every scene he's in.<br/><br/>One very bright spot: Arliss Howard plays the manager of the Boston Red Sox and has a brilliant scene with Brad Pitt at the press box of Fenway Park. Howard effortlessly plays a very small role with unparallel grace. One of my rewarded starts is solely his.<br/><br/>You're reading a review coming from someone who doesn't actively follow baseball, but likes a good sports film. I didn't find Moneyball to be a bad sports film, yet I can't say it kept my interest long enough to prevent me from dozing off by the seventh inning."

Bennet Miller , director of Oscar nominated ""Capote"" has done a full justice to a very motivational story of a man who silenced his detractors after facing lot of criticism. The script was handled very efficiently along with a powerful performance by Brad Pitt. His acting has grown over the years and this we can observe from the choice of films he is doing. He emotes everything through his eyes and expression itself makes this film worth a watch. This is first time Jonah Hill has taken a serious role and he was very impressive as in the supporting role. Philip Seymour was just about OK in a small role. An actor of his caliber could have been given more meatier role. The cinematography was outright with soothing background score.

","To some Moneyball may seem dry and boring. It's essentially a sports film with very little of its subject sport. Instead it focuses on numbers and statistics, and how sometimes these can be a good substitute for huge pay cheques. I have no real interest in any sport from any part of the world, but I do love me a good sports movie. Moneyball is about Billy Beane, a man that works as a general manager to one of the lesser baseball teams. He is looking for that all important last win of the season, and has his own demons having been told he was going to be the next big thing when he was younger. This didn't exactly pan out, as the scouts failed to question whether his skills would battle against his confidence in the big leagues. These sections are told in brief flashbacks and give us a great insight into the character. They are not completely necessary, but they allow us to see why such a man isn't as motivated by money. Peter Brand comes in and explains that using complex maths, a cheaper team could indeed stand up against the bigger teams. It's a great underdog story, where every player is an underdog as well as the whole team. It shows us the importance of taking a risk, and how sometimes breaking conventions is the only way you might have a chance. Moneyball also works by not being all about success. The successes come with the failures, resulting in a well rounded and thoughtful film. Hill gives his best performance so far, and Pitt further cements himself as a great actor.

","I tend to watch the films about sports with some reluctance, because that is not a subject I am interested in, and as a consequence, I do not know many things about it. So, if a film deepens too much into the rules or History of some sport, it is more difficult for me to ""plunge"" myself into its narrative. And that is exactly what I was afraid of before watching Moneyball, not only because it deals with baseball (a sport I do not know practically anything about), but also because it is focused on its coldest and most inaccessible part: the statistics, the negotiations and the insides of the management of a professional team. To my surprise, the film ended up being very entertaining, perfectly accessible and even emotive.<br/><br/>The subject Moneyball deals with might sound dry, but co-screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian expertly combined the intellectual aspect from the story with the emotions of the classic sport story, in which a ""loser"" is ready to face unimaginable obstacles in order to reach the triumph...or at least trying it. The fact that the story is developed in meeting rooms, locker rooms and offices does not make it less interesting, even though director Bennett Miller certainly knew how to offer us some tense moments during decisive baseball matches.<br/><br/>However, there are a few moments in Moneyball which feel a bit longer than they should during the very beginning. Nevertheless, the movie improves when Jonah Hill comes into scene, and his excellent chemistry with Brad Pitt takes the control of the narrative. Pitt himself brings a sincere and detailed performance, avoiding unnecessary sentimentality, but credibly expressing emotion whenever it is necessary. Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as the pragmatic trainer Art Howe, while Kerris Dorsey brings an adequate performance as the main character's daughter and Chris Pratt is quite funny in his role.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I do not think Moneyball is a great movie, but I surprisingly liked it pretty much. My favorite film about baseball keeps being A League of Their Own, but that does not avoid me from recommending Moneyball as a very competent sports drama, which is well written, solidly acted and presents the adequate balance of suspense, emotion and drama in order to leave us satisfied."
"Miles-10","8","0","1","7 November 2011"," Moneyball review
","This is a story about pioneers changing old patterns of business-as-usual, but Brad Pitt's affecting portrayal of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane gives this movie its heart. It opens in 2002 as the team is losing a championship game to a team with three times more money. The New York team has simply hired more of the best players, which Oakland can't afford to do. Billy sees that unless the team tries something different, they are going to lose again next year; yet his scout/advisers almost absent-mindedly to go back to the same failed practice of hiring the second-rate players that the team can afford, while expecting there to be a different outcome. Their ""intuition"" amounts to arguing over whether a player has any confidence based on whether or not he has an attractive girlfriend.<br/><br/>Billy's innovative solution turns out to be common sense, but he doesn't know what it is to begin with; rather he feels his way toward it gradually. The first step is to see the problem, but the next step is to see if anyone else sees it, too. How can they jointly solve a problem if only he can see it? Billy asks his scouts to articulate the team's problem and is frustrated when none of them can put it into words; but the problem is simple: the team doesn't have the money to hire the superstar players who invariably beat the Athletics. Billy sees this, but he does not know how to fix it until he goes to Cleveland to trade players; there he notices that their manager is listening to the whispers of a little nebbish named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), who turns out to be a brilliant player analyst. Peter's insight is that there are many players in baseball who are under-valued for what are often silly reasons. For example, one pitcher has a peculiar way of throwing the ball, and all of the scouts tell Billy he should be rejected because he looks ridiculous, but Peter points out that this pitcher nevertheless has a decent record. Because prejudice against such odd players is widespread, they can be picked up for a song, and a team made up of similarly under-rated players, Peter thinks, could be a winning team.<br/><br/>After banking on Peter's approach, Billy faces another problem. Coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) doesn't understand what Billy and Peter are trying to do, so he keeps playing the players he thinks are best. The team loses game after game. Ironically, the soundtrack presents excerpts from a sports radio call-in show where host and fans agree that the team's poor showing is the fault of Billy and that Art Howe is doing the best he can. Finally, Billy figures out a clever if risky way to outfox Art so that he has no choice but to send in the lineup that Billy and Peter have chosen. After that, the team's fortunes improve dramatically, but when they lose another season-ending championship game, no one remembers how much they have improved over the previous year. Billy is denounced by the experts: ""You can't reinvent baseball"", one of them intones authoritatively.<br/><br/>The final development in the story proves that the ""money"" in ""Moneyball"" has nothing to do with greed. Billy seems almost to surprise himself when he turns down a multi-million-dollar contract with an East Coast team owner who recognizes what Billy is trying to do. The owner wants him to do the same for the Boston Red Sox, but Billy knows that what he really cares about are his daughter and his work with the As, and both are in California.<br/><br/>Pitt makes us care about Billy's quest not just to win but to achieve personal fulfillment. His performance communicates the depth of his character's passion for his job and his family. Billy not only has a work ethic but a genius for recognizing a problem and its solution. He also has the humility to realize that he needs someone with the technical expertise to help him, and the friendship that develops between Billy's former jock and Peter's Ivy League nerd is tender and genuine. Through most of the film, these two are the only ones who believe in themselves and each other, and they back each other when no one else stands with them.<br/><br/>As I watched, I kept having the impression that Pitt is channeling Robert Redford, but I am not convinced that this is intentional. Perhaps it is just something that is happening to him as he enters middle age. (One could hardly age more gracefully than that.)"

","""Moneyball"" is a smart, solid, moving film. It's about baseball and it's about life. I'm not much of a baseball fan, but I really enjoyed this film. The film succeeds on both levels. It gives you a close-up look at baseball, both on the field and behind the scenes, a look that feels very real, but it also gives you baseball as a metaphor for bigger life issues: faith, delusion, winning, losing, sacrifice, devotion. I cared about Billie Beane, the main character, and in his struggles I saw my own. Overall, ""Moneyball"" is one of the best baseball movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>A man, Billie Beane (Brad Pitt), decides that he and his partner, a Yale mathematician and baseball fan, have a way of putting a baseball team together that will cost less money and result in more wins. Beane's method defies conventional wisdom. If he's right, powerful people will lose money, status, and jobs. They don't want him to be right, and, in any case, they think he's both nuts and obnoxious. The owner of the Oakland Athletics gives Beane the power to test out his theories on his team, but coach Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) doesn't want to comply. Hoffman makes Howe out to be an obnoxious butt blister, a depiction that Howe has protested. As ""Moneyball"" tells the story, as long as Howe resists Beane's ideas, the Athletics lose. Beane resorts to cutthroat tactics to get his ideas on the field. Once he succeeds in establishing his dominance over Howe, things change.<br/><br/>In Beane's fanatical devotion to his method, in the giant and costly risks he took, I saw not just a story about baseball, but a very moving journey about innovation and dedication. Especially moving and convincing was a scene when Beane's ideas seemed to be working well and people seemed to be coming around to his side. He didn't join in with others in the frivolity of champagne showers. Rather, he was as grim, as focused, as he'd been throughout the rest of the film. His dedication was not just to winning games, but to changing the way the game is played.<br/><br/>This is the first time I can remember caring about a Brad Pitt character in a movie. I cared about lesser characters, as well, including hapless first baseman Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) and a player who learns, from Beane, that his career is through.<br/><br/>Beane's ex-wife (Robin Wright) and daughter (Kerris Dorsey) are on screen briefly, but their scenes were extraordinarily touching. They weren't cloying, forced or artificial, as are too many distaff scenes in baseball movies."

","MONEYBALL <br/><br/>(a film review by Mark R. Leeper)<br/><br/>CAPSULE: Brad Pitt plays the general manager of the <br/><br/>cash-strapped Oakland As who ignores his scouts and <br/><br/>turns to the recommendations of an inexperienced <br/><br/>statistician to hire a winning team. In spite of <br/><br/>strong opposition the statistical approach proves to <br/><br/>be a phenomenal success for the team. Jonah Hill <br/><br/>plays the odd mathematician and Philip Seymour Hoffman <br/><br/>is very good as an uncooperative manager with fears of <br/><br/>his own. Bennett Miller of CAPOTE direct Steven <br/><br/>Zaillian's and Aaron Sorkin's adaptation of Michael <br/><br/>Lewis's book MONEYBALL: THE ART OF WINNING AN UNFAIR <br/><br/>GAME. There are lots of films about baseball and only <br/><br/>a handful of films about mathematics--even fewer showing <br/><br/>mathematics in a favorable light. It is surprising to <br/><br/>get such an entertaining film that combines both. <br/><br/>Rating: low +2 (-4 to +4) or 7/10<br/><br/>Our world is awash in numbers. We collect and can have available all kinds of statistics. What is difficult is collecting and understanding all the numbers, learning lessons from them, and then deciding if the lessons can be trusted. I read a review of the book SUPER CRUNCHERS by Ian Ayers. It told how Orley Ashenfelter used a statistical approach called regression analysis to predict the quality of certain wines. He determined that he could collect three numbers: average growing season temperature, winter rainfall, and harvest rainfall, and from them simply generating a number that would be expected quality of wines. There are wine experts who use very subjective approaches and a great deal of experience to predict wine quality. They laughed at Ashenfelter's simplistic approach. But a simple mathematical formula turned out to be a better predictor than trusted experts with years of experience at predicting wine quality.<br/><br/>If that story sounds oddly familiar, it is almost exactly what happened when Billy Beane, General Manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team realized he did not have the budget to hire new and promising players or even to hold on to the better players whom he already had. Instead he hired Paul DePodesta who was a Harvard graduate who applied statistics to hiring a team. In MONEYBALL Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) hires Yale graduate Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill with a name change from DePodesta) to pick unrecognized candidates. And the story of MONEYBALL is very much like what played out with the wine predictions.<br/><br/>The scouts were paid well for their gut reactions of who would and would not be good players for the team to hire. They criticize the new statistical approach to selecting new players. And initially that approach does not work at all. The problem, however, is not in the statistics but in the lack of faith in the mathematics by the manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman, who unexpectedly seems like he was made for the grouchy role). The statistical approach to baseball (elsewhere the approach has been named ""sabermetrics"") makes everyone feel a little insecure, and they resist it. When Beane seems more interested in Brand's assessment than that of his scouts, one can see why they are insecure. But even Hoffman's Howe finds his career riding on Beane and Brand's radical ideas. And what happens is the story of MONEYBALL.<br/><br/>One arguably bad touch is the use of relatively short and stocky Jonah Hill for the statistician. Apparently director Bennett Miller was exploiting a stereotype of what the public expected a statistician would look like. In fact, the real Paul DePodesta resembles Guy Pearce and is quite unlike Jonah Hill. Admittedly Pitt and Hill do play reasonably well off each other as opposites, but the pairing is cinema, not reality. There is some drama to Hill's portrayal of a man who loves a game that he is clearly not physically suited to play. Unlikely as it seems the man still manages through mathematical skills to make himself an important figure in baseball history. It is nice to see Robin Wright in a small role as Beane's ex-wife. Pitt gives a solid performance. Miller seems to have a natural directing style if a little uneven at times. He will occasionally have realistic overlapping dialog, but does not use it uniformly.<br/><br/>MONEYBALL is a true story about a cash-strapped baseball team that was able to intelligently become a winning team on limited resources. Maybe that makes it a perfect film for these times of failing economy. I rate MONEYBALL a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale or 7/10."

","I didn't know what to expect when walking into the theater to watch Moneyball. I had some idea but I wasn't sure if this film was going to express a contemporary route or follow the overly used dramatic plot device that all inspiring sports films utilize. <br/><br/>To divulge, Sports have generally taken a common route in the film industry. I mostly refer to the examples of The Mighty Ducks Series, Remember the Titans, Cool Runnings, Coach Carter, Rocky, Miracle, etc. I don't consider films such as the Sandlot or the Bad News Bears to be in the category of inspiring sports films since their main drive for the film is comedy and not the sport itself (Maybe a little of the Sandlot as it portrays America's early romanticism of the sport) These films are always about the underdog who develop a strong work ethic under grand leadership and embody the principles of teamwork with sprinkles of motivational speeches. With hard work, you can achieve greatness. That was the encompassing message that left the audience with these ominous thoughts. Often times, I thought to myself if these films were meant to serve the greater purpose of portraying the ""American Dream"". There is nothing wrong with these films, in fact, I very much enjoy them both as a child and as an adult, but they have been severely over used and entirely predictable. Often times, the story digresses so far from the actual events that ""Based on a True Story"" is visibly clear of its true purpose of functioning as a marketing ploy. <br/><br/>When it comes to Moneyball, all conventions go out the window. This film goes so deep to the ""base"" of baseball, ""Based on a True Story"" becomes an understatement. Moneyball lies somewhere closer to The Social Network rather than Coach Carter. Witnessing the sport through the eyes of a data analyst and the general manager changes your perception of baseball. As a result, the film makes you understand how Billy Beane has truly changed the game. Moneyball portrays the sport purely as a business rather than with the nostalgic romanticism we Americans associate with baseball. Seeing every play and every player as products and business transactions makes Moneyball in an entirely different category of its own. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is subtly shocking for those who are remotely interested in the sport and pleases the expectations for baseball enthusiasts who want a movie that REALLY talks about baseball. My reluctance in offering it the full 10 out of 10 is its exclusiveness in audience direction. Baseball is not as widely understood as it used to be and I feel as though the film could've have taken a more broad encompassing approach to the topic. The social network was able to grab the audience in whatever direction it took because Facebook was so widely understood way before the film's debut. Everyone had a common ground. Moneyball fails to establish that."

","""Moneyball"" is a pretty interesting take on how to win at the game of baseball. And it's enjoyable and relevant because it's based on the true story of real life Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane and how he turned around the team with the help of an Ivy league graduate computer whiz Peter Brand, plus it was based on a book by Michael Lewis. Aside from that it's thoughtful showing the inner workings of brain trust of how to manage players and the under worked deals of putting together a winning baseball team. Plus the film has realism by showing actual baseball footage so the viewer can feel he's watching the big leagues.<br/><br/>Also the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is top notch Pitt is to be believed as the stressed out and rugged go against the grain Beane who clearly takes a different approach to winning. As he proves instead of heavy spending to build a team he seeks the help of a computer educated analysis director in Peter Brand(Jonah Hill joys it up). And while watching you see the feel of an underdog developing as Billy wants to win as he remembers his failure when he didn't develop into a big league star. The film is drawn showing the viewer some intrigue and drama yet just like the big baseball climax it wins in the end. It's a good feel to see winning can be done a different way, this film did indeed hit a home run."

Having now seen it, I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Billy Beane's application of baseball metrics I had long believed in and then experiencing success with it was a vindication of the way I looked at baseball (often to the derision of my other baseball fan friends). As such, this is an engrossing and compelling story to me. I remember well the details and actual people involved. Given all that, it could still have been done poorly but, happily, it was not.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is compelling as Beane and Jonah Hill is a scene stealer as Peter Brand, the nerdy statistics analyst who serves as Beane's inspiration to try something different and then his right hand man. Some of the peripherals of the story (Beane's personal life, for instance) could have been tightened up but serve to chronicle the pressure on Beane from all sides as his new approach fails miserably at first.<br/><br/>The movie kept me interested throughout and told a story I already knew in a compelling way, at least to me who knew the background.

Billy Beane is a failed major-leaguer who becomes General Manager of the Oakland As, a team whose budget is in the basement and whose best players have been stolen by better teams. Billy challenges orthodox scouting policy, and hires an economist who gathers stats to put together a team of under-achievers, based on their statistical potential. <br/><br/>More than a sports movie, this is a film that illustrates how loyalty and desperation result in a leap of faith to change the lives of the players, management, and the entire city of Oakland.

","(This film is based on the true-life book of the same name by Michael Lewis.)<br/><br/>Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland A's, is wrestling with trying to put together a winning baseball team when his budget is the lowest of any major league team. Whenever his team does well, the more affluent teams hire away all his best players. How to win?--or even survive?<br/><br/>Beane (Brad Pitt) turns to the work of Bill James, who invented a variety of new statistical ways ('sabermetrics') for evaluating major league baseball players and what it takes to win ball games. <br/><br/>Billy finds a statistical nerd & baseball addict, Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a recent Yale economics graduate, who understands how to apply Sabermetrics to identify and hopefully acquire those low cost players who would be the biggest help to the team's winning. Billy makes Brand his team's assistant GM and risks everything, daring to walk a plank -- either leading to an abyss or across a bridge to success.<br/><br/>In part, the film shows the conflict between the old, time honored style of largely intuitive evaluations by baseball scouts and coaches versus this use of strange, new, statistical evaluations. <br/><br/>In recent media interviews, baseball insiders say this film really captures the feel and scenes inside club houses, BB meetings, negotiations, etc. But it also has touching, human elements (e.g., between Beane and his daughter). <br/><br/>The book/film, based on true events, is only slightly prettified. <br/><br/>(Quite a bit more about James & Sabermetrics is described in Wikipedia; search it for: ""Will James Sabermetrics"".

"classicalsteve","9","0","3","25 September 2011"," Uncoventional Wisdom Challenges Baseball Establishment -- Pitt's Outstanding Performance Almost Made Me an A's Fan
","In most fields, particularly those which have been around for 100 years or more, the so-called ""conventional wisdom"" often dominates decision-making in business. And yet over and over again, business wants to adhere to conventional wisdom, until it's debunked when someone brilliant comes along and demonstrates different approaches to the ""tried and true"". These conventions are often misconceptions usually based on faulty logic and/or faulty information. ""Moneyball"" starring Brad Pitt is largely about challenging the conventional wisdom and ultimately the status quo of Major League Baseball, a sport with an approximate 170-year history.<br/><br/>In Major League Baseball, the conventional wisdom has been that big stars with big salaries make winning teams. Billie Beane (Brad Pitt in an Oscar-caliber performance), a little known GM of the Oakland Athletics, challenged that convention and made winning teams with a much smaller budget and no big star players, or at least former stars in the latter part of their careers. Most of his players were undervalued performers who would play for far less money than the big superstars. Moneyball, based on the book by Michael Lewis, chronicles Beane's new unconventional approach.<br/><br/>For help, he solicits a young economics wizard Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who has been using techniques to analyze players at a much deeper level. Instead of scouting players in the usual way, by simply watching them at ball parks either at the high school or college level, Brand would look at all their statistics. Not just batting averages, but on-base percentage, runs scored, and even how well they do against other players. They also derive how many runs total the team will need to score in the course of a season to enter the playoffs, and they figure out how many base runners they will need to accomplish this goal. <br/><br/>The use of statistics to tell larger unseen stories was begun by baseball statistician innovator Bill James, which he calls Sabermetrics. Sabermetrics looks much deeper into players' performance in terms of their contribution to the team as a whole, rather than just looking at speed, batting average and on-field errors. The system also analyzes how well a team's offense bats as a whole, called base runs, not just team batting average. Before James, traditional scouting often relied on simply watching players in action a few times and determining speed and build, and even such things that have nothing to do with the game, such as how attractive they were as well their girlfriends!<br/><br/>Beane and Brand take these theories of using much deeper statistics to the management and their scouts to assemble a roster of undervalued talent and misfits at a fraction of the price of teams like the NY Yankees. At first there is much resistance in upper management and also then A's manager Art Howe. According to the film, Howe is resistant to play the players in the way they were designed. And the team suffers, losing many games. Commentators and even the A's' owners begin questioning Beane's methods. For example, Scott Hatteberg was recruited because of his high on-base percentage, but had been a catcher with the Red Sox who lost his throwing ability due to injury. Most scouts believed his career was over. But Beane and Brand believe he could contribute to the A's. Only, Hatteberg would have to play first base, but Howe was reluctant to play him. In a daring move, Beane trades their rookie first baseman and other players mid-season, forcing Howe to play Hatteberg at first base. Then, all of a sudden, something magical happens.<br/><br/>This is truly an inspiring film about a true-to-life baseball story. I have been an SF Giants fan all my life, but this film almost made me an A's fan. The SF Giants finally achieved a World Series win in 2010, also with a bunch of misfits and undervalued players. The Red Sox finally overcame the Bambino Curse with a World Series win 2004. I have to believe both the Red Sox and the Giants used Beane's methods to assemble unlikely teams of undervalued players to achieve success. Even though the A's and Beane did not quite win world series rings, they may have fundamentally changed the game which only about a half dozen people can claim in the history of baseball. It's one thing to make a great contribution as a player. It is even more significant to change how major league teams operate. Beane may have made the most significant contribution to professional baseball since Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson and broke the color barrier in 1946. It doesn't get much better than that."

Had I known it was about Baseball, I probably would have waited to see it on DVD, as my knowledge about the sport is practically zero. I wouldn't confess that I know more about the sport now, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Moneyball may be based in the realms of American Baseball, but the movie goes well beyond that. On a meta note, the movie captures the notion of ""success"" and ""failure"" that society brands on individuals. In fact, if you have ever questioned what success means, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does a fantastic job as the GM of the team. He gets into the role remarkably well, and very soon his glamorous personality is forgotten as he molds into the life of an overworked, under-appreciated team manager who is dealing with his own demons while trying to achieve success for his team.<br/><br/>The movie has its funny moments when Jonah Hill, who plays the assistant GM, lights up the screen with his intellect, wit, and innocence. His performance is critical to the film and helps lighten the mood.<br/><br/>On the whole, it is a great movie, which leaves one in a good mood, and makes one holistically reflect on things that are important in life."

","Take my review of Moneyball with a grain of salt. Its two-and-a-quarter-hour running time probably rivals the aggregate amount of professional baseball I've watched over the past three years – which is to say, not much. I'm not the target audience for any sports flick, but a great cast delivering an Aaron Sorkin script put me in the seats. On that level, Moneyball delivers.<br/><br/>Sorkin has a knack for finding the humanity in black and white statistics. It's in part what made his telling of Facebook's success story (last year's brilliant, brainy The Social Network) so remarkable. A fitting – if inferior – follow-up, Moneyball is as much about business as it is about baseball. In fact, the thesis of author Michael Lewis, upon whose book Sorkin and co- writer Steven Zaillian sculpted the screenplay, is that victory on the field can be reduced to mere mathematics.<br/><br/>Enter Brad Pitt as Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane. After being creamed in the playoffs, many of his star players pick up contracts with teams with deeper pockets. The truth as Beane puts it is that baseball is a fundamentally unfair game. Affluent teams can afford the best players, and subsequently win the most games and the most championships. But rather than accept the status quo, Beane hires Yale grad Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), and cooks up a way to build a team around underrated but undesirable players, like a pitcher with unorthodox form and a ex-star pushing 40.<br/><br/>""We're card counters now,"" Beane explains to his mystified staff. Moneyball plays almost like a heist – and cheating any flawed system is exhilarating to watch. The problems stem from elsewhere; the movie drags in its second half, lacking the concise narrative momentum of fiction. It's a problem from which many biopics suffer, and though Sorkin fares better than most, he doesn't have a David Fincher behind the lens this time around.<br/><br/>Granted, director Bennett Miller is no slouch, having made his Oscar-nominated Hollywood debut with Capote in 2005. With Moneyball, Miller faithfully photographs Sorkin and Zaillian's script, but never elevates it. Pitt and Hill are empathetic underdogs, and their performances convey admirable depth. Still, even in their best moments, it's hard not to wish that more weren't going on on screen.<br/><br/>Moneyball also gets bogged down by superfluous subplots like flashbacks to Beane's fizzled pro baseball career and his relationship with his twelve-year-old daughter. The sequences give insight into the inner workings of the character's mind, but seldom feel relevant to the main thrust of the plot. Especially when they beget a string of false endings that has the audience on the edge of their seats in the worst sense of the term.<br/><br/>Those scenes don't sink Moneyball, but they somewhat stifle its potential for greatness. The fascinating premise, that computers can pick winners better than we can, is partially buried under content far less novel. I've seen enough strained father/daughter relationships, thanks. The film would likewise run thinner and healthier without Beane's trips down memory lane.<br/><br/>But it still works. Probably the best indication of the film's merit is that it appeals to viewers with no vested interest in the sport. At its finest, Moneyball is about the deconstruction of baseball romanticism, with a straightforward exchange of ideas that feels almost documentary at times. Surprisingly enough, it's the conventional storytelling devices that feel sluggish, unexciting, and repetitive. Not the baseball."

","Most films about the Great American Pastime feature the game itself (""Eight Men Out,"" ""Major League""), the drama behind it (""The Natural,"" ""The Rookie"") or some ethereal experience that uses baseball as a metaphor for life (""Field Of Dreams"").<br/><br/>The newest motion picture based on this premise is one of the first to deal with the business aspect of the game. ""Moneyball,"" directed by Bennett Miller (""Capote""), written by Aaron Sorkin (""Social Network"") and Steve Zaillian (""Schindler's List,"" Gangs Of New York"") and based on the book by Bill James, does to ball stat fans what ""Apollo 13"" did to NASA engineers - makes them super cool.<br/><br/>Beginning in 2001, after the Oakland Athletics amazing choke job against the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series, General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) sees the writing on the wall - the days of doling out millions upon millions of dollars to high-priced free agents is killing baseball.<br/><br/>Meeting the less charming but equally stat-driven Peter Brand (Jonah Hill, ""Get Him To the Greek""), Beane now has to face an angry A's staff (losing superstars Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon to free agency), fans and 100 years of baseball tradition.<br/><br/>Why? Because Moneyball, the concept, uses a series of intricate statistics to determine the most important aspect of the game - scoring runs. Plus, a small market club like Oakland has to worry about just meeting payroll, so Beane and Brand have their work cut out for them, trying to rebuild a more efficient team within the constraints of a limited budget.<br/><br/>Furs fly and hackles are raised when Beane goes up against coaches, trainers, scouts, clubhouse personnel, and especially Athletics manager Art Howe (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Oscar winner for ""Capote""). Howe, usually very quiet and mild-mannered (I actually met him several times during inter-league games in San Diego), is completely against the philosophy of using stats to win games.<br/><br/>As an old school baseball man, when he sees a bad fielder or a player past his prime or an unorthodox pitcher, he sees failure. Beane and Brand, however, see an opportunity for runs, which means wins in the moneyball system.<br/><br/>At first, during the 2002 season, it appears as if this concept is a complete and utter failure. The A's slip comfortably into last place and Beane's head is definitely on the chopping block. Howe doe not help the situation, though, keeping key players out of the lineup who might actually make the system work.<br/><br/>Fed up, Beane makes several trades which force Howe to use the moneyball athletes and - lo and behold - the squad turns around and goes on an incredible winning steak that threatens to break the all-time AL record.<br/><br/>Most of the film's later drama revolves around this action. Can Oakland do what the Yankees, Red Sox, Indians and Tigers could not accomplish? Will moneyball succeed or fail as a viable baseball strategy? Will the players and coaches ever come around - even if the owners and GMs fall in line? <br/><br/>These questions are more than adequately answered in this fine film. A bit long in the tooth - especially when dealing with the frankly uninteresting parts of Beane's family life, but overall a most interesting look at an idea based upon the nerdiness of Sabre statisticians and math geeks invading the beloved game of baseball.<br/><br/>Already the Oscar buzz is loud for this one. Expect Pitt's low-key effort (of the even lower-key Beane) to snag a lead nomination, while Hoffman and (quite possibly) Hill just might score Best Support Actor nods. <br/><br/>Perhaps a little too much retrospect and not quite enough on-field action for my tastes, but ""Moneyball"" delivers in the clutch and makes a sometimes dull game sparkle and crackle with excitement."
