"Cowman","Null","712","948","2 May 2004"," CITIZEN KANE may let some people down, but it's still worth seeing.
","It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE.  Not because it's ""too old"" or ""too boring"", but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made.  And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant.  From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.<br/><br/>CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple.  Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp.  As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on.  And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense.  To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.<br/><br/>But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations.  Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time."

","Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble.  It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories.  The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized.  At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains.  Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.<br/><br/>As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity.  Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death.  The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently  destructive of human values.  Kane himself states `If I hadn't been born rich I  might have been a really great man.<br/><br/>What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity.  We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed.  At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people.  This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore).  Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.<br/><br/>Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man.  This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar.  Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time.  He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.<br/><br/>Unconstrained by Hollywood's traditions, he broke all the rules.  The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations.  A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another.  Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth.  The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb.  Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does.  And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.<br/><br/>So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.<br/><br/>Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made.  Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film.  When that didn't work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film's criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target.  Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.<br/><br/>It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane.  It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.<br/><br/>Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz's efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music.  Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist's dreams, obsessions and fears.  Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century"
"elleglw","10","235","318","31 August 2006"," why did Citizen Kane create such an impact upon its first release?
","Well as a media student myself , i have come across this question many times in books and during lectures. There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.<br/><br/>2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:<br/><br/>KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.<br/><br/>-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.<br/><br/>3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.<br/><br/>There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece ."

","I have an observation concerning Rosebud (and I don't mean that story about Marion Davies). Everyone seems to assume that Kane saying ""Rosebud"" means he was thinking of the one time in his life when he was totally happy and had what he wanted. For years I have also assumed that. The other day something occurred to me and I am curious to know if it has occurred to anyone else.<br/><br/>When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the ""love nest"" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!<br/><br/>So maybe when Kane says ""Rosebud"" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why ""Rosebud"" is the last word he speaks.<br/><br/>But if this is true (and it seems quite logical to me) then why does no one else comment upon it? Why has no one spotted it? Or has someone I just don't know it? Or could it be that this is the kind of truth that no one wants to face? That all of our lives are determined more by blind, idiot accident than by design or purpose."

","OK look, let me settle something between those who love and hate this film. A lot of people hail this film because it is technically brilliant and ground breaking. Director Orson Welles did a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before. Nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie. This movie also had a great impact in its time. The title character was based on media giant William Randolph Hearst. He was that generations Donald Trump. He opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded. Lastly this film contains some of the strongest and most common themes in literature; Life versus death. It is for these reasons why this film is so revered.<br/><br/>On the contrary people who hate this film mainly complain that it is boring. Which is a legitimate complaint. The story is slow compared to today's standards, and there is no real Hearst character alive today in which to relate. So yes, the story on the surface is outdated. However, this does not make it a bad movie. It was not made as a Matrix/Star Wars type of movie which can be enjoyed even at surface level. This is not pure entertainment. Remember there is more to film than storytelling. This film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption. There is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on Hearst, one just needs to look deeper. Look at Shakespeare or Hawthorne for example, their literary works are universally loved. Yet, many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes. Just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today's world.<br/><br/>My advice to those who did not like it the first time or have not seen it yet is simple. Watch it again for what it is. Do not expect to be on the edge of your seat for two hours. Watch it for the cinematography that alone makes this film among the best (I don't agree with AFI's number one ranking but I think it still ranks high). Look deeper into the story and try to connect with it on some level. At the very least appreciate how influential this film was and where the industry would be without it. If you can do this, then maybe some of the naysayers will change their minds. Again, you do not have to love Citizen Kane, but at least respect it for what it is."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","160","237","21 October 2004"," A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling
","I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10"
"WriterDave","8","39","55","5 May 2008"," All That Ballyhoo!
","On the Criterion Collection DVD of Orson Welles' classic ""Citizen Kane"" there is an original theatrical trailer where Welles cleverly advertises the film by introducing us to the cast including the chorus girls, whom he refers to as some nice ballyhoo. That pretty much sums up my opinion of the often over analyzed film that always shows up at the top of the list of greatest films ever made. Even though this was the first time I sat down to watch the film as a whole, I knew everything about it from studying it in film class and from the countless number of essays, homages, and parodies that have come down the pike over the years. It seems impossible now to judge the film against a blank slate, but with great ballyhoo comes great scrutiny.<br/><br/>Released in 1941 by RKO as a Mercury Theater Production, ""Citizen Kane"" is the tale of an influential and shockingly wealthy newspaper tycoon (Welles) inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst. The story follows the investigation into the origins of ""Rosebud""-the mysterious word Kane utters on his deathbed. Following newsreel footage announcing Kane's death, we are then thrust into a series of flashbacks through interviews with various people who knew Kane that reveal the nature of his character.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Welles' film is as innovative and engrossing today as it was yesterday. Every single piece of cinematic trickery, every dissolve, every long tracking shot, every seamless edit, every play with chronology, every special effect is perfect. Welles was audacious and inventive with his art, and it is for these technical aspects that ""Citizen Kane"" will always stand the test of time.<br/><br/>However, the story of ""Citizen Kane"" remains cold and distant. I didn't instantly connect with the characters and the plot the way I did with other classics from the period like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Third Man"" or even more recently, ""There Will Be Blood."" Often, the supporting players over-act, and the flashbacks are tedious (especially the one detailing Kane's second marriage) or emotionless (like the scene showing Kane's snow covered childhood). There's a certain smug arrogance to the whole production that makes it seem like perhaps Welles was secretly making a comedy. It leaves one wondering how it would've come across had Welles actually been allowed to do a straight up biopic of Hearst.<br/><br/>Is it any wonder that so many critics today hail this as THE all time great? Much of today's cinema is geared towards style and technique over substance, and way back in 1941, Welles was the first to author this very modern brand of cinema where the art is not in the story but how it is told and shown to the audience. His ""Citizen Kane"" is technically rich, layered, and enthralling but narratively vapid. Did I ever really care about Kane or Rosebud? No, but it was fascinating to watch. It's some very nice ballyhoo indeed."

","Yes, this title is a classic and we can all agree that it has been critically acclaimed by many to be a masterpiece. This movie pops up in so many lists of the greatest movies of all time that watching it at least once in your lifetime becomes a must. So I prepared myself for at the least a good movie. Is it a good movie? Well, yes and no.<br/><br/>See, it depends on why you are watching movies in the first place and where you derive pleasure from. For me watching movies is a way of entertainment and enjoyment, I want to have fun, I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to think, I want to be engaged, I want to guess what is going to happen, I want characters that I can relate to and be attached to. Now all those things don't mean that I want MINDLESS fun,I do prefer intelligent plot with great characters and development but I want the movie to incorporate entertainment value as well. Citizen Kane was a character study, it was like an assignment for my university where I had to critically evaluate the title to get a good grade.<br/><br/>Yes, cinematography was amazing and to think it was a movie from 1941 it is just jaw dropping. Yes, the character of Kane was complex and it was a good character study. Yes, the symbolic nature of ""Rosebud"" and what it represents was brilliantly done, especially when we see that Kane's romantic life with his women was screwed up. But all those things are meaningless to me when I don't enjoy the movie and I am ready to die from boredom. I literally forced myself to not fall asleep, all the time I was thinking ""There must be something wrong with me, this is the greatest film of all time. Get your sh*t together, wake up and pay attention. This is awesome, right?"". At some points I even thought that I must be stupid for not liking this film, but if people choose to name me stupid I don't care, at least I am honest with my feelings. What matters is that I consider myself to be fairly intelligent and I didn't see the appeal of this movie unless you are watching this for critical purposes.<br/><br/>Now why this movie is in the top 250 and is considered a classic? That's probably because of the technical aspects of the movie and in this sense it might be a masterpiece, but I just can't see people enjoying this so much to have it so highly rated because of the entertainment factor."
"ilpohirvonen","10","48","71","31 October 2015"," Why Is ""Citizen Kane"" the Best Film of All Times?
","Anyone who sees ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it ""for what it is,"" so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: ""it was okay."" This will not do. It is a great tragedy if ""Citizen Kane"" suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" or Beethoven's ""9th Symphony"". In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why ""Citizen Kane"" necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and ""Citizen Kane""?<br/><br/>One might begin with the basic fact that ""Citizen Kane"" wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds"", and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, ""Citizen Kane"" was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that ""everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'."" Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?<br/><br/>First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of ""Citizen Kane"" is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in ""Citizen Kane"". The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- ""Rosebud"" -- by interviewing people who knew the man. ""It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing,"" he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' ""Oedipus Rex"" as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of ""Citizen Kane"" lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. <br/><br/>Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of ""Citizen Kane"" and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. ""Citizen Kane"" is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.<br/><br/>More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of ""Citizen Kane"" are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, ""Citizen Kane"" remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions."

","Citizen Kane is probably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, nigh perfect from the start till the end. Often competing with The Godfather, to be numero uno, Citizen Kane is in a league of its own and nonpareil on countless number of fronts. The creative innovation and the technical advancements implemented, can be least regarded as incredible and astonishing, for a 1941 movie. The movie pioneered the phenomena of time switching and special effects in the world of cinema.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and source of inspiration to the film-makers of different era. Citizen Kane is an obituary about a fictitious Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate and a newspaper tycoon. Through this movie, Orson Welles, not only immortalized Charles Foster Kane but also proved his mettle, as a writer, director, actor and most importantly as an auteur. The scenes presented as flashbacks, not only display his versatility as an actor (taking care of the nuances and the subtleties needed to portray the different stages and aspects of Kane's life), but also his story-telling brilliance. Kane's murmuring of the word 'rosebud' at the time of his death and him publicly annihilating his election opponent, Jim Getys, represent the two extremes of human life, the very low and the very high, respectively.<br/><br/>The scenes between Welles and Joseph Cotton are an absolute treat to watch, the latter being at his sarcastic best, depicting contrasting emotions of sympathy and disgust towards his childhood friend, owing to the dichotomy that he suffered, simultaneously taking care of his duties as a journalist, and his friendship with Kane. The movie is studded with numerous mesmerizing and unforgettable scenes and moments, which immensely contribute to the apotheosis that it so deservedly enjoys. A true cinematic magnum opus, without an iota of a doubt and a must for every cinema lover."

","If ever there was a film that I had a love-hate relationship with, ""Citizen Kane"" is surely it. Some of the non-script elements are as good as what one would find in any other film. Yet, the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an early twentieth century newspaper tycoon is terribly dated and painfully boring.<br/><br/>The film's B&W cinematography is arguably the best in film history. DP Gregg Toland uses high-contrast lighting and murky shadows to create a wonderfully noir look and feel. And in some scenes bright back-lighting puts foreground characters in stark silhouette, creating an authoritarian and oppressive tone to the story. This is true especially in the film's first thirty minutes. Throughout the film, frame compositions are clever and interesting, like one scene in the second half wherein a woman, with her back to the camera, blares out an operatic aria on stage to an audience that we viewers cannot see, amid murky, shadowy lighting; it's like something from a nightmare.<br/><br/>And the film's visuals are laced with strange optical illusions, as a result of Welles' use of deep focus camera techniques. In one scene, for example, background windows appear normal in size relative to characters in the foreground. But when a character walks back to the windows, we see that the windows are actually much larger and higher than first appeared, and that renders the character small, by comparison. The same optical effects show up in the Great Hall of Xanadu, with a fireplace that appears average in size, until a character walks back to it; at which point the fireplace is seen in its true size; it's so big and high as to overwhelm the human figure.<br/><br/>Sound effects amplify these optical effects. For example, in the Great Hall, the cavernous, mostly empty, room strongly echoes human sounds, creating the impression of some huge, dark cave. The whole feel is one of oppression and death. Just terrific.<br/><br/>But the film's story, about a corpulent newspaper tycoon, is so dated as to be largely irrelevant in the twenty first century. Kane starts out with noble intent to help the lower classes. But over time he changes. And throughout, he is egotistical, overbearing, bombastic, loud, and generally too full of himself. His only real belief is in himself. He is fond of possessions, but is emotionally empty. In addition to an unlikeable protagonist, the script's dialogue is very talky.<br/><br/>The film's acting is generally quite good. I particularly liked the performances of Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, and Agnes Moorehead. Special effects are good too and, when combined with lots of stock footage, create the visual illusion of a cinematic epic.<br/><br/>Some viewers love this film; others loathe it. I love the cinematography and sound effects, but loathe the story. ""Citizen Kane"" should have won several Oscars, including especially cinematography. That it did not has caused Hollywood endless guilt, and to compensate, they routinely vote the film as ""the number one greatest film in history"".<br/><br/>But it does not deserve that lofty title. Hollywood needs to give the film several postmortem, but well deserved, Oscars, especially for B&W cinematography. Then, they need to let go of the guilt."

","Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.<br/><br/>Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively (which Welles does very convincingly) over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth, power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.<br/><br/>Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma- we never do get a full-bodied portrait of the man, only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they ""knew him"". In the newsreel, a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline, a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist- a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or, indeed, being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the on-screen reporters, just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud', or something he himself is not aware of? <br/><br/>Kane is never truly sympathetic, yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him (""If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man""), then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence, and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone (""I am Charles Foster Kane!"") yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness (""I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely""). Kane is ultimately indefinable; a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.<br/><br/>Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed, corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah, who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander, a thinly veiled take on Hearst's real-life mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success (For Davies this was dramatic roles in films; her talent lay in comedy). Distinguished actors Moorehead, Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.<br/><br/>One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay, one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she ""never gets any fun"" because they ""live in a castle"". The visual portrait is fascinating, with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess, complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge, yet empty, room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here, the sum adds up to perfect- direction, acting, writing, photography and music.<br/><br/>The imposing, haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA (filmed the previous year) in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's half-finished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character- grandiose, larger than life, powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled."

You fall asleep.<br/><br/>Surprised, you think, 'It must be me, maybe I'm tired,' so a month later, you try again. But you don't even get as far as before, and wake up drooling out the corner of your mouth as a bloated Orson Welles, with really bad age make-up, groans 'Rosebud, Rosebud'. <br/><br/>It doesn't make sense. You're perplexed. You've watched other films on the lists... Casablanca made you stand up and cheer, cry, laugh, feel connected to all humanity. You even adore films on the list that some might consider oblique, like 8 1/2, which you reckon reinvented cinema language, weaving in and out of memory, dreams, psyche, reality, putting the human spirit up on the screen, making you cheer, laugh, and feel connected to all humanity. <br/><br/>So why does CK leave you so cold? You wonder, 'What's wrong with me? Am I stupid or something?'<br/><br/>Your borrowed DVD copy gathers dust (notice how the lender never asks for it back?), taunting your unquiet mind: ""You must watch me: I'm the greatest film of all time!"" But you shudder at the thought. Life's too short and, after all, there's more engaging things to do - like scraping plaque off the dog's teeth.<br/><br/>Years pass.

So you gird your loins and sit - awake! - through the whole thing. The whole turgid, ponderous, dull, vacuous, plodding, dank catastrophe. It's even worse than you feared. An emotionally and intellectually empty story. Your average six year old can invent a more complex, engaging tale.<br/><br/>Genuinely puzzled, you ask people who name it as one of the greatest films of all time why they like it, and with barely concealed superiority that phoneys are wont to adopt, they wax lyrical talk about the haunting mystery of the final words, ""Rosebud, rosebud"". You notice there's no feeling behind what they say. They also talk a great deal about Gregg Toland's cinematography, with liberal references to ""deep focus"", and you appreciate this, you really do, the cinematography was damned fine, best thing about the movie. That shot which started outside the window then tracked back into the room was really cool. But you just don't believe a movie is made great by cinematography alone. <br/><br/>In all your inquiries, you never once hear the following phrase, spoken from the heart: ""God, I love that film"".<br/><br/>So here you find yourself, reading IMDb comments.<br/><br/>Well, let me tell you this: There's Nothing Wrong With You!

Then ensues a series of interviews with the key people in Kane's life, each of whom relates the man's story as he or she knew it... <br/><br/>The portrait that eventually emerges is one of a grasping, vain, selfish, and ambitious man... ""He never gave you anything,"" an old friend recalls bitterly, ""he just left you a tip."" In the film's final moments, workmen in Kane's palace are seen destroying unwanted junk One of the items they toss into the furnace is a child's sled; as it burns, the word ""Rosebud"" can be seen painted on it<br/><br/>The story of Charles Foster Kane is engrossing but not particularly profound The movie is a superb piece of film-making, nonetheless, because the techniques employed, although not necessarily new, had never before been used together to such startling effect Welles and Toland made brilliant use of deep-focus photography and of an arsenal of lighting effects <br/><br/>In the course of the film, flashbulbs pop, spotlights play, the sun's rays pour down into darkened rooms, beams of light are emitted by a movie projector, lightning flashes, and smoke, fog shadows, rain, and snow all contribute to the almost tangible atmosphere Quick, dramatic cuts occur throughout In one famous sequence, Welles employs six fast scenes to portray the disintegration of Kane's first marriage: each shot shows Kane and his wife at the breakfast table, but in each they are clearly more estranged until, in the final shot, they sit in silence as she reads a rival newspaper<br/><br/>Toland's constantly moving camera is somewhat obtrusive, but it is nevertheless mesmerizing In the famous sequence at the opera housethe occasion of the second Mrs. Kane's disastrous debutthe camera shows the anguished vocal coach in the conductor's box and then moves upward to the flies, where one stagehand expresses his critical opinion of the performance by holding his nose Welles' use of sound, ranging from thunder to a cockatoo's screech, reflects his experience in radio<br/><br/>There had never been a picture like ""Citizen Kane."" It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, ""Citizen Kane"" electrified a complacent industry Welles dominated Kane He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941"
"meggs212","Null","141","251","17 November 2003"," an example of a unique and well done movie
","The movie Citizen Kane was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. The movie begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane, who was the editor of the New York Journal.  He says the name rosebud and drops a crystal ball, which falls to the ground a shatters.  News clips are shown about the different occurrences in Kane's life depicting how Kane acquired his fortune.  Throughout the whole movie reporters are trying to figure out what the word rosebud meant and why it was the last word he said before he died.  The reporters find people who knew Kane throughout his life trying to get information from them that would put some sense to Kane saying `rosebud' as his last word.  Many of the stories told by the people interviewed show the audience a lot about his life through flashbacks. One of the opening scenes is that of Kane's mansion called Xanadu.  It has a sign that says `no trespassing' that is hung from the outside gate.  The shot is very dark and gloomy, hinting that maybe Kane's life was the same way.  He was a very power-hungry man that went from being at the top to rock bottom.  Many other movies have definitely taken note to style and effects of this movie.  The camera work, lighting, acting a music contributed to making Citizen Kane one of the best American movies of all time.  Orson Welles deserves all the credit that he receives from this movie.  He was the leading character, producer and director; basically a one man show that still many of us appreciate.  I thought that this movie was well done.  It had so much symbolism that made the movie unique, although if you didn't know what was symbolic during the different scenes it would be hard to follow, but most of the symbolism is easily recognized.  One of the best symbolic scenes that also foreshadows is when Kane is at the top of the stairs and he is told that he lost his position and as he walks down the stairs the camera is shooting from at the top and it looks like a spiral showing that Kane's life and career are out of control.  Citizen Kane was very dramatic and all who took part in the movie played their roles well.  The characters seemed very real and believable making this movie very memorable.  This film has features that every movie should try to incorporate; symbolism, great actors, interesting storyline, excellent camera shots, lighting and sound techniques.  I think everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time because it is one of the greatest American movies of all time."
"Tobias_R","10","33","52","16 August 2006"," The Role of Sheer Chance in Life
","One commentator made the original point that Kane may have uttered ""Rosebud"" as his dying word not because he was nostalgic about his childhood but rather as a symbol of sheer chance in affecting and changing his life. As the commentator pointed out, Kane would never have met Susan Alexander, his mistress and later his second wife, if he hadn't been at a warehouse looking over things from his childhood home. If Kane hadn't met Susan, his life would have turned out quite differently. Indeed, if one looks carefully at the childhood scenes of Kane's life, one would see little that Kane, as an adult, would be nostalgic about. There are strong suggestions his father beat him and that, however caring about Kane's welfare his mother was, she seemed emotionally cold and distant. Indeed, Kane's association of his sled Rosebed with the role of chance in his life would be reinforced by the fact that he was interrupted playing on Rosebud and told by his mother and Mr. Thatcher about the radically different turn his life was taking from that of a poor boy to a quite wealthy one really overnight. Indeed, by subtly showing the decisive role of chance in Kane's life, the filmmakers were undermining the powerful American myth of the self-made man. Hard work didn't make Kane's fortune, it was the result of his mother inheriting the title to a mine thought to be worthless but wasn't."

","More movie review lists have awarded ""Citizen Kane"" the honor of being the best film ever made than any other film whatsoever..Deservedly so!! Why?... The superb character portrayals... Charles Foster Kane (based on William Randolph Hearst) was a character which sparked a lot of controversy in the movie industry back in 1941!! This film did not even win best picture that year, that award was given to ""How Green was My Valley"". Reluctance to allow a film like ""Citizen Kane"" to be released, evoked a formidable indication that people had a perception of the silver screen as the purveyor of the stilted panacea which provided glossy entertainment for the movie audience!! The ugly depiction of abhorrent human nature that ""Citizen Kane"" so succinctly illustrated, left a scar on the manufactured illusions of movies during this era!! So many film's entertainment agenda during the '30's and '40's were fortified by high budget fantasy!! These illusions orchestrated a premise of escapism that the moviegoers grew accustomed to!! (Wizard of Oz is a stellar example)...Nevertheless, ""Citizen Kane"" hit the big screen, and from there, received unprecedented critical acclaim!!<br/><br/>What was the attraction?.... Charles Foster Kane was a neglected and irascible man who concocted a myriad of avoidable vulnerabilities in his life. His childhood became a pitfall of doom and despair which left an indelible mark on him!! His empathy for the working class people inevitably translated to his perception of them as chattel, and that he must be the ameliorated recipient of their gratitude!! His fame and fortune was predicated on the idea that the banal proletariat be relegated to the pathetic plight of a marketable commodity!! So many concepts were avant-gard in this movie, this is why they were widely unacceptable!! Concepts such as: The life of a corporate mogul being the culprit to making Charles Foster Kane fall prey to vanity and social entitlement!! He became a victim of megalomania, this was his ultimate downfall!! The dark human emotions and vindictiveness of politicians seeking election and/or re-election manifested themselves through very authentic reactions from the characters in this film!! The perennial egocentric demeanor which afflicted Charles Foster Kane throughout the entire movie, signified a pejorative compassion which was totally self centered!!!<br/><br/>The character portrayal of Charles Foster Kane by Orson Wells was outstanding..Genuine feelings that were related to selfishness and avarice in this movie simply astounded me!! People have to consider the year this movie was made (1941) to fully appreciate the ideas which were thrown out at the movie audience!! No matter how reprehensible Charles Foster Kane was, he was also NEWS!!! This will always be the way of the world!! This newspaper king wound up being utterly thwarted by a form of convoluted justice!!! Leaving a largess of artwork behind, merely pointed out to everyone that his priorities purported a horrid arrogance!! The onus was on the movie audience to get acquainted with the despicable aspects of negative emotional qualities that Charles Foster Kane masqueraded around like coveted trophies!! Ultimately, his childhood put a lethal spin on his adverse reactions to everything, and played a significant role in this movie!! I strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in movies, that they see this film!! ""Godfather"" ""Shawshank Redemption"" ""Lord of the Rings"" (Fellowship of the Ring) and ""Gold Rush"" have all been selected as the greatest movie ever made by one critic's list or another, but, not nearly as often as ""Citizen Kane"" though!!! ""Citizen Kane"" is an absolutely remarkable movie!!"

","Citizen Kane, the film, is many things.  It is a brilliantly crafted series of flashbacks and remembrances.  It is an engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world.  It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers.  It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom.  Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema.  There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece.  The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud.  The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life.<br/><br/>From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life.  From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically.  Citizen Kane, undeniably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created."

","Some of my generation have pegged Citizen Kane as boring and out-dated. Perhaps it is like Crime and Punishment or some equally long and laborious book: it is important, revolutionary, but not thrilling if you aren't completely into that kind of thing.  However, as an American I thought it my duty to watch Citizen Kane, which is considered a ""timeless classic."" Incidentally, Kane is Number One on the AFI Top 100 list--bu the best movie of all time did not even receive the Oscar that year!!!  This certainly exemplifies the differences in opinion here. I enjoyed this movie because of its tragic nature: Kane's sad fall from grace and innocence, brought on by the lust for power and wealth.  At one point, Kane says, "" yes, I bought many...things.""  And he sounds regretful. I suddenly realized we do buy so many things that do NOT bring us the happiness we anticipated.  Kane lacks the one thing he cannot buy-love, and ultimately no one can survive without it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most famous scene in all of cinematic history, the closing shot of the Rosebud sled is at once the saddest and most riveting I believe I've seen.  In that moment we see how that young boy in the snow, ripped from his parents, succombed to corruption and greed, and died as alone as he felt when taken from his parents."

Sensing that there's a story behind Kane's dying word, a magazine editor shows a reporter a newsreel obituary that chronicles how Kane created a business empire, married a U.S. President's niece, ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York, divorced his first wife and married a second, collected art, built a fabulous estate called Xanadu, and divorced his second wife. The reporter is then assigned the task of ferreting out the significance of ""Rosebud."" As the reporter's investigation progresses, fascinating details about Kane emerge.<br/><br/>My opinion: <br/><br/>Citizen kane is maybe for a lot of people (myselve not included) not a real entertaining movie, But there is no doubt about it that aws one of the most important movies ever made.<br/><br/>The visual style of ""Citizen Kane"" looks stunningly fresh and inventive even today, and the unconventional narrative structure of the Oscar-winning screenplay still seems daring. Welles' portrayal of a character who gradually ages from 25 to old age is unexcelled, and the movie's supporting cast, most of whom had worked previously with Welles on stage and radio productions, is superb.

The B&W cinematography, and the nostalgic, almost haunting feel to the lighting and the ""deep focus"" camera-work draws you in to the outstanding visuals. The visuals! From the opening shots of Kane's storybook like castle (no reavealing anything about that here!) to the crane shots over the bar in the rain, the movie is a stimulating and detailed picture to watch. Not only that, but the story is rich and detailed, and structured beautifully, with Orson Welles playing the title role as a recently deceased newspaper tycoon, a la William Randolph Hearst. A powerful and both loved and hated public figure, a young reporter is sent with the task of finding the meaning of his last words, and in turn takes a journey through flashbacks and meetings with various people connected with the gigantic tyrant. You leave the story as confused and as haunted as you come in, but it doesn't matter. The acting, visuals, and timeless story draws you in and leaves you with a film classic that is not easily forgotten. Highly influential and an American classic, ""Citizen Kane"" is an outstanding drama any real movie buff will appreciate."
"b_havag","7","76","135","2 February 2009"," Why?
","Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.<br/><br/>But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other ""greatnesses"" actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being ""great"".<br/><br/>You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.<br/><br/>But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.<br/><br/>And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic ""not entertaining"" I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: ""Citizen Kane is a total bore!"" To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.<br/><br/>So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why ""the greatest movie ever made"" fails for me. 3/10"

","I rented this movie almost accidentally on the route back from shooting pool, without any preconceptions of what it was about, although I was very aware it had been dubbed ""the greatest film ever"" by many.<br/><br/>Basically, the film asks a highly abstract question of whether we can reconstruct a puzzle from a set of available pieces: are the pieces independent or can there be a piece which fundamentally affects the reconstruction? It also presents a very specific example of how this kind of projection applies to human psychology: can there be a single event or item, a ""rosebud"", such that a man's life cannot be wholly understood without it? We all project our persona every day to our fellow human beings, but no one else really knows what's running in our minds as we lay in bed in the evening: the portions of our minds with no trespassing.<br/><br/>I especially like how this theme is shown on so many levels at once. At the bottom, the reporter is trying to reconstruct Kane's life by anecdotal evidence; Kane's readers are trying to reconstruct the world state by Kane's newspaper; and finally, we the viewers are trying to reconstruct the meaning of the film by watching it. The film was based on the media mogul William Randolph Hearst, whose persona the writers first shattered to pieces and then reconstructed to form Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>An interesting add to the interpretation (forgot the name of the critic behind it) is that the whole movie is imagination, or self-inspection, by Kane himself in seek of his rosebud. In this case, the unseen Thompson could be seen as Kane himself, trying to find his lost childhood innocence from the inner depths of his mind."

","MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest American films ever made. Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget, actors, script, and more.<br/><br/>He plays Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words ""Rosebud."" So the film starts off by searching for what ""rosebud"" really means. We see countless relations of Kane interviewed. None of them know what ""rosebud"" really means. But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life, and eventually the mystery unfolds itself.<br/><br/>Like Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru,"" ""Citizen Kane"" is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness. Kurosawa claims he never saw ""Citizen Kane"" before making his film, but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" has, perhaps, some of the best makeup ever seen on film. A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something, overweight man. (And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life.) <br/><br/>I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert, who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in ""Citizen Kane"" than in the ""Star Wars"" films.Though subtle, I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film. They're so flawless it's hard to even notice.<br/><br/>Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are, which creates a feeling of paranoia. All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time.<br/><br/>And if you want symbolism, this film is for you. As Kane hands over his empire in one scene, he walks over to a window, which to the naked eye looks normal-sized. But as Kane nears the window, guess what? Turns out the window is very, very high. It makes Kane look small. Think about it. He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth. It's all very symbolic.<br/><br/>I recommend picking up the DVD; it also contains a two-hour documentary called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" plus many, many more tidbits, including the original theatrical trailer (which is very odd and original).<br/><br/>All in all, ""Citizen Kane"" is a classic of epic proportions. One of the very greatest American films out there."
"majikstl","10","18","28","13 June 2005"," The Distinguished Citizen ...
","There is a telling moment in CITIZEN KANE that quietly reveals a lot about what makes the film great. It is a scene set in the dark days of the Great Depression, where Kane is turning over much of his empire to his arch-nemesis, Thatcher. As they talk, Kane casually walks away from the camera and we suddenly discover that the room the men are in is an illusion. The background wall that looks to be right behind the them is actually twenty or thirty feet away, the window sill isn't at waist height, but actually is over Kane's head. The room is huge and Kane is dwarfed by his surroundings. Kane than walks back toward the camera and perspective again creates an illusionary intimate image.<br/><br/>It is a neat camera trick and KANE is full of neat camera tricks. It discretely plays with our perception of reality, just as the story does. Through out, Charles Foster Kane is at a distance and slightly out of focus and then he is up close and personal; he is larger than life and suddenly small and petty; he is always at the center of the picture, yet concedes the foreground to the various witnesses who tell his story. CITIZEN KANE is a treasure chest of cinematic gadgets and gizmos; yet as deliciously stylized as KANE is, the style meshes perfectly with the content. CITIZEN KANE is a story of illusions and perceptions told through illusions and perceptions. <br/><br/>Before KANE, and for the most part afterward, no film has quite taken hold of the medium of film and done so much with it. Other directors have tried to dazzle us with how cleverly stylish they can make their films, but usually the effect is self-consciously arty: Every rabbit pulled out of a hat is greeted with a drum roll and a fanfare. The beauty of KANE and the reason director Orson Welles remains an artist of awed respect, arise from the casual grace with which he performed his magic tricks. His rabbits are in themselves so fascinating that how he produces them is only of secondary interest. Yet for a film obsessed with stylistic trickery, CITIZEN KANE still manages to be an incredibly personal story.<br/><br/>To say a film is efficient may seem like a backhanded compliment, but part of the wonder of KANE is that it tells so much story and covers so much territory on a B-movie budget. It is an epic created on sound stages and with editorial mosaics. Welles begins his film with a mock newsreel obituary announcing Kane's passing, then basically repeats aspects of that same story several times over from different perspectives, maintaining a vague chronology, but jumping around in time to let us know that there is more to a life than the mere passage of time. Welles tells us who Kane was to the world, then who he was to the people who actually knew him -- suggesting that who we are is defined not by what we have done but by who we have touched. It is one of the most effective and insightful film biographies that was ever made. The fact that it is a biography of a fictional character is totally irrelevant.<br/><br/>The essence of CITIZEN KANE is the fable of the blind men and the elephant. Like the blind men, who, upon examining only a part of the beast, assume that the elephant is a rope (the tail), a tree (a leg), a sword (a tusk), etc., the witnesses to Kane's life see him as a spoiled child, an idealist, a hypocrite, a monster and so on and so forth. All are correct, yet all are wrong, only seeing in Kane what they want to see. We never meet Kane the man, only Kane the illusion, yet we end up with a vague grasp of who he must have been. If CITIZEN KANE offers any universal truth it is that a life -- or a movie -- is more than the sum of the parts.<br/><br/>Even given all the well-deserved praise proffered to Welles as a director, he never seems to get his due as an actor. His embodiment of Charles Foster Kane is, simply put, one of the great screen performances of all time. We remember that KANE saw Welles as a first time director, but it was also his first time on screen professionally and he gives a performance that is both self-assured and subtle, bold and bemused. Taking Kane from his twenties to his sunset years without a false note, giving a performance that combines gentle humor with grandiose theatrics, Welles creates a character of shifting moods and conflicting motives, yet always consistently believable. In later years, Welles perfected his persona of larger-than-life bluster and wounded arrogance, on screen and off, but he never again got a chance to play a character of such complexity and nuance.<br/><br/>KANE's status as ""the greatest film ever made"" is always being challenged, defended and debated, yet it is remarkable how seldom the film itself is imitated. Despite being given this perfect blueprint for how to film a biography, it is rare that any film attempts to break free of the this-happened-that-happened style of storytelling. It is as if the legendary stature of the film intimidates others.<br/><br/>Hitchcock once said that film is life with all the dull parts edited out. Welles adheres to this and goes one better: CITIZEN KANE is all highlights and underlined passages, a Cliff Notes biography of sorts. Does this allow us to get to know the real Charles Foster Kane? Well, yes, and no. We are allowed to solve the mystery of ""Rosebud,"" but Kane the man remains just out of our reach. We never really meet Charles Foster Kane, only his shadows. Welles and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz give us pieces of a puzzle, but the pieces are not all from the same puzzle."

","Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) is easily the most beautiful movie I've ever seen for so many reasons. It is visually stunning, the composition is amazing. I loved the focus techniques of a wide range of depth of field and the massive sets the most. It's a gorgeous film to look at but it also tells a great story.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane lived an incredible life and the most important and significant thing in his whole world was tragically destroyed. Kane lived a successful life, he made a great fortune out of the poor lifestyle he was born into. Hidden deep behind the fame and fortune of Kane's life was a sad man who never found true happiness. The only thing that ever mattered to him in his entire life was tosses aside and burned without a second glance. The last scene was so painful, and as a viewer I felt so helpless for Kane. The writing was great, I loved that it made me feel so strongly.<br/><br/>The camera work was wonderful in this film, a different way of focusing was introduced. In certain scenes the foreground, middleground and background were all in perfect focus. In other scenes everything would be in focus but the middleground. Unusual camera views were also used that had not been seen much before. Extreme high and low shots were often used, seeming disorienting to the viewer.<br/><br/>I believe this film will continue to blow away viewers of any age no matter how old the movie gets. The cinematography is so beautiful, even by today's standards, which makes Citizen Kane timeless."

","It's important for all people to explore the world and pursue their dreams and goals for themselves. It's important for people to be happy with their lives and not force people to help them become successful. Money, greed, and selfishness don't bring happiness to someone that was forced to get into a career at an early age or of any age at all. It's important for a person to enjoy their childhood while looking ahead towards a brighter, happy future.<br/><br/>The actor's portrayal of Kane and his colleagues was shown very well throughout the film. The juxtaposition of the flashbacks and the present time research of Kane's life were used well and made the plot flow through fast and easy for the viewers to understand what was happening in the film. The news reel and the voice narration of providing the back story of Kane's life and death was effective to set up the main idea that the viewers are going to see and find more information about Kane's life and what the meaning of the last word that Kane said at his deathbed was all about. The use of framing and cinematography was used well throughout the film. The lighting on the back of the actors and the front of the actors was really dramatic, sharp in focus in the depth of field, and kept people guessing what was going on inside their minds and the emotions that they're feeling at the present time as Kane and the reporter are searching for success. In other scenes, the use of lighting was soft and sometimes balanced through the film. The double exposures in some parts of the film were used well.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good film to watch. It has a great moral story that everybody should follow in their lives."

","A friend once remarked that ""Casablanca"" is a much 'warmer' film than ""Citizen Kane."" Upon rewatching 'Kane', I found that is not quite the case. It starts out rather ominously, intentionally so, but once Charles Foster Kane's early adulthood is portrayed there is much humour abounding, both subtle and slapstick, until his (first) marriage begins to cool (as a decade is depicted in a memorable montage sequence over a long dinner table). Thereafter the film's noir shadows complement a descent into a very unpleasant downward spiral until the finale (obviously inspired by ""Rebecca"", produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, only a year earlier; some of that film's opulent interiors are also mirrored in Kane's extravagant settings). Welles must have realised the picture was plummeting into such dark, glamourless territory as to leave the moviegoers with a 'negative' experience that he tacked on an introduction to the Mercury Theatre players at the end of ""Citizen Kane"", backed by a jolly tune utilised in one of the earlier sequences.<br/><br/>Not all of the music is by Bernard Herrmann, as is commonly believed. Two musical segments in the ""News on the March"" sequence were appropriated from the 1939 ""Gunga Din"" film which was scored by Alfred Newman. The first, a pastorale snippet accompanying a quote about Xanadu from Coleridge's (unfinished) poem ""Kubla Khan"", then the trenchant strains while Kane meets with infamous world leaders like Hitler and Mussolini. The first appears in the ""Gunga Din"" scene where Sgt. Cutter (Cary Grant), atop an Indian elephant, halts just before a chasm spanned by a wooden bridge. The second appears in ""Din"" during a scene where the Thuggee cult leader (Eduardo Ciannelli) rants about prior despots, saying, ""Surely Napoleon was the maddest of them all!""<br/><br/>None of Welles' later films comes close to ""Citizen Kane"" which only affirms that this was not a one-man show. A long list of superb collaborators only heightened the quality of this landmark motion picture."
"Perception_de_Ambiguity","10","10","14","20 January 2009"," Why the viewers of Citizen Kane are an essential part of the film
","Famously in the film Citizen Kane the title character Charles Foster Kane dies in his bed, muttering ""Rosebud"" and dropping a snow globe, without anybody other than Kane being visible in the room. Yet the whole film is based on the premise that ""Rosebud"" was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.<br/><br/>The film mostly is told to us (quite literally) from a subjective point of view and through opinions of people who knew Charles Foster Kane. And Kane was a different kind of person depending on who told the story. A main message of the film - so to speak - is that there is no actual picture of a person, there are just many different fragmented pictures of which none are true or false. <br/><br/>In the very first scene of the film we see a sign that says ""No Trespassing"". This sort of makes us the intruders to Xanadu and to Kane's life. The camera goes through his garden around the castle leading into the castle. So in the beginning we, like, become another one of those subjective witnesses who try to get the ""full picture"" and who eventually will form an opinion about this person. And to include the viewer into this bunch of unreliable witnesses and to manifest the concept that we are in the same position as all of those characters who told us THEIR story of Kane's life, the viewer obviously (for now) is the only witness to the first act of 'Citizen Kane' and the last chapter of Kane's life. It is this very event that gets the stone rolling. It makes us a witness and now the investigation of Kane's past life can begin. <br/><br/>Now if you think of the interviewer/reporter who asks the people for Kane's story, we mostly see him from behind with the camera looking over his shoulders. Or he is obscured by shadows, a hat and (observating) glasses. Often he simply is off-screen altogether and we apparently are the interviewees' only listeners. The poor man is pretty much faceless. One could say that the interviewer, who never is fleshed out as a character - if you can even call him a character with an own identity - is taking the position of the viewer who witnessed his last word and who wants to find out what it means. <br/><br/>You could look at it as an inside joke by Welles, that the very premise of the film is based on what initially looks like a goof. He waits until the last interview to tell us that the butler was actually in the room to witness the word, and now the film doesn't need us as witnesses anymore. We are done being witnesses, as now we have created our own individual image of Charles Foster Kane in our mind, based on everything we saw and heard. Maybe soon another viewer will trespass the the barriers of Xanadu, wondering who this man was. And this time he will walk up to us and ask us who Charles Foster Kane was, and we will be glad to tell him."

","Few films in the history of cinema have received as much analysis & acclaim as 'Citizen Kane'. This is most admired film of all times & considered by many thinking men as a best piece of cinema by legendary actor, film maker Orson Welles. It is debut film of Orson Welles as a Director.<br/><br/>America's largest & most powerful landlord of Xanadu & Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Cane died with the last uttered word 'Rosebud' in the very initial scene. Next we see News clips & documentary featuring the power & riches story of his biography including his rise & fall of empire covered by every news agency of the world. Now the million dollar question for the reporters is who or what this last spoken word 'Rosebud' supposed to mean. The flashbacks of Cane's life unfold by the other characters reveals the life story of social & personal ups & down of his life & its really sentimental & realistic portrayal I have ever seen. Welles has told the story of a man increasingly captive of his own needs. Even as the suspense about ""Rosebud"" unfolds in the last scene to the audience, it still remains enigma to figure out what it is. Orson Welles has done remarkable work here in acting & direction & production at the age of 25 & its simply his inborn talent. Its character not only the character of lifetime for him but for the world of cinema to cherish forever. The movie's technical brilliance lies in its landmark B&W cinematography by George Toland with apt use of light & shadow & deep focus photography. One can also notice the powerful lines of dialogues & speech uttered by Cane throughout the film. Most of the principal actors in 'Citizen Cane' were new to the motion picture & yet everyone performed extraordinary especially Joseph Cotten as Jad. The movie is regarded as the ""world's best film by Sight & Sound magazine in the last 40 years (1962-2002). It is quite sad to know that it was flop at box office but gradually became admirable classic as time passed. Nominated for 9 awards at 1942 Academy awards it only won one: Best Original Screenplay. <br/><br/>A Pure Gold.<br/><br/>Ratings- 10/10"
"stefanbe","10","10","14","5 July 2007"," Has a film ever been more praised and loved by film critics than Citizen Kane?
","Has a film ever been more praised and loved by film critics than Citizen Kane? Some people will say The Godfather or Casablanca hold that title, but I think it's Citizen Kane. The praise is certainly deserved, because this is certainly is one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time. Much more fascinating is the fact that it was almost never released and close to be destroyed. Welles had already created controversy with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast that shocked America, but that was nothing compared to what erupt thanks to Citizen Kane. Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst believed that the film painted an unflattering image of him and was determined to bury the film, along with Welles. Due to Hearst's power of the press and radio waves, the film was barely advertised and flopped on its initial release. It would also lose the Best Picture Oscar to John Ford's sentimental How Green Was My Valley (considered by many to be the Academy's biggest mistake ever). Kane would disappear and only after both the careers of Hearst and Welles fell did it start to gain an audience upon numerous re-releases from the 1950's onward. It was praised by critics as a masterpiece and Welles was put alongside Chaplin and Ford as one of cinema's greatest artists. More and more acclaim is given to Citizen Kane each day and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Millionaire tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies one night in his bed at his giant castle, Xanadu with his very last word, ""Rosebud."" A reporter (William Alland) working on a news reel about Kane is soon asked by his boss to investigate the importance of the word. So, he begins to interview previous colleagues of the newspaper runner, which leads to various flashbacks of his life. After his mother becomes rich, she sends Charles away with a bank owner and he soon grows into a prosperous man, who decides that ""it would be fun to run a newspaper."" He gains control of The Inquirer, which soon blossoms into a major enterprise. He soon marries the president's daughter and runs for senator. After that breaks off, he meets a young woman who he wants to become a successful singer, but she is not able to hold a tune. Yet, through all of this, does the reporter ever find out what ""Rosebud"" means?<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has been looked into and analysed by many critics (including one providing a commentary for the DVD) and almost everybody has a different interpretation. I, for one, view it as a story of a man who despite gaining a lot of money, never really became happy and that one word is Kane realising that his death is probably the best thing to have ever happened to him. Kane becomes so insanely wealthy and successful, that he forgets what life is all about, which explains why he just melts away in Xanadu for all the years after his second wife's divorce. Kane may not be the kindest gentleman, but he certainly is fascinating, which is probably what adds to the everlasting appeal of Citizen Kane. Orson Welles set out to tell the story of one man and made a masterpiece and a classic motion picture history. His performance, direction and screenplay are all perfect in every way. His supporting players, which he brought to Hollywood with him from the Mercury Theatre are all impressive as well. Gregg Toland, the cinematographer, also deserves heaps of praise for his brilliant camera work and lighting effects."
"jvincent1","10","10","14","24 June 2007"," What Makes A Film A Masterpiece?
","Is Citizen Kane a masterpiece? The results of the British Film Institute 2002 poll of major directors and critics found Kane to be rated the best film of all time, and Orson Welles the greatest director. Do the intelligentsia of film have the exclusive right to determine which film is or is not a masterpiece? Certainly not. However, the use of the term ""masterpiece"" is being thrown around so casually today as to render the word virtually meaningless. If you look at IMDb's user rating, you would find Citizen Kane ranked #23 and The Shawshank Redemption #2. This is a rating by us common folk, not people who have studied film or make their living from movies. Does this give rise to the contention that The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece also? One may argue the point, and if you read through the user comments, many, many people use the term to describe that movie. I'm sure if you read through the user comments for, say, Pulp Fiction, that ol' word ""masterpiece"" will be there again and again. Check out Forrest Gump. I haven't, but my money says you see that ""m"" word quite a few times there also. After all, it DID win six Academy Awards. If all these movies are considered masterpieces by enough people, does that make it so? I really don't know. I do have my opinion and the privilege to state it, everyone else like it or not. You may disagree with my view, but you shouldn't absorb it and react personally. A masterpiece in film is no different from any other art form. Painting, music, sculpture, literature; some works are great; others mediocre. Greatness must stand the test of time. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen that Dali, listened to Wagner, or read Shaw's play. Each time is the first time. There's a wondrous quality there which fascinates always. A sense of immortality. So, is The Shawshank Redemption a masterpiece on the same level as Citizen Kane? Not even close. Kane meets my criteria as do many others. In fact, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not even Welles' best movie, so I must think highly of him as a filmmaker. Kubrick, Bunuel, Wilder, Ford, Fellini, Fassbinder, Lang, Ozu, Truffaut, Kurasawa, Hitchcock, Altman, maybe Goddard, maybe Herzog, look out for Tarr, Visconti, the list of great films by great filmmakers is long enough, but not so long that every GOOD film we see is a masterpiece. Let's collar that word and hold it in a safe place before it becomes completely superfluous. I'm sure Welles would approve."

","What makes a great film? In my opinion it is the following: <br/><br/>#1.Photography (most important because it IS a film. If it's shot badly, then your skrood.) NOTE: I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first, such as Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Etc.<br/><br/>#2. Directing/Editing (I lump the two together because the director really edits what is going on while it's being filmed, then finishes the process in the cutting room)<br/><br/>#3. Acting (If we can't believe the people, we've lost it. But, bad acting can be corrected in the cutting room, and with multiple takes).<br/><br/>#4. Sound and Music (If what we hear doesn't fit, the movie might as well be silent).<br/><br/>Now, this is all well and good for a movie that tells a great story. Add to that a serious dose of style, ingenuity, and passion, all of which can be found in each frame of Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane isn't just a great movie with great characters, a great cast, great music from Bernard Herrmann or great photography. At the time of its creation it was like a cannon shot from the camp of RKO at the media moguls who were dominating the minds of people at the time.<br/><br/>This message was not only important to the American public who had a right to objective journalism, but also because we were seeing the affects of divisiveness over the airwaves thanks to Hitler, and the power that comes from shaping the perceptions of the masses needed to be acknowledged from a semi-fictional standpoint, and Wells did it with so much energy and style you can't help but admire this work even 60+ years later. Citizen Kane shook the rafters of the media, and even though they played it down, everybody at the time was feeling the quake.<br/><br/>Above all else, Citizen Kane tells the story of a man who is a victim of his own success, a story that can never be told enough.<br/><br/>When you see Citizen Kane, you're not just watching a well made film, you're watching a piece of art, a piece of history, and a timeless story of how power corrupts.<br/><br/>Absolutely."

There are a lot of great films, great because of the way they advanced the art of film, which don't burn their way into your brain and heart the way ""Kane"" does, finding new ways to amaze every time you watch it. The wonder of ""Kane"" 63 years later is not only its greatness, but how much doggone fun it is.<br/><br/>Orson Welles made a film so electric, so outrageous, so simultaneously joyous and sad, it's a wonder it did as well as it did, getting nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and winning the prize for best screenplay. So ahead of its time in so many ways, it's a wonder too RKO ever released the thing, even without significant pressure from William Randolph Hearst to destroy the movie because he believed, not completely correctly, that it was all a big dig at him.<br/><br/>""Kane"" manages to be entertaining from first to last. Its quick cuts and clever transitions have only benefited from the MTV generation like few films of its time, yet it also retains a certain classic Hollywood grandeur, in its gaslit sets, black-and-white compositions, Joseph Cotten's marcelled hair, and the endlessly quotable dialogue.<br/><br/>And it's often hilarious, too. Sometimes in very overt, slapstick ways, like Signore Matiste's music lessons to the impossibly amateurish Susan Alexander Kane. Sometimes in cleverly sardonic ways, like when we see Bernstein examining the alternative headlines the morning after Kane's unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. There's more subtle jests, some which require multiple viewings. I just caught one, where Kane first makes the acquaintance of Susan Alexander by taking her up on her offer of ""hot water."" She provides the hot water alright, as Boss Gettys makes sure.<br/><br/>Welles performs the rare trick of making intelligence fun, his own as well as the viewer's. It's a magic show that has lost none of its power all these decades later.<br/><br/>Welles was only 25 when he directed and starred in this, his first real film role, but he already made his mark on popular culture as something of a trickster in 1938, when he convinced millions of radio listeners the Earth was under Martian attack in his adaptation of ""The War Of The Worlds."" ""Kane"" starts out with similar trickery, putting up a fake newsreel of the kind moviegoers were accustomed to seeing back then. Welles himself was quoted as saying the whole identity of ""Rosebud"" was a bit of a blind alley, ""dime-store Freud"" he called it, but the notion works, not only in setting up an air of mystery to the proceedings (shades of film noir, the genre that immediately succeeded Hollywood's Golden Age that concluded with ""Kane"") but asking a question that Welles' own life seems to beg in retrospect. When is greatness enough for its own sake, and when is it just a way people isolate themselves from the rest of humanity?<br/><br/>It's a shame that ""Kane"" didn't launch a series of Mercury Theatre productions, not just the truncated ""Magnificent Ambersons"" and the weird ""Journey Into Fear"" but a slew of other films, as Welles and his team once envisioned. It fed a bit of a myth, of Welles as an artistic martyr. Welles did suffer from his vision, but he also suffered from being Welles, impossible, petulant, and mercurial. ""Kane"" suffers a bit, too, seen too often as a start not followed through on by its prime creator than as a brilliant individual achievement that has fed so many other great minds since its release.<br/><br/>A couple of reviews down, someone calls this ""another boring black and white film,"" and I almost peed in my pants. Not from anger, but laughter. People can think what they want about ""Kane,"" and they will anyway, but as Matiste would say, ""some people have it, and some don't."" Give it a chance; you won't be sorry."

The movie combines a lot of genres such as drama, romance, comedy, mystery and suspense. Writers Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles made a screenplay that was very suspenseful and interesting and the most important part was what Kane's last utterance ""Rosebud"" really meant. There was a lot of other good performances throughout Joseph Cotten (in his film debut), Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, and especially the director, producer and star Orson Welles. the movie may seem a little confusing at times but it still is a great movie."
"farshadnm","9","7","9","4 August 2012"," if not a masterpiece at least a great movie
","before i watch citizen Kane i was expecting a complicated, boring and slow paced movie. nevertheless i wanted to watch it to see what is all the fuss about. and i was surprised that it was a well made movie and i understand why people calling it a masterpiece of all time. i watched it once and maybe there are somethings that i didn't pay attention to. but anyway, this is my review of the movie. keep in mind that English is not my first language, so i apologize in advance for any possible error. ..... when Kane was a kid his parents send him to city so he may be fortunate and wealthy and have a better life. he loved his mother and didn't want to go, but his mother chose that wealth is better than love for him. it made an impression on Kane. he for the rest of his life seeks love through wealth and fame. he tries to buy the love of people, friends, even his wives with money. he can't love, but wants to be loved. he lost millions of dollars trying to keep the newspaper running because he doesn't care about money, it doesn't mean anything to him. for him, it is a tool to buy something that he didn't have as a child. at the end of his life, his wife was the last person that could love him and when she left, there was nobody else. people didn't love him, his wives left him, he fired his (maybe only) friend and he realize that he lost everything he fought for in life. when he see the snow ball, it reminds him of the day he was playing and making snowman when he was a child. it reminds him a name, a name that he forgot for a long time, ""rosebud"", the sled he used to play with as a child. rosebud is the reminiscent of his childhood. the story is good, acting is good and the way of story telling is great. it was not boring or complicated for me, but i get it that for some people it may be boring. many people says that the movie has a slow pace but i disagree. the only problem i can think of is that it is hard to get attached to characters and i think that's why some people get bored. but i was interested in the story and Kane's character and followed the movie easily. citizen Kane is a great movie and i know i will watch it again some day."

","This is my favorite film. Biblical flicks are in a category all its own.<br/><br/>It's screenplay uses elements from every movie genre except sci-fi as its reaching beyond imagination. But in terms of imagery it takes a little bit of everything. The beginning plays as an early Hollywood horror story; darkness, fog; the later Hitchcock film Psycho brings to mind Kane's castle ""Xandu"" it's featureless house, other than its dark shape, looming in the moonlight. Don't touch it's cinematography; it'd be akin to making Gone With the Wind black and white.<br/><br/>The ending left me a pleasant mishmash of emotions. It's a deliciously fragmented piece the outer manifestation of the story telling, Susan's obsession with puzzles and the gradual corruption of Kane's personality is pieced together by those he came in contact with. Neither are finished--but that's the the aspect of this masterpiece that sets it apart; Welles keeps his characters unperceptive of what made him tick. In his divulging the film's nagging question, Welles concludes its ending opposite of the style he had employed throughout--successfully drawing the ""Rosebud"" mystery away from the compilation of putting together by the characters then waving the answer in front his face--It's impact upon me was a jumble, none of it ""lame"": bowled over how the answer had indeed been provided albeit fleeting much earlier. It's a touch of sadness; for the reporter's quest remaining unsolved and those in contact with Kane never understood him. He was an enigma.<br/><br/>Between creepy beginning and mind-blowing ending, poignant, touches of comedy, those in Kane's life (especially promoting his ""singing"" second wife) and the title character's slide; from champion of the people to absorption of his infallibility.<br/><br/>Concerned over repeating myself and not describing it to the digress I want without spoiling it, I'm closing it by recommending While watching it (and please watch it; it'd be worth one's while) Keep those reminiscing about Kane as separate puzzle pieces while watching."
"kennethwmccall","10","7","9","31 October 2005"," the studio process at its very best
","I think that the making of a movie is truly a collaborative process, thus the films of the studio era are without doubt the most fascinating and inventive to date. This does not mean that an independent film cannot be a good movie, it just doesn't have the expertise and resources behind it to make it a truly great movie like Citizen Kane. It also doesn't mean that the big bygone studios didn't turn out their fair share of clunkers, but in my mind, to find the best movies of the last century you have to look to the big studios.<br/><br/>As to Citizen Kane in particular, it is always fascinating to watch. Unfortunately when we think of special effects these days, it's with action films of dubious quality, but Citizen Kane probably used more and to better advantage.The innovations, such as deep focus, sets with ceilings, the mixture of newsreel footage(both real and staged),the effect of overlapping dialogue are amazing. And to think that this was at a time when sound movies were only about a decade old and the movies themselves weren't even a half century old. It's amusing to think that when these techniques were used to create a realism unseen in films up to that time, the audiences were put off, since it was so different than anything else they had seen and they thought it looked phony!<br/><br/>I recently heard a comment from Richard Chow(the editor from Star Wars) on TV that he is still learning things from Citizen Kane, and its great cinematographer Greg Toland, decades later.<br/><br/>So in conclusion to me Citizen Kane stands head and shoulders above any movie before or since."

"tedg","Null","22","36","28 May 2002"," Narrative and Eye Disconnect
","Spoilers Herein.<br/><br/>This an extremely influential film, by one of the very few inventors of cinema. But I do not think it is Welles' best. (That's either `Othello' or `Lady from Shanghai' depending on your religion.)<br/><br/>First of all, this is not the work of a genius, but the excellent product of three committed artisans: Welles, Tobin and Mankiewicz.<br/><br/>Mankiewicz, with his brother, were the industry's working intellectuals. Here (aided by Houseman), he simply got a client intelligent enough to know what was up. Similarly with Tobin, who was the Sascha Vierny of his day. These two men pulled on Welles, but as we will see, in independent directions.<br/><br/>The story, Hearst and all that, is irrelevant except for the notion that a writer in the right place can create reality if willing to pay the price. The acting is fine of course, uncharacteristically abstract -- but that's hardly innovative nor groundshaking. No, what makes this film important are two features, and the failed relationship between them.<br/><br/>The first of these is the incredibly complex narrative structure. Things that are normally nested frames: a reminiscent flashback, a text annotated with pictures... are here multiply set up and in turn enfolded into the film proper. We see a newsreel, whose footage later appears in the `real' action; we have a recalled death vision of a childhood but that becomes untenably self-critical; we see her singing and again from her perspective. We have several on-screen narrators but each gets swallowed. There are so many narrative devices at work it keeps us spinning, sledding as each comes into play and is then reabsorbed. The puzzle is assembled several different ways. Nowhere else is such narrative cleverness been even attempted, not by Lynch, Bergman, Wenders, anyone.<br/><br/>The other innovation is the breaking of convention with the eye of the camera. The camera takes positions -- physical and philosophical -- that were previously utterly unknown. Previously, the camera was audience supplemented by `context' shots: perspectives that a human observer might not see but that seemed natural. Now, the camera is something unto itself that we have to accommodate. The camera does things no human would or could. It sometimes (often!) sees two things simultaneously, something that never happens with the natural eye. It has a curiosity that we would not have directed. The eye defines the lighting, not the other way around -- here everything is colored not by what it is, but by how the film's eye changes it.<br/><br/>Both of these experiments are masterful. They changed the world of films, and hence dreams, and hence all of abstract thinking forever.<br/><br/>But the flaw, the lethal problem with this film is that the two experiments have independent lives. They are not coordinated beyond some fairly easy touchpoints and then only in the simplest of ways: an image that is being described by a speaker and the nature of the newsreel. It is as if there were TWO geniuses at work, each doing something important and neither communicating with the other. So when there is a shift or a trick in the narrative, the eye is ignorant of it.<br/><br/>But hey, it was just the man's first film. He quickly fixed that in `Othello' and especially `Shanghai.' The merger of eye and narrative is the real revolution. `Kane' raised the question, which is why it is important. Tarkovsky, some Bergman, Malick, Greenaway have subsequently succeeded with this merger using different devices, but the master is Kurosawa. Welles made Kurosawa possible. It all starts here, but only as a promise. In real terms, the film is a failure."

"bilsborrow23","10","11","16","24 September 2012"," The Best Film Ever?
","The BFI top 50 films list was dominated by one film for 50 years. That film, was ""Citizen Kane"". Any film that tops a critically acclaimed list, deserves a watch. I can say without a doubt that this film is one of the most compelling and stylishly executed motion pictures I have ever viewed.<br/><br/>As for my title, ""The Best Film Ever?"", I truly believe if there is one film that rises above the others I have viewed it must be this one, there is something so unique and tidy about the way this film has been put together and shot, it is full of iconic shot's that when you watch them you will want to pause the film and just stop and stare with delight at the beauty of the camera work and the perfect acting that is being displayed within the shot.<br/><br/>The plot of Citizen Kane consists of a young boy, Charles Foster Kane, who has been rejected by his parents and is given away to live with a rich, money grabbing politician who is very wealthy. Charles runs into this wealth and also becomes the head of a newspaper company named, ""The Inquirer"". Charles changes the whole system of the newspaper and how they fill their papers. Charles transforms the paper and makes it much more politically competitive with the other papers, this draws attention to the Inquirer as well as drawing attention to Charles himself. Charles then runs for governor and displays a powerful speech which consists of some tremendous acting and is surrounded by some iconic scenery which is lead by a large poster of Kane which stuck in my mind because of its wonderful vastness. Everything looks good for Kane until his affair, (so to speak), is discovered by an opposing governor candidate. When this story gets out, Kane's chances of becoming governor deteriorate and this starts Kane's spiral of self destruction and in time drives him into his grief hole which he calls ""Xanadu"". He goes to live there with his wife who he lost his chances of governor for and slowly becomes a more miserable weaker man.<br/><br/>The second side of the plot is a lot shorter but is a key part of the film. It starts when there is a shot of Kane, (At this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words, ""Rosebud"", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the wood floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's acquaintances to find out what rosebud could possibly mean, the conversation's between the journalist and Kane's acquaintances turn into flashbacks which structure the whole film wonderfully and create an entertaining unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to appreciate if not enjoy immensely.<br/><br/>My verdict on this film is pretty much summed up by the title, the film is structured unlike any other films in its time period and is assisted superbly by consistent, powerful and distinct acting that when viewed will impress anybody who is a lover of films and also appeals to people who are used to watching films that maybe are not so acclaimed, I am instructing you now, do not be hesitant to watch this film, it is almost impeccable and thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>""Whatever I do, I do because I love you"", from me, Kane receives a 10."

Although it did have an underlying message (and a very strong and well made one too), the film wasn't at all what I expected; the camera work and music in particular livened it up, and at times it was quite light hearted. I think this helped make the emotional scenes all the more powerful. It kept me gripped all the way, and I don't have a long attention span. The acting throughout is superb, with very little of the overacting that you might expect from this period, with Welles in particular giving an outstanding performance in the lead role. My advice is give it a try, even if you think it's not your type of film."

","Hey, make no mistake: this film does deserve lofty status. It is a good film, fantastically photographed.....but the greatest of all time? I question that, but that kind of question - Who's number one? - is impossible to answer. <br/><br/>I would think to be number one you would have to have a great technical film, great story, great acting, great camera-work as this has, AND have it generally loved by the public. Then you have a true number one picture of all time. I'm not a fan of ""Gone With The Wind,"" but that was a technical marvel, too, for its day and was universally loved by millions of people....so I can see that being listed number over Citizen Kane. The same goes for Casablanca, Ben-Hur and a number of wonderful films.<br/><br/>Anway, concerning this movie, I enjoyed it best for the cinematography. Orson Welles, the ""genius"" behind this film, was ahead of his time with his inventive camera-work. The acting is good and it's interesting to note that this was Welles' first acting role. Yes, he was an amazing talent, behind or in front of the camera. The story is pretty unlikable and, in this day and age would be too boring for most people under 50, sad to say. However, even older, more ""mature"" folks find this hard to get through sometimes from what I have read.<br/><br/>The unlikable part mainly comes from the lead character, ""Charles Foster Kane,"" played by Welles. He is simply a selfish egomaniac. Other unpleasant parts of the story include several scenes with his second wife, in which she berates him in this shrill hysterical voice; the fact there is very little humor in here and the ending is anything but uplifting. <br/><br/>For those who find this a confusing story, I suggest giving it another chance. I found this film better the more chances I gave it. It also looks fabulous on the latest special-edition DVD. In summary, it was a great technical achievement but remember professional critics usually have the same mindset and are afraid to be their own person, so don't feel stupid or inadequate if this film doesn't do it for you. You are hardly alone. But, yet, that camera-work has to be seen and appreciated if you really love movies."

","I was troubled by a lot of aspects of the AFI's 1998 list, but Citizen  Kane wasn't one of them; it thoroughly deserved the #1 spot. A magnificent story regarding the search for contentment and happiness among the  squalor of cold material things. Kane's search is a paradox in itself; his happiness lies in a single material object - Rosebud - which represents  his innocence and carefree happiness of childhood. The irony is that the  other material objects he procures in this search only hinder his efforts.   Welles' dramatic effects and his symbolic method of storytelling would make Melville proud; he always notes who is in shadow, what music is playing where, what position his characters are in, etc. The best ever."

","Often considered the greatest American film Citizen Kane's reputation precedes it- but there is a reason for it. Directed by wunderkind Orson Welles(who was barely into his mid 20s) Citizen Kane is a towering achievement of themes which resonate with anyone of us, and the cinematography and pacing are so good most American filmmakers swear by it. Based on the life of a real life newspaper moghul Kane tells the story through flashback of its titular character Charles Foster Kane(Welles). It is a given that for such a work of art the reputation is indeed going to take precedence. But if seen with an open mind one will realize that Citizen Kane is a work not only ahead of its time but also a precursor of many a character studies done in the Hollywood system. Citizen Kane will stand the test of time, as it has for so many decades now."
"leftistcritic","10","3","3","19 January 2019"," Classic movie that wasn't what I thought
","Before watching this movie I only knew of it from a reference in the episode in season 6, episode 5, where Sideshow Bob becomes Mayor. The 10+ minute intro that is a newsreel sets up a dual story, one in the ""present"" (1941) of a reporter trying to figure out what Rosebud means and snapshots of Kane's life, a bit like one's memory. This is especially relevant with people talking of ""fake news"" today as Kane goes through life buoyed by a paper that literally prints fake news. Orson Welles carries the movie as Charles Foster Kane, the wealthy newspaper publisher whom doesn't care about anyone else but himself. The ending of the movie, with the meaning of Rosebud clear to the viewer but not found by the reporter is gone, almost like it dies with Kane. This movie was detested by William Randolph Hearst as it is based loosely on his life.<br/><br/>There is more to say about this movie than one paragraph. For one, this movie is relatively compelling drama which pulls you in. Of course Orson Welles as Kane does a great job, showing his ruthlessness to dominate over others, but I also think that Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander Kane (Kane's second wife) and Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane (Kane's first wife) play important roles as well. The focus on the press a bit resembles other movies of the era like The Power of the Press (1930), Mr. Deeds Comes to Town (1936), Platinum Blonde (1931) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1938) to name two I can think of off the top of my head. I could name the other actors as well, but the performances of Welles, Comingore, and Warrick are the most striking in my opinion, although others undoubtedly played their part.<br/><br/>The political themes for this film are obvious. Some critics have said that this film reflects the reflects ""the battle between intervention and isolationism"" waged in the U.S. especially since it was released six months before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and that Kane's one fate of ""wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history"" is the fate of ""isolationism"" (which should more accurately be called non-interventionism). I think that is a valid point, but I also think other critics are right to point out that this film focuses on manipulation, by mass media, of public opinion, and of the political process. In that way, this movie almost foresees films like Network in 1976, the pinnacle of mass media manipulation just to get a better rating-share to bring more profits to ""uneasy"" stockholders whom believe the world is a business.<br/><br/>With that, my review comes to an end, with what I have said so far justifying a rating on this film of a 10 out of 10."
"bwright68","10","3","3","10 January 2019"," Innovative Elements of Citizen Kane
","Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is a landmark in the history of Hollywood filmmaking. This is due in no small part to the unprecedented amount of creative control ceded to him by RKO Studios. Welles was unquestionably a genius, but his uncompromising desire for artistic integrity, coupled with filmic concepts and production methods deemed unconventional at the time, would prove to be not conducive with Hollywood's powers-that-be. Regrettably, the degree of freedom that would foster the realization of his cinematic debut was to never reoccur with any of the enfant terrible's subsequent films. As such, the magnum-opus that is Citizen Kane survives as a lasting testament to its auteur director's innovations. Welles's editing, cinematography, narration, mise en scene, sound, acting, and props are crucial elements in this regard.
Welles's manipulation of time was crucial in maintaining Citizen Kane's non-linear story. This was achieved, in part, through transitions consisting of dissolves and form cuts. For example, when Kane, the new owner of ""The Inquirer,"" asks why rival newspaper ""The Chronicle"" has a larger circulation, his loyal associate Bernstein (Everett Sloane) attributes it to their journalistic integrity. To clarify, he points to a photograph of ""The Chronicle""'s editorial staff. The image proceeds to fade out into a slow dissolve while simultaneously transitioning into a form cut of the same staff-members in identical staging positions, except this time posing for ""The Inquirer""'s photoshoot. Thus, Welles's cinematic language wordlessly advances the story by eliminating the time needed to show Kane buying his competition's integrity and loyalty.
The theme of being bought and sold applies to the protagonist's childhood as well. In particular, the scene when Charlie's parents ""give"" him to the banker Walter Parks Thatcher (George Colouris). In this instance, cinematographer Gregg Toland's use of deep focus and long camera takes help tell the story. The short lens used in this example provides the large depth of field which allows us to clearly see Charlie playing outside the window in the center frame's background. He is also the dominant in a frame within a frame, foreshadowing his imminent entrapment and loss of innocence. Additionally, the long camera takes give us time to take in information about the adult characters based on their acting. For example, the stern countenance and stoic posturing of Mrs. Kane (Agnes Moorehead) in the right foreground emphasizes her concentrated control over the details of Thatcher's contract (which is appropriate since it involves her son's welfare). Despite her patrician facade, Mrs. Kane wants Charles to have a better life, even if it has to be with a Wall Street executive as his guardian. Her husband, on the other hand, shambles from middle-ground to foreground, all the while babbling ineffectually like a doddering old fool. He is clearly not in control of the situation. The wide angle lens of deep focus photography allows all four characters in the shot to stay in focus regardless of which distance plane they are positioned in. Additionally, the lack of distracting edits allows for every aspect of the performances, along with the well planned mise en scene, to be taken in by the viewers on their own accord.
One way the apportioned facts about Kane are taken in by the audience is through the film's innovative narrative devices. There are two examples which occur early in the film that help us learn about our protagonist before we actually hear him tell his own story. The first way is achieved via newsreel footage announcing his death. It begins with the booming, non-synchronous narrator's voice announcing the death of Charles Foster Kane. Descriptions of his wealth and influence are accompanied by transitioning wipes of Xanadu (Kane's palatial residence), his extensive art collection, and a multitude of guests enjoying their stay in the war-profiteer's estate (an optically printed Adolf Hitler among them). The narrator also explains how the scandal of the newspaper tycoon's extramarital affair with Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) cost him his bid for politics. The second way we learn about Kane occurs in the darkened screening room when the ""March of Time"" newsreel ends. In his attempt to humanize Kane for a follow-up report, the newsreel director demands more background information on the deceased magnate. We are then able to parse out bits and pieces of speculation amidst the din of overlapping dialogue (a common Welles trope) that follows, including the current whereabouts of his second wife, Susan. This also provides a starting point for lead reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) to begin his investigation.
The starting point for the audience's investigation begins with the establishing shot of Xanadu. This same imagery also appears at the end of the film, essentially bookending the story. Although both emphasize his wealth, each scene offers a different takeaway for the viewer. For instance, the film opens with an ascending crane shot over the wrought iron ""K"" atop Xanadu's main gate. In the distance, Kane's palace (a matte painting) looms in the misty background which, like the protagonist, is shrouded in the unknown. Although we know little about Kane at this point, the roaming camera reveals a private zoo, golf courses, and docked gondolas materializing out of the fog. Clearly, a wealthy individual lives here. However, after we learn of his death, our perspective changes. For example, at the end of the film, a bird's-eye tracking shot (the camera mounted on an overhead cable) curates over the labyrinths of Kane's crated artwork. Xanadu's captured collection of empty opulence is not unlike that of the pyramids; both retaining riches of dismayed men inside their sepulchers of shattered dreams.
Occasionally, ear shattering sounds serve as signals for transitions occurring in Citizen Kane. Although the godlike newsreel introduction, ""News on the March!"" is a salient example, the most innovative (and bizarre) use of sound occurs in the third act to herald his wife's flight from her gilded cage. As the shot begins, a loud screech is heard from an enormous Cockatoo optically printed on the left side of the frame. Presumably, only the audience sees and hears the Cockatoo, although it's quite plausible the birdcall emanates from an aviary in Xanadu's zoo. This diegetic sound effect nonetheless signifies Mrs. Kane's cry for freedom, as well as mimicking her limited operatic vocal range. The bird's image then cross dissolves into a full shot of Kane approaching the bedroom, inside of which Susan hastily packs her suitcases. Like the Cockatoo, Susan Kane is seen by her husband as an object of beauty that must be amassed and stored alongside the other symbols of his material wealth. Like using his newspaper as a platform for yellow journalism, and the questionable ethics employed in his vying for public office, Susan's exit is another failure at control which leads to Kane's disillusionment.
The believability of Welles's character metamorphosing from a young entrepreneur into a disillusioned old recluse can be partly attributed to make up. However, the real method behind his portrayal of Kane's age progression is due to a convincing acting style. Originally trained as a stage actor, he cut his teeth treading the boards at an early age. The magnified emotional and physical expressions needed to convey the character's inner moments to a theater audience were perfectly suited for Kane's boundless energy and subsequent lethargy on the big screen. The scene, for example, in which young Kane is seen cavorting with all the dancing girls in ""The Inquirer"" newsroom is bristling with sheer youthful exuberance. The ceiling in the room is low, making it appear as if the structure itself cannot contain his energy. As he reaches middle age, his mannerisms are replaced by less physicality and more bellicose oratory in his self aggrandizement. The shot in which he confronts Boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins) in Susan's apartment is an example of this. As a younger man, he would have likely resorted to violence in the face of his opponent's blackmail threat. However, Welles' indicates Kane's decline with slower, more deliberate movement, such as his decision to not pursue Gettys down the apartment building's stairwells. Instead, he resorts to blustery bravado on the upper flight (like his campaign podium), exclaiming,""I'm Charles Foster Kane!"" By the end of the film, he is an aged and broken man alone in the cavernous catacombs of Xanadu. His girth, borne out of Dionysian decadence and disappointment, causes his trembling legs to shuffle along at a hesitant gate. Welles's innate theatrical dramatics conveys a visceral decrepitude, contributing a great amount of pathos to his iconic emergence from the ruins of Susan's bedroom. As he lethargically lumbers past his shocked domestic staff, and between two opposing mirrors, Kane's spiritual nadir is endlessly repeated into the illusory vanishing points of the props' myriad of images.
The prop that is most germane to the theme of Citizen Kane is the ""No Trespassing"" sign posted on Xanadu's main gate. Like a hieroglyphic curse intended to thwart grave robbers, the sign decries prying into Kane's enigmatic persona. At the outset, its mute warning goes unheeded by the advancing camera's single-minded scrutiny, as unyielding in its movement as Kane's headstrong temperament. Yet, despite the transgression into Xanadu's inner sanctum in which we are privy, Kane's only mortal self-disclosure occurs in his single-word valediction: ""rosebud."" Later, through his associates' excoriations and obsequies, we incrementally learn of the pyrrhic victories of Kane's ego. These present conflicting images of him as a crusading journalist, yet rhetorically stooping to ""Remember the Maine"" artifice; a champion of the working man, yet not approving of unions."

Of course at the center of Citizen Kane is Orson Welles who not only is the main lead but also the soul producer and co-writer, and of course the director- this film defines the wunderkind talent and genius of Kane. Such was the impact of this film Orson Welles probably never came out of its shadow. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and there is no reason to not be enthralled by it."

","In this film we see the arc of a wealthy man's life from childhood memories to his aspirations after college, from wielding power in the middle of life to an end that, amidst vast wealth and opulence, simply looks back on childhood, and then goes up in smoke. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) may have been based on William Randolph Hearst and the film a critique of the 'rich and powerful', but there are elements it that are also universal. It takes a piercing look into how people change over time, how power corrupts, and how all life is transient. <br/><br/>Kane may have all of the benefits that money brings, but he's also a little broken inside, with perhaps a narcissistic or attachment disorder stemming from having been given up for adoption by his own biological parents when he was a boy (and that, in turn, hinted as being due to his father's abuse). He therefore has no real friends, or true love. He positions himself as a 'man of the people', but he's aloof and above them from all, using them to amplify his own power. He may collect all of the statues he can find in Europe for his castle in America, but ultimately dies like anyone else, without any real meaning, and his possessions disbursed. <br/><br/>It's fascinating to watch Kane evolve over the film. His days as a young man are full of hubris and the desire to run a newspaper, mainly to push social messages. While he also has a knack for increasing circulation via sensationalism, he's also pure enough to pen a 'Declaration of Principles' that promises to publish truth, free of special interests. In a fantastic exchange, his friend Jedediah (Joseph Cotten) points out that his first two sentences have started with the word ""I"", and as we'll see, the 'special interest group' that Kane sells out to is Kane himself. He gradually morphs to begin abusing the power he has as a publisher, swaying opinions on war, and flat out saying that the people will think what he tells them to think.<br/><br/>Kane's relationships also evolve in interesting ways. Early on he seems so close with Jedediah, jovial and dancing at office parties, but he fires him without thinking twice about it when Jedediah dares to publish the truth in a review of his second wife's awful performance at the opera. In a parallel way, we see this second wife (Dorothy Comingore) go from a humble, nice, and honest woman he meets on the street one night to a spoiled and vindictive wife, then bitter alcoholic. She speaks about Kane over a drink in a two-bit club, and Jedediah speaks about him from an assisted living facility. The film has a rather dark view of the endgame that awaits us all.<br/><br/>The transience of life is further emphasized by little moments in the supporting cast, such as Bernstein (Everett Sloane) saying of his own life these fantastic lines: ""A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.""<br/><br/>Orson Welles is excellent as both actor and director, and the way the story is told, via flashbacks from multiple perspectives and short jumps in time, is compelling. He also utilizes a number of innovative and interesting visual techniques that feel modern. If you're looking for a film with an uplifting message, one with action, or one that will leave you feeling warm, this is not your film. On the other hand, there is such honesty here about power and about life, the filmmaking is fantastic, and it has an ending that is absolutely devastating, in those plumes of smoke going up into the night sky."
"HaddonfieldJason","Null","12","18","8 October 2011"," Quite frankly the most intelligent film ever made
","Citizen Kane is a marvelous piece of cinema. It transcends all efforts made before and after it. What we have here truly is the great American film. The black and white cinematography is to die for. Kane is by far the most visually appealing film ever made. I find something new in it's shadows with each viewing and it takes a really great film to offer that to a viewer. American movie making really owes it all to Kane. It really is the only film I can think of that fails to break into a sense of monotony. <br/><br/>And of course Welles' performance must be praised. Here we have a twenty six year old man fresh off of a lucrative stage career make a seamless transition into film. To see Charles Foster Kane is to see the perfection of characterization. There are no loose ends with this character he is wrapped perfectly. Of course he is a metaphor for the joys and evils of capitalism. We must ask and why did he become what he did? The great thing about Kane is that it still proposes questions that require answers.how<br/><br/>In each viewing of Kane I just think to myself what bias cinema come to? There was a time when motion picture making was a challenge and it meant something. Kane should be studied because it is a perfect film. It gives the viewer something to think about and yet offers dynamic characters. And to think the lobotomized masses of American cinema goers would rather be watching a Transformers film. Now there's a series I would care to forget about. I mean what kind of movie has stupid robots? And that isn't even the problem with those poor excuses for celluloid. Each film in that series is a blood curdling experience. I absolutely hate the parent characters and Shia whatever his name is. The racial stereotypes are offensive and the idea of a Transformer heaven where Shia goes to in the first sequel is beyond ridiculous. I mean come on! And what about that stupid government organization? Really? You expect me to believe that they were able to keep a giant robot within the Hoover dam without nobody knowing about it? Or how about the fact that they actually had the transformer ship crash into the moon? You might infer that some telescope would catch wind of it. And the actor they got to play John Kennedy in the beginning of the film was doing the worst stereotypical Massachusetts accent ever. Transformers is dumbing down America pure and simple. All it exists to do is sell toys to idiot kids. Michael Bay makes millions of dollars while Orson Welles was abandoned by the Hollywood system. Really! It infuriates me."
"bkoganbing","10","12","18","25 April 2007"," An Expert On What People Will Think
","The problem with writing about a film like Citizen Kane is that with 809 previous comments on the boards here, there is little that hasn't been said already. The best you can do is not look at any others and express your own thoughts your own way.<br/><br/>I've always felt the real reason that William Randolph Hearst so bitterly resented Orson Welles's masterpiece is that it got really too close to his own soul for him to be easy. Most folks who talk about Citizen Kane go for the obvious target, Welles's depiction of Marion Davies (Susan Alexander) as a no talent gold digger. In fact Welles himself in later years said he thought he was unfair to Davies then in Dorothy Comingore's performance. <br/><br/>What Welles showed in Charles Foster Kane was the insincerity of his beliefs. The key line in Citizen Kane I've always thought was what Joseph Cotten said that his friend Charlie Kane had a lot of opinions, but didn't believe any of them. To this day serious biographers of Hearst still wonder exactly what he did believe when the day was done.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane came up with a host of Oscar nominations, but only took home one award for original screenplay for Welles and Herman Mankiewicz. Original it certainly was in concept and execution.<br/><br/>The role that was written by Welles and Mankiewicz and directed by Welles for Welles is one of the greatest roles ever written for any film actor. The technique of Citizen Kane is always discussed, the flashbacks told from many points of view for the audience to get a grasp of what the title character was all about. What's not discussed is Welles himself.<br/><br/>What he does in fact is give several performances of the same man in one film. Welles reinterprets Kane five or six times depending on whose flashback we're seeing. He's a scared child being taken from his parents, he's a rich frat boy and incorrigible scamp as seen by George Couloris the J.P. Morgan like banker, he's an idealist and crusader as seen by his business manager Everette Sloane, a man with no core set of beliefs who will do anything to bend the public to approval by his closest and maybe his only real friend Joseph Cotten, a lonely man with a compulsion for real love by Dorothy Comingore, and as an aging tyrant by butler Paul Stewart. Welles makes every one of these Kanes come alive and each relates to the other.<br/><br/>The names of all those I've mentioned in the cast before were from Welles's Mercury Theater Company, nearly all went on to substantial movie careers. Others from the cast who did are Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Erskine Sanford. I don't think any other film comes close to introducing so many talented players to the screen.<br/><br/>The film begins with the aged Kane's death and that single word 'Rosebud' which sends everyone scrambling to find out just what he had on his mind in his final moments on earth. Those searching never do find out, but you the audience does and the unveiling of Charles Foster Kane's inner soul is something once seen and never forgotten."
"ackstasis","9","12","18","12 February 2007"," ""I don't think any word can explain a man's life""
","Orson Welles' debut feature 'Citizen Kane' stands as one of the twentieth century's most revered films, and, indeed, the title of ""The Greatest Film Of All Time"" has often been bestowed upon it, from as early as Sight and Sound's 1962 rankings, when it indefinitely dethroned De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves (1948).' After two viewings, I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time, but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that, however, 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939, in an unprecedented studio contract, RKO offered young prodigy Welles, fresh from his success on the stage and the radio, a two-picture contract with full artistic control (a promise that ultimately wasn't kept). Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick, Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pulitzer, but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane, poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream.<br/><br/>Charlie Kane (Welles) rises from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' for the simple reason that he ""thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper."" Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing ""yellow journalism,"" which, though frowned upon by most critics, proves immensely profitable. Decades later, after two unsuccessful marriages and a failed bid for public office, Kane sits alone in his massive, unfinished Xanadu mansion (the most massive, impersonal and even sinister abode ever to grace the silver screen), pining for the lost innocence of his childhood. This is the story of a tragic life, and the ultimate testament that money can't buy happiness.<br/><br/>The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large ""NO TREPASSING"" sign on the gate of Kane's vast and lonely dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the enormity of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, ""Rosebud."" With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. Following his death, the producer of a newsreel about Kane asks a reporter, Jerry Thompson (William Alland), to uncover the significance behind Kane's final words, a well-meaning but rather naive attempt to encapsulate a man's entire life in a simple seven-letter name.<br/><br/>A criticism often levelled at 'Citizen Kane' is that it feels less like a warm, involving biopic than a formal masterclass in film-making technique. It's true that Welles was exploring largely unmapped cinematic territory at the time, and there's a certain sense of experimentation about the film. Mankiewicz and Welles constructed the screenplay as a series of fragmented, non-chronological flashbacks, each sequence filling in the missing parts of Kane's life, sometimes even showing the same event from differing perspectives. Greg Toland's elaborate cinematography makes unprecedented use of deep focus, in which everything in the frame  foreground, background and anything in between  is constantly held in sharp focus; the end result is a film that feels far more dynamic and ""animate"" than anything preceding the French New Wave. All innovation aside, anybody who suggests that the life of Charles Foster Kane is somehow uninvolving really needs to revisit the film; Welles pours his heart and soul into portraying the arrogant, tormented and ultimately lonely millionaire, and it's uncanny how the director's own tragic career drew clear parallels with that of his most memorable character."
"gftbiloxi","10","12","18","29 July 2005"," Fascinating--But Increasingly Problematic With The Passage of Time
","In order to survive the passing years, a film must be able to transcend the limitations of the era in which it was made. This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.<br/><br/>To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem. A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage. Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal. And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.<br/><br/>The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore. They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates. As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longer offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.<br/><br/>There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels. Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","""What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?"" When viewing this film, I immediately paralleled Mark 8:36 to Citizen Kane. Considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, films of all time, Citizen Kane, which also revolutionized film cinematography, told truth about life that love cannot be gained by money. Assuredly, the film's remarkable excellences in every respect attest the addition of my perfect score to the already sky-high positive reviews of critics and audiences.<br/><br/>Based on the newspaper publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who also is credited for triggering the Spanish-American war, Citizen Kane begins with Kane's final, dying, ""Rosebud."" Inquisitively, a curious reporter by the name of Thompson hopes to solve the mystery around the word and its meaning by interrogating friends and family of Kane. During these interviews, Kane's life unfolds in flashbacks as we see him possessing, with high hopes, his rich guardian's failing newspaper, which he quickly expands into an empire of thirty-seven nationwide newspapers under his unique techniques. But he wanted more; he wanted to be loved by everyone, adored by everyone, a governor, a household name. He just could not be content with what he was; he had to be bigger.<br/><br/>Without doubt, Orson Welles, the director, producer and screenwriter, also masterfully played this unique Kane, the rajah of the American society. As it was openly frowned upon during the Golden Age of films, little negative content appears Citizen Kane. Even though the plot revolves fairly around adultery, it is only mentioned slightly in newspaper headlines and characters' monologues. Also, young viewers may find the film boring as the message is told in a style that might be above their level.<br/><br/>What if I said that ""Rosebud"" was his childhood sled? I revealed absolutely nothing about this unique, troubled life, as Thompson mentioned at the near the end, ""Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. No, I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life. No - I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle - a missing piece."" Kane, a man who wanted love on his own ""terms,"" failed to understand in his ""terms"" that in receiving love, love needs to be given. With this deep and powerful message, this piece of art has been ingrained into history as the most influential film ever, and it will easily become a family favorite."
"Red-Barracuda","9","5","6","9 July 2012"," A true original
","RKO was the smallest of the Big Five Hollywood studios and the purveyor of mainly undistinguished genre pictures. For this reason they hired a young theatre producer called Orson Welles to make a prestige film. Welles had just shook up radio with his production of The War of the Worlds, a broadcast that was so innovative and realistic it caused widespread panic throughout the United States with some people really believing that Martians were attacking. Welles was given free reign to make the film he wanted. This was unprecedented for an untried film-maker. The film's central character resembled newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. The film was delayed several months while RKO tried to appease Hearst's lawyers. It was well received by the critics but not a popular success. It would remain the high point of Welles career and the one time he enjoyed such complete control. This led in part to the auteur theory where masterpieces of cinema were attributed to the director's genius. However, this is too simplistic as Welles had great collaborators here such as screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland. The former provided a disciplined structure for Welles to work off and the latter the deep focus photography that allowed him to manipulate cinematic space in a way that strengthened the story. The combination of deep focus and long takes allowed for scenes where characters moved around the cinematic space in ways that heightened the drama considerably.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is often considered a triumph of technique but it's really the way in which the technique was used and controlled to strengthen the story that makes it so notable. It wasn't the first film to utilise deep focus or long takes but it was the first one to use them so systematically. It combined many opposites – social comment / surrealism, European art film / Hollywood entertainment, comedy / tragedy, realism / expressionism. Kane himself is presented in a variety of ways – dreamlike images of him dying, a remote public figure, a man known by wife and friends and finally a detached being. This reality is expressed by a combination of objective fact and subjective opinion. The beginning of the movie illustrates opposites of approach. We begin with a subjective dreamlike death scene and immediately are thrust into the objective 'News on the March' segment that mimics the news documentary in a similar way to how Welles mimicked the radio news in The War of the Worlds. In this part we are told the whole narrative in summary. It's a microcosm of the film as a whole. After this we then piece together the story of Kane's life via the accounts of various people who knew him, all interviewed by Thompson, a man whose face we never see because he really represents us. The use of flashbacks, multiple narrators and an ambiguous conclusion was a very innovative one for the time. The film as a whole resembles one of the jigsaws that Kane's second wife Susan works on, each piece contributed another truth but some pieces are missing. To add to the complexity of the film, different people offer contrasting judgements that make up the differing periods of his life. Welles once remarked that 'the point of the picture is not so much the solution of the problem as its presentation'.<br/><br/>Thompson realises that no single word can 'explain a man's life' and so it proves with 'Rosebud'. The sledge and paperweight represent the time when Kane was happiest and the love he lost but it's left essentially ambiguous and is never fully explained. Kane seeks to regain the love he lost for the rest of his life but always on his own terms, this leads to the ruin of his career and relationships. He winds up in Xanadu his very own pleasure dome with caves of ice. The final tracking shot moves slowly over the expensive rubbish that Kane has accumulated; as we pan forward we see items from further and further back in the story until we find the fateful Rosebud sledge. The 'answer' to our quest."

","I think the quote that my friend made about this movie sums it up pretty much: it is a modern day work of literature. I agree with him precisely on that point. I do not give it a 10 because at places it is slow and dull, but one does not appreciate the brilliance that is this movie until after one has sat down and thought about it. Citizen Kane is not a movie is simply watch, it is one to think about and mull over the ideas that come through it. Another friend stated that it was the most boring piece of crap that he has ever seen, and though that might be his opinion, I feel that he missed the entire point of this movie.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is about a man named Charles Foster Kane who is a US newspaper magnate. I will not delve into the plot because that is not the purpose of the movie. Rather it is a character study on Kane and it is also a tragedy for we see how Kane's life not only slowly disintegrates to its inevitable conclusion, but also we see how his life ended up as it is.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of discussion over the precise meaning of Rosebud, the word that he mutters on his deathbed. At the end of the movie we discover that Rosebud is the name of his sleigh, and we see this as it is thrown into the fire. A journalist spends the entire movie trying to find out the meaning of Rosebud, but he fails to do so, walking out of Kane's manor, Xanadu, behind a huge amount of possessions packed away in boxes. We learn that the answer to the Rosebud question is an insignificant item amongst all of these meaningless possessions.<br/><br/>What does Rosebud mean? It may be the name of the sleigh, but what does it really mean. I guess to answer that question we must look at what Kane had, and what he did not have. At the beginning of the movie we are told all about Kane, or what the media knew of it, but as we follow the journalist we slowly come to learn more about the more intimate and personal period's of Kane's life. We are allowed into Kane's personal space and into his mind to try and understand how he thinks, and by doing that we are given clues as to why he mentioned Rosebud.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane was incredibly rich, having almost everything that he could want. Xanadu, his palace in which he died, was a tribute to his wealth. The palace was not finished, but that only says something minor about his character which I will not address. What I wish to draw out of that is that Xanadu represents his wealth and his ability to claim whatever possession that he wants. I use the word possession because there are three things in the movie that his money cannot buy: the presidency, love, and his childhood. The presidency is a minor thing, and love becomes more important after his first divorce. It is important because he uses his money to make his second wife famous, but one thing that this does not do is make her truly love him. He dies in bed a lonely man.<br/><br/>I believe that the major thing that Charles Foster Kane could not buy was his childhood, and we see evidence of this throughout the film, and tied together at the end where we see his sleigh, Rosebud, burning in the fire. His actions and his attitudes all show signs of a little boy trapped in the body of a man, trapped since the days he was sent off to boarding school.<br/><br/>The first instance is when Kane's mother decides to send Charles Foster Kane away. His father is against this, but his mother is adamant that Kane has a good education. When Kane learns of this his first reaction is to lash out at Thatcher, his trustee, with his sleigh. For the rest of his life he hated Thatcher with a passion. He refused to listen to him, and made his job incredibly difficult. Even though he was sent to the best schools, he reacted violently against them and was never able to last long. In the end he purchases a Newspaper because it seems like a good idea.<br/><br/>He hated Thatcher because Thatcher was the man that stole Kane's childhood. When Kane came of age he was able to dissolve the trust, and as such remove Thatcher from his life. He reaction to the schools is his hatred of having his childhood stolen from him, and the newspaper was him trying to reclaim the childhood that he had lost. In the end he is too old to live out a childhood, but tries to anyway.<br/><br/>The final thing that I wish to discuss is the reaction by Randolf Hurst against this film. It is a reaction that I really do not understand because I do not see Kane as an unflattering character. My friend described Kane as being a real and a repulsive character. I did not find him that repulsive, rather rash and unthinking. He actions which lost him the presidency was not due to any immorality, but rather due to lies fostered by his opponents. The divorce of his first wife is never explored, and it is doubtful that it was because of this because she knew the truth. Maybe it is because she did not really love him, but because she loved the fact that one day he might be president."

"Quebec_Dragon","9","8","11","30 July 2009"," New review from first time watcher: Kane still good today?
","Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time? I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.<br/><br/>Despite the unconventional story structure, you never get lost, although you might be temporarily confused, and it makes the whole storyline very engaging. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very rich and influential newspaper mogul from childhood to his death but not in chronological order. As a matter of fact, the film starts with the death of Kane, followed by a newsreel (like in old World War II screenings) recapping his whole life and then followed by an investigation into Rosebud, his mysterious last word. It's inspired by the life of real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried his very best to destroy this movie... literally. There are lots of creative liberties taken but if you study the background, you will notice the similarities. It's a great story extremely well told. You might not care about Kane but he's certainly a rich, complex and fascinating character. He's played by the director Orson Welles and he shows a wide range of emotions and acts differently according to age, not just in demeanor but physically. The other actors, most of them newcomers to cinema, are very fine although a few succumb, including Welles sometimes, to overacting just a tad (they were mostly theater actors which would explain the theatrics I suppose). On first viewing, I found the mistress of Kane particularly annoying and badly acted to the point of being grating but on second thought, I think she was supposed to be that way, a bit of a superficial simple floozy.<br/><br/>Overall, I was impressed, despite high expectations, at how original, enjoyable and artistic Citizen Kane remains in 2009. It might not be one of my favorite films, nor would I consider it the best film of all time but I think it still appeals to modern sensibilities and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy of your own, preferably with the great commentary track by the famous critic Roger Ebert (Kane being his favorite film of all time) and with the illuminating documentary about the Battle of Citizen Kane showing the conflict between director/main actor Orson Welles and Kane's inspiration: Hearst, as well as their biographies.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10 (not a 10 because I wasn't moved or awed as much as a few other select films)"

","Ease the tension. Give it a 10-rating. I'm not sure if I could pick any movie and claim it was the Best Movie of All Time. That's a great deal of pressure. So I ignore such a label, and I watch the film.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is powerful, but it's so well constructed as to give you multiple impressions of Kane that it's hard to realize how emotionally charged this movie is. I love it for lines such as Kane's explanation of what he would've been if he hadn't have been rich: ""Everything you hate,"" he says. And I love the movie because of Welles's voice. You could look at this movie a hundred different ways, and the details would still remain to support you.<br/><br/>It's perhaps one of the most intricately-constructed films I've ever seen, and the honesty in the film is magnificent. This movie does make me sad, because among other questions, it asks this: ""If you're remembered after you die for what you did, what you will it be?"" And, to me, that's a very sad question to want to ask. A feeling that there is no absolute understanding between people. That it's all skewed by our own personalities. That who you are depends on the paper you chose to read.<br/><br/>How could anyone not think this movie is great? Best film of all time, whatever. The movie is brilliant, one way or another."

","A word of warning: The following review and critique contains ""spoilers"" (dialog and plot-points which may - and in this instance - will give away scenes and surprises in the film), but it is unlikely that this will be the first time you have read or heard this information. After all, what can really be said or written about this film that hasn't be said or written before? Everyone who writes about film (from it's release in 1941, to me tonight, to someone else tomorrow) has written something either about or in reference to ""Citizen Kane"". It is a true classic. ""Citizen Kane"" is not only one of the most talked about films ever, it is also one of the most influential films ever. And, perhaps, singularly the best film American cinema has ever produced. Art is a very subjective thing, and this film is clearly filled with it. Only great art or great tragedy can produce such lengthy and long-term discussion. So what can be said that has not been said previously? Let me start by saying I did not like Charles Foster Kane, nor do I believe I was meant to. I do not take for granted that characters must be sympathetic. They do not. There is such a thing as the dark and mysterious (sometimes dangerous) character; someone who, simultaneously, will shock and infuriate us, yet from whom (for some reason) we can not turn away. In other words, it is possible to care about and become involved in the life stories of less than idyllic people. This is especially true with regards to Charles Foster Kane. Mr. Kane is a tyrant. He's as hated as he is feared. By the second act we see Kane as a hostile, detached and driven man. But time offers the unique gift of insight to those who are willing to wait for it. Something did not occur to me until recently (I did not see or hear it in any speech or interview, nor have I read of it in any of the too-numerous-to-count reviews, write-ups and critiques of the film): Charles Kane is not a man at all. He is still the same scared little boy taken away from his home and his family, lost in the wilderness, scarred for life and seemingly irreversible damaged. Now, I am positive that I am not the first to come to this conclusion (simply based on my personal knowledge that I am not that bright), but I am the first (that I know of) to write it down tonight. What do we see in the beginning of the picture (which we don't realize until the end)? The end of innocence. Lost youth. Separation. These are the things that plague Kane as an adult and shape the broken soul who tried to purchase virtue, marry youth and fight for any kind of connection throughout his ""adult"" life. He needed a connection. To anyone. Or anything. Do you remember in the beginning of ""Citizen Kane"" when he says ""Rosebud"" and then drops the snow globe? The butler tells the reporter at the end of the film that Mr. Kane said it twice. You only hear him say it once in the beginning. But at the end of the film, when he tears apart the room after his wife walks out, destroying practically everything, he picks up the snow globe, and is about to break it, but notices the sled encased in it. He is crying and says ""Rosebud"". He then walks past several employees, including the butler (who clearly heard him) and then lies down, says it again, drops the globe and dies. Here is my point: He is redeemed. Regret equals redemption. Kane regrets everything. Susan Alexander, this wife that left him (whom he left his first wife and son for); Kane met her while on the way to the warehouse that contained his youth (including his childhood sled ""Rosebud"" which was his last physical bit of material possession that held any connection to his long-deceased mother). He never made it to that warehouse (that night or any other) because he met Susan. Because of this he never regained, retained or made peace with that lost youth. So instead he tried to buy happiness and marry the youthful Ms. Alexander, in an attempt to hold onto some sort of ideological notion of what childhood could have been. Only after the second Mrs. Kane walks out, and he sees that sled in that snow globe, does he recall what he would have or could have been had he never accepted that ""hot water"" that Susan Alexander offered him on that sidewalk that first night they met. He becomes a man in that instant. Charles regrets everything. Then, he makes peace with everything by remembering everything. And he dies with redemption."

It uses a very cheep device to provide suspense if you want to call it that, we are waiting to find out what Kane meant by his final word on his deathbed: ""rosebud."" The plot is thin tedious and the end was about the most anticlimactic a movie ending could be. I think it was summed up best in an episode of the TV series Family Guy, when Peter Griffin says, ""It was his sled from when he was a kid. There I just saved you from two long, boob-less hours.""

But in general, movies just don't have the same magic they used too.<br/><br/>Watching Citizen Kane for the first time was a relief for me because I almost forgot that there were terrific movies out there. Citizen Kane is a brilliantly made political drama with terrific acting and excellent cinematography. I almost forgot how amazing the classics can be. I think my favorite part about this film is just how the people never figured out what Kane's last word was before he passed, ""Rosebud"", meant. I felt like some things should just be left in peace and you'll always have at least one piece of the puzzle missing.<br/><br/>What a terrific and perfect movie that should be watched by all.

Fine, it was clever having Rosebud, and the importance of youth, but i felt that this is an example of a movie, that could be told in about 5 minutes, rather than stretching it out into one of the longest and most boring movies that i have ever seen. Now, i was also shocked at the acting. i generally find that acting supports a relatively weak script, however in this movie's case, i felt that the relatively weak script was supporting the awful acting. i personally was not very impressed with the acting strictly because the reactions felt very forced and everything was very overdone. all in all i was not impressed at all with this film, regardless of past ratings."
"AlsExGal","10","9","13","18 April 2016"," Where do I begin?...
","and how do I end a review of this film? Well bear with me while I try.<br/><br/>Why is Citizen Kane a great film and yet so hard to review? Because it is like a big ball of yarn with the ends of many threads sticking out. You can just yank on any thread, start writing, and go on forever. Let me start with its style, which is discussed in great detail in the late Roger Ebert's excellent commentary on the DVD of the film. Its unusual photography, editing, scene transitions, etc. are why it is shown in film school.For example, the lap dissolves in the scene with Joseph Cotten in the old-folks home were very unusual. The scene of Cotten talking dissolves into a flashback scene with Kane, and half-way through the dissolve, we see Cotton on the left side of the screen and the Kane flashback on the right side, and that is held for several seconds. It is a dissolve into a split screen by means of very clever lighting. The lights fade out on the right side of the Cotten scene, and they fade up on the right side of the Kane scene. That technique had never been done before, and I've seen it in only one or two movies made after that.<br/><br/>Then there is the story, the theme of which seems to be uttered by the reporters near the end of the film, as they give up searching for the meaning of Kane's last word - ""Rosebud"". They say Kane was a man who, though one of the wealthiest men in the world ,lost everything he ever had, even though he died rich. And so the story we have been watching is, on the surface, just that. The final scene showing you Kane's possessions that are considered of no value by auditors being tossed into the flames of an incinerator - one happening to be a sled with the name ""Rosebud"" on it, the sled Kane was playing on the day he became a rich man - as a child through a quirk of fate.<br/><br/>I used to be in the camp that believed that the snow globe was representational of Kane's nostalgia for his boyhood home and maybe for the sled. I no longer believe his attachment to the piece has anything to do with his pre-wealth youth. I think it reminds him of a time much later than that. That snow globe actually was a possession belonging to Susan Alexander before Kane ever met her, sitting on her dressing table in her small apartment. Kane picked up the globe during his rampage in her bedroom in Xanadu when she left him. Holding that globe abruptly put an end to his destruction of her bedroom. Why? I think it links back to the evening when they met and Alexander had no idea who he was. That night Charles Foster Kane was just a ""schoolboy"" who could wiggle his ears and do shadow puppets to impress a thoughtful and attractive young lady. This courtship was a period in their relationship that we can assume was not influenced by his money. For that one evening, he wasn't the richest man in the country. No other relationship that Kane had, once he was wrested from his sled as a child, began in that same manner. All the other people surrounding Kane as an adult were near him because of, or with full knowledge of, his wealth and power. Jed Leland was a friend from his college days. Mr. Bernstein was an employee. The first wife, who was met and courted on a buying tour of Europe, would know who Charles Foster Kane was when they met. Only Susan Alexander came into his life completely carefree of his wealth. And she brought with her that snow globe.<br/><br/>While holding the snow globe as he lay dying, Kane isn't thinking about the cabin in Colorado or his sled - even if that is the scene depicted in the snow globe. (What an odd coincidence that she would own a snow globe with a cabin and sled in it when they met. That is a bigger ""huh?"" than who heard Kane's last words.) Kane is thinking about this very personal artifact that belonged to Susan Alexander, the woman who, in spite of a toothache, offered some kind assistance to a stranger one night long ago.<br/><br/>Why does Kane whisper ""Rosebud"" on his death bead and not ""Susan.""? I don't know. Perhaps it is just where his mind wandered while reminiscing about that evening in a young woman's apartment when he was detoured from going to the warehouse that stored the artifacts of his youth.<br/><br/>What are the other threads you could pull on and write paragraphs about? Kane's parents and why his mother did what she did, apparently never seeing her son again once she turned him over to be raised by bankers, somehow seeing this as an act of love. Then there is the issue of memory and how people are not what they seem to be - the apparent sycophant Mr. Bernstein seeming to have a great deal of wisdom and depth in his old age that you would not have foreseen when he was young - he talks about a girl he saw on a ferry 40 years before and how a day hasn't passed that he hasn't thought of her. How Kane liked being ""the voice and defender of the masses"" but maybe didn't like the idea that maybe someday those masses would organize and demand their rights, as Jed Leland had said on his way out of Kane's life. And on it goes.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if this review is a bit disorganized, but ""Citizen Kane"" is not linear storytelling, or any other kind that I can identify with one word, yet it is storytelling at its best."

","Citizen Kane is the perfect film.  The story is so detailed, yet told magnificently in just two hours.  The meaning of the word Rosebud is something that makes you think about your own life, and what the meaning of love means to you.  Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is a nasty, greedy old man who wants nothing in this world but to please himself.  The fact that he can't love anyone is a wonderful touch to the already wonderfully filmed movie.  I've seen this movie four times on video, and I'll see it again and again.   ****"

","Any (re)viewers who came away with negative impressions of Kane probably made the mistake of watching the film on video. You should never approach a classic film in anything but a proper movie theatre. Would you watch ""2001"" at home on a 14"" screen? You would! Why? Watching 2001 on anything other than a full-size movie screen, or even better an IMAX screen, is a waste of time. Its grandeur cannot be appreciated under home conditions, pausing the film every 10 minutes to check on the laundry.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has a lot more plot than 2001, but the problem is the same. Everything that's daring and exciting about the direction -- the crazy camera angles, the freakish tracking shots, the wildly imaginative changes in mood and lighting -- you don't get anything of that on a tiny screen. All you get at home are the clever plot, brilliant dialogue, and great performances, but even so I find Kane boring at home too. Oh, and don't forget the subversive assault on the necessarily irresponsible use of corporate power. Off hand, I can't think of a single Welles film that works on a TV screen. Well, maybe Touch of Evil, since it's so heavily plotted. But with Ambersons, Lady From Shanghai, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight, to cite just a few quickly, you're just ruining it for yourself getting your first exposure at home.<br/><br/>There's a second-run movie theatre somewhere near you that needs your support and probably shows nice, scratchy prints of Kane, exactly the kind that everyone who loves Kane saw their first time.<br/><br/>I'm one of the people who thinks the AFI list is a bad joke which can safely be ignored. By accident, some great films did manage to wind up on the list. Citizen Kane is one of them.<br/><br/>As our Neapolitan compatriot, who most graciously excluded his own country's Ladri di biciclette from consideration, says, Citizen Kane is ""il più grande film della storia del Cinema"". I think it's the greatest in cinematic history as well. Yeah, and it's boring at home."

","There is no doubt about it that Wells did groundbreaking stuff as far as how he filmed this movie, which adds support for many critics claiming this to be the best movie of all time. Both the story and acting are equally as enjoyable. So...why do so many people dislike Citizen Kane? Because there's no action and no killing. It's easy to see that many Americans want to see movies that are superficial with tons of action. These movies are certainly enjoyable to watch, but they're a dime a dozen. Many Americans also dislike black and white movies on the simple fact that they don't have color. (""Many"" doesn't indicate a majority, just a statistically significant amount.) The last ""drawback"" that Citizen Kane possesses is that it is already highly acclaimed. People hear so much about this movie that what they expect is a completely unattainable level of greatness, and many people already know the significance of rosebud prior to seeing this movie for the first time. However, despite these ""drawbacks"" Citizen Kane still manages to hit the top ten on IMDb. As other reviewers advise, watch this movie for what it is. Don't expect action, killing, explosions, or CG effects. Expect filming ingenuity, great acting, and a great story."

","It never gets old. I remember I first watched it back in 2008, and I was mesmerized, it sucked me in like Star Wars did when I was seven. It never ceases to be entertaining and fun, and yet Kane is such a sad character. Seen only from the perspectives of his friends after his death and from the cold machinery of a newsreel, no one really knows Kane, and sadly not even Kane himself, who after being second-guessed out of his childhood and subsequently second-guessing himself throughout life in search of his new stage or ""snowglobe"" in which to play, finds himself gazing through his own void, in pain and depression, with only the frozen memory of his happiness uttered in eternity through the walls of his palace in a single word. Through greed and misanthropy disguised in benevolent intentions Kane finds himself in a prison of things and empty halls, all new toys he acquired and just as hastily discarded, still a child when he played newspaper man, collecting his statues like action figures, all more things to fill the empty void in his life. When the one person he comes close to loving, Susan Alexander, leaves him, he no longer has anything to cling to and so destroys himself and lives a life of regret and longing. Susan Alexander is the only one who might have got through cage and saved him, someone who knew nothing of his reputation but just liked him for a night, but he imprisons her too like a pet.<br/><br/>The film shows the effect Kane's lifelong self-destruction has on others, particularly Susan Alexander who ends up depressed and alone, and Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten is great as always) the cynic who sees through Kane's glib charm for what he is.<br/><br/>I can relate to Kane, he's a very human character I think many can relate to. He may have had a way out of his pain with Susan Alexander, but it never happened, the damage was done early on. He was taken away from his sled and into the care of a cold, serious, heartless man upon discovery of gold on his mother's land. His mother seemed very attached and maybe he wanted to be perfect in his mother's eyes too, Leland mentioned that he loved his mother.<br/><br/>In the end it seems there is catharsis for Kane, as all his possessions are burned and his precious sled too, the truth of his famous last word incinerated forever into the atmosphere. It's very powerful and striking to see all the worth of this man's life turned into black smoke. The imagery in the film is striking and the way it's filmed too. Seeing Kane walk through a hall of mirrored reflections really makes me you feel his loneliness visually, and that's what cinema is all about.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is held up on a pedestal, and much has been and written about it, but beyond the huge importance it has in film history, it's just a really entertaining, fun classic that anyone can watch and enjoy and relate to, not just film buffs, and that's why it's so fondly remembered."

","Citizen Kane is a great movie, a first of its kind to include a novelistic character arc, depth, scope and technical innovations that hadn't been so successfully directed previously, although given that hundreds of thousands of films were produced throughout the 20th Century, the claim that Kane is the ""greatest movie of all time"" is just glowing hyperbole.<br/><br/>But is the film really good? Yep. Follows the story of an impoverished child that lucks out with a land deed that makes him a super-wealthy industrialist (a plutocrat, really) and owner of multiple newspapers, he's a media tycoon and philanthropist who's designs for nationwide (global?) power and influence are bought down by the sensationalistic media and personality politics that he himself had made a lions share of his fortune from.<br/><br/>The acting is strong, every scene and sentence either moves the plot forward or develops character - if only Hollywood movies these days could follow these two concepts without digressing into pointless CGI ""franchise"" movies that infantalize their audience and dazzle them with computer rendered frames that the brain unconsciously recognizes as fake anyway, but besides all that, Kane is a movie about a seemingly real man, and an era: the American century.<br/><br/>I don't subscribe to the notion of American exceptionalism, and am not actually American at all (even if I did live there, I wouldn't consider myself) but the film is really about the birth of a culturally, and economically new power apart from ""the old country"", with new values, new leaders and new forms of equality and mass media. The film also explores the inherent contradictions and hypocrisies of the new ruling class of the 20th century; Kane goes from being a genuinely useful idealist, to being an obscenely wealthy fool, trying to dignify the lot of the working class (his own social roots) by pushing a music retail clerk and mediocre stage singer to the level of stardom through his own great wealth and media influence. You can see parallels to today's society in every sequence of Citizen Kane, and its worth seeing more than once."

Citizen Kane has a lot of story behind the scenes. Orson Wells based the movie on a man named William Randolf Hearst. When the movie released, Hearst wanted Citizen Kane to be destroyed, and never seen by anyone because the movie pretty much tells about his entire life. There is so much more about what happened in between Hearst and Wells, but it is an amazing story. Citizen Kane is a perfect definition of an excellent movie.

With that he dies releasing an ornament that crashes to the floor such as his life. During his life he had alienated himself from everyone, focusing on a political career. Those who knew him are interviewed examining the meaning of his final words. Speculations evaporate into flashbacks to show his brief childhood to his introduction into the world of politics.

Outstanding supporting work by Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloane who portray friends of Kane's who also worked with him, and both with different results career wise. Dorothy Comingore plays his mistress who grows tired and depressed until her only option is to leave. Agnes Moorehead plays Kane's mother who reluctantly makes the decision along with his father that ultimately affects his entire life.

No one film is the supreme film, as there is no one book that is the best, no one song and so on.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is Orson Welles debut feature made in 1941. He was commissioned to make it by RKO features after he got some fame from the now infamous 1938 broadcast of the war of the worlds. He got the chance to develop his own script use his own actors and crew and had a lot of creative control and thus we got Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is about a man: his life, his trials, his tribulations, his ups, his downs and finally his death. The movie opens with what is now one of the most iconic scenes in movie history. An aging Charles Foster Kane played by Orson welles himself lets slip a snowglobe as he utters his final words "" Rosebud ""<br/><br/>From then on we are taken on a journey through his life. And we watch the talent of welles unfold. Maybe it is his career in radio and theatre but Welles can do one thing and that is tell a story. There is not one dull or uninteresting moment in the film. The story unfolds in a brilliant manner and you are completely sucked into the world of Charles Foster Kane that is so well created by Welles and portrayed by his hand picked crew<br/><br/>Welles has created a fascinating character study in Charles Foster Kane. There have been so many great men and everyone has always tried to scratch away at the surface at try to reach the whole truth about what a man was. Welles tries to show that there is no one truth or no one answer to a man's life. Life is so vast and so varied that every man at one point is occupied in living so man different lives that it is impossible for anyone to gauge what one action or one word meant.<br/><br/>The final monologue is filled with profundity. Even if parts of the movie seem aged (none did to me) that final monologue will always remain relevant as will the movie .<br/><br/>And I am giving it a 10 not because I am another admirer of the emperor's new clothes. I could have given it an 8 or a 9 but now it has become cool to hate Citizen Kane. To protest against these people citizen Kane deserves a 10"

"elgronko","10","6","8","14 August 2009"," Citizen Kane, Rosebud and Little Big Horn
","I have something to add to the various layers of meaning that Rosebud may harbour, that I don't think has yet been mentioned on this site. I recently learned that the Rosebud was the name of the main river of which the Little Big Horn was a tributary, and was also the scene of a battle between the Americans and the Sioux during which the American forces were routed. As a direct result of this they were not able to arrive in time to prevent the defeat of Custer's Ninth Cavalry at the battle of Greasy Grass. The subsequent massacre by the Sioux provoked outrage throughout America, leading to the destruction of the Sioux nation and, by inference, native American culture.<br/><br/>Could this have something to do with the movie's theme about the loss of America's innocence through the allegorical figure of Kane? It seems likely that this was considered when choosing the name of Kane's sled, and adds, for me, yet another layer of meaning to this phenomenal piece of cinema."
"gentendo","10","6","8","3 December 2007"," Theme through Music and Sound
","The theme of this film is supported through its use of music and sound: The self-centered attraction for money, power and materialism leads to a loss of childhood innocence, pollution of family, empty and shallow values, and an inevitable self-realization of retrospective regret. The opening scene begins with a darkening minor bass-horn which produces a cold, mysterious, and empty atmosphere. The viewer sees a mega-mansion in the background perched on top of a hill with a luminous light spilling out through an open window. As images of the mansion move closer and closer towards the window, the music crescendo's louder and louder and finally climaxes with a sudden bass/drum roll as the light turns off inside. The tension and release of the parallel music here suggests that something dramatic has, or is about to take place inside that room. It is a musical cue to what the viewer is about to uncoverthat is, the light of the world's largest newspaper tycoon has just turned off, or died. <br/><br/>Diegetic and non-diegetic music is used frequently throughout the film to help convey the rise of Kane's empire of selfishness, his attraction for money and power, his manipulation on public opinion, and the pollution of his family. A diegetic song written specifically to hail Kane as a great newspaper publisher is sung during a banquet party his staff throws for him. Here Kane is seen as the center of attention as he dances with a group of women who flower over him and sing praises to his name. This song expressly demonstrates the rise of Kane's egotism. Even earlier in the film during the news reel sequence, a tapestry of events from Kane's life is displayed with non-diegetic drums and pompous horns to help reflect Kane's smugness towards money and power. During a time-lapsed sequence over Kane eating breakfast with his first wife, both mickey-mousing and non-diegetic elements are used to heighten the disintegration of his first marriage. Fast-paced camera swipes (accompanied with the tingling of bells and strings) are mickey-moused with the progression of each sceneshowing the further decay of their marriage each time. The non-diegetic music becomes more and more morose to enhance and foreshadow the inevitable divorce. Sound is also used to capture the empty and regretful life of Kane. During a particular scene with his second wife constructing a jigsaw puzzle, he engages her in a shallow conversation about not wanting to move to New York. As he walks through the immensely spacious halls of the mansion, their voices are heard deeply echoing off the empty and lonely wallsgiving the impression of isolation. This diegetic sound is to reflect Kane's inner emptiness and loss of personal childhood innocence to the debauchery of materialism. <br/><br/>Sound becomes dramatic and crucial in the scene where Kane's second wife leaves him. As he tears apart the materialized and wealthy room he has built for her, foley sounds are heard emphasizing the crashing of chairs and shelves, and the ripping of pillows and blankets. The sound increasing here reflects Kane's retrospective regret in all that he has lost and also that which was most dear to him. The intensity of these sounds then contrasts perfectly when he picks up the snow-globeall sounds vanish. In the midst of silence, the viewer then hears a faint and muffled, ""Rosebud"", from Kane's mouth. The sound of this word resonates with the viewer; echoing forth Kane's long-lost childhood to when he was first taken from the innocence and youth of his home and forced into the scandalous and corrupt world of politics and media."
"Uliabes","10","6","8","20 October 2007"," Nothing like it....
","When it comes to Citizen Kane, one question eclipses all others: Is it the best film ever made? The answer, for me anyway, is yes.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is still easily THE greatest films ever made. Its not 'one of', or 'the second', its the FINEST. I don't think any film will ever over-shadow it, either. Its one of the most famous, as it (successfully) broke every cinematic boundary in the book. It introduced countless innovations that are today a common part of film-making.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an unforgettable image of a distant, fog-shrouded castle on a hill. It's a classic Gothic shot, and goes a long way towards establishing Citizen Kane's mood. We quickly learn that this place, called Xanadu, is the dwelling of America's Kubla Khan, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a one-time newspaper magnate who could have become President if not for an ill-advised extramarital affair. Xanadu, in the words of the faux newsreel that gives a brief history of Kane's life, is the ""costliest monument of a man to himself."" Any resemblance to The Ranch, William Randolph Hearst's real-life San Simeon abode, is not coincidental.<br/><br/>In the opening, Kane is dead, and utters the word 'rosebud' as he hunches over. His death, like his life, is a big news event, and the paper he owned, the New York Inquirer, is desperate to unearth the meaning of his cryptic last word. Is it a woman he bedded? A horse he bet on? A beloved pet? Some long-lost, unrequited love? The truth, which isn't revealed until the closing scene, represents one of the all-time greatest motion picture ironies, and leads us to believe that, on some level, Kane regretted not having led a simple, quiet life. A ten minuet newsreel follows this to exhibit his larger-than-life accomplishments.<br/><br/>After this, reporters and the public in general, begin to investigate what he actually meant by 'rosebud'. The film dips into flashbacks (in chronology), to search for 'rosebud's significance. It also shows interviews with his loved (and loathed) ones, to see if they have any inkling to what it may mean.<br/><br/>The movie is a visual masterpiece, a kaleidoscope of daring angles and breathtaking images that had never been attempted before, and has never been equaled since. Every image is depicted with incredible detail, and beauty.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Citizen Kane is far ahead of its time. Uncompromising, unsentimental drama of this sort was not in vogue during an era that was better known for titles like The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, and How Green Was My Valley (which beat out Kane for best picture).<br/><br/>Not only is this film-making at its best, but motion picture archives and collections across the world would be poorer without copies of this film, which will forever be recognized as a defining example of American cinema."

","It starts at the ending and then makes its way from the beginning to the end through multiple viewpoints.  Not a very odd concept in 2003, but in 1941, when `Citizen Kane' was made, this was a very rare and not well thought of way to make a movie.<br/><br/>`Citizen Kane' appeared to be very ahead of its time with the structure of the story to the lighting effects/shadowing used throughout it.<br/><br/>`Citizen Kane' is the story of a small boy that is taken away from his parents (with the permission of his mother) by a businessman and the story of his life after that.<br/><br/>Growing up with his birth parents, he didn't really have a lot going for him except the love of his parents.  Yet, when he grew up with his new `family' he had the chance to inherit many different things, yet he chose a small newspaper, called the Inquirer.<br/><br/>Among the millions of dollars he was already worth, his newspaper started to become big and the movie portrays his adventures in relationships with him and with others throughout his life.<br/><br/>When the director (Orson Wells.also the man character of the movie) and creators of `Citizen Kane' were making the film, they almost wanted to give up because they though no one would want to watch the movie, nor would they like it.  Yet, in reality, `Citizen Kane' became known as the best movie in history and the influence of every movie today.<br/><br/>The movie is very unique in many ways and it's uniqueness pays off in the end.<br/><br/>You may be skeptical of the power and influence of this movie during the first half, but as long as you pay attention and put thought into the movie, it comes out as one of the best movies you've ever seen.<br/><br/>Once you've watched this movie, you'll have an entirely different perspective on movies and when you get out of them in general.<br/><br/>`Citizen Kane' is a bizarre, though provoking movie that some may not like, but as long as you're someone with the ability to think for yourself, you should thoroughly enjoy this movie."

I just could not relate to the story. It is about a tycoon who becomes a recluse, it sounds like a good story but it was so long and drawn out I fell asleep and had to stop watching. I was disappointed mainly because the first time AFI came out with the top 100 movies of all time I wanted to see the best of the best. Many of the top 100 films I had seen, many more I hadn't (seen) and a few of the ones I hadn't seen were films in AFI's top ten.

"loza-1","1","41","81","24 May 2005"," The Hyperbole of Genius
","All the pseuds say it; all the polls of the ""greatest films ever made"" say it: this is the greatest film ever made. Orson Welles, in between mouthfuls, shows his genius once again.<br/><br/>But things are never quite what they seem.<br/><br/>Take all that brouhaha about ""The War of the Worlds."" All those people thinking that the Martians had really landed. Or did they? I have heard this play twice, and I have to say that I cannot see anybody being taken in by a radio play that is not particularly good. Indeed when you dig up the contemporary newspapers, you can see a distinct absence of named people; and the articles smack of having been written before the broadcast even went out. At the time, the Mercury Theatre was being threatened with the termination of their radio series: they were that bad! What better to keep them on the air than the biggest load of hype in entertainment history. It is reckoned by some historians that not a single person headed for the hills as a result of this radio programme.<br/><br/>But surely Orson Welles answered his critics in ""Citizen Kane."" Didn't he?<br/><br/>Well if taking the story of Hearst, blackening the reputation of Marion Davies, and pinching unusual camera angles from other directors, like Michael Curtiz, is genius, then Orson Welles is a genius and ""Citizen Kane"" is indeed the greatest film ever known.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that if people go around shilling Orson Welles as a genius, the pseuds will be stupid enough to believe it.<br/><br/>But don't take my word for it. See The Adventures of Robin Hood, which predates Citizen Kane. There you will see all the unusual angles you will wish to see. Curtiz even has a couple of shots taken from the fireplace, the difference between Kane and Robin Hood is that in Robin Hood, the fire is lit. Also in Robin Hood you will see moving camera shots a-plenty, especially in the opening scene in the great hall at Nottingham Castle, which means that the often repeated statement that Orson Welles invented moving camera shots in Citizen Kane is utter drivel. I will repeat it just in case the pseuds miss it yet again: Citizen Kane is NOT the first film to use moving camera shots and Orson Welles did NOT invent this technique.<br/><br/>If you want to call Michael Curtiz a genius, I have no problem with that. He certainly has more right to that appellation than has Orson Welles.<br/><br/>But I can be wrong. And I have been proved wrong. I once said to a friend of mine: ""Is it just me, or is Citizen Kane the most overrated film ever made?""<br/><br/>He replied: ""You are wrong. Citizen Kane is a great film. whenever it is shown on television, I never sleep better.""<br/><br/>As someone who has fallen asleep in front of Citizen Kane myself, I just had to admit that I was wrong.<br/><br/>And all those people who stayed at home instead of going to the cinema, making Citizen Kane a box-office flop. They were wrong, too. <br/><br/>Or were they?"
"joshuafagan-64214","10","7","10","3 February 2016"," Still Great After 75 Years
","Like most anyone who has watched this movie over the last fifty years or so, I was introduced to it by a great number of people proclaiming it to be the greatest movie of all time. So at the age of fourteen, I got it from the library, popped it in, and had my understanding of film changed forever.<br/><br/>I do not consider this the greatest movie of all time. But it is the most important movie of all time. It is arguable that film should be divided into two eras: the pre-Citizen Kane era and the post-Citizen Kane era. There are enough revolutionary techniques and ideas to make a film lover's head spin. But one thing a lot of people overlook is just how good this movie is on its own right.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe it is a film version of an acclaimed twenty-century novel. There is sharp symbolism, highly developed characters, a somber mood, and nuanced discussions about broken dreams and the human condition.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of those types of stories, you will enjoy Citizen Kane. If you're not, you may not, but do yourself a favor and watch it anyway. Just like every literate adult should have already read The Great Gatsby and Of Mice and Men, every filmwatching should have already seen this movie. If you have not, I suggest you take care of that.<br/><br/>Me? I adore The Great Gatsby, like Of Mice and Men, and will watch this film over and over again. It concerns a reporter trying to track down the meaning of the last word of the famous media Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. Along the way, he talks to various people who knew Kane and gets many different sides of the story. He ends up not finding out the meaning of that last word, but we, the viewers, do.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not gonna spoil what Rosebud is- this despite the fact that it has basically become shorthand for 'spoiled twist'- but I will say that it fits with the themes of the movie quite nicely. This is the right way to do a twist. One thing many directors and screenwriters forget is that twists are not merely supposed to be shocking; they are supposed to add to the story in a fundamental way. Most good stories I've seen get this. All bad stories I've heard do not. It is a fundamental and simple concept, so I have to wonder how so many directors and screenwriters miss it.<br/><br/>Speaking of directors and screenwriters, for this film, they are one in the same. Mr. Orson Welles fills both roles and acts in the titular role, pulling off the most astounding triple play in movie history. Any triple play is incredible in this industry, but doing it in one of the greatest films of all time: that's impressive.<br/><br/>There is a scene midway through the film where Kane walks through a hall of mirrors. It stuck in my mind, and it sticks in the minds of almost everyone who watches this movie. I cannot think of a better example of the power of visual storytelling. An amateur filmmaker would have just had Kane ramble off his emotions. But Welles, taking advantage of his medium, crafted one of the most haunting and memorable scenes in cinematic history. If you have a friend who won't shut up about how books are better than movies, show them this film and point out this scene.<br/><br/>One thing that surprises many inexperienced filmwatchers is how this film only won one Oscar. Yes, a film said by many to be the greatest of all time only received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Best Director? How Green Was My Valley. Best Cinematography? How Green Was My Valley. Best Art Direction? How Green Was My Valley. Best Picture? How Green Was My Valley.<br/><br/>Now, How Green Was My Valley is not a bad film. I suggest you watch it if you have nothing better to do. But it's no Citizen Kane. I doubt many of you have heard of it.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, this was not simply a case of poor decision making, though you could find much of that if you look in the annals of past Oscars. Media mogul William Randolph Hearst believed this film to be about him in all but name (very arguable) and said it was a negative portrayal (eh) that misrepresented him (definitely not). He could not get all copies of the movie destroyed or anything like that, but he did fight it at every turn, and he is likely the main reason why the film did not get more Oscars.<br/><br/>Ironically enough, William Randolph Hearst's name is one that has somewhat been eroded by the passage of time. The only thing many people in my generation know about him is that he likely inspired this movie. So it turns out that the film he fought against ended up giving him a form of immortality.<br/><br/>Kane is one of the most complicated characters in all of film, and more importantly, all his complexities mean something. Nothing feels like it's there just to make the character more complex. The result is a brilliantly textured story, one that can be loved even by people who aren't typically into this type of arc.<br/><br/>This film does not only feel revolutionary, it feels alive. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is the first film to feel truly, cinematically alive. There were great films made before it; among them are Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz and King Kong. But those films were merely sweeping, brilliant stories put on film. This is a unique, cinematic experience."
"jackhall-17335","10","7","10","28 November 2015"," Masterpiece
","Citizen Kane is a beautiful film that reveals new treasures each time you watch it. The first time I watched it I didn't care much for the film or the characters but after about 10-15 viewings it's gotten to the point that the last 40 minutes have me on the verge of tears. The reason is that each time I watch it I learn more about the character and it becomes such a tragedy as you watch. The camera work in the film is so beautiful and based on the other films I've seen from before this film came out it seems that this was the first movie to make the camera itself a character. However no character in film history is more interesting than Kane. Every word he says seems to be a contradiction or spite until you realize that the whole time Kane was simply a puppet trying to grab hold of his own strings destroying himself in the process."

","When I think of perfect films I think of godfather, vertigo, psycho, Schneider's list etc. but comparing those films to citizen Kane is a crime. I watched this film when I was 13 and was bored to death, throughout the entire film I was wondering what all the hype was about, then I was wondering what rosebud meant, it was listed #1 on rotten tomatoes and I was confused, was it something I missed? I watched Steven spiel bergs masterpiece black and white film Schneider's list and I was mesmerized, I sat down and rematches the film for a second time, and liked it so much I watched it a third, almost a year later I have seen it almost 10 times. Why is Orion Welles considered one of the greatest directors in the world? I don't know either, but all I know is if anyone made Kane as their debut film today, they would within the likes of Charles Chaplin, Nolan, Spielberg, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood even woody Allen. This film is my favorite movie ever made, and although Welles never made a movie this good again, he made this classic and for that I'm grateful."

","Citizen Kane was an incredible film. I was sort of mesmermized by it, more so the camera work with the unusual angles than with the story. I liked the way Orson Welles played with time and the beginning was really the end and the film was told through flashbacks which were really told by different characters. There were a few grand, grand scenes that I really enjoyed-the party at the newspaper with the dancers, ice sculptures, and the rousing song. I was overwhelmed by the scene when Charles Kane was giving his campaign speech. I did start to lose interest in the story somewhere in the middle and really felt no sympathy connection with Charles Kane. Maybe I wasn't supposed to connect with him, as his character was larger than life and because we learn about him through others recollection of him, making him mysterious and unknown. We can only infer from his last word that he was forever impacted by being torn from a place that he held such dear memories of. This film made you realize that you were looking at a film and not someone's real story."
"Imaginist","10","7","10","18 February 2006"," Citizen Kane (5/5)
","""Citizen Kane"" has often been called the greatest film in cinematic history, and with good reason: it is a stroke of genius on the part of Orson Welles. He was only 25 when he directed this film, and yet he pioneered some of the most amazing cinematography and production techniques of his day or any other. At a first glance, ""Kane"" is a rather simple story: a young boy, Charles Foster Kane (played wonderfully by Orson Welles) inherits a large fortune and winds up dying alone and unhappy--his last words being the infamous ""rosebud."" Although it seems like a rather cut and dry endeavor, it is so much more than that, mainly because the film is done in flashbacks. <br/><br/>We begin with Kane's death and then move backwards and forwards through his life, in an attempt to find out what ""rosebud"" means. This is brilliant editing on Welles part; he takes a simple story and creates a complex mesh. Through these many flashbacks we slowly but surely begin to learn of Kane and those around him, and this creates quite the portrait. Welles almost always shoots Kane and other strong characters from a low angle, making them appear lager than life--this especially aids in the character development of Kane. Before this film, using camera angles in such a way was scarcely heard of, but here we see a new technique:Welles shows us that angles can do more than just make a movie look""pretty.""<br/><br/>Another fascinating technique Welles employs for character development is set design. Whenever Kane is present, it seems that the ceilings are lower, for examples one should look at Kane's publishing house, and some of the rooms in his mansion. This further demonstrates Kane's massive size and power, and at the same time higher ceilings are used when more inferior characters are used. For example, a newspaper reporter interested in solving the mystery of rosebud, is first shown in a great hall looking at some old records and memoirs belonging to Kane's old guardian, Mr. Thatcher. Because of this we recognize that this reporter is not important, but rather only secondary. Also, Kane's second wife is often sitting in the largest rooms the Kane mansion, which makes her look rather small. <br/><br/>However, the best example of how Welles uses set pieces to enforce Kane's power is when he is running for governor. Here, Kane makes a speech to a very large crowd, and behind him is a mammoth picture of himself. Of course, what is also amazing about this scene is that Welles discovers a new technique called deep focus: he is able to simultaneously keep the large picture and Kane in focus, giving the illusion of depth. After this speech Kane is all set to win the governor's race, but through a twist of some dirty politics, he looses, and soon after, his first wife leaves him. Of course, to anyone paying attention this comes as no surprise--we know there has been distance between Kane and his wife for quite some time. However, we do not receive this information through dialog but rather through Welles brilliance use of subtlety. Welles shows us several scenes of the couple sitting together and having breakfast. Each breakfast encounter comes and goes with great speed leading into a dissolve which then takes us to another breakfast meal. We see the couple slightly bickering, but the way Welles shoots the scene it looks as though they are still eating breakfast right next to each other, which does not usually indicate tension. However, the last frame of this breakfast montage shows a wide shot of the couple, and we see them sitting at a much bigger table then they were first sitting at, and they are also sitting directly opposed to each other. This part of the film tells us a wealth of information, and all because of a set piece (a table), the clever use of editing, and the camera placement. No other film maker before or since this movie has used these technical aspects to flesh out so many details, not only about the characters, but about the story.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about Welles is how much information he is able to convey using subtlety and some simple yet poignant dialogs. Welles does not hit the viewer in the face with his film like so many movies in this day and age (i.e. anything done by Michael Bay), but instead he opts for letting the audience come to their own conclusions. And when I had mulled over this film, the conclusion I came to was rather depressing: Charles Foster Kane had all the money and power in the world but this could not buy him love, and like most of us, he never comes to realize that simple fact, which in the end left him bitter and lonely. Thinking about all of this was rather heart wrenching, but what really drove it home was when I came to discover the meaning of ""rosebud"": it was one of Kane's childhood toys. That to me is most upsetting of all: the only time Kane was ever truly happy was when he was a child--when he was free from his wealth.<br/><br/>Kane could have said or thought of anything in the world on his deathbed, but instead he chose to reflect on his short-lived childhood. Now if that doesn't get you misty eyed, not much else will. I recommend ""Citizen Kane"" to any mature person looking for a deep and intricate film, in which there is much more than there first appears. However, it is probably wise to watch the movie twice, in order to discover all the little and large things Orson Welles so masterfully paints on his canvas of celluloid. All and all I give ""Citizen Kane"": 5 out of 5 stars.<br/><br/>Copyright 2006 Imaginist"
"Chris-435","10","7","10","1 March 1999"," The Melville of Cinema
","The careers of Orson Welles and Herman Melville are eerily similar...there is the great early work that is thought by some to be the alpha and omega of their respective forms (Citizen Kane and Moby Dick), there is the long eclipse, there is the great late work rediscovered (Touch of Evil or (the yet to be rediscovered and absolutely flabbergasting) Chimes at Midnight and Billy Budd, sailor), and there is the irrepressible mindf**k (F for Fake and The Confidence Man). But even more than that, Welles and Melville were the two most disillusioned artists America ever produced, which goes a long way toward explaining why average people interested in the arts as mere ""entertainment"" don't like their work. Both Kane and Ahab are singularly unpleasant individuals who are crushed by the cosmos in one way or another in spite of their indomitable defiance. These are not pleasant archetypes in the least...but they are infinitely more valuable than all the ""heroes"" of popular fiction. Welles and Melville take a speculum to the human condition by testing these characters to destruction. Citizen Kane has one of the most difficult structures in film. Its fractured narrative prevents the viewer from truly understanding Kane--but this is the point of the movie...why else would the film conspicuously leave out one crucial viewpoint (Kane himself)? In this respect, Citizen Kane is also a lot like Hamlet, which is similarly impenetrable. Anyone who demands identification with the ""hero"" is going to be sorely taxed by Kane--this separates the men from the boys, so to speak.<br/><br/>Is Citizen Kane THE greatest film of all time? Of course not. To declare that any film holds that honor is ludicrous. After all, once a certain level of craftsmanship is attained, once a certain level of insight is expressed, these distinctions become meaningless. Star Wars lost the best picture Oscar to Annie Hall in 1977--is one better than the other? The experience of watching either of them is so radically different that the comparison is absolutely invalid...they have nothing in common except their relative excellence. Kane's hold on the honor stems from the fact that it invented more of the language of sound filmmaking than any other movie, but no one claims that the other contender based on that criterion is the greatest film of all time (that would be the extremely controversial Birth of a Nation). Dont get me wrong...Kane is ONE of the greatest films...but no film could or should be asked to stand as the alpha and omega of the art.<br/><br/>Even so, Kane is a harrowing aesthetic experience.<br/><br/>And Kane IS massively entertaining. I resent the notion that a film has to elicit some knee-jerk emotional response to be considered entertaining--having the eye engaged and having the mind challenged ARE entertaining...but I sometimes forget that we as a people more and more value feeling over thought...God help us all.<br/><br/>(If anyone is interested, I also reviewed Cat People (1942)"

","The fascinating mystery drama, the most ambitious and boldest debut film, with time he got labeled as one of the best and most innovative. I will not engage in, nor even parody comparisons. I am only interested in the ""rosebud"". The relentless pursuit of power, empathy and proving are not the essence. Things that no one pays attention are the essence. CITIZEN KANE is a dramatic and narrative masterpiece. The work in which all details of biographical mosaic of one man. A man who is after all a ""big"" except in being true to himself. The man can not be explained in one word, but to man one word can mean almost anything.<br/><br/>The press magnate's only means of stories through which the director demonstrates extremely fresh, innovative and secure access, skillfully guiding the story and the actors, playing with light and shadow, deep personnel and other plans, and creating a whole that attracts maturity. I am delighted by the fact that each average viewer of the film can compose and reconstruct the story of the main character as he wants. The man and the emergence in society. Not many people will find some sort of fund, mainly to raising story to a multitude of disagreements, search and conflict. Man until deep talk with himself will not be able to talk to the world.<br/><br/>Although Kane is incredibly rich and powerful, failing to take advantage of this wealth and power in order to win the election for governor, to promote his second wife as an opera star, or have the love and loyalty of those who surround him. At the end is shown as a lonely old man, imprisoned in his castle, ornate palace which was built to satisfy his ego. His precious things can not replace the emotional loss to the in your life.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I think that . Joseph Cotten (Jedediah Leland), garnered the sympathy of the majority. <br/><br/>Kane is people generally was good fun.

","..in my book, and I have a big book of films. I first saw Kane in the mid 90's and had already acquired a distinct taste in films. The Cohen Brothers, Taratino, Lee, Lynch, these were my favorite directors in the early 90's, and WHAMMM, here comes Welles.<br/><br/>This film gave me goosebumps within the first few minutes. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have ever seen, and the suspense leading up to one single word is amazing. The way the story is told is delightful, and Welles just steals the show. There are so many camera tricks in this film I had seen before though, and it was all in the films by the directors I have just mentioned. One of my favorite things Welles does with the film is how he took out floors to film different angles of himself to look powerful, while most other people in the film are shot from above to seem lower than him. I never realized the influence this film had on other filmmakers, and still see it today in several films.<br/><br/>I can only imagine the excitement and buzz around it when it first came out. It was good for me going into the film knowing of the Hearst family and the true basis behind the films characters.

"theowinthrop","10","8","12","25 April 2007"," An American Colossus and the People Around Him
","There are now 810 comments on this, possibly the greatest of all American films (if not all films). This review is about an issue I always think about - how horrific was Kane to his country, his associates, and his intimates?<br/><br/>Kane's personality is that of a man desperate to try to hold onto the affections of everyone who encounters him. He has had little real family life (as his mother - Agnes Moorehead - makes the blunder of taking him away from a somewhat drunken father - Harry Shannon - and giving his upbringing to a cold banker - George Coulouris). Kane understands what love is, but he has no way of concentrating his idea of it - he is uncertain if he is going to lose the affections of everyone.<br/><br/>If he had been brought up properly he would have been able to do things more stably. Instead he keeps switching personality depending on whom he meets. He is the breezy young newspaper owner who is determined to shake up the fusty paper he bought (to the delight of Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloan, but to the dismay of old time editor Erskine Sanford). He is the crusading liberal in the face of banker Coulouris (as a way of evening scores, and of reminding the banker of how most of the public saw the rich in 1898). He is the young lover to his first wife (Ruth Warwick), but they grow apart. Frequently it is suggested that his first wife Emily was harmless. What is ignored is she's an anti-Semitic bigot about his close associate Bernstein (Sloan). Hardly a harmless type. She also is not very supportive about his political hopes.<br/><br/>The most interesting problems about Kane's personal choices for popularity and love is the ""Alexander"" problems. He meets Susan (Dorothy Comingore) by sheer accident, and the simplest things breaks the ice between them. But Susan does not stop the affair, and it becomes the ""Achilles' Heel"" of Kane's run for Governor of New York. Boss Gettys reveals the relations of Kane and Susan, destroying the former's political career and his marriage. But nobody ever notes the following:<br/><br/>1) Kane was committed to political reform - to end the power of a crooked Boss. Emily's selfishness or anger in not sticking to Charles helps this crook retain power. It's hardly edifying conduct. 2) The public willingly drops supporting Kane in the election - their amusement enhanced by the scandal. But they too are saying they support a crooked Boss and his system. 3) Getty does tell off Kane about his pig-handedness, but this does not explain away his own willingness to use partial extortion (he offered to sit on the story of the love affair if Kane ""discovered"" he was too sick to continue running for Governor - the election is only a few days off!). Actually, despite Ray Collins' splendid handling of the role, Gettys is not an admirable character.<br/><br/>The scandal also affects Kane's friendship with Jed Leland (Cotton). Cotton has already been suspicious when the Enquirer hires away the staff of the Chronicle in 1897. Bernstein makes a cynical comment that these writers can change their opinions to match their new owner's. Leland is not sure (but they don't change Kane's political opinions). When Leland hears about Kane's affair, he becomes a drinker, and he insists on working in Chicago - away from Kane and New York City. Kane really wanted him to remain. <br/><br/>Later, when Susan tries to be an opera singer Leland begins a negative review (that Kane finishes). Kane does fire Leland, but tries to give him a large severance check (which Leland rips up). Susan is a small harpy screaming about Leland's review, and refusing to consider Leland a friend of Kane's (""Friends don't do that!!"", she screams). Kane was ripped apart by these two. Keep in mind, he did not have to marry Susan after the scandal broke - but he did make her his wife. It does not satisfy her. As for Leland, his father died a bankrupt suicide when Kane helped him out. He is certainly an ingrate.<br/><br/>Susan is always denying that she wanted to be an opera singer. Certainly she lacks the voice or talent. But that does not prevent her from continuing a singing career once she divorces Kane. Who's actually lying here?<br/><br/>Gradually the attempts to be all things to all people to keep their love just fails. Kane (at the start) is labeled a Communist by Thatcher at a Congressional hearing, and some spokesman at Union Square (addressing a labor rally) calls him - after a moment of spaced, uncertain waiting, a ""Fascist"". Everyone calls him or looks at him as what they want to look at him as. <br/><br/>What did he do wrong? He revolutionized newspapers. He helped promote the Spanish American War, and the Panama Canal. He helped elect Teddy Roosevelt in 1904. He stood for reform of political government in New York State in 1916. He also stood against the entry into World War I (a point many people to this day feel we should have avoided). He built an opera house in Chicago. His empire shrunk a bit in the Depression, but most remained in tact. His art collecting was outlandish, but it saved many precious items from destruction in World War II. And while he did AT FIRST support the fascist and Nazi leadership (as many prominent leaders and social figures did through 1936 or so), he later denounced them. Actually, Kane turns out to be a pretty useful citizen of the U.S. for his times, not such an ogre.<br/><br/>Can a case be made that this flawed man deserved to be respected? Yes. Bernstein was right - and remains the only friend of his who was faithful to the end."
"barleeku","10","8","12","1 February 2005"," Give Welles due credit as actor
","Enough has been said in the comments about the use of lighting, directorial and editing techniques, etc. I love this movie and each time watch it enthralled. The plot moves along brilliantly, and while many of the techniques have been applied by countless filmmakers since, there's still something about seeing the trailblazer in all its glory - especially as it still holds up. But I just want to give Welles due credit for his acting. I think part of the absolute magic and impact of this film is Welles' ability to transmit a sense of someone larger than life in every way. When he's caught up in the chase of a great story - or the creation of it - his intelligence and vision and sheer conniving brilliance emanate from his every gesture and word. He is expansive and dynamic, he was incredibly handsome, and he seemed to burst from the screen when playing the young Kane. The figure of Welles himself creates a powerful internal tension within the film because he lights up an otherwise dark, morose palette. In many ways, his character has nothing to do with Hearst - Welles himself was a force of nature, and in some ways Citizen Kane is a prophetic vision of his own fate in Hollywood. Welles was a great actor, as was his co-star, Joseph Cotton, one of the great understated actors of the screen. Cotton is a perfect foil for Welles - as he is in that other absolute masterpiece (not directed by Orson), ""The Third Man"" - because he hints at his own uneasy depths which are always being stirred up by Welles, whether as Kane or Harry Lime. I also see the end of Apocalypse Now, with Brando's dark, isolated, ruminating semi-madman as an homage of sorts to Welles alone in Kane's castle at the end of Citizen Kane. The two greatest burn-out male geniuses of the American silver screen, both gorgeous in their time and both expanding into bloated ruins, their ""potential"" often seen as unrealized - but both perhaps having transcended even those expectations of themselves."

","There's not much to say about ""Citizen Kane"" that hasn't already been said. I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in ""Kane"" have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective. I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think ""Kane""'s uniqueness will be apparent. I don't think the film is without flaws. Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags. The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch ""Kane"" for the originality of the story. Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it. When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story? Do you really know what happened to him? <br/><br/>This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised? The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved. That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.<br/><br/>And if none of this is reason enough to watch ""Citizen Kane,"" just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions. Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.<br/><br/>And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role. Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.<br/><br/>And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"DaveDiggler","6","11","18","11 August 2010"," Gaudy Reputation, But a Dull Film
","I really can't find anything in ""Citizen Kane"" worth liking. Do I see what the big fuss is about? Sure. And it is one of the best looking and most well made film of the 40s (from what I've seen. I admittedly don't watch many films from the 40s, because of bad experiences with ""great"" films such as this). ""Citizen Kane"" is a monumental achievement because of some of the technical aspects. I have no reason to watch ""Citizen Kane"" ever again though. I don't particularly like any of the acting, and the story is just dull to me. I don't watch movies for editing, camera work, lighting or technical achievements. Those aspects of filmmaking certainly can greatly help or hurt a film, but without a good script, and without good acting, you just have a good-looking movie. That's the case with ""Citizen Kane."" Supremely directed and extremely well crafted for its time, but I just didn't care for the man or the exposition of most scenes. <br/><br/>A lot of directors can make a good-looking film, and a lot have. The remake of ""All the King's Men"" is wonderfully shot, but the movie is a complete mess that is just butchered by the director (most noticeably the atrocious casting and the shampoo commercial-esque editing). ""All the King's Men"" does have a good performance from Penn, but that's about it. Other than that? It is a terrible movie. ""Citizen Kane"" is not that bad and Welles' direction is far better, but I think it's a similar case were two movies look a lot better than anything that's happening between the characters, or within the story. The characters might be exquisitely framed, but I just didn't care what they had to say. <br/><br/>It is masterfully made for its time and it is a greatly influential film. That's what it is remembered for and what it was always be remembered for. Rosebud comes second. If you rate a movie purely on direction, then you probably give it a high score. If you don't, then your taste will dictate how effective it was. For me, ""Citizen Kane"" is another major disappointment to add to the heap of ""disappointing classics."""

"benjaminburt","10","4","5","28 November 2017"," The ""Bible"" of Movies
","Almost anyone looking for a deeper understanding of film soon hears about ""Citizen Kane,"" often as a comparative measure. ""Such and such film is the 'Citizen Kane' of horror,"" ""Such and such film is the 'Citizen Kane' of bad movies."" What would be a fitting comparative statement regarding the film itself? Simple. Citizen Kane is the 'Bible' of movies.<br/><br/>Despite years of scrutiny and derision, it still holds weight. We see its conventions and style influencing all aspects that surround it. Some people swear by it, while others fail to see its merit. Am I talking about the Bible or Citizen Kane? <br/><br/>To continue the comparison, some people are bored out of their whits by Citizen Kane, much like some people are bored reading the Bible.<br/><br/>Okay, this may be a bit of an exaggeration. But, I must say, Citizen Kane is a monumental film. Citizen Kane, to me, is beyond the simple entertainment we get from watching your average movie. Citizen Kane is a piece of art. Acting, directing, blocking, lighting, cinematography, editing, stage production, and sound design are all on full display. The film is exquisitely crafted, and technically superior in every way.<br/><br/>So, where does the hate come from? Perhaps Citizen Kane's main offense is that it's so simple, so shallow, and rather anticlimactic. When people go to see a movie, generally they want to think and they want to feel. Citizen Kane does not attempt to manipulate feelings or reveal some deep human truth. It's a story of the life of a man.<br/><br/>Watching Citizen Kane, you may not be as invested in the characters or the story as other films, like Lord of the Rings, Vertigo, or the Godfather. It will not evoke emotions like watching Hachi, Big Fish, Shawshank, or Titanic. But, despite this, I cannot call it less than a perfect film. And I don't say that lightly; I give very few films a perfect score.<br/><br/>Orson Welles, they say, borrowed his favorite elements and stylistic choices from contemporary films and applied them to his masterpiece. The result was a film that is composed like a symphony, crafted like a painting, and is overall the most technically superior film I've ever seen. <br/><br/>I hope my review can help you decide whether or not this is for you. For those who examine film as a medium, this film is phenomenal. For those looking to enjoy a film that will engage, morally challenge, or emotionally affect them, this may not be the one for you."

It uses a lot of deep focus, which required a decent amount of skill and was an out-of-the-box thing to do. one indoor scene stands out particularly for its beauty and play with light. the only light coming into the room is natural sunlight streaming in to a dark, smoky room from small windows high on the wall. other scenes were shot from ground level, also an unusual way of filming. ""Citizen Kane"" is really different, really clever, and and excellent film to watch for those who appreciate more than just an interesting story."
"bigredintl","Null","4","5","6 December 2006"," The Lighting Effects Used In 'Citizen Kane'
","The limitations of the movie being in 'black and white' did not hinder the captivation of the viewer. The impact of Citizen Kane lies in mise-en-scene and the technical tools of film-making, lighting, framing, editing and angle. The most prominent cinematic technique used in Citizen Kane is probably the lighting. The director meant for it to be a dark picture with very heavy contrasts, so he used single source lighting. The objective was to use simple lighting devices in order to give the scene a certain ambiance and in some cases, to further develop the characters with the use of shadows. An example of single source lighting is when Thompson is reading Mr. Thatcher's memoirs. This single source light creates a sense of isolation which seems to accentuate Thompson's lonely quest. The way the light illuminates the room also says a great deal about Thatcher's personality, especially by how it illuminates the large portrait of him hanging on the wall. One of the most memorable times in the movie that a single light source was used is the scene where the reporters debate how they will add to the story. The bright light source that comes from the window is so soft that it, complimented by the cigarette smoke, covers most of the room in shadow. As a result, the characters are not easily seen. This scene is effective because it says a great deal about the reporters themselves, or at least how the directors wanted to portray them as; where they are not primary or main characters in the movie. Casting all of the reporters in shadow, implied that the director wanted the reporters to be seen as characters of no importance, not just as characters, but also as an institution when considering the media. The reporter scene also happens to be the strongest use of shadows and light, which is a more prevalent technique, used throughout the film that says more about character intentions and motivations. Shadows are used to express the ethical value of a character; they cast doubt on a character's reliability, or by the absence of shadow, display a character's innocence or truthful intentions. As opposed to the lighting of a scene, the use of shadow is more effective on a character. One of the most touching uses of shadow In the movie is during the scene where Kane reads the Inquirer's ""declaration of principles"", which he wrote. When he does this, he is cast in shadow as he reads the declaration but once he has finished reading, he is cast back into light. This says two things about Kane; regardless of whether his idealism is genuine, Kane does not have a strong enough character to persist with such principles. Shadows heavily used during the confrontation between Boss Gettys and Kane and his wife at the time at Susan Alexander's apartment.<br/><br/>There is one scene in particular where Susan is standing between Gettys and Kane. In this scene both men are cast completely in shadow as opposed to her who is completely in light. This can be used to signify that both men are can be deemed as very dishonest people. Susan on the other hand is the innocent person in this quarrel. She is the victim of both men's ambition, which has forced her between them. Shadows were also used later in the film in order to display Kane's superiority over Susan. This is when she reads the horrible review about her by Leyland in the Enquirer. She tells Kane that she wishes to quit, but he demands that she continues singing. He stands up over her and she is covered by his shadow for a moment, suggesting his dominance over her. He intimidates her and she does continue with her career. Quality, direction, colour and source of light are large aspects of the scene where the reporters decided to find out what 'rosebud' means and therefore state the plot of the film. The quality of light is differentiated throughout the scene. The intensity and direction of the light source change depending upon who is speaking and the sources are intensified as the speaker's relevance increases. The main reporter, Thompson and his editor, Mr. Ralston, are highlighted and shadowed according to how big their roles are at a given time. From the beginning of the scene, Ralston's face is shadowed and his movement around the room is limited. While he is deciphering what he thinks about the news reel depicting Kane's life, his face is shadowed and dark as he moves across the set. Citizen Kane is still respected and admired because of the groundbreaking cinematic techniques that are just as inspirational to filmmakers today as they were fifty years ago."

Later into the film we get the reverse shot, the mirror. Everyone freezes into place as before, but now we see the curtain lift, lights blaring directly in front of us, but the curtain lifts and we don't see an audience. Only pitch black darkness and the song going out to it.<br/><br/>The astounding accomplishment is neither shot individually, even though both are perfectly crafted. It is how much of the world of the film is mapped between them (it would take a Tarkovksy to sustain more internal space between anchors).<br/><br/>One anchor is puppetmasters in control of this image being staged, but not who we thought, not Kane, who watches impotently as part of the audience, not anyone important, only those two ordinary workers on the level of the gods. The reverse of this? Nothingness that contracts space of itself to create something out of nothing, something that fills the void and is light and song calling out.<br/><br/>Between them we have a cosmogony several layers deep, each one generated by an image being staged to frame something out of nothing. It's worth puzzling over the many shots this ties into, all to do with projected light through the dark creating the world of the film.<br/><br/>Something to meditate upon."

","This is a great movie, the best drama ever made. Everything about it is perfect. And the test of it is that no one at the time of its release knew what to do with it, or what to make of the genius of Orson Welles. These two facts themselves engender a tragedy that should, but probably will never be, a film like Citizen Kane. Yes, it was nominated for all the right things. And son of a gun, the Academy ACTUALLY gave CK an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>BEST ACTOR 1941 Sgt. York? I love Gary Cooper, but... BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR 1941 How Green Was My Valley, Best Picture, Best Director? A great film, and by my list of films, John Ford is a great director, but... BEST FILM EDITING 1941 Sgt. York again? Now, come on! Guys, didn't you see that newsreel mock-up stuff, splicing CFK next to Hitler etc? Sgt. York? MUSIC 1941 All That Money Can Buy...well, at least Bernard Hermann, music man for CK, won.<br/><br/>The Academy is not an Oracle of Film Greatness, and sometimes they even get it right. But in 1941 they looked past the brilliant Jewel that is Citizen Kane and picked up, instead, a handful of shiny pebbles."
"JoeKarlosi","10","9","15","10 June 2004"," Citizen Kane (1941) ****
","I am totally elated to say I've just had my first - and by no means my last - wonderful experience with the well-labeled ""classic"" that is CITIZEN KANE.<br/><br/>I decided to see it bright and early, at 7:30 am where I could be at my most alert and perceptive. It did not disappoint me in a single way. And even though I was fully prepared in advance to think ""there's just no way this is going to be the 'best film ever made',"" the more I became entranced in it, the more I understood precisely why so many fans and critics over the decades have bestowed such an honor on it. It's a truly great motion picture - and if I'm not presently prepared to call it ""The Single Greatest Film Ever Made,"" I certainly think it's one of the greatest, at least that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I must say with regret, however, that I'd already heard what ""Rosebud"" was before watching the movie, and that's a real shame. Because I would have been totally blown away by that bittersweet revelation had I not expected it. The only thing for me to hope for was that, at least, the manner in which this information was revealed in the film would be properly dramatic and effective, and not just some character telling its meaning or some other less than stellar presentation. I was actually hoping that the movie would end with the ""Rosebud"" object somehow being amidst Kane's personal possessions -- but who would ever have though that it was going to be SO brilliantly revealed - with such grandeur! Absolutely perfect - drama at its finest!<br/><br/>The performances were marvelous, beginning with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (what a shame to think Cotten was ultimately to be handed such junk as LADY FRANKENSTEIN later on). I spotted people I never expected to see, such as George Coulouris as Thatcher (another who wound up in Grade Z horrors like 1957's THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY!).<br/><br/>I was totally intrigued with the character of Chuck Kane continuously, and I loved the manner in which this well-crafted story was told via flashbacks and time leaps backward and forward. Of course, the cinematography was second to none and, I imagine, astonishingly fresh and innovative for its day. Dialogue was great, too; I particularly liked one funny bit where the elderly Thatcher tells the young adult Kane: ""You're too old to call me 'Mister'"", to which Welles replies, ""and you're too old to be called anything else"" ! <br/><br/>Orson Welles was a genius with this work of art. I can't wait to dig into the documentary, and perhaps even Roger Ebert's commentary. To think that Welles was so young when he fashioned this beautiful film, and had complete creative license! This is what I like with a director when I can get it - one who is in charge of everything, not just someone who is merely directing someone else's ideas. I like a director to conceive, write, direct, and edit everything (at this point I'm not positive that Welles did it ALL, but he did enough!).<br/><br/>Well, I could go on forever at this moment, but I'll let others get a word or two in. All I can say is - if you hadn't guessed by now - this baby's got a space on my shelf with its name on it! And by the way, EXCELLENT restoration job, Warner!"
"happygoluckyduck","10","8","13","17 March 2005"," Perfection
","This film is simply put, perfect. But in this reviewer's opinion, a little too perfect. Orson Welles, at only 24 years old, obtains complete artistic control and all the financial aid he would for creating this film. On the set, no one but cast and crew was allowed. The progress of filming was kept entirely secret from producers and studio executives. The movie is released and William Randolph Hearst leads a vicious crusade to have the movie boycotted. And in the end, everyone recognized that it is a landmark in film making history and perhaps one of the greatest movies, if not 'the' greatest movie of all time; in short, perfection. All of these are pretty odd circumstances for just one film, don't you think? I think so, For perfection is beyond the grasp of human minds and hearts. Then one must ask, how then was this film created if a perfect film can not be created by man? Well, frankly, Martians. Yes, it may come as a shock, but martians were the ones who created Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Martians have been observing humans for a millennium, studying our trades, our relationships, and ultimately our art forms. Film being the synthesis of most visual and auditory arts, the Martians decided in 1938 to give film a try. Through mind control and virtual hypnosis they manipulated a young, influential radio personality and actor to be their human front man. That man was Orson Welles. Welles, using Martian mind control received permission, finance, and freedom to go ahead with 'his' project. The reality of it was the Martians were in complete control of the production, using their influence over all the mercury players and cast members to do their will. The set was a closed set all the time, simply because the Martians were out in the open giving direction. When a producer would come by, the Martians would go into hiding, and upon Martian instruction the humans would start tossing around a baseball. Only a martian could think of a ploy so devious.<br/><br/>Though no evidence for this exists, it is my opinion that William Randolph Heart caught wind that it was Martians heading up this project, and being objected to the mind control and manipulation, he lead his notorious crusade against this picture. He felt that human rights were being violated, and who can blame him? But really, in the end, no harm was done. The actors had created a marvelous performance under Martian instruction, and the Martians had proved to themselves that they understood human relationships, especially our need for love. Thus being satisfied with their artistic endeavors, the Martians headed off, only to return as consultants on the film 'Seven Samurai.' But, even though Citizen Kane is not a product of human artistry, it still is a wonder to know that someone out there understands us humans, even a little more than we do.<br/><br/>See this movie."
"prudhocj","10","6","9","15 January 2007"," SPOILER ALERT!! Rosebud
","The mystery is revealed! The meaning of Kane's dying word has been an American cultural icon that has been debated since 1941 and now the information is available to bring the answer to hand - http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2007/january/object.php <br/><br/>I got the shivers when I read this. <br/><br/>The Smithsonian article is fascinating in regards to the movie but the woman - Rosebud Yellow Robe - is even more fascinating. I hope some producer reads this and does some research on her leading to a feature film about her beginnings and long life. The rich Native American culture of South Dakota encompasses the tragic history of all of the original inhabitants of this continent and would make for an epic film. And now.....this connection is made to what is arguably America's greatest film."
"OttoVonB","10","6","9","12 January 2007"," Groundbreaking
","Charles Foster Kane (Welles), newspaper giant and billionaire, dies alone in his huge domain Xanadu. His last word, ""Rosebud"", sends news reporters and investigators on a hunt to uncover his complex past and unravel the dying legend's words.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"", by then first-time film director Orson Welles (then in his twenties with acclaimed radio and theater work under his belt), is still stunning and fresh today, despite containing many elements of film which we today take for granted, but were unheard of at the time. In 1941, the multiple flash-back structure, complex visual vocabulary - including angles that are still less than orthodox - and scope were truly revolutionary. What remains is an almost exhaustive film class in one movie.<br/><br/>Orson Welles imbues the grand-standing and often vulgar Kane with undeniable charisma. His presence in his own films would soon prove to be one of their most enduring strengths: think of his jovial Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight, his repulsive Quinlan in Touch of Evil and his simmering Othello in his adaptation of Shakespeare's play. Welles's would be a career of superb roles and cameo, and Kane is no exception. As his wounded best friend, Joseph Cotten holds his own with panache and emotion, and all the supporting turns are fine, amplified by the then novel overlapping naturalistic dialogue to make this one of the most alive films of all time.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane also marked a turning point in talkies, where they ceased to be neatly illustrated plays or books and became something else: something that is meant to work primarily on a screen. Whereas classics of the silent and later were defined by frames (like a painting) or dialogue (like a novel or play), Citizen Kane is defined by movement and editing, juxtapositions of moments and images, duration of frames and nature of cuts. It was the first film, and to this day one of the very few films to fully make use of the complete film-making arsenal. that it is endlessly entertaining as a story (kudos to screenwriter Mankiewitz) is the icing on an extremely alluring cake.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" often grabs the number 1 spot in critic polls, and for all its technical and artistic excellence, its entertaining nature makes it easy to appreciate throughout the ages, something a Kubrick or a Tarkovskyhave never achieved despite their brilliance.<br/><br/>hands down one of the best films of all time!"

The fact that this film possessed contained some of the more innovative special effects to plague the filming industry (Such as a mono-colour scheme) did little to relieve its monotony. And honestly, who didn't expect the ending? It's no wonder that Orson Welles never found work again. The brief appearance he made in ""Ed Wood"" was more than excessive for a man who didn't breathe at the time of its production. Citizen Kane? More like Citizen Pain!"
"someguy889","10","6","9","19 June 2004"," Rosebud **Spoilers Herein**
","**SPOILERS HEREIN** You have been warned.<br/><br/>The sled is not the answer, and Citizen Kane knows it. Yet almost all of the film is told in flashback to discover what Charles Foster Kane's last words meant. The sled was `rosebud,' and finding this out in that last scene is nothing short of satisfying. A sixty year old sled cannot explain a man's life or answer and any lingering questions about him, and yet knowing that Rosebud was his childhood sled is one of the most satisfying `answers' to a mystery in cinematic history. 	Charles Foster Kane's entire life is told in a flashback through a journalists eyes (we're always looking through his eyes because we always see his back). Through a newsreel, there is the Kane who `spoke for the common man' yet had the largest estate in America. Through his bank-owning guardian Thatcher, there is the Kane who squandered his fortune for a small newspaper and started those despicable tabloids. Through his best friend Leland, there is the Kane who wrote a dubious Declaration of Principles and went against everything it stood for years later, and who chose his mistress over his political career. Through his admiring assistant Bernstein, there is the Kane who entertained millions, and who wrote Leland's bad review for Susan Alexander (`sure, everyone knows that story').  Through Susan Alexander, there is the Kane who made shadow figures on the wall but never gave her anything she really cared about. There is the Kane through Thomson, the journalist, who says: `You know, in a way, I kinda feel sorry for the man.' 	Kane was always a man who people couldn't quite figure out. He was a man who saw what he wanted and knew how to get it. But it is obvious, through Orson Welles' superb acting, that Kane wants something more than just material goods or power. He is never seen admiring one of his statues or gazing at one of his paintings. Mainly, he wants love. He cannot truly love so he wants double the love for himself. He creates his own love, only to learn that love cannot be created. He creates a political appearance, so that people may hate the opposition and love him. He even creates an operatic career out of his second wife, so that people may love what he has produced. This is the Kane that the people around him could sense. Leland, Susan, even Thomson, all saw the Charles Foster Kane who had lost almost everything he had, and just could not fathom that love too could be lost.<br/><br/>	Then there is the Kane who is alone. Even though all of his life is told in flashback and all of the events were witnessed by someone, there are intimate scenes in which a man is revealed who was surrounded by people and yet died alone. There is the boy playing outside in the snow while his parents determine his future. There is the Kane (his face hidden in shadow) clapping longer than anyone else for Susan's performance. There are the many Kanes reflected through parallel mirrors. There is the Kane letting out all his anger and he destroys Susan's room and his mistakes. There is the Kane who utters `Rosebud' before he drops the wintry ball and dies. RosebudÂ… Bernstein seems to think it was something that he remembered  and wished he had from a long time ago. Leland thinks it was something he lost. Thomson thinks both: `He got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle... a missing piece.' The sled is what young Charlie Kane loves and plays with in the snow, and also uses in a feeble attempt to escape from Thatcher. The sled is what Charlie was reminded of when Thatcher tried to give him a new sled for Christmas. The sled is a satisfying `ending' for reasons that are hard to put into words. The sled is the core of the stunted development of Kane's private life. It is the symbol of hope, innocence, longing and security. It is the origin and a reminder of a time before greatness. It's a `what if.' But when Charles Kane dies, for him, Rosebud is love.<br/><br/>
My grade: 9/10"
"daveb75","10","6","9","5 May 2004"," Great work of poetic art
","""Citizen Kane"" is a very mature film. And you have to participate, as a viewer, to get into this one. For example, the use of short lenses with everything in focus (background, foreground, etc) forces you to choose for yourself what you think is more relevent in the frame. Welles and Tolland never impose their vision on you. It also gives way to overlapping dialogues, which was unheard of back then, and still is rarely seen in standard Hollywood movies. Same thing with the editing. Welles seldom cuts in talking scenes, instead he just keeps long takes rolling, therefore, once again as a viewer, you have to participate and focus on what you think is more important in the scene, rather than have the habitual overuse of separate talking heads forcing you to see one actor and not all of them. In ""Kane"", you can witness all the characters' reaction to the events. Sometime Welles will cut only at the very end of a dialogue for dramatic emphasize. Then, there is the structure of the film. Everyone seems to think they knew the real Charles Foster Kane. But nobody really ever knows everything about another person. That's both the beauty and the tragedy of any human life. But by giving us first of all the death of the main subject with his final and famous dying word, Welles is using a gimmick to allow us to witness different recollections by the people who think they knew him best. But the bottom line is, all they can do is give us a rendering of different events and can never get at the heart of the man. And that's why no one really knows about Rosebud. ""Kane"" never had a huge budget but it made a wise use of special effects that don't call attention to them like ""The matrix"" does, for example. That gave a grand look to the picture. But you never realize it as you're watching the film. There would  be a lot more to say about this wonderful work of art, but it would take years to match all that has been written about ""Citizen Kane"" and a lot of people explain the film a lot better that I can. I'm just asking the potential viewers of Orson Welles film to use a little intelligence while viewing it. It's a piece of poetry. Even Jack Kerouac was flabergasted by the  poetic aspects of it. It gave new meaning and exploded boudaries for cinema. So to call this film dated, to me is like saying that Beethoven's fifth symphony isn't worth listening to because it's been made so long ago. Time doesn't have an effect on true works of  art except to keep them alive and aging well, like a good bottle of wine."
"Spleen","10","6","9","27 August 1999"," Certainly ONE of the best
","`Citizen Kane' would be more widely loved, perhaps, if it did not begin with a lengthy newsreel account of Kane's life.  (Actually, it begins with the death scene, and I know there are some who find THIS bizarre and off-putting.  But I doubt that's what turns people off.)  While this is the only part of the film that could be described as dull, I suspect that some viewers don't bother to watch any further, expecting more of the same dated vulgarity.  But a newsreel is a newsreel.  Everyone knew they were vulgar and intolerably pompous, even when they were being made - ESPECIALLY when they were being made - and it's just this vulgarity and pomposity that the rest of the film undermines, in the lively account that follows of what Kane's life was REALLY like.  After the newsreel it's one great scene after another.  `Citizen Kane' is anything but worthy stodge.<br/><br/>But presenting us with the newsreel, mind you, was a good tactic.  Forget the `Rosebud' thing.  The real story is that of the reporter who researches above and beyond the call of duty, cross-examining witness after witness, in search of enough `human interest' detail to make more sense of Kane's life than the newsreel did - and he can never find quite enough.  The amazing thing is that Welles plays perfectly fair.  He hides from us the identity of `Rosebud', but nothing else; and in playing Kane he makes no effort to conceal what Kane is thinks or feels.  Yet we share the reporter's perplexity at the end.  Welles performed one of the world's great conjuring tricks when he told us every important detail EXCEPT the identity of `Rosebud', and then sprung that information on us, as well, to see if it made a difference.  See for yourself if it does."

I thought there must be something terribly wrong with ME. I couldn't finish it. It was so bad I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't understand why didn't I like it. It had to be my fault. Then I read the review of one of the earlier posters and she said what I felt but was afraid to say. The movie was awful. It was beyond bad. It was the worst movie ever filmed in all of history and I can safely say there will never be one worse. The only reason I gave it one star is I couldn't give it zero.

I would probably have fallen asleep if it had not been for the hope that it would come up with something of interest before ending. I might as well have fallen asleep though, cause not much happened. I watch a lot of movies, and I don't mind artsy or unsual ones, like El Topo, Breaking The Waves, Santa Sangre, Satyricon etc. Citizen Kane completly failed to interest me though, and even though it's far from the worst movie I have ever seen, I would not even dream of calling it the best."

","I was disappointed. A work of art should be viewed as a whole. So, besides its ground-breaking techniques, which are brilliant, this film seems to me not to ""get together"". There is something over-ambitious in it, surpassing the actors' and (don't shoot) perhaps even Welles' possibilities at the time. The story is simple, the characters are sketchy and motivation-lacking, and the ""Rosebud"" search reminds me of the melodramatic search for the Immortal Beloved in Bernard Rose's film (lame, I know), but fortunately it remained a mystery. With all that hype about the ""greatest film ever"" (???), it's too easy to be disappointed about ""Kane"". And speaking of technical aspects, why not equally praise Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (1916)? Me, at least, I do so."

I didn't understand the movie at all and I certainly didn't understand why it was #1.<br/><br/>Now I realize how ignorant I was.<br/><br/>Last year, I took a course in college on Film (I'm working on being a film director myself). Citizen Cain was a topic that the professor brought to us early in the semester. This would be my second time viewing the movie. But by this time, I had a basic understanding of film history, shots, camera angles, script writing, etc.<br/><br/>You see, you have to understand what movies were like before Citizen Cain, and after. Citizen Cain was a revolutionary movie in terms of edition, camera angles, and story. It was also ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Let's start with story. The movie starts with his death. The entire story is told through interviews and flashbacks by everyone who was involved with Cain. Unlike other movies with a linear narrative, this movie required you to think and put all the pieces together.<br/><br/>Another big thing was the way light and dark was used. High and low camera angles were used to the extreme. I can't point out every single one but you could ask a film expert point them out.<br/><br/>Another big thing was that the movie was pretty much a satire of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul. I recommend watching the movie ""RKO 281"" with Liev Schreiber and James Cromwell so you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie failed at the box office. It wasn't until years later when critics saw the movie and realized how great it was.<br/><br/>So if you saw Citizen Cain and didn't get it, I don't blame you. I didn't get it the first time either. It's largely due to the fact that the movie is so old, so there's a large generation gap.

","The American Film Institute knows their stuff and it's no wonder that they rank this movie the # 1 film ever made. Orson Welles portrayed some of the best dramatic acting along with directing that I've ever seen, and believe me I've seen a lot. This movie got robbed at the Oscars for reasons that I'll never understand. The quotes are so good and there are so many of them. Welles was a genius that was never fully appreciated even today, probably because most of us forgot about him. I felt bad for him because after he made this perfect piece of art he spent the rest of his life trying to make another one that was just as good or better and which he was never able to do (though it might've been impossible anyway because sometimes you can't beat the best). The supporting actors were fabulous, you just don't see it done this well anymore or anywhere close to it for that matter. This story has something in it that every person can relate to and it doesn't fall short on any of it. If you consider yourself even a novice movie lover you have to watch this and the sooner the better. That's my story and I'm sticking to it!<br/><br/>Final Judgment:<br/><br/>Movies : If it's ever re-released I'd be there in a second!<br/><br/>DVD Purchase : Get the special edition.<br/><br/>Rental : More important than air and water!"
"FilmOtaku","10","7","12","11 February 2004"," The greatest film of all time - for many reasons
","`Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time'.  How many times has anyone who watches films or follows films heard that phrase?  The question is, do people who actually tout this oft-repeated phrase actually believe it?  Or have they ever even seen the film?  Arguably, there have been some truly great films that have been released since Citizen Kane, in fact, most of the `great films' have been released since Citizen Kane, but there are many factors that support the assertions that A) Citizen Kane is indeed the greatest film of all time, and B) Citizen Kane is uncontested as my favorite film of all time.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is of course, the story of Charles Foster Kane told through the eyes of those who loved him, hated him and idolized him.  It is also a famously thinly-veiled telling of the life of William Randolph Hearst, the publishing magnate.  Welles, at 25 and already being touted as a genius, had enough of an ego to tackle this subject.  Unfortunately for Welles, and his ego, Hearst was still very much alive and very much in control of various media outlets, movie studios and their executives, all of which demolished the film's release and hype.  It wasn't until decades later when people realized the incredible visionary aspect and technical genius of the film.<br/><br/>
Citizen Kane was released in 1941  the same year as such films as The Little Foxes, Suspicion and Sergeant York  all three great films, all three big competitions for Kane.  And actually, `How Green Was My Valley' won. But what Kane had that these films did not, was passion.  Technical mastery. Ground breaking camera work and blocking techniques that paved the way for the way films would be made, even today.  Thought-provoking symbolism, and defiance.  Welles knew that he had a time bomb  he was warned by industry insiders, friends, maybe even Hearst himself.  But whether it was ego or feelings of entitlement for his own work (or, most likely, a combination of both) the film that he poured his entire life into remains the standard that films made 60 years later with remarkable technology are held against.  One looks at the deep focus and isn't fazed because it is now standard.  Welles created that.  The camera angles, the symbolism that is so creatively used, (watch for faces that become shaded and draw your conclusions as to why that is) the blocking that tells a story without actually saying, `This is what we are trying to convey here'.  (Out of about twenty scenes where this occurs, you can specifically invoke the `breakfast table' scene between Kane and his first wife, or the scene between Kane and Davies where the shouting is almost irritating, but is executed to provide a demonstration of the vastness, grandeur and loneliness.<br/><br/>Some friends and I recently decided to start an informal `Movie Club' and for the inaugural night, I wanted to screen my favorite movie of all time, `Citizen Kane'.  We discussed why that is a dangerous statement, and why calling Kane the `greatest of all time' could be construed as intellectual irresponsibility considering the stories that have been told since Kane in 1941, and the technology that has been invented since Kane graced the big screen for the first time.  I agree that the point can be argued.  Someone can argue with me that George Lucas, director of that `other' groundbreaking film(s) is improving upon the original with his extended versions.  Yes, you can argue with me, but you will not change my opinion, and in that same vein, I will never find a film that has affected me more than Kane has.  It is for that reason alone that films that I have seen since compete for slots #2  Infinity.  Citizen Kane's historical importance and innovative technique give it an automatic pass to #1  the beauty, the story, and the acting are just wonderful extras that truly make this film the `Greatest of all time'.  <br/><br/>--Shelly"

","My wife and I bought this movie a few years ago, kept saying ""We gotta watch Citizen Kane one of these days"" -- so this weekend, got out the drinks, sat down to watch this highly rated flick, hoping it would be as good as they say.<br/><br/>I have a friend who works for one of the Hearst grandchildren, so I thought ""this will make a good conversation piece, to compare notes so to speak"" -- well here's what happened.<br/><br/>We started on Saturday evening, after the first 20 minutes or so, we started checking the DVD player asking ""how much more of this movie is there"" -- and every time we checked the remaining time, we both groaned. I paused the movie a few times to stretch, to clear my head, to prepare for the torture again, sat down and pushed the play button.<br/><br/>We finally gave up at about 1/2 through. So the next morning, that would be Sunday, we thought we could finish the movie, which we did, checking the ""time left"" several times until the end of the movie and the explanation of the opening word.<br/><br/>After this extraordinary boring movie, we took out the 2nd DVD to see the real explanation, which was far more interesting than the movie, and about 1/2 the length. And the explanation of Rosebud was clarified in the 2nd DVD, or at least a believable explanation was provided.<br/><br/>I have only posted one other review on this service, about an equally boring but current movie. I have seen many great movies, and the reviews of the great movies are helpful, but how Citizen Kane is thought to be a great movie tells us all something about movie critics. They like to support the artsy and boring movies that everyone else hates, and pan the movies that the crowds love. I think they do this to demonstrate that they are independent thinkers, but what it proves is that most movie reviews can be ignored, good or bad, since they bear little resemblance to the actual joy one might get from watching the movie under review.<br/><br/>Watch this with no expectations of enjoyment, but watch it just so you can ask a ""real"" movie goer that loves it to explain ""What did you like about the movie, I mean, really, what? And please, focus on the story line and the acting, was any of it good?"" I didn't think so."

","And imho those years 1915-1955 were the most entertaining in movie history too. I've never called myself or written down that I'm a film ""reviewer"": unless you get paid for it by someone else and it's your job title the internet is generally the place to simply pass comments about this, that or the other. There's more than enough reviewers out there in the world anyway, and critics or snickerers too. I dislike passing bad comments on anything because 99% of the films ever made took some effort and brainwork even if I didn't personally approve of it. I could never ""review"" Kane, passing some paltry comments on such a monumental film is hard enough, but over the last 40 years I've now seen it so many times think it's high time I gave my opinion too.<br/><br/>Disjointed story told by disparate people at different times of boy growing up to be ruthless newspaper magnate who is used to getting his own way with everything and everyone, and a newspaper reporter trying to find out what he meant by his dying word. So: It's relentlessly inventive and near perfect in every department, script, acting, production-direction, camera-work, sets, costumes etc, with the available technology they had at the time presenting a movie that still looks fresh as a daisy to someone who doesn't. A nitrate-gleaming black and white production, with no colour, cgi cartoonery, swearing, relevance to ordinary peoples' lives, sex or violence for enlightened modern audience tastes (but containing some analogue cartoonery for those who need the fix) – it's the lack of these absolute essentials that most people today can't forgive in Kane. And the plot isn't incomprehensible and no one grunts through their parts like today. On the other side are people who think that after all the decades this has now been proved to be the unbeatable ultimate in cinematic art, and all other films are simply also-rans with Kane in its somewhat traditional role of being unassailable. Both sets are wrong of course - it's all personal taste and nothing lasts forever, even criticism isn't static. However, Kane is set in the amber of the Golden Age of the movies and is to me the best movie from that celebrated era. Indubitably. Again however, if I could only take one film with me to watch on a desert island this isn't it.<br/><br/>Far from being mediocre the end ties everything up beautifully, and it helps make poignant sense of the previous two riveting hours. Unlike the vast majority of films, come good, bad or indifferent criticism it'll still be here after we're all gone so let's hear it for Good Old Citizen Kane!"
"Losshir","9","6","10","30 June 2006"," Does it deserve to be acknowledged? Yes. Best Film ever Made? No.
","I'm gonna be brutally honest here. I didn't exactly like this film. After years of hearing how it was by far ""the greatest film ever made"" perhaps it's expectations were too high. How can any film possibly meet expectations when expectations are nothing lower than perfection? With the knowledge that this film is universally considered the best ever made, there is no way it could possibly meet that bar especially for someone who rarely agrees with such massive popular agreement. Many scenes were enjoyable, and many were boring, but maybe I didn't ""get it"" or maybe I didn't want to.<br/><br/>A large problem with this film has nothing to do with the media but the people who love it. Professors who adore it, critics who dissect and people who say they love it to sound smart and artistic. No film can possibly survive after 60 years in those conditions.<br/><br/>You can shoot me for saying this, but the acting was overdone, and the film was very dark physically. Normally I don't mind that but in some scenes I wasn't able to make out the emotions and faces of the characters. I understand that this film was a massive undertaking as far as films that do creative things such as camera angles, mixed up narratives and things of that nature, but that does not mean its the best one out there. It served as a good first stepping stone but talented film makers have gone a long way since then.<br/><br/>People seem so eager to praise it they forget that there are also many problems with it and that in some instances, it's greatest assets are it's greatest liabilities. While it had character development I was hoping for more, although I enjoyed the fact that the audience would have to insert their own opinions about Mr. Kane in attempt to understand him. Despite this, I wasn't that interested in this man's life or the people surrounding him, and in such a character driven film, concentrated around one man, that is a very large problem.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too saturated in the sugar-coated world of Hollywood but I was expecting more from this film. Many scenes were boring, and a movie can be the best ever made, but if half of its boring, whats the point? Maybe upon a second viewing I will appreciate it more. Does it deserve to be acknowledged for technical and narrative innovations? Yes. Best film ever made? No."
"djohn2581-1","10","6","10","15 October 2005"," This film should be number one............
","as it's probably the best and most intelligent script ever written and it's splendidly and brilliantly directed and acted.<br/><br/>If you're looking for pure entertainment, you won't find it here. CITIZEN KANE is a thinking person's entertainment that touches on many aspects of morality and the lack thereof. Imagine a hybrid of ""The Prince"" and ""All The King's Men"" and you have something of the ideas at the core of CITIZEN KANE (yes, this predates Robert Penn Warren's masterpiece). That message is that power, be it monetary or political, corrupts AND destroys. That money buys the best of everything except that which is truly worthwhile. That an ego, left unchecked, will turn on itself. That loneliness is too often self-imposed. It is a story of a man's self-destruction - of how his desire to have everything and control everything ultimately results in his having nothing except his money and regrets. These were new and profound subjects for mass entertainment.<br/><br/>CITIZEN KANE is cinematic brilliance. It stands, arguably, at the summit of American cinema. As for me, I don't know if it's the best movie ever made. I do know that there are a few movies that are just as good but I know of none that are better."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","6","10","23 February 2005"," majestic, albeit so hyped that it's hard to view objectively
","SPOILERS Every person has their own little list of famous films which they haven't seen. Films which are legendary and which cause looks of shock by friends if you admit to your ignorance. Your friends look at you with a look of surprise, and ever so slight disdain, if you confess your guilty little lie that you've never seen this piece of cinematic history. Whether it be ""Godfather Part II"" or ""Star Wars"", these films are often well loved by those who consider themselves to be film enthusiasts.<br/><br/>One film which constantly appears on the embarrassing list belonging to individuals is Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"". Written, directed, produced and staring that one genius of an individual, ""Citizen Kane"" is often named in polls as one of the greatest films of all time. This in itself though can cause problems for the every day viewer. Whilst it is not difficult to see why so many people rave about the film, it's constant hype and the praise laid upon it, means that the Kane newcomer always enters with expectations of an almost planetary size. ""Citizen Kane"" is a wonderful film and yet another fitting tribute for cinema's most important individual (Welles), but by putting so much pressure on an audience to be dazzled, the films enthusiasts are doing the film more damage than good.<br/><br/>Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane. Taken away from his parents at a young age, Kane grows up into a rebellious rogue who inherits an enormous fortune. Taking over a failing newspaper, Kane sets about making a name for himself.<br/><br/>Told through flashbacks, the life of Kane is certainly an interesting one. A man who appears to have it all, yet always possesses an underlying unhappiness, Orson Welles presents Kane as a man we feel more pity for than any other emotion.<br/><br/>In perhaps his second finest performance, personal choice going for his relatively short role in 1949's ""The Third Man, Welles presents an emotionally varied Kane who appears to be at his happiest when lavished with love and attention. This rich, almost childlike, individual forever insists on getting his own way, whilst others around him grow to dislike, and in some cases resent, him. With his superb script and outstanding direction, Welles brings passion to the role and deserved more than just an Oscar nomination for his performance.<br/><br/>As we experience Kane's life through flashback, we obviously witness all those people who matter to him at one point or another. The supporting cast, led by Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore, is exquisite in it's performance as it helps to make the film more than just the Orson Welles show. Cotten in particular, accredited at the end of the film with an ""introducing"", is superb as Kane's old friend Jebediah Leland, a man who grows to dislike Kane's increasingly flexible morality. Keeping a copy of Kane's original mission statement for the paper, Cotten's character slowly collapses in on himself as he gives way to alcohol, cigars and Kane's imaginative views on journalism. Always keeping the character alive, Cotten never stops working hard for Welles and obviously proved a success since he once again worked with Welles in ""The Third Man"".<br/><br/>All in all, ""Citizen Kane"" is a superb film. Worthy of the praise people heap upon it, the film's method of story telling is brilliant, and keeps the audience entertained from start to finish. The problem though remains that whether worthy of praise or not, this film is not going to be for everybody. Released over sixty years ago, it is not going to appeal to the majority of younger generations. This, added to the absolutely humongous amount of admiration that the film receives, is going to lead to some individuals feeling disappointed by their expectations. ""Citizen Kane"" is one of the greatest films of all time, but to prevent younger generations from finding it over-hyped, we need to cease our praise and simply let them watch it."
"Mojambo85","10","6","10","6 April 2004"," The Best Movie Ever Made.
","I'm really sick of seeing people panning this film.  Either they're doing it just to spite those of us who appreciate good films, or they're doing it because they really have no clue what makes a good film good.  A lot of the user comments I've seen here fall into both these categories.  Which leads me to believe that most people on imdb.com have no real appreciation for cinema as a true art, and also as a true form of entertainment.  But that's another subject.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is easily the best movie ever.  To audiences today, it might not wow with its special effects, its lighting, its acting, its camera work, its editing, its sound; the list goes on and on.  Most of us have been born and raised on color, explosions, and even CGI in the case of the many teenage LOTR fans here.  But the fact is, for its time, Citizen Kane re-invented all that could be done in all of the above areas.  I can only imagine what it would be like seeing it at the time of its release.  It would have been simply mind blowing.  No movie ever since has revolutionized cinema like Citizen Kane, not even the Godfather movies, however good they may be.<br/><br/>And it's likely that no movie ever will do again what Citizen Kane has done for cinema.<br/><br/>10/10...and this deserves to be #1 on the Top 250."
"jall1","10","6","10","11 July 2002"," It deserves the hype.
","Everyone knows the hype. Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made. Some people agree completely with the hype, others acknowledge Kane as a masterpiece but not necessarily the greatest ever made, and then there are those that just don't understand the hype at all. I recently saw Citizen Kane for the first time, and I'm going to have to put myself in the first group. It does deserve the hype.<br/><br/>I understand why some people find the classics boring and wonder how they could enjoy Citizen Kane. I enjoy watching the classics because I'm interested in cinema history and film technique, but when I put historical considerations aside and just look at the films themselves, I often find them to be rather tedious. Citizen Kane is not like the other classics. It is still fresh and entertaining, and I recommend it to everyone, film buff or not. You should keep in mind, however, that Kane was made in 1941. To avoid disappointment, don't expect an action movie with flashy special effects, a tear-jerking drama, a laugh-out-loud comedy, a suspenseful thriller, or a mind-bending story with deep thoughts about the universe, plot twists, or amazing shocks that will blow you out of your seat.<br/><br/>
What you can expect is the simple yet fascinating story of the fictitious publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, a story told with such cleverness and skill that it is a joy to watch. Much has already been said about Kane's dramatic and technical achievements, and I agree with the praise. I especially love the circular narrative structure, the brief montage that encapsulates the gradual disintegration of Kane's first marriage in only two minutes, and the scene in which the elderly Kane rips up his second wife's room. Welles' performance is mesmerizing as he lurches through his furious rampage. If you are interested in film technique, I highly recommend the DVD version of the film with its excellent commentary tracks (especially the one by Roger Ebert).<br/><br/>If you watch the DVD, also make sure to see the documentary that comes with it, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which chronicles the clash between Welles and the real-life publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was angered by the portrayal of Charles Foster Kane, a character undeniably based, at least in part, on Hearst's life. Hearst banned any mention of Kane in his vast newspaper holdings and threatened any theaters that dared to show the despised film. He also tried to buy all available copies of the film and have them destroyed, and he came very close to succeeding. The scary thing is that if Hearst had been only slightly more successful, no one would have ever seen Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>It is the fact that Citizen Kane survived that makes it the greatest film ever made. Its triumph is not only a testament to the power of the cinema, but a shining example of how that power should be used. Some critics acknowledge Kane as a technical masterpiece, but erroneously fault it for being too shallow. Such critics miss how Citizen Kane dared to truthfully and intelligently display the corrupting influence of vanity, wealth, and power and how it defeated a challenge from those very elements in real life. Never falling prey to the pride that it warns us about, Citizen Kane does not stoop to pretentious preaching or arrogantly claim to know all of the answers. Welles was an arrogant man, but he put his arrogance into his performance of Kane, not into the tone of the film. Citizen Kane is powerful in its simplicity and subtlety, and as serious and thoughtful as it is, Kane still manages to be fun, entertaining, and above all, clean and inoffensive. Hearst's papers have faded away with time, old copies preserved but read by no one. The old black and white movie that those faded papers almost destroyed lives on, viewed by millions of people. The cinema and Hollywood hype reign supreme.<br/><br/>Hollywood's hype is a two edged sword. So quick to wield its influence whipping up a frenzy of anticipation for new escapist entertainment and filling its chests with ever growing profits, Hollywood is slow to use its enormous power to raise awareness of important issues, to give artistic expression to truth and to opinions and ideas that matter. When it does attempt to use the better edge of its sword, it is so often merely an assault of violence and pornography in the name of `edgy,'  `stylish,' or `educational' art, and just as often a sappy, cheesy, or politically correct rehashing of stereotypes and clichés. Citizen Kane shines as a glorious example of how it should be done, and I wish Hollywood would follow its example more often."

"elucidations","10","5","8","3 July 2013"," Yet another middle-aged man gone ROSEBUD-CRAZY
","Quite a few ""Citizen Kane"" fans now know, that the word 'rosebud' was a clever inside joke on the part of screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (and Orson Welles), because it was a nickname William Randolph Hearst used for his high-profile public mistress, the hot and juicy Marion Davies (the nickname being a descriptive term for a part of the female anatomy). It's my understanding they'd have known this because Hearst referred to Ms. Davies by this nickname in front of others (and to what must have been the embarrassment of these friends, who might also be gossipers).<br/><br/>Who can say for sure whether this is true, but I believe it.<br/><br/>Because it makes the story of ""Citizen Kane"" more coherent and focused, when you consider that it is largely about a great and influential man who throws away all the goods things he has, simply because he's middle-aged crazy for a young juicy blonde.<br/><br/>And so now for me the central and key scene of the movie is where Kane has been confronted by his wife about his mistress (thanks to the hardball-playing Governor), he's caught in the ""love nest"" with the juicy young blonde... and what does he do, he throws everything away, a good and beautiful wife, a promising political career, and ultimately the respect and friendship of his closest friend, all because he's middle-aged crazy and foolish for ROSEBUD.<br/><br/>Another scene which now has a different significance I think, is the one in the screening room, where the producer of the newsreel charges the reporter with finding out what 'rosebud' means, saying ""it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing...""<br/><br/>And then immediately a FLASH OF LIGHTNING, showing Susan Alexander's face.<br/><br/>Anyway, no doubt about it, an amazing film to watch, containing many other insights too, such as a scathing (but true) critique of Hearst's manipulative use of the powerful capital of a newspaper.<br/><br/>And even if you don't think that Susan Alexander is Rosebud, it's still a real and common thing, many men, especially men of ""money and property"" (because of the greater independence and luxury it grants them), throw away everything at the onset of middle-age, in a mad and foolish and ridiculous pursuit of young juicy snatch.<br/><br/>Two things though: one, I don't know if it ever has anything to do with the man's mother, or his childhood, or least of all any toys he had as a boy... and two, it usually doesn't result in a movie made about the man (and his high-profile public mistress), let alone one that film critics consistently rate as perhaps the greatest ever made."
"illbebackreviews","7","5","8","16 December 2012"," This film may have once been regarded the finest motion picture of all time but 72 years later, its still regarded as a great movie
","I've been told that Citizen Kane has been regarded as the greatest black and white film and ALSO the greatest motion picture of all time, that is until 'Vertigo' surpassed it. My initial reaction to this statement was REALLY!?! <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I have loved some black and white films most notably one of my favorite films of all time, '12 Angry Men' and also Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' Checking the perfect Rotten Tomato rating convinced me to watch this film although there were mixed ""Top Reviews"" on IMDb. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the start and found it extremely unique as it started with the death of Charles Foster Kane uttering his last word 'Rosebud'. I thought that was a great way to start and the mystery behind why he said it was definitely mysteriously and got me interested in the story, much like '12 Angry Men' did. However, to me, this film heavily suffers from poor pacing. At sometimes, the film seems to be speeding along brilliantly, with the plot and characters flowing through perfectly. At other times, the pacing is completely off and the film seems a bit of a torture to watch. I NEVER expected or wanted any action of any sort for this type of film as '12 Angry Men' did not and that was a spectacular masterpiece. However, the tone of the film just put me off as some flashback sequences dragged on a bit too long. <br/><br/>What I can't understand about this film is how it STILL is regarded the ""Second"" greatest motion picture. I mean, back then, it would've been a revolutionary film with all the special editing and the camera work and the great acting but now??? I mean, to be honest, there are plenty of FAR SUPERIOR black and white pictures such as 'Cascablanca', '12 Angry Men', 'Psycho', 'Schindler's List' and so on. These films I listed keep you emotionally connected to the story more (or at least it did for me) and have far better characters and a plot.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that I hated the film or found it extremely boring. Not quite true. I enjoyed the film as a whole but there are certain elements lacking from the film. One is, after a while the mystery behind the film starts to get away from people as the film at times goes onto focus on stuff that end up not really relating to Kane's last word. It also became extremely difficult to connect with 'Singer' aka Susan. I found her character, ENTIRELY annoying as she turned out to be one of the main parts to Kane's life. <br/><br/>One thing I definitely loved about the film however, was that it perfectly illustrates how Charles' life completely changes when he falls for fame and power. The scene where he starts off in love with Emily and slowly shows shots and shots of his feelings toward her changing was superbly done. Overall, the film brilliantly illustrates how Kane's happy life changes when he falls for fame and power. <br/><br/>*******MAIN SPOILER***********************<br/><br/>I enjoyed at the end how 'Rosebud' to Charles meant that he could've the last of his years happily.

Bashing the hell out of this movie is every bit as worthwhile as bashing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa; no one cares.

The movie is an important piece to movie history just like ""Rosebud"" was important to Kane. The thing is, this movie isn't just a historical document. It's a powerful, gripping story that is still significant to this day. I'm not willing to tell the whole story here - many have done that before me. It's more worthwhile to advise you to watch the movie, instead. This isn't a story to hear - it's a story to WITNESS.<br/><br/>Movie buffs go crazy for this movie, and they have a right to do it. Citizen Kane's technical innovations and clever storytelling style really do play tricks with the viewer, and make an apparently simplistic (only on the surface!) story come alive. Of course, it's not a movie for everyone. One who's utterly unimpressed with the movie won't get any beating from ME. But even the most impatient ones should at least try to look through the surface. It's a rewarding movie, and deserves no less than 10 stars. Give the critics some credit on this one, for one."

","With the help of the brilliant musical director, Bernard Herrmann, who had never worked on a film before, Welles Expands the use of music to build and structure his film. The same musical phrases will recur at seemingly unrelated moments, tying the scenes together. Or be subtly changed each time they appear anew. A melody such as the ""What is his name?"" tune is sung vigorously at the Inquirer Party, is heard again played more aggressively at the political rally, becomes sadder after the election defeat, and reappears behind the credits. The breakfast scene between Kane and Emily was cut to correspond to the music, Welles patterning the montage of shots, one shot successively superimposed on and then replacing another, to follow the movement of what Herrmann called his ""ballet suite."" Music had seldom been used so cleverly or given such an important role in a film before."

","The main thing that stands out when watching Citizen Kane is that the techniques used in the cinematography were decades ahead of their time. Specifically, the rotoscoping in of reflections, the camera angles, and the ""pseudo-interview"". The camera angles used in Citizen Kane were not really picked up for common use until the early to mid 1980's. This film was the first to really integrate the perspective of the viewer to make an emotional and psychological impact outside of the typical movies of the time. It was a risk taken by Orson Welles, and has had impacts that reverberate to this day in the movies that we watch, though some directors do not even know ""why"" a camera angle holds so much impact. Viewing this movie as a time capsule of the art-deco period, and taking in the ""might of man"" attitude of the time period, it is easy to sense how Leni Riefenstahl and Ayn Rand both influenced the directors vision."

","Made in 1941, this movie is a classic and has been called the best movie ever made. That is not bad considering it was made by a 29 year old, Orson Welles. For some reason I have always put this movie aside, because people have been telling me that it is a deep movie and not to be viewed without concentration. So therefore I have always put it off, but finally I put it in the DVD player. Let me tell you, it really is a great movie. Or should I say fantastic movie? We follow Charles Foster Kane, from childhood, to his deathbed. The death scene starts the movie and you hear Kane say the word `Rosebud' and that is what the movie is about, trying to find out what he meant by it. Orson is a master at setting the scene, how the camera works, the setting etc. But I won't tell you more about this because this movie is an experience in itself. I rate this movie 9/10"
"kaneforgov","10","5","8","29 June 2004"," Rosebud Revisited
","I have seen Citizen Kane numerous times over the last 25 years and studied it in film class years ago while in collage and it remains my favorite film of all time. Not because of the awards and accolades it has won but because it taught me to look at film and film narrative in a different way.<br/><br/>Having said that I do admit that I understand why currently some younger viewers don't appreciate it as a masterpiece. In the age of MTV film-making and CGI inspired scripts, many current moviegoers don't have the patience to allow a film to unfold before them, taking literally until the final frame to complete the story and characterization. The truth is that film production has come so far since 1942 that we take for granted many of the storytelling and cinematography techniques that Wells employed. Although he may not have invented these techniques, Wells used them in groundbreaking ways and his influence can still be seen in movies today. There is also little recognition of the film within the context of when it was made. Wells, at 26 years old, had produced a very controversial story using film techniques that were quite new to movie making. Using a cast of mostly unknown stage and radio actors he managed to make a movie that wasn't simply the filming of a stage play, which was a common style of the period. Add the controversy created by the William Randolph Hearst connection (and the fact that Hearst newspapers of the day wouldn't carry ads for the film) and you see a movie-making story that has become a part of American culture.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to re-watching Citizen Kane, this time with my 15-year-old daughter. Hopefully, she'll get it even without Orlando Bloom or Lindsey Lohan.<br/><br/>On the subject of Rosebud:<br/><br/>I never believed Kane's dying word 'rosebud' had a deep psychological meaning such as a representation of everything he had lost or his inability to love. Some have suggested rosebud was 'mantra for memories of a lost childhood' and the separation from his parents which lead to his lonely life. To me, it was simply the last memory of an old man. Spurred by the visual of Susan's snow globe he recalled one of his oldest memories. At the end of the film, when asked what he thinks Kane's final word Rosebud explains, the reporter says, 'I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life.' <br/><br/>In actuality, Rosebud, a simple memory of Charles Foster Kane's, was Orson Wells' catalyst for telling the story of Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>I've always had a certain fascination with the character of Charles Foster Kane and Orson Wells' portrayal of him as well as many of the themes of the movie. One moment likable and attractive, the next despicable, Well's played Kane with a charisma that has been rarely equaled on film, (or in Wells' subsequent films.) Themes such as wanting to be loved but being incapable of giving love and a man's value being measured by his 'collections' are fascinating to me. Even now, with all the modern advances in film technique and the hundreds of movies I've seen, I still get chills at certain points of the film. I first saw the film at 20 years old and for me the movie represents my awaking to seeing film as art. It also gave me the desire to look below the surface at Wells' motivations and created for me a fascination with his style.<br/><br/>Equally fascinating is the 'making of ' story behind Citizen Kane. The power struggles and controversies that surrounded the production of the film are Hollywood legend.<br/><br/>Most people with whom I've discussed Citizen Kane, who love the movie, don't really care whether it's considered the 'best film of all time'. The awards and recognition the film has earned are not determining factors in how I look at Citizen Kane and my passion for the film goes beyond any websites top film listing. In the end, one's favorite films tend to be determined by how they touch you personally and not the box office or acclaim they attain."
"Jim-480","9","5","8","13 April 2004"," There is no greatest movie
","Much of the dismissal of the quality of Citizen Kane comes about because of several factors:<br/><br/>1) There is a disconnect between what critics expect of a movie and what general audiences expect of a movie.  To say that CK is entertaining is simply an opinion - no more, no less.  Our opinions on films can be researched and refined or raw and personal.  To claim that one is better than the other is arrogance, but we do it because of some sort of instinctual belief that ""everybody should think the way I do.""  This is not the case, however, and there is going to be backlash when Kane isn't the movie that people expect.  It is not entertaining in the traditional sense. It's hard to get attached to the characters unless you really want to, and the story (the life of a media titan) isn't something that naturally appeals to everyone.  It's a movie you have to work at liking.<br/><br/>2) CK is astoundingly technically accomplished and years ahead of its time. When you compare it to the standard movies of the day, you can see how much film instinct Welles had and how revolutionary the film was.  However, most people today don't have an expert grasp of the intricacies of making movies, and most don't care about things like lighting, blocking, and camera placement.  Most people go for story and characters and see movies as passive entertainment.  They don't want to focus on extraneous things like short/long shots.  And they shouldn't be chided for wanting a movie to be simple to understand - most people watch movies as entertainment, not as a hobby, and breadth of film knowledge shouldn't be a requrement for doing so.<br/><br/>3) CK is defended extraordinarily heavy by often-arrogant film-buffs who imply that the only people that should judge a movie's quality are the people that study the movies.  This is a dangerous and stupid position. IMDB is set up so that EVERYONE gets an opportunity to share their opinions. I'm not a big fan of Godfather (boooring) but I understand that my opinion is only one of millions and therefore not all that important.  Film geeks want their opinion to matter more, but the truth is that it really doesn't. This bothers them, because they've spent so much time loving movies only to watch their vote get cancelled out by a 12-year-old that rates the Princess Diaries as a 10.  Guess what?  That movie was made for 12-year-olds, and CK was made for people who like to watch movies that are mental exercises.<br/><br/>4) The dangerous title of ""Greatest Movie Ever Made.""  Movie-watching is too personal to ever apply that title to anything.  Yes, we can all agree that certain movies are better than others, and the majority can be expected to make an opinion on how people in general view a certain movie.  But to call a movie ""The Greatest Movie Ever Made"" is implying that everyone should feel that way.  Everyone will not feel that way.<br/><br/>So a good many people hate Citizen Kane.  That's their right.  Film-going shouldn't require an initiation and entrance exam.  IMDb is the sum of popular opinions, and CK-lovers just aren't going to get everyone to love such an dense, complex film.  Some people don't look for that in movies, and they are no more wrong than you are for wanting it."

","When Charles Foster Kane was a boy, his mother sent him away from his home in Colorado to live with a banker in New York. His mother was the owner of the Colorado gold mine and wanted her son to grow up somewhere nice. As a young man, Charles was kicked out of almost every prestigious college, including Harvard. When Charles turned twenty one, his mother had orders that he would take full ownership of his mother's fortune. When he got full ownership of his wealth, he bought the New York Inquirer newspaper. He turned it into the most unique paper of its time and he began taking over many other papers in other states until he had the most circulation.<br/><br/>
Many people think that this is the story of William Randolph Hurst who ran the New York journal at the same time when the movie was in production. There are many similarities between William Randolph Hurst and Charles Foster Kane, but the truth is this is a fictional story of a fictional character.<br/><br/>This particular movie is the most intriguing film that I have seen. The script was written for radio broadcast and soon became a motion picture and some of the dialog stayed the same. The way that the film starts out is unique because the main character dies then summarizes his life. The main plot is to figure out what the meaning of Charles Foster Kane's last word `rosebud', meant. What was also intriguing was the lighting, in some scenes there would be very bright light, and other scenes so dark you could barely see the characters face. The acting was surprisingly good because all the co-stars had never acted before in their lives.<br/><br/>The film was delightfully funny, sad, and dramatic. You could almost feel the characters emotions. Orson Welles was a genius when he put together this film that he stared in and also directed. It will probably be one of the greatest films that I will see in my life-time, and was one of the greatest films of its time."

","This is not my favourite film, but if I try to set aside my personal taste, and judge from a general point of view (far more difficult...), I have to say this is the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>What's most impressive is how modern this film looks. If a movie like this was made today, I'd say it is twenty years ahead of its time. And it was made more than sixty years ago! Camera angles, directing style, originality of the framing, everything is more peculiar and, in a sense, more modern than what we're used to. The best example is maybe the multiple reflection of Kane image in the mirrors. How many modern films have a shot so original, so simple, and so evocative?<br/><br/>The other great aspect is that this is by far the best example of character development in all cinema history. Kane is a like a real person, always coherent with himself, but never banal or predictable: a lesser writer would have described him simply as a greedy man that makes everything to make money (and this would have been a very banal and boring story). Welles shows us the drama of a man that use his great wealth to make other people love him, and at the end of its life faces his failure, as he dies alone. Welles' performances, both acting, writing, and directing, are astonishing, given that he was only 25 at the time, and all the other actors are great too.<br/><br/>10/10"
"oldskool84","10","5","8","29 September 2001"," One of the greatest films of all time
","What can I say that hasn't been said already on this masterpiece. The first time I saw Citizen Kane I wasn't that impressed with it. My opinion of Citizen Kane was that it was a good film but definitely not the best picture ever made. When a movie is so hyped up you can't help but be dissapointed but on my second viewing I was amazed by the film. This is probably the best experience I've ever had watching a film. You can feel the energy and youthfulness in the picture and you could sense that the filmmakers were trying to push the boundaries of film and were not afraid to experiment.<br/><br/>I still don't think that Citizen Kane is the best film ever made though, no film can be called the greatest. How can you prove that? You can have a favorite film but calling it the best is just ridiculous. Now I've heard alot of people say that the ending was terrible and it doesn't make sense. The thing is that the movie is not saying that Rosebud is the answer, right before the end Mr. Thompsons says that no one word can explain one man's life. That's the filmmakers telling you  what your about to see should not be taken as an explanation for Kane's life.<br/><br/>I think Rosebud is the search for one's lost innocence or childhood. The important parts of our life that we want to remember. I think Citizen Kane is about humanity, our search for understanding and meaning of our lives and how we lose ourselves in the things that don't matter. Anyway that's just my opinion. To all the people who didn't enjoy this movie, I would encourage them to see it again and you'll be rewarded. For anybody to truly appreciate any of the great films you must watch it more than once. There is so many things I would like to say but that's how life works, you never get to say everything you feel."
"salfamily","10","5","8","28 September 2001"," Don't Believe the Naysayers
","Is Citizen Kane the greatest film of all time? Who cares? The fact that it's great is qualification enough. <br/><br/>While I can't say I'm surprised that so many have called this movie ""boring"" (the success of Jerry Bruckheimer hasn't escaped me, after all), I will say that I'm disheartened. I've always found the picture to be breathtaking, even exuberant, throughout its entire 119-minute running time. The sound and dialogue have a crackling wit to them, and the visuals! What can be said of Toland's cinematography that hasn't already been stated a million times over?<br/><br/>No, Citizen Kane is not emotionally jarring, and we don't necessarily feel any sympathy for any of its characters. We are not meant to identify with the movie's hero, Charles Foster Kane. We're merely asked to be intrigued by him, to contemplate his situation and how he came to it.<br/><br/>If the revelation that comes at the end of the film is a letdown, well, it's supposed to be. Ultimately, Rosebud is no more important to Kane the man than the girl with the white parasol is to Kane's assistant, Mr. Bernstein-- the girl whom Bernstein saw on a ferry dock one day and then never forgot. Rosebud is a remembrance, perhaps a symbol of youth or a transcendence that was never achieved, that has no significance outside of Kane's own mind. The revelation of what it truly is underscores the futility of trying to fathom and define a man's motivations-- it explains nothing.<br/><br/>But Rosebud's function within the film is clear-- it's the key that Welles and his collaborators use to open up the world of Charles Foster Kane and then spin us through it. And what a trip it is! The structure of the narrative and the visual program play out in a surprising, almost gleeful way (although people call it ""slow,"" I always find myself exhausted trying to keep up with what the movie throws at me). After I've watched it, I often have trouble pinpointing where exactly in the film certain scenes occur. It's almost too rich, too varied, to subtract from.<br/><br/>I also disagree with the notion that Citizen Kane is a ""cold"" movie. Several scenes emit a strong (if reserved) emotional warmth (those in which Kane first meets his mistress come to mind) while others are quite humorous (the razor sharp dialogue and the dead-on timing of the actors contribute substantially to this). And besides, not every movie is meant to give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside; not all set out to make you cry. Some simply dazzle you with the brilliance of their conception and force you to reconfigure your notions of what a movie can be."

The total result severely injured Welles' reputation, and inhibited his future ability to work freely and without inhibition--necessary requirements of the true artist. <br/><br/>The real-life scenario of Welles' being beckoned to South America to create a US ""propoganda movie,"" was undoubtedly a pay-back to private funders, who had granted Welles the addditional monies needed to finish ""Kane,"" but which place Welles in a vulnerable position of future obligation.<br/><br/>With the debacle of ""It's All True,"" the Pan-American project, which was parallel to the unauthorized studio hacking of ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" the dye of destiny was cast: it would be an uphill career struggle for this artist through the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Nowhere in the annals of film history is there so great a tragic figure as that of Orson Welles, whose genius deserved as fine a working environment as possible.  Alas, the distored values of the motion picture industry is the culprit; likewise, the blame is extended to big business in general, with its primary objective being almost perversely profit-oriented.<br/><br/>As the years pass, the great work of Welles will undoubtedly escalate in appreciation.

However, I also thought that great skill was used throughout the staging and shooting process of this film. The film really does show the audience watching how talented Wells really is. He acted in this film as well as wrote it and I believe that this gave him a great advantage when he created this film. Since he had wrote for the film and was starring in it as well that gave Wells more control of how his vision was portrayed on the screen and it worked out very well.

First off, I love what Welles does in the very beginning of the film with the news real about how Kane dies. Right off the bat, the end of the movie is given to you. Some people may hate that because it ruins the end immediately, but that's not the point of this film. Through incredible acting by director Orson Welles, you embark on the journey of a man of poverty into a successful publisher and politician eventually. The cinematography in this film is some of the best I have seen. One of my favorite scenes is the camera work done in the scene where the reporter enters the large private library that contains Kane's journal. The camera work done in that scene is magnificent. Also, the lighting done in Kane's political speech gives me a feel kind of like the Nazi party following Hitlers speeches. Makes a feel of full attention on the man and how important he is.

For Thompson, Rosebud will be another piece of a jigsaw puzzle he could never find. But the viewer is redeemed through all the things they learnt from Kanes life all these years. And as the final scene shows us with the flaming Rosebud, life goes on."

","Began seeing this film in snippets running in and out of the house between playing baseball in the backyard and heading back down into the basement with Cool-Aid and tuna fish sandwiches to sit on the couch and watch this thing on our black and white T.V. Sooner or later, it would be on the Bill Kennedy show and he would look into his files for newspaper footage about it. The thing that's so wonderful is how accessible this film is for being touted by some as 'the greatest of all time'. Whether or not that is so is more than I know. I've seen and enjoyed a lot of great films. Anything that I might say would barely add or subtract to what has already been said and would probably prove to be redundant at best, so I'll just make a few personal observations and let it go at that.<br/><br/>CITIZEN KANE is like a Magic Box filled with all these independent features of interest. Barely coming in under two hours it seems much longer than that and compares favorably with other epics that require an intermission somewhere between its three hours or more length. That's the first thing I have to say about it; the way it seems to dilate time and yet is over before you know it. You don't even have to see the thing from beginning to end to enjoy it. Some years passed before I actually sat down and saw this piece in its entirety. But it didn't seem to matter. There is something ubiquitous about it; it will be there for you when you get the time to fully appreciate it. As a kid, the film noir beginning made me wonder whether or not this was a horror story or some kind of detective tale. As most people know, the truth is it is both and more than that.<br/><br/>Agnes Moorehead never looked better in her life! Joseph Cotton along with the rest of the Mercury Theater come on strong in this tale. <br/><br/>There are many who will compare this film to THE GODFATHER or VERTIGO and there is probably much to be gained from this, but looking at the film from the inside out you feel yourself having access to one of the most liberal minds of all time. There is a strong spirit of inventiveness here where Welles as the auteur is not adapting his tale to the strictures of Film, but rather adapting the strictures of Film to this vision of grand sweeping storytelling. This to me is what separates it from other great films that it can be compared and discussed with. For most cinematic works, technique is subservient to the story; and yet in CITIZEN KANE it feels as though technique is subservient to the inventiveness of its creator. I'm sure this is true in some Hitchcock films and of course the films of Ingmar Bergman and others, but here that sense of inventiveness is less coldly calculated as it is with Hitchcock at his best, nor is it as somber and steeped in religious and philosophical overtones as it is with Bergman at his most profound. The inventiveness of Welles here is youthful and exuberant and in a naive sort of way distinctly American. Gangway! The young Turks have come to town! Clear the floor for some hoofin' and break out the champagne!<br/><br/>I say naive because there is something unselfconscious about this modern classic. Welles is too busy having fun to worry about posterity right now, he'll get back to you later concerning all that. I'll never forget the scene with the dance hall girls. After a bit of cinematic legerdemain where we see Kane buy off the whole staff of a rival newspaper and frame them for a news photograph, we then find his own people joining in to sing his praises. As a youngster the thing that startled me was how long this scene went on; Welles didn't seem to be doing this scene to serve the story particularly, but just for the sheer thrill of dancing with the ladies and having fun! The exhilaration of this scene was something that has stayed with me all my life. Some kind of energy seemed to spiral out of the screen and shake you by the shoulders and urge you to take one spin around yourself. Come on! There's enough booze and food for everyone! It's this scene that makes me wish that Welles had chosen the life of Babe Ruth to chronicle rather than that of William Randolph Hearst.<br/><br/>But it doesn't stop there. When you hear Welles present Kane as an orator you are seeing a spellbinder at work; you will see this side of Welles again in MOBY DICK and perhaps more importantly, in the final scenes of the film COMPULSION. This is the energy and passion of a young man at the height of his powers. Kane for President! He'll fight for the common people and win us our rights!<br/><br/>Eventually, due to poor choices and a marked propensity to love the power that his wealth brings him more than the people he supposedly wishes to champion, we see Kane progress towards his inevitable slide into tragedy. This is handled with sophistication and taste and we see how Kane becomes an embittered worn out old man living a shallow existence among the shadows of the things that he owns.<br/><br/>In the end, we are given a glimpse of insight into the character of Kane that is denied all the other characters in the film. But even that is just an echo of what Everett Sloan as Bernstein tells the reporter Jerry about the girl he saw crossing over on the Ferry. Soon even this is just so much smoke drifting up above the chain link fence and the NO TRESPASSING sign in front of Xanadu...<br/><br/>NEWS! ON THE MARCH!"
"PetarSrdanovic","10","3","4","10 July 2016"," The master-piece
","You may ask yourself: what are criteria for a good movie? This is a question of great importance; it is still an unsolved problem. However, there are some titles which deserve to bear title ''good'' or even ''master-piece'' despite the fact that we don't have such criteria. They change you completely, so you don't need any further proofs that they are ''good''. Orson Welles' ''Citizen Kane'' is certainly one of those titles. <br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane, the protagonist, was a very wealthy and powerful man. For decades, Kane had been influencing public opinion thanks to his media empire. But, ''as it must to all men, death came to Kane''. His death was an ordinary death. Old man died in his bed. His last word was an ordinary word - ''Rosebud''. Nevertheless, Kane wasn't an ordinary man. Wouldn't it be great if we could find out what he meant by ''Rosebud'' at his very end? Does ''Rosebud'' tell us something about Kane's life that can be helpful for understanding his personality?<br/><br/>In two hours of this master-piece, we didn't just get an answer to these questions. We got a story about Kane's whole life. Kane's childhood, youth, old age, moments of fear, love, suffering, his political failure, people he loved or, at least, possibly loved. After all that, at the very end of the movie, meaning of ''Rosebud'' is finally revealed. ''Rosebud'' is name for sleigh which represents Kane's childhood. <br/><br/>One could say: ''Well, what's exactly the point of all this? An old tycoon remembered his childhood, the period of his innocence; almost all men are emotionally connected to their childhood. Furthermore, there was no point in watching events on Kane's later life because they are completely irrelevant for the meaning of his last word.'' I strongly disagree to this kind of argument. In my opinion, Welles wanted to send a message to us. Two hours of Kane's life should show us that man (any man) is very complex being. Kane's acts, his speeches, his emotions are often strange and unexpected, even paradoxical. On the other side, his last word, ''Rosebud'', as I already said, represents his childhood. Childhood is period of simplicity. So, Welles' message could be: Even we are very complex, we naturally strive to simplicity. If that so, if we accept this as a truth, there will be a lot work for philosophers and scientists."

","Citizen Kane is a 1941 American mystery drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-author, director and star. The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film of all time, Citizen Kane was voted as such in five consecutive Sight & Sound polls of critics, until it was displaced by Vertigo in the 2012 poll. It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as AFI's 2007 update. Citizen Kane is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which were innovative for its time.<br/><br/>The quasi-biographical film examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of Welles's own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is told through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: ""Rosebud."""

","Any art becomes harder to appreciate as time passes. We look at statues and paintings from, lets say the Ancient Greece, and we appreciate them for their aesthetic, their style and the craftsmanship that went into making them. Yet we often know very little about why or even how they were made. Were they political in their time, like art often is nowadays, or were they made simply to feed the artist, like some of the greatest works of art in history have sometimes been made? And if we somehow found out that a painting of a human figure in some prehistoric cave was actually a political satire of the rival clan chief, would it add value to the work?<br/><br/>I ponder this because I don't think I fully get Citizen Kane, or if I even can get it without a degree in history. Back in its days, the film was widely applauded for its groundbreaking style and its cinematographic feats. Orson Welles put himself on the map by pulling off tricks and visuals that had never been seen before. He also based the story of one Charles Foster Kane on a real life business tycoon William Randolph Hearst, a polarizing figure back then, thus tying the film to the days of its release.<br/><br/>And I view this film and I must admit that it didn't blow me away. The cinematography is brilliant and impressive, but I've seen most of the tricks already in newer films, and thus their impact is lessened. And while it's an interesting character study about the meaning of contentment, wealth and American ideals, I was left with the impression that I was missing something. And I think it's that I have no real life parallels to compare this film to. Especially seeing as I'm not an American.<br/><br/>Is it still a good film? Oh, definitely. It's a pioneer of its field, its themes are very deep, it's beautiful on the technical level and even the story, while rather slow, does keep you interested through the capturing presence of Welles' acting. I do recommend seeing it, though I must admit that I respect it more than I like it."
"DoctorHver","10","3","4","19 May 2016"," When you lose your Rosebud, your childhood is gone.

That brings noting than just misery and unhappiness. <br/><br/>Thus the meaning of Kane's final words's right in front of everyone sight yet nobody see through them. Because they themselves have also gone through similar prospect as Mr. Kane when going form youthful child to an unfulfilled adult. <br/><br/>Citizan Kane's far as i'm concerned is just one of very few movies that make me cry every time I watch. Probably because I feel deeply connected with the change of going from child to an adult. Which I find highly depressing.

","Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles), media mogul, dies at his isolated palatial estate, Xanadu. A virtual recluse, his only company was his large retinue of servants and his collection of priceless artifacts. A news outlet sets out to reveal the man behind the legend, going through articles and books on Kane, interviewing his friends, associates and ex-wife. They see his rise to power and fortune, his marriages, his attempts at politics. Moreover, they are striving to discover the meaning of his dying utterance - Rosebud. <br/><br/>A masterpiece in every way. Superb plot, written by Orson Welles and Herman J Mankiewicz. Covers some very powerful themes, all of which are still relevant today: the corruption of innocence and ideals by power, wealth and greed; the power, manipulation and deceitfulness of the media, the yearning for simpler times and how earthly fortunes mean nothing in the end.<br/><br/>Brilliant direction by Welles - this movie set a new benchmark in the field and even today would be difficult to surpass. His camera work and cinematography are exquisite: the use of light and dark (especially), the camera angles, panning shots. Just watching it you know you are watching a master craftsman at work - every shot is carefully planned and deliberately aimed to create a certain effect. It feels like art.<br/><br/>Solid performances all round, with Welles to the fore again. Even the makeup is in another league - witness the transformations of Kane from 25 years old to 30-something, to 50-something all the way to his final days at 70-something.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest travesty in all of cinema is that Citizen Kane did not win the 1942 Best Picture Oscar. It was nominated in nine categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actor and Best Original Screenplay, but only one won Oscar - Best Original Screenplay. Best Picture went to How Green Was My Valley, a good movie but not in Citizen Kane's league.<br/><br/>The reason for this may well have been a campaign by media tycoon William Randolph Hearst to discredit the movie and prevent it from being released. The movie was loosely based on the life of Hearst."
"CriticalViewing","10","3","4","27 April 2016"," Cinematic and Storytelling raw excellence
","This film by Orson Welles shows the end of the film first, but without explanation. The ensuring story, is about that explanation. It fills in the pieces of it as it goes along from various angles and viewpoints from those who knew him in some way in some point and time, or the few that actually managed to have a close relationship with Mr. Kane, such as his best friend Leland. This film capitalized it's black and white color base, use of low and high camera angles to show the power dynamic, and lighting most heavily to relay this story (outside of the ever clear use of diction in this, and many other, films). The film plays in a staggered time-wave while remaining logically chronological. It progresses with giving flashback moments of a forward moving story that we as the audience know from the opening scene, him dying alone saying ""Rosebud"" with his final breaths. The film makes great use of being filmed in black and white, to have stark shadow contrast, and of light 3-point lighting. Low key lighting is made dominant, but high key is used as well. Just as in life, there are happy times and there are not so happy, dark, fearful, stressful, depressed times. It is an autobiographical representation of real world William Randolph Hearst. Hearst hated the film and fought to keep it out of theaters, away from eyes that would view it and stick to it as truth of the extremely powerful man, how always has an air of a low camera angle following his life. Kane, becomes just as powerful, but the dark side to all of his success, and all of his and those close to him, such as his wife. The Welles rendition both shows the extravagance and aired out the dirty laundry of it all. He kept the fact that Hearst was a hard working man with the drive and ambition, dedication to success and charm, that helped bring him to the top. But he added in the bad, which was distasteful and unacceptable to Hearst. Still this film remains in circulation, and the cinematic prowess with which this story is told remains one of the many great American film classics."

","I fondly recollect, growing up in Canada in the 70's and 80's, my mom taking my older sister and I to the cinema (my dad was more interested in watching bowling, hockey, or either crime shows, British sitcoms or hockey on TV). Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous."

","""Citizen Kane"" is possibly the most acclaimed film that I know of. It's been called the ""greatest film of all time"" by a lot of film critics, polls, magazines, etc.<br/><br/>The film is a chronicle of the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictional character based off of William Randolph Hearst, a famous newspaper publisher. The film's structure is highly unconventional, in which Kane's life is revealed through interviews with various people who knew him well, making a majority of the film a series of flashbacks.<br/><br/>On both a technical and story level the film is quite influential. The story, itself, becomes far more bleak and dark than a lot of the films coming out at that time (at least in the US, that is), and it completely insults a very powerful figure (that being William Randolph Hearst) who was still alive at the time, and fought to get the film banned (just watch the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" and the drama ""RKO 281"", two films that are also quite great).<br/><br/>On a technical level, there's many extremely inventive techniques being developed here. There's one particularly interesting low angle shot that was made so low because Welles actually drilled a hole in the floor of the set. Other than that shot, you mine as well look at every single other shot or scene if you want to see some technical innovation. You could just analyze it frame by frame if you want to attempt to see all of its influential visuals, and you still may not have truly seen all of the detail. As Roger Ebert said on the commentary, ""Citizen Kane"" is actually a special effects picture. The main difference between this film's special effects and the special effects in a film like ""Jurassic Park"" (another greatly influential film) is that the special effects in this film are kind of hidden, but nonetheless powerful in their own right.<br/><br/>A lot of people may call it the #1 most important film of all time, but I have to disagree. While it certainly is one of the most important films of all time, one really needs to go back to the silent era to find all the TRULY most important films. Films like ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Great Train Robbery"", ""The Birth of a Nation"", and ""Intolerance"". Welles, himself, actually did say during his introduction of D.W. Griffith's classic ""Intolerance"" that that film deserves all the credit for a lot of modern cinema's techniques.<br/><br/>However, with all its technical innovations that have been talked on and on about time and time again, I've heard very little about how ENTERTAINING the film is. ""Well that's because it isn't entertaining!"" I can hear some guy who had overly high expectations (and gave the film 1 star with a lengthy review entitled ""Disappointing"") shout. Well, you're wrong, the film is quite entertaining! Sure, there's no action sequences, explosions, Adam Sandler doesn't play his twin sister, and Kevin James doesn't wackily fall down 420,000 times, but there IS true human emotion, iconic lines of dialogue, and a truly compelling imagery that ends with one of cinema's greatest twists! There was actually a time in my life in which I watched ""Citizen Kane"" nearly once a day because I enjoyed it so much! I genuinely watched it TWICE in one day just because of how much I enjoyed it, which is very rare with me.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the greatest film of all time, maybe you should lower your expectations a tad bit and just experience the film for what it is."
"Anthony_Miller","10","3","4","9 February 2016"," Exceeded expectations and then some!
","As someone who's seen plenty of excellent modern films, I expected Citizen Kane's greatness to strongly depend on historic innovations rather than truly timeless quality. But after watching it in my film course this week, I immediately recognized why it has been touted by many (including famous film critic Roger Ebert) as nothing less than the best piece of cinema to ever grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>Orson Welles and his team left no stone unturned in their quest to fill every scene with clever camera-work, intelligent blocking, smooth editing and... well the list goes on and on. Right from the first scene, where you are embraced with the cold and dark tone of the movie through creatively plastered-together shots of the ominous Kane castle, you know you are in for something special. Something that I don't normally notice in contemporary movies but I picked up on in this one is the lighting. The lighting in this film is practically another character, and this in and of itself is something to be in awe of. I can't imagine the amount of time, effort and talent it required to craft something so precisely beautiful. I feel like a sap going on like this but Citizen Kane truly is a masterclass in filmmaking.<br/><br/>I went into this movie expecting a dull experience with decent technical aspects and cheesy performances but left it with a whole new mindset on what makes a good film and what makes a good filmmaker. If you're a terrible cinephile like me who is reluctant to watch the 1940s classics, I strongly recommend giving this a watch."

","Citizen Kane is one of those films that you hear about a lot when studying film. After seeing the film, I can see why. I thought this film was great. Orson Wells does an awesome job telling a story through flashbacks. The dynamic between the characters is really cool as well. The acting, I thought, is really what shines about this film. Wells plays Kane himself, and no one could of done it better. Wells knew exactly how he wanted his loud, commanding chapter to be portrayed and he did exactly that. The editing is another great part of the film, flashbacks can be tricky but Wells does a graceful job in depicting it. The only criticism I would have is the dialog at many times seems like filler, as I was lost at time about what they were talking about, it seemed nonsensical. However, I sort of enjoy this aspect of movies sometimes, when the dialog is entertaining, which is true about this film. I would recommend it to anyone. It is truly a masterpiece in film."

I've known of Orson Welles but have never seen any of his movies until this one and it definitely left me wanting to watch more of his films. This movie is a mystery-drama about news reporters trying to figure out what Charles Kane, a wealthy publisher's last words. The plot was well written and I found it to be entertaining to watch. I could not stop thinking and wanting to know what Kane's last words had meant, this keeps the viewers intrigued and not want to take their eyes off of the screen. It's said by many that this is the greatest movie ever; it is also said that it is extremely overrated.

And after watching the movie I can safely say that it deserves all the recognition that it gets. What I simply love about this film is that it simply is going and discovering the life of Mister Kane. Just who he was and how he got to where he is. And the great symbolism in the film with the first and last scenes will make you wonder why you didn't think of that being one of the answers to the question, what is rosebud?

","Citizen Kane is tremendous, to say the least. The film feels larger than life. Not just conceptually, not just in the sum of all its parts, but also through smaller things like sound design, camera movement, set design, lighting, moving performances and even tiny scraps of dialogue.<br/><br/>When each component of a movie serves that movie so well, they can be forgotten. The final product seems to transcend equipment and technique, though they are obviously imperative to the film the audience ends up seeing.<br/><br/>The sense of space conveyed by the film is incredible. The larger-than-life feeling that even strikes the audience plays well to the character of Charles Foster Kane, as well as to the ""point"" of the movie itself. The spaces within the movie get bigger and bigger as it goes on, and as Kane's life goes along and his riches grow. Those in the film who are searching for the meaning of Kane's last words are moving into bigger and bigger spaces, in the company of more and more important people, but getting no closer to the point. In many ways, this is how Kane's life itself is portrayed to feel. All of the money, statues, square footage in the world could not lead him to a meaning, to a sense of fulfillment. One scene in particular comes to mind in relation to this: a conversation between Kane and Susan in a parlor of their mansion. They need to shout across the room to one another, and their echoes show the audience how empty material pleasures can be.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie are fantastic as well. Small and simple movements or expressions carry dialogue that seems small but feels quite heavy, even to those watching. This is the result of that rare combination of excellent writing acted out by just the right actor.<br/><br/>In many of these ""smaller"" factors, Citizen Kane seems to have hit the lottery. Each aspect is great in its own right, and fits just perfectly with each other piece. There aren't many other movies like that."
"CalvinValjean","10","3","4","10 December 2015"," The Great American Film
","Why would I ever write any kind of review on CITIZEN KANE, a film that's been analyzed to death and is considered to film what Shakespeare is considered to literature? I actually have a good reason: in recent years, I've noticed more and more people seem to dislike the film, mostly because of its hype. Supposedly Ingmar Bergman called it boring. Now I happen to be a Bergman fan, but considering the dude made some pretty slow-paced movies, those are strong words! I can understand why many might feel let down by the story. The hype ""Greatest Movie of All Time"" implies that you are in for a great, sweeping GONE WITH THE WIND-style epic. Instead it's a smaller film about an unsavory character. It also focuses a lot on the newspaper business, which may not seem very relevant to modern audiences. My friend Zelda summed it up quite well: <br/><br/>""I think that at this point, the film is more appreciated by directors than it is by general audiences. I know that what Orson Welles was doing with the camera, with angles, lighting, whatnot, was revolutionary - but I know this because I've been told this. As a plebeian when it comes to such things, those aspects don't stand out for me as much, and I understand they're big factors in what make that movie a classic. Instead what I have is a puzzle of a story, which, while interesting, is not compelling emotionally enough for me to place it in my top films list.""<br/><br/>This is a fair point, so here is what I propose. I will write a review about KANE where I will not ONCE mention the technical breakthroughs of the film. Forget about the cinematography, score, editing, etc. I will simply analyze the film's Story and why I feel that it is actually a very powerful and heartbreaking story.<br/><br/>CITIZEN KANE can be summed up easily: it's the story of a man who can never get over having been rejected by his mother and is incapable of feeling love. <br/><br/>This point might only be fully clear on repeat viewings. Mrs. Kane only has one scene in the movie, but we linger on her a bit, allowing her to dominate the scene. After that she is only mentioned in passing. Kane talks about her death on the same night that he meets Susan for the first time. We never know exactly how Kane feels about her, and what exactly he is thinking when he tears the room apart is left to our imaginations, but we feel the weight of it. We observe him cheat on one wife with the next and we're not told why. Yet when analyzing the facts, we do know why. We also observe him alienate his friends. On the surface this may seem to just be a petty drama, but only after we get the full story are we able to understand why this man so desperately needed to be loved.<br/><br/>Kane remains elusive; he is ultimately the protagonist of the Story, but he is always a mystery to us, and he is portrayed both positively and negatively. This moral ambiguity applies to most of the supporting the characters as well. If you notice, we remain on a last-name basis with almost every character in the film: Kane, Leland, Bernstein, Thatcher, and Thompson. With Thompson it is taken a step further in that we never even see his face properly, making it clear that although we are following this reporter around, he is more a symbol than a character, and it is Kane's story that should be our focus. Developing the characters in this way makes them seem like regular people, occupying a story rather than starring in it.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the issue of the ending. Rosebud is obviously a MacGuffin and perhaps people were expecting some sort of big reveal. The film has the confidence to end on a puzzle; Rosebud is revealed not in the style of a detective solving the case with a big ""Aha!"" gimmick, but as a subtle artifact that rewards us for paying attention and makes us think about how it fits in. Had the film ended in a different way, perhaps we wouldn't be talking about it today, but the fact that only moments after Rosebud is revealed it is then destroyed are perhaps the saddest moments of the story and what have caused the tale to resonate.<br/><br/>I don't think any film deserves the title ""greatest ever made"" because that's obviously going to be subjective. Here it is has perhaps done more harm than good. If CITIZEN KANE were a novel, it would not be a great sweeping epic like WAR AND PEACE, which is perhaps what too many people expect. It would be a very short and quiet novel. It is about a person's life, but it only observes it rather than embellishes it. It is not a melodrama but a voyeuristic study. At the end of the film, we see Kane's entire lifetime reduced to boxes and boxes of scrap, and we are asked whether or not a man's life can be summed up so simply. Or maybe we know that such a collection of junk is all any of us will ever have."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","3","4","3 December 2015"," Welles' masterpiece
","Well I finally watched it, the so-called ""greatest movie of all time"". Does it deserve the praise? Yes. Is it the greatest film of all time? I wouldn't go that far. Its eclipsed for me by other classics like Casablanca, Taxi Driver, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. But Citizen Kane is absolutely a great film, telling the story of one of the most famous characters of cinema history.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane opens, as we all know, with the passing of a titan. Whispering ""Rosebud"", Kane passes into the void and his snow globe shatters. Journalists desperately try to come up with a tribute that does not just retell his life but rather peels back the layers to expose the man within. With just the word ""rosebud"" to go off, journalist Jerry Thompson seeks out Kane's guardian, friend, co-worker, ex-wife and butler to conduct interviews that might reveal what ""rosebud"" means and that it might give a clue as to who Kane was. The film is shot in flashbacks with these interviews, a story technique I don't particularly care for but works essentially with the framing of the story and the mystery of Rosebud.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane breathes on two superb aspects, the first being Gregg Toland's breathtaking cinematography. Welles and Toland also orchestrate one of the most widely used and effective tools – shooting powerful characters from below and weak characters from above to diminish them. The only time this doesn't work is when in the final scenes, we can see Welles' prosthetic mask under his chin that would have been easier to hide with a different angle. Moreover, I am stunned by the fact that Citizen Kane contains some of the most perfect shots of all cinema history – Kane walks past a mirror, reflecting himself countless times out; the way the camera zooms in Kane's speech but manages never to lose frame on that iconic Kane for Governor poster in the background; Thompson sits down to read an archive with the light beaming in from a small window – I could just list them all. The last shot, a retreating camera over the clutter of Kane's estate, then the reveal of Rosebud's fate before a cut to black smoke spewing from his chimney is a masterpiece of reveal, camera-work and editing – and even thought I've seen it a dozen times on Youtube clips, it sent chills through my entire body. <br/><br/>The other aspect is Welles' magnetic performance as Kane. Welles himself was 25 when he made the movie – which you would never believe because he carries gravitas of a man twice his age with ten times the life experience. There is only one scene in which Welles plays his own age, and he does it with a youthful glint in his eye, but in the later scenes he carries the same sort of powerful presence that we expect from esteemed actors like Sir Daniel Day- Lewis or Sir Ian McKellen. The makeup team does probably the finest work I've ever seen in a film, ever. Kane's rage is palpable, his drive profound, and during one scene his sense of loss is affecting by the void we feel in his performance. Welles captures so perfectly the emotionally hollow man that Kane was, always seeking approval from others because he grew up distant from his parents. In one very telling scene, his son waves excitedly and Kane responds with a polite salute rather than anything warmer.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane's screenplay is a deserving representative of the film at the Oscars, with scenes like his disastrous run for Governor worthy of commendation in their own right. I could probably have done without most of the first twelve minutes, which is little more than an expository summary of the movie condensed for the paper's eulogy. It only sought to highlight also how skimmed over Kane's first wife was – their marriage consists only of a few back-and-forth scenes at the dinner table. She and their young son vanish from the film and without the opening montage I'd never know why. The other problems I have with the film are just problems of a past era of film – characters talk over each other, people hold phone conversations but don't pause long enough for the other person to speak, and people shout all the time because film was still in its early years. <br/><br/>None of that is to take away from Orson Welles' masterful film. His performance is one for the ages and some of the techniques in making the film should be used to teach new recruits to the industry. However, the thing I found fascinating was that in the closing credits, Welles gives every actor their due but slides himself into the extended cast list. Whether he was being humble about his performance or something else entirely, I found it fascinating.<br/><br/>Also, suck it Lisa – there totally is a cane in Citizen Kane. He carries it on the street when he meets his second wife."

","Citizen Kane is a timeless classic. In fact,it's probably the greatest film ever made(at least the AFI thinks so).

The film explores the darkness and depressiveness of humanity, and how money can't buy happiness.<br/><br/>Most of the credit for this fantastic film should go to Orson Welles, as Wrote, Directed and Starred as Kane.

","This film was absolutely incredible every time I watch a movie that is this old I am shocked to find how ahead of its time it really was. Orson Welles in this film was incredible his presence always looms throughout the whole film even though he is dead. I love how a lot of the movie involves flashbacks of Charles Foster Kane's life. The constant unknowing of his final words tends to drive you crazy throughout the whole film. And at the end when you find out what ""rosebud"" means your happily contempt with what it means. The visuals in this movie are great its very transcendent of the atmosphere. But my question is how did they hear Kane say ""rosebud"" when there was no one in the room with him?"
"tjgoalie13","9","3","4","8 October 2015"," A Beautiful Portrait of a Tragic Character
","Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.<br/><br/>When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character. Another obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?<br/><br/>The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end ""Rosebud."" Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says ""A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known."" <br/><br/>It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud. <br/><br/>Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema."
"851222","9","3","4","15 September 2015"," A very solid movie with some mystery
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" (1941) isn't the best or most important movie ever made in my opinion. As there one word cannot explain man's life, one movie can not influence flow of cinema itself. That said ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good picture, while it's opening ~17 min are nothing short of brilliant and next 40 min are superb, the movie felt short a bit during the end, with to much being focused on ""the singer"" rather on Kane's life itself. <br/><br/>There are some truly brilliant camera shoots in this movie, which i suppose was one of the first camera tricks at the time. Acting is very good, especially by Orson Welles - he should have won Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Script is great and directing is also a tip notch, that is why this movie barely drags.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Citizen Kane"" is a very good movie about with some mystery. I kinda guest the meaning of this word during the end, and last scenes confirmed my guess - it is a good mystery but maybe a bit over-hyped (no spoilers). This movie definitely worth seeing once (even as i'm watching for the first time just now in 2015)."
"pioneerlythere37","9","3","4","14 September 2015"," ""Rosebud.""
","Without subtitles I thought that Charles Foster Kane had said ""frostbite"". In the opening minute I almost thought I was watching a horror movie, the way the cinematographer went from one scene to another, aided by the fact that Xanadu looked haunted.<br/><br/>The trivia for ""Citizen Kane"" was some of the most interesting trivia I've ever read. Orson Welles wrote and acted the character of Charles Foster Kane superbly well, and I suppose also did well directing himself. If this movie does anything, it is displaying yellow journalism and corrupted almost-politicians. Only Charles Foster Kane would think it ""fun"" to run a newspaper. At times Kane appears to be the man he wants people to think he is: a loving, kind, honest man, who would fit better than any other eligible man as the governor. Thanks to his friends, we brutally discover the true man underneath the layer of fake skin: a selfish, heartless man who only has one true goal in life: success, which he believes will also bring him happiness. But success cannot buy happiness, which he seemingly doesn't find out until his final dying moments.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely not one of my ""Great Movies"", as it was Ebert's. As interesting as this movie was, the thing that nagged at my mind the most was the fact that, if he died when he was alone, how does anyone know what his final words were? Somehow, amazingly, this thought apparently never did occur to Welles or any of the other cast, crew, or producers until after it was released, whereas it occurred to me within ten minutes, as I'm sure it did to many other viewers. Did Ebert himself miss this fact, even after hundreds of viewings, or somehow shrug it off, even after doing an audio commentary on it? Perhaps I can see how he shrugged it off, considering I have done the same on other movies I've enjoyed, though the problems were less obvious and less important to the plot.<br/><br/>This movie seems almost documentary-style, first giving us a summary of his life, then going back and addressing each plot point in more detail. The movie's strong points were the directing, characterization, and cinematography, and Welles' acting, although the other actors were quite disappointing. The movie was interesting and fun to watch, and the mystery kept us intrigued, although it was not quite what I was expecting. Charles Foster Kane was a very entertainingly arrogant character, and quite an incredible debut for Orson Welles. The end reveal is fascinating and meaningful in itself.<br/><br/>My Official Score: 89.5/100"
"LowellFan09","10","3","4","1 September 2015"," One of the greatest films of all time - beautifully shot and directed
","Many critics and fans alike regard Citizen Kane as the greatest film of all time, and it's easy to see how that endearing reputation has befitted its audacious production for so many decades. In experiencing the film on Blu-ray (the 70th Anniversary Edition, to be exact), the film holds up magnificently well through the innovative and distinctive structure, make-up/visual effects, and lighting employed by Orson and his team all those years ago.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane, of course, was the directorial debut of Orson Welles, whose booming and authoritative voice had made a him career in radio after co-founding the Mercury Theatre with John Houseman in 1937. By 1938, they created the Mercury Theatre on Air which would showcase their famous reading of the H.G. Wells classic, 'War of the Worlds,' a prank many took serious upon first hearing. Eventually, RKO Radio Pictures would grant Welles total freedom to make any picture he wanted; needless to say, Citizen Kane was born and became the darling it now is with both critics and fans around the world. While the picture did lose RKO money initially, the financial loss says nothing of its considerable contribution to cinema.<br/><br/>The film is known for its incredibly poetic composition, deep focus, and nonlinear storytelling, which I must say, allows revisiting the picture to be a much more pleasurable experience since one is always trying to dissect all these wonderfully visual elements. Much of this credit should go to cinematographer Gregg Toland, whose use of 'deep focus,' a terrific technique whereby the back and foregrounds are equally in focus, became essential in giving Citizen Kane its unique and often-times deceptive appearance. Toland of course won the Academy Award for cinematography for William Wyler's 'Wuthering Heights' the year prior, and would subsequently assist Welles in making a picture that allowed the audience themselves to decide the importance of what was on screen without obvious dictation from the director or crew. So many of these incredible shots allow for plenty of clever effects and underlining of character foreshadowing as the story moves along.<br/><br/>The acting is also a remarkable standout, in particular Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom were friends with Welles from his Mercury Theatre on the Air radio crew, as were most of the actors in the film, in fact. The latter however - the stunningly enigmatic Agnes Moorehead - is my favorite performance of the entire picture. There's such a restraint and composure to her character that goes unmatched by anyone else. Sadly, she has less screen time than her co-stars, but this of course makes her no less effective in my view. Her performance is so boldly pronounced that she alone is responsible for quickly hooking the audience into the story of young Charles Foster Kane; we cannot help but want to learn of what happens to this young man through seeing his mother portrayed so fearlessly in such an important context of the movie. Bernard Herrmann's music is also a grand addition to the picture, loaning its duties to all sorts of emotions - drama, comedy, suspense; he even supplies an original aria for one of Kane's opera- singing mistresses. It's a fantastic, widespread composition for which brings a lot of weight to Welles' vision. The Blu-ray of course is great and features the stunning, Academy Award-nominated documentary, The Battle for Citizen Kane, along with commentaries and other features. It's definitely worth upgrading from the DVD and I urge anyone who has yet to see this film to purchase it immediately.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a fine example of how motion pictures can establish themselves as true art and what young filmmakers should focus on as an influence over their own productions. Let us not forget those who laid these tracks before us; they surely lead back to some magnificent places, don't they?"
"Patti-Gaston","9","3","4","18 March 2015"," Remarkable!
","I can see why this movie is on the top of everyone's lists; I can't stop thinking about it! ""Citizen Kane is rich with symbolism, layers upon layers of meaning and incredible cinematography. From Kane's death bed utterance to the final scene I was spellbound! I keep thinking about why Kane did what he did, who he was trying to replace with all the life size statues he brought back from Europe and what Kane's life might have looked like if his parents didn't send him packing for a neat $50,000 a year. My interpretation of Citizen Kane is this: the man, Charles Foster Kane seeks desperately to replace his mother who sent him away as a young boy but no amount of expensive statuary can replace the love he was denied as a child. His youth went up in smoke just as all his childhood treasures in the movie's final scene. A must see film, not only is the story thought provoking, the camera work, lighting and each frame from the film is a treasure."

"pleamon111","10","3","4","13 December 2014"," Is it as Good at the Hype? Almost
","In all honesty, I went into this movie knowing about how people call it a film classic so I am not looking at this movie as if it was just released yesterday. One of favorite aspect of this movie was how they didn't just tell the story of Kane's life beginning to end as most movies do, the way Welles used Kane's last words ""rosebud"" as more of an object through which the rest of plot developed was very interesting. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the film is that throughout the movie there are several key characters and while brilliantly acted, I never fully understood who they were. If I watched the film over again I would probably understand who everyone was but in my opinion it took something away from the story. These characters were very interesting and each had a different perspective on who Mr. Kane was, I feel that if I could distinguish his account from his best friend I think this would have added more to the experience for me.<br/><br/>Another aspect I really enjoyed about the movie was the acting. Although as previously mentioned sometimes it was hard to distinguish who was who, but the performances were still really good. Orson Welles did an amazing job as the rich powerful, but never happy newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane. I really enjoyed seeing how Mr. Kane reacted to money and wealth and how as he gotten older he looked at the world differently. Also Dorothy Comingore who played Susan Alexander Kane had a wonderful performance that really showed the emotional toll of living with Mr. Kane. The way her character developed really highlighted how Mr. Kane changed throughout the film and really added something to the movie.<br/><br/>The only other problem I had with the movie is in some parts the movie was slow. This was not a huge part of the movie but some scenes seemed to drag on a little to long.<br/><br/>In Conclusion, Is it 'The greatest in cinema history' as some have said? I don't think so. With that being said is it possible that I just didn't appreciate the movie fully. Probably. I think it was well directed, acted, and had an interesting story. I will definitely want to watch the movie again and maybe after a second viewing I will understand its full brilliance. Util then, I think this is a great movie that definitely made cinema history at the time and has only been getting more respected as time goes on. I would definitely recommend you see this move and make your own conclusion."
"AlexandraJordan1987","9","3","4","12 December 2014"," Flashback, Flashback Flashback!
","I really love a good film with a nice set of flashback story telling, and this one is it! Straight from the beginning we are thrown into a deep story about a group of people trying to get to the bottom of a rich mans last utterance, and the director takes the viewer through a flashback joy ride. This film incorporated great camera angles of the ceiling , lighting techniques and quick jump shots, which is largely part of the reason why this film was so groundbreaking: in that all of the elements of editing and cinematography that are seen in Citizen Kane had never really been put together in the same film before. Another thing that i truly enjoyed with this film was that the flashback story telling came from multiple narrators and not just a single one, which again was something that had never really been done prior to this film."
"temmons-908-283115","10","3","4","7 May 2014"," Wells has amazing directorial control
","Citizen Kane is one of those movies, that from the very opening scene, has atmosphere so immersing that it draws you in to the scene as if the whole audience is now sitting inside the the shot with the characters. The same can be said for only a small handful of special movies, but Citizen Kane is definitely on the list. In the first twenty minutes we see a documentary presented on the life of Charles Foster Kane, and when the documentary has finished we pan over to a dark room full of reporters. There is smoke in the air highlighted by small square windows, and the actors are silhouetted as they pass by creating an almost star burst like effect. Kane's control over these small details is what keeps the film interesting and the viewer interested in watching what visual nuances will be captured next."
"booklover1","10","3","4","28 January 2014"," A Masterpiece
","The first time I watched Citizen Kane, while I appreciated the technical advancements and its influence on film in general, and while I thought the film was fantastic, I didn't really believe it to be the film to end all films in the aspects of character, plot, and entertainment. However, recently I decided to re-watch a lot of ""Classics"" that I watched at a younger age. Movies like Gone with the Wind, Crash, Avatar, Vertigo, Rear Window, the movies I watched as a kid and liked (Except for Rear Window, for some odd reason) but I never considered the best. While I haven't gotten to the movies I just listed yet, I did manage to sit down and watched Orson Welles's masterpiece, Citizen Kane. And you know what? I finally got it.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie made me feel something. There were scenes filled with energy, filled with emptiness, filled with tragedy, it really does take you through the full scope of such a successful man's life, and even though Charles Foster Kane himself can sometimes be arrogant, egotistical, and downright terrible, you don't feel justice when he fails. You feel sympathy. But why? Because in the end, through his ups and downs, he's a human being. He has emotions, he has flaws, he has likable traits, he's extremely fleshed out throughout the film, and while he may not be the most enjoyable, suave, or likable character, he certainly is one of the best in film history.<br/><br/>Another thing I feel is worth discussing is the ending. Everybody knows it, thanks to Family Guy feeling it was humorous to spoil it for no other reason just to do so, as well as basically every review mentioning it. So don't go any further unless you already seen the film. So, throughout the film, news reporters are eager to find the meaning to a famous millionaire's final word, ""Rosebud"" (Which before anyone throws that plot-hole in my face, I just go with the theory that he said it loud enough for the nurse outside to hear). At first, they believe it's a girl, possibly one of the many that he's dated throughout his life. This is understandable, as the millionaire, Mr. Kane, is famous for being around women.<br/><br/>However, in the end, Rosebud is not a woman, or anything anyone thought it would be. Rosebud was in fact, his childhood sled. Earlier in the film, we see Charles as a young boy, with his sled, which at this point, we don't know its name. Charles is taken away from his mother at a young age to get an education, leaving his sled, his home, and his childhood behind.<br/><br/>His parents had sent Charles away to become rich, and leave behind his poverty in which he grew up in. However, as Charles dies, he looks into a snow-globe, and with his final word, he remembers a time in which he was truly happy. Sure, he became rich and famous, but it would be entirely possible that in the end, he would have been happier if they decided to just let him play in the snow.<br/><br/>So in the final scene, you see the sled thrown into a fire, merely junk in everyone's eyes. It was an old sled to them, but to Charles Foster Kane, it symbolized loss of innocence, similar to Lord of the Flies, with the children becoming barbaric, mimicking the world they lived in, and by the end, they cry for the loss of their innocence, as instead of being shielded from the violence like the evacuation intended, they embraced it.<br/><br/>Orson Welles is fantastic, displaying power and greed, but also bolstering an ego. He also did a good job depicting the different ages of his character, with his make-up helping as well. The other actors do a great job as well, and while some of them were a bit hammy, it definitely matched the personalities of the characters they were portraying.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about what makes the film fantastic, the film is shot gorgeously, with both the camera-work and the sets matching the mood of the scene, the editing is extremely modern and keeps the film flowing at a good pace, and the film knows when music should be played, and when the scene should be silent, something a lot of films from the 30's and 40's fail at doing. But in the end, it would just be me reinstating how fantastic the film is, which I really don't think should be repeated, as I believe you get the picture by this point.<br/><br/>So, is this my favorite film? Well, it's tough to say, but I think it's just barely worse than Lawrence of Arabia, though that may have been for the bird scene in Citizen Kane, which, like the car scene in Tarkovsky's Solaris, it felt like a fourth wall gimmick to me. But when I'm comparing a film to something like Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard to come up with favorites. I guess that's why I list off my favorites rather than usually picking one. But I'm getting off topic here. Citizen Kane is a powerhouse of a film, the type of film that doesn't happen often, but the type of film that not only inspires all to come, but still manages, among the clichÃ©s it creates and amount of people who have the film spoiled for them, to remain fresh and new to all who watch it."
"davelucas1974","10","3","4","1 April 2013"," Citizen Cane Review
","www.TheMovieFrog.com Classic Cinema Series #2 - Citizen Kane #2<br/><br/>Starting a review for Citizen Kane feels a lot like starting a review for Casablanca did. What am I going to say about the film Roger Ebert has dubbed ""the greatest of all time"" that hasn't been said before? EVERYONE knows that this is one of the most innovative and masterfully constructed movies ever told. It was drastically ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, editing, sound design, you name it. But we all knew these things long before I started this article.<br/><br/>I could certainly write a whole review about the acting, so naturalistic and understated for a picture of the time period. Welles is a revelation as Kane, with this marvelously smug yet confidential line delivery like he's talking down to you and honoring you with a secret wisdom at the same time. Agnes Moorehead is positively creepy as the loving mother who has completely turned her emotions off in order to do what's best for her son. Dorothy Comingore absolutely blows me away as Susan Alexander Kane, probably the most fully realized character not featured in the title. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the movie is full of great performances. Again...we knew this going in.<br/><br/>I could speak at great length about the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. We begin with the end of the story, then we get a brief overview that lays the ground work for the sub plot that creates the structure for the rest of the movie. Then we see different, shifting periods in Kane's life through the eyes of several different characters who all have their own take on who the man was. This may not seem so significant in an age where film makers like Nolan and Tarantino regularly turn chronology on its head, but these men owe a huge debt to Welles for showing them how it is done long before they were born. But...we knew this.<br/><br/>I could write a piece in which the central point is that Citizen Kane is one of the most quietly busy films ever made, rife with symbolism. In the opening scene alone, we are treated to images of snow super-imposed over Kane's face symbolic of both an ending, and the story's beginning (which we don't know yet). We see the snow globe shatter, as Kane lets go of his... (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)"

","A movie of epic proportions is how I would describe Citizen Kane. I have watched this film a couple of times, expecting not to like it as much as I would. Being a movie that gets a lot of hype with its title as 'the greatest movie of all time,' I can clearly see why. Is it the greatest of movie of all time? I don't know and that is up to your opinion, but all I can say is that I try not to watch films with those impressions influencing my expectations. Although what I can say is that I greatly appreciate this film and I can accept the praise and I feel it is one of the best films I have ever watched.<br/><br/>Despite being from the 40's, this movie somehow feels fresh to me, even today in this day and age! The way that this story is told feels so intrinsic. The movie begins with an introduction of the whole story that really took me off guard at first, but then I realized it didn't tell the human aspects of the story that was to follow and this is one of the most unique introductions in a movie I have ever seen. You think you know the whole story from this mini-documentary styled intro, but this is still a jigsaw puzzle that still needs to be solved by the people who know Kane personally to fill in most of the blanks, especially the mystery of 'Rosebud.' Kane was a powerful figure, but a character who also had a sense of humanity and through this, it's easy to feel a connection to Kane. As we delve into the human aspect of the film, we become more and more immersed with the story and it is a very human story, in my opinion. This to me is what makes the movie effective.<br/><br/>And what also astounds about the story is that it feels complete and it did not need to have anything else added to enhance or add further drama to the story. You would think a movie that tries to tell a story of a man's life young to old would feel rushed, but at this running time, it feels like you know the guy! Never have I seen such character development this good and fleshed out on film. And to top it all off, the makeup looks very realistic, along with Orson Welle's acting, which perfectly pulls it off for his different ages throughout the movie.<br/><br/>And that is only a few of the great aspects of this film. The great cinematography techniques in the movie have definitely made me more analytical and aware of these intricacies in film. Not only is the story filled with ambition, but you can see it in the beautiful visuals. From Kane's huge, but sparse mansion to scenes utilizing chiaroscuro, you can see the influence it had on films today. From starring and also directing this film, you can see from watching the film the amount of ambition that Orson Welles poured out into this epic.<br/><br/>After watching Citizen Kane, I cannot help but feel like there has been a transition from me being a casual movie watcher to a serious film buff. With its simple, but grandiose story, its breathtaking visuals and even the music that perfectly compliments every scene, this movie has become a timeless beauty that ages like fine wine."
"AukeBriek","9","3","4","8 March 2013"," How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? To the film itself!
","How to watch a movie like Citizen Kane? It's supposed to be the best film ever made according to the most prestigious poll in the world, for decades in a row, only recently being surpassed by Vertigo. It seems to me that there are potentially two major factors related to this fact, that might bias and distort our judgment of the film itself, our naked experience of it so to speak. The first one is the most obvious: either a fear of being excluded from the cinema in-crowd, or otherwise just being overwhelmed by all those respectable opinions of all those respectable critics who surely must know what they're talking about, or just plain unintelligent herd-mentality, might cause you to think that this film is much better than it actually is. There is also a less obvious possibility: the fact that this film is so highly revered might cause you to think that you are only bullied into thinking that it is so great, and that you start to think that the only way of preserving your authenticity is to denounce it or to greet it with a lukewarm response. Personally, I know I'm susceptible to both distortions, both based upon the a priori fact of 'Kane' being canonized as it is. A fact that, in these cases of distortion, will determine your opinion of the film, regardless of whether or not you have actually seen it. A fact that may very well blind you completely to ""die Sache selbst"". I think that a phenomenological reduction is in order here. A commitment to completely shut out the knowledge of Kane having the reputation that it has, while watching it. Only then are you perhaps able to actually see the film, let alone judge it. But this is no easy task. In fact it is an impossible task. Therefore, it would seem to follow that it is impossible to watch it. That may be true strictly speaking, but of course not all things are as black and white as the film itself. It is all a matter of degree and a matter of at least trying, or perhaps not of trying, but of letting go, much like 'trying' to sleep cannot be successful when it is literally a matter of trying. But if that is what you shouldn't do, then what should you do? I think that you should let yourself be immersed by the film, let it touch you if it gives itself to you and let it fail to touch you if it tries too hard, if it pulls on your heart like it were only a puppet on a string. All in all, it is your heart that provides you with the most reliable compass. That is not to say that your heart should be opposed to your mind and that if it would 'merely' blow your mind it wouldn't be good enough. Again, things aren't as black and white.<br/><br/>But enough about all the preparations. To the film itself! Was I touched by the film? Yes I was. In fact at times I was touched deeply by it, more than I remembered from the last time. Especially by some of the scenes with Kane's wife in the opera house and the scenes in Xanadu, where the true nature of their relationship was revealed. But is Kane a manipulative film? Yes it is. I think that Orson Welles perhaps suffered from many of the same faults as Kane himself, like Leland said: ""You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules."" Citizen Kane is a film that self-consciously wants to be loved. No, it demands to be loved, to be taken before anything else. Very, very hard work went into the making of it to ensure this. It avoids extremities and one-sidedness so as not to exclude any viewers. It includes beautiful and innovative shots in order to appeal to critics and formalist, but mostly not so obvious as to become elitist. It tries to be deep, profound and mysterious and takes itself dead-serious. There was one scene that didn't touch me as much this time, even if it did before, and that was the Rosebud scene at the beginning: it was so intensely self-serious that for a fraction of a second it went over the top for me and became almost comical, like a self-parody (and the fake mustache didn't really help there). But mostly the film is absolutely perfect in terms of editing, narrative and dramatic development, composition, cinematography and an undefinable feel of greatness and precision permeating almost every shot that can only be the product of extremely hard labor and loads of talent. There were also less than perfect qualities, such as the somewhat slower development of the middle part, the acting that varied from great to constructed, even from Welles himself. Also the atmosphere is strange: mostly the film smells like newspapers, money and power-grabbing. Of course that is what the film is about, but as an atmosphere that is normally not really a virtue. Still, this dry and somewhat suffocating atmosphere becomes part of the tragedy of the film, just like the fact that the film is just as manipulative as Citizen Kane himself, becomes part of that tragedy and actually deepens it. Just by not succeeding to create a beautiful atmosphere, the film tragically makes us wish to be released from it and makes us yearn for something lost. Just by the fact that it tries to manipulate us, tries to pull our strings too hard, and fails to touch our hearts because of it, the film becomes the very deadness and emptiness that sends chills down our spine, from the top of our heads, straight to our hearts. 10/10"
"alejandrothedirector","10","3","4","2 November 2012"," One of my new favorites
","I had always admired Orson Welles but I'd never seen any of his films. I admired him because like myself he was an actor, magician and film director. I've always known that Citizen Kane was considered to be the greatest film of all time by many critics and yet, I still hadn't seen it. I finally got the opportunity to watch the film for the first time recently and it's climbed to become one of my favorites. Citizen Kane has themes as old as literature itself: love, ambition, corruption and the price of success to name a few. These themes are part of the human condition and some of my personal favorites, so the film strongly appealed to me. The most impressive asset of the film was Welles. In addition to directing and writing the film, he also starred in it. Considering that this was his first film and he was given complete creative control by RKO, it was monumental. The film's cinematography for its time was groundbreaking material, with camera shots that had never been seen before or had just been emerging, such as the use of deep focus so the audience looks at the whole scene. Knowing a little on Welles' personal life, one of the film's most interesting aspects was that in many ways Welles was Kane, gifted and a slave to his own hubris. The film portrays a life of riches as poor substitutes to love. All Kane ever wanted was to be loved like every human being, but he was stripped away from the moment he was taken away from his parents at a young age. He spends the rest of his life trying to relive that childlike wonder, which is what his sled is symbolic of. If he can't be happy, then he makes the lives of those around him miserable as well, such as pushing his second wife Susan towards an opera career that she never wanted. He spends his later years in Xandu, his own castle. He spends fortunes on statues, to the extent that they completely occupy his home and he even has doubles of the same ones. The only two possessions he cared about were his snow globe and his sled, which reminded him of the life he wanted to rekindle. This is filmmaking at its finest. Welles pushed the boundaries and made the film his way, with his people without RKO breathing down his neck. I believe the only criticism a person could give is that it is boring to them, which is a fair complaint considering the plethora of films that are out there today and how much more technologically advanced Hollywood has become since the early 40's. I feel as if ambitious or intellectual men will get the most fulfillment out of Citizen Kane. I personally give it a perfect rating."
"ChristophCinema","10","3","4","19 October 2012"," I tried hating this movie
","When I first saw Citizen Kane, I hated it. Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie. Don't look at it as the best movie, just look at it as a movie, and maybe you'll appreciate it more. Greatest Movie of All Time? Yeah, it's kind of hard not to like it?"
"alexis-368-973240","9","3","4","6 September 2012"," A great movie from finish to start to finish!
","Although Citizen Kane was intended to make fun of William Randolph Hearst and his lavish ways of living, the movie nevertheless shines. It has every element a classic film has: romance, mystery, adventure, and even a little bit of thriller/horror.<br/><br/>Unlike many movies, I could feel the same emotions as the character. Because the acting is so well done (with maybe a few cheesy sections), Citizen Kane is very convincing.<br/><br/>I admire how you can never see the faces of some of the characters. That was done on purpose to convey that these characters were not very important.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very succinct and unique. No other movie could have such clever screenplay. Of course, ""rosebud"" is the most famous line out of the movie, but the way the characters respond to each other is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>The flashback is very gradual so that it is not confusing. I am very fortunate that I don't have to waste energy trying to follow along.<br/><br/>I find it interesting how Orson Welles tried some new filming techniques. He used camera angles to show dominance, deliberately put actors in danger, and made sets very detailed and elaborate. In fact, he was one of the few directors at the time to have a ceiling.<br/><br/>Although the first time I saw Citizen Kane was in a high school videography class, I still felt like I was in a theater, enjoying the classics that some people never notice."
"manendra-lodhi","9","3","4","2 August 2012"," Deserves to be a great film.
","If you see a 50 years old film and still find the cinematography and other film making techniques to be compelling than just imagine the impact it would have over the audience in those times. From the start I found it to be a visual treat. Over the first few minutes it runs as if you are sitting in a local train and which stops at different stations and you get to know the glimpses of your journey. Such is the great editing which is used in the starting.<br/><br/>The story telling manner was completely unorthodox and has blown my mind. What is more important to note is the character of Charles Kane. The film has depicted his character in such a way that the audience is in a confused state as to what truly was his nature. I like films which make people guessing and thinking when they leave the Cinema Hall. The acting of the director himself was awesome and other characters also performed very nicely. In all, this is a film which will leave you thinking about it all the time obviously making you guess the different aspects of the story. Any cinema lover is sure to enjoy this.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>The story of the film is brilliantly written and the character of Charles Kane has been analyzed with full depth. What is more compelling to me is that analysis of the character done in the film is from the point of the view of the director and the writer. But it also leaves space for the audience to make their own version of this character. Such great is its depiction. No doubt that the cinematography and editing are at their best. To understand how great the techniques are, you have to get out of the world of films that we are living in currently. Only than one can truly understand what is great. Orson has given the best acting in the film as the lead character. The only other one whom I would compare here would be Francois Truffaut and his acting in the film Day for Night. The progress of the story, the depth of the nature of the important characters and their part in the film are satisfying to the maximum level.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>In the middle however I got drifted away a little from the film but that might be because I was carrying too much of expectation from the film and was expecting it to be as compelling as The Bicycle Thief but I understand that both of them are of a different genre. And maybe we should never carry too much expectation because when we do so than our mind makes us to find faults in the act we are going to perform. But the pleasing editing again took me into the film.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Truth is bitter."" <br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A must watch film for all lovers of cinema."""

","This film truly deserves all it acclaim this is by far the best film ever made and I couldn't agree more. Here is a list chronicling just some of the reasons this film is undoubtedly a cinematic phenomenon.<br/><br/>Kane- One of the most complex and intriguing protagonists in cinematic history. He is a egomaniac living in his own fantasy he created, he is distant and focused he was a child taken from innocence and normality and thrust into a corrupt world. He clings on to this innocence and what his life could have been to his death with the infamous ""Rosebud"". No one but Welles could have pulled this role off with his charisma, physical presence and the tone of mystery he engulfs Kane in, the scene where Kane looses it and destroys a room is haunting and Welles nails it subsequently creating one of cinemas greatest scenes in this spontaneous release of emotion from this typically distant and unemotional character.<br/><br/>The cinematography- Greg Toland who had previously done the cinematography for the vast and beautiful grapes of wrath. He teamed up with Welles and together they crafted some of the most beautiful and innovative cinematography ever to hit cinema. The direction will leave you astounded.<br/><br/>The script- No one expected much from the script since it was primarily written by a drunk out of work screenwriter (Herman J) and then edited and re wrote by a first time Theatre man (Orson Welles) to many's surprise the script utilised a new puzzle like narrative format loitered with character depth and subtle connections. The story is complex well developed and magnificent. The story also utilised the poetic device of ""rosebud"" a verbal representation of childhood loss and innocence. It not only deserved the Oscar it won for best script but it deserved many more.<br/><br/>Those are the 3 main points on why citizen Kane is a cinematic masterpiece. I did not touch on the other things that are great about it the universal focus, the score and the editing and excluding why its a technical revolution in the medium of film."
"seanwilson556","10","3","4","8 March 2011"," It's definitely a classic but it's struggling to hold up today
","Maybe it's because the newer generation aren't into the older films. Maybe it's because they aren't fans of black and white films. Maybe it's because they find it ""dull"" and ""boring"". The sad thing is: I am in the new generation. I've not met anyone my age (21) who enjoyed Citizen Kane or don't bother because it is ""too old"". A lot of people my age who use IMDb love this but we are in the minority. It really is sad.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a tough film. It's tough because the main character, Charles Foster Kane, isn't really a very nice man. The viewer follows this mans amazing journey but also leads to some bleak and dark moments in his life. So it might be tough to watch 2 hours of Charles Foster Kane (played to perfection by Orson Welles) but don't give up. The acting is unforgettable from Welles, Dorothy Comingore, Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and especially William Alland as the reporter Jerry Thompson even though we never see his face. Terrific and innovative move from (also director) Welles.<br/><br/>The cinematography is exquisite. Containing dark rooms and hallways and offices with beaming light soaring through the windows, it just looks lovely. The lightness (and darkness) play important roles as well in Citizen Kane. Many times actors faces (including Welles and Alland as previously mentioned) are covered in the darkness to show sometimes the corruption and lies a ""picture perfect"" businessman can be. Darkness dwells in all of us but we don't always see it. Along with the lovely cinematography is the creative and gorgeous camera shots. Welles utilises long takes and some wonderful crane shots which show us the larger than life characters in a larger than life world. Just look at Kane's mansion and you'll notice the dream-like castle he lives in. <br/><br/>It's a masterpiece that almost wholeheartedly deserves the moniker: Greatest Film Ever Made. It's definitely not for everyone's taste. But it's a film that eventually got highly praised in terms of story, camera work, cinematography, acting and it's non-linear style. It's not my personal favourite but I can't say anything bad about this film (apart from the newsreel footage of Kane's life, I find it annoying). It will hopefully live on to entertain newer generations.<br/><br/>Sean."

The musical score, in particular, is the best I've ever seen. The film has charisma, charm. The acting is impeccable. The script fantastic. It's epic. And all done by a 25-year-old, which really gives it full marks.<br/><br/>And especially for the time, it must have been incredible. The cinematography, the landmark qualities, everything was so original and new. But in the final half hour, deeper insight is necessary. We are left hanging on a thread, wondering especially after some incidents how the newsroom is going. We know little of Kane newspapers, though the dilemmas in his personal life are particularly well played out."

","Everyone knows that ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest movie ever made, and there's little I can say here that will add to what's already said. However, there is so much more to ""Citizen Kane"" than just a movie, no matter how superlative. ""Citizen Kane"" is nothing more than a priceless document in American history; in tracing the life and career of one man, Charles Foster Kane, Welles presents nothing less than the history of the United States from 1871 to 1941. The film is also a chilling example of the ability of a power-mad media mogul to manipulate public opinion. Citizen Kane could just as well be Citizen Turner or Citizen Murdoch. It's incredible how many careers were launched as a result of this film. Among the uniformly excellent supporting cast the performances that linger in my memory are Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Ray Collins as Boss Jim Getty, Paul Stewart as Raymond the Butler, and of course the legendary Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother. The only flaw in an otherwise perfect work of art is the intentionally bad opera sequence, which goes on far too long. No wonder Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) attempted suicide. Who wouldn't, if they were forced to sing that drivel every night?"

Made in 1941, and without the greatest cast, this film is telling the story of a newspaperman before and after his death.<br/><br/>Talking about the cast: The movies three main female parts, played by Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead and Ruth Warrick, all playing a Kane, are doing unforgettable roles, and I wonder why none of them became real stars after this fantastic performance. The story is classical without being boring or ""I've-seen-it-before-like"". You will soon forget that this is a b/w-picture! You will find the colors inside!"

Not only is the acting superb, but each shot is carefully planned out. Character position and lighting goes from beyond showing peole what the film makers were able to do and instead shows deeper meanings. Height and screen position are used to dictate dominance etc...Welles was a genius who was able to work with people that helped to take the way he saw something in his mind and make it reality. Tolland's cinematography is unbelievable and the use of deep focus lighting is very effective. All of the actors give amazing performances especially Welles and Cotten. It should not be missed and it truly is the greatest movie of all time."
"cyoc51","Null","3","4","19 April 2004"," A generation of movies that is lost
","I have recently seen the movie Citizen Kane. I thought the movies was very good compare to many of the movies of today. I like the idea of putting three perspectives in the life of a person. At the beginning you have the death of Citizen kane and his final word ""rosebud"". Then it showed the media perspective of his life and who they thought he was. Then you have the perspective of his acquaintances who understood his personality in a different way. What other hidden information is the idea of a silent power. The power to control the human mind or to structure a social order. I notice this today by the media choosing what they considered to be important.<br/><br/>
Some people's comments about rosebud as just being the name of his snow board are just not seeing the picture. That word meant his hidden emotion. Deep inside he didn't have what he thought his destiny was supposed to be. Money couldn't buy his love for his family and used his wealth for revenge. So in my perspective, Citizen kane was never a man of wealth. In monetary terms he did loose most of his money; however, in what was truly important to him was lost ever since he moved away from the family farm. In that perspective money is not wealth, love and happiness to be with people that loved was wealth. Since, he was taken from it, everything was lost from there on. The newspaper was just a scapegoat to hide his inner feelings. His reactions toward his wife, the singer, was to give her what he didn't have and that was happiness. He wanted her to be extremely happy, because he felt that she is doing what she always wanted to do.<br/><br/>The screeplay resemble the movie ""21 Grams"" and many other old and new movies. I like the way the movie started how Welles was able to mixed in different cultural perspectives in given us different ways of understand the persons life. Sometimes movies have hidden messages that are never found, because some people are to caught up in seeing things from their own perspective. I don't blame them for it because that is human nature and it is useful for our survival.<br/><br/>I don't know much about lighting and special effects, but that doesn't limit me from understanding the films objective. Today movies are being done very quickly, so the movie industry could make more money. Citizen Kane was consider was a commercial bust, but if the person takes the dream and objective than this could shape the way the person thinks about the world. To me that is more important, then just having movies that have many sex scenes, bad acting, bad scripts, putting songs that don't go along with the movie, etc.<br/><br/>Citizen kane has allowed directors to expand their talents and it is a movie that will be remember for along time. That is what makes myths, legends and Heros. Like Julious Caesar, he wasn't the firt emperor of rome; however, most people acquaint him to being the first emperor. His idea was the reason for the introduction of Augustus Caesar, his nephew Octavian. The same could be said about Citizen kane, orson wells ideas of the use of the camera for psychological purposes and the structure of the story is what made it remarkable. Ideas are what introduces inventions and inventions are introduce by a conglomerate of ideas."
"nelliebell-1","10","3","4","28 March 2004"," A Drunk is in Charge:
","The motion picture Citizen Kane is most recently being marketed in a two disc special edition from Warner Brothers.The one disc is of course Citizen Kane and the second disc is entitled,The Battle over Citizen Kane-Special Features.I would recommend if you are in the market for the movie get the two disc special edition.It is important to understand why or at least how come this movie is so highly thought of,the second disc will assist the would be viewer in determining what kind of a problem are we up against.I originally saw Citizen Kane somewhere around 1970-1971 and I did feel it was interesting, however what about when you cant put your finger on it but its still there? Thats somewhat how this film was then and this time around I know why.The film was in part about Orson Welles own life however much is as I was aware of upon the initial viewing many years ago about William Randolph Hearst.This area is why I recommend the special edition.Hearst is the one who said you send me the prose and I'll provide the war,this is not meant to excite it is meant to warn you as to what your up against.Hearst was a very dangerous and even frightening character because according to the information that was provided he may have contributed to the assassination of President McKinley.This special disc will provide enough material so that you find that when we talk about undue influence,propaganda,areas like creating your own stories just to increase circulation and very unseemly attributes,there was know one more powerful nor influential then Hearst.The idea of what all this influence means was virtually invented by Hearst and this is what I mean when to suggest that what is in fact reality is not the well spring of a Democracy but of a horse of a different color and that is the death of a democracy.There are no dreams only the pedalling of a system and its undue influence and Hearst was an important part of a lie that we are even today suffering the effects of.There is good reason why this film is thought of so highly because like some other films they tend to comment on reality without knowing just how justice in this heart and this mind sees what it has attempted to accomplish.The idea of influence is perhaps like the power of suggestion it electrifies the night air,it maybe the impostor we are looking for,I kid you not.In fact this type of a discourse has provided a underpinning to some of the twentieth centuries most serious calamities.The idea of false importance is of a worthy psychological look see as well as the problem that we are drawn to now take a look at-This film is smart and if such considerations are somewhere even if only on the shelf somewhere it might be worth viewing.These items are of course not mentioned lightly and indeed there consequences do not go away simply,they must be dealt with because this is a problem.In a manner of speaking the call is yours as to the purport of this two disc edition and the films place in film history.P.S. Do not take the idea about ""rosebud"" seriously,upon the initial viewing I seem to recall that rosebud was the name on his sled.This film is something of a satirical look at the life and times of William Randolph Hearst."
"psionicpoet","Null","3","4","18 November 2003"," Worthy of its high regard as one of the best films of all time
","It's incredible to see how masterfully Orson Welles, a Hollywood newcomer both in front of and behind the camera, has outclassed the directors of our time when it comes to composition, style, and symbolism. Few of the current crop of directors heralded as ""great"" - directors like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and David Lynch - can match the overall quality and message of Welles' single most influential film. In a time when films are valued for spectacle over quality, ""Citizen Kane"" is like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is more than the story of a newspaper magnate's rise and fall; it is a tale of what is ultimately important in a person's life. Despite the vast riches that Kane attains, he is far from happy. He is left with two failed marriages and few friends. At the close of his life, all he has left is his memories - and something called ""Rosebud.""<br/><br/>Though Kane himself says ""I don't think there's one word that can describe a man's life,"" that is in fact true of his life. ""Rosebud"" is what mattered to Kane in the end; it was the only thing that he truly wanted. Not in a literal sense, but instead what ""Rosebud"" stood for; a mystery masterfully concealed until the very end of the film.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why film critics laud ""Citizen Kane."" It was revolutionary in its own time, a feat that few films can attest to. It's disuse of chronological storytelling and heavy use of frame composition for inferred messages can be compared only to some of director Quentin Tarantino's better efforts, where style is held almost above plot. Welles manages to do even Tarantino one better, elevating style and maintaining and engaging plot at the same time. It's easy to see why ""Citizen Kane"" gets its praise; I would admit to being one of its admirers."
"JPTaylor","10","3","4","17 November 2003"," Deserving of its praise.
","""Citizen Kane"" is a film I find truly graceful.  The story is portrayed so elegantly, so subtle and yet simple at the same time.  Its message is not earth-shattering or prophetic - instead, all elements of the film are focused on the small, yet significant story of one man's search for love.<br/><br/>The movie follows the life of Charles Foster Kane.  It tells the story of his acquisition of his first newspaper and his rise to power, as well as his slow decay.  But the film is not focused on events, or particular happenings.  Each story aspect is a tool to develop and explore the character of Kane and his journey as a man locked into his own palace.<br/><br/>The film's main theme, around which all aspects of the film revolve, can be summed up by the character Leland, college friend of Kane, after Kane's death:  ""All here really wanted in life was love"". Ever he needs and demands love, but ever he shoves it away in his search.  Although he is, in the public eye, a bold and charming figure, he is in reality a broken and bitter man attempting to replace his loss with public adoration and material wealth.<br/><br/>The meaning of the word ""rosebud"" to which the many reporters are searching, I will not reveal here (despite its listing on IMDb as one of the most known movie spoilers of all time according to a recent poll), but I will say that its meaning is simple and yet explains further the theme of the film.  The fact that it is explained to the audience but not to the cast is more tribute to the solitary nature of Kane.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is not a movie you can watch passively.  To get a full appreciation of the film you must take in each shot as an individual piece. There is a wealth of subtle symbolism pervading the film, portraying visually the emotions and conflicts of the characters that cannot always be read on their faces, while not detracting from the basic necessities of the story.  Instead, its symbolism is focused in reality.<br/><br/>
Consider, for example, a scene depicting Kane, campaigning for an election. Here Kane is seen alone at a podium, a small figure against he backdrop of yet another depiction of Kane - a larger-than-life, intense being, nearly omniscient in his realm.  Yet it is simple to ignore this scene without watching it critically - the backdrop is simply a campaign marketing tool, masking its true purpose, which is to contrast Kane the man with Kane the world-famous tycoon.  Yet this is one of the more obvious examples of symbolism in the film.<br/><br/>Yet the film is not perfect.  I found the introductory and concluding scenes of the film rather self-indulgent and clumsy in its symbolism when compared the beautiful and subtle cinematography throughout the rest of the film. It is exaggerated and simple.  Also, I am at a loss as to the meaning of a bird squawking extremely loudly in the middle of a conversation - it is extremely loud and disorienting, although I'm sure it has a purpose.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is among the most critically acclaimed films of all time, and for good reason.  The film tells a complex tale that does not cheat the audience through cheap characters or stale storytelling.  It is easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen."
"Chris_Cadatal","Null","3","4","17 November 2003"," Probably the most innovative film of all time...
","Probably the most innovative film of all time, Citizen Kane provides a rich amount of visual artistry, groundbreaking editing techniques, and a complex, but powerful storyline for any viewer to enjoy.  Hands down, this film raised the bar and set the standard for what a real movie should be.<br/><br/>
Orson Welles, who starred in, directed, produced, and co-wrote this film, gave the movie industry a fresh new outlook on how movies should be made and presented.  Having already gained notoriety in radio, Welles took on the challenge of filmmaking when he was only 25 years old.  No one knew nor expected anything remarkable to come from Welles' work, but the cinematic genius produced a film worthy of being praised as the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>
What sets this film apart from all of the other's made in that era up until now was the brilliant use of the camera.  Welles used many different angles and inventive lighting techniques in his shots to show the emotion within that scene, or the relationship between the characters of the movie. Aside from all of the technical aspects, Welles also had a lot of metaphoric and symbolic elements hidden in his film, however one cannot count or see all of the symbols and metaphors since these elements may be interpreted in different ways.  But in doing so, Welles broadened the views of his viewers, by making them think about every aspect of his film as opposed to just watching it.<br/><br/>
Citizen Kane depicts a man in a classic rags to riches story.  That man is Charles Foster Kane.  This film shows Kane's strategic climb up New York's social ladder and how he got to become a world-renowned newspaper tycoon. Kane's strong will and independence kept him on top.  But as the plot gets thicker, the audience sees that his `do it myself' attitude ultimately leads to his demise.  Kane was a man that had everything he ever wanted, except of course, happiness.  Something was missing, and as the movie got closer to the end, you could really see the emptiness in Kane's life.  He longed for something or someone called rosebud.  William Alland, who plays Jerry Thompson, the `News on the March' reporter trying to uncover Kane's life, best explains this idea.  In the movie, he says, `Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost. Anyway, I don't think it would have explained everything. I don't think any word can explain a man's life. No, I guess Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle...a missing piece.'<br/><br/>
Ironically enough, the movie starts off with the end.  After grazing through Kane's estate, Xanadu, the viewer sees Kane on his deathbed saying his famous last word, `Rosebud', which by the actual end of the movie, the true meaning of rosebud is revealed to the audience without the actors in the film realizing it.<br/><br/>
With so much symbolism and artistry put into every scene, it is no wonder why Citizen Kane is considered as the greatest movie ever made.  This film changed the cinematic world one shot at a time.  It is undoubtedly a classic and truly one of the best American films out there."
"Histrymaker","Null","3","4","17 November 2003"," This movie is an instant classic, both in our time and in generations to come
","Citizen Kane...not many films can measure up to its level.  This dramatic film portrays the life of one man: Charles Foster Kane, a ruthless newspaper man who leaves one word in his rememberance: Rosebud. The entire film looks into this man's life through the views of his closest friends and aquaintances.   It also begins and ends with his death, and follows closely with the missing puzzle piece to his life, rosebud.<br/><br/>This movie was far ahead of its time.  It was the first film ever to use special effects, and most of it is unbeknownst to the viewer.  The film is rich in symbolism to answer the questions of how and why something happens.<br/><br/>
To be perfectly honest, this seems to be a basic black and white film that in todays culture would be unattractive and boring.  But it is much more than that.  And the makeup was enthralling!  They were able to make a 24 year old Orson Welles a some 70 year old man, and make it totally inconspicuous.  Not many films, even today, can do that.<br/><br/>This film was very exciting and worth many viewings, and is the epitome of all films, which is why so many other productions have followed in the footsteps of this one outstanding film: Citizen Kane."
"ericglunneborg","Null","3","4","15 November 2003"," Think of it as a movie with the moral, money cannot buy happiness
","Contains spoiler At first glance, Citizen Kane appears to be a  biography about a rich man who achieves power and control through his business dealings, or in this case, through the operation of a chain of newspapers.   At the time the movie came out, similarities were made between the movie and the life of William Randolph Hearst. For instance, when reporters down in Cuba stated that there was no war there, Kane stated `there will be war when I say there is war.' This was the actual position that Hearst took at the time. Whether Kane is modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst or not, the resemblance is strong.  Both men would sacrifice anything to write the news, and in some cases, they would make up  the story so circulation could increase.<br/><br/>The movie begins at the end of Charles Foster Kane's life. The opening scene shows a large castle in the background..  The camera pans the scene to show a couple of monkeys in a cage and two empty gondolas. It is a lonely setting.  The castle remains in the background with one solitary light flickering in an upstairs window.  The scene changes to a house within a snow globe.  All of a sudden you see a pair of mustached lips, that whisper `Rosebud.'  The hand holding on to the snow globe, drops it and the globe shatters in to small pieces on the ground.  Charles Foster Kane's life has ended. Now  begins the task of solving the mystery of who is `Rosebud'. At this point, the movie  goes back and forth from present to past as reporters interview everyone who was close to Kane in an attempt to discover who Rosebud is.<br/><br/>Through the use of  news reels, Kane's life is shown from its beginning to his rise to power. As a child, Kane was given up by his mother so that he could live a better life. Kane moves away with his new guardian, a rich man named Mr. Thatcher (played by George Coulouris) Kane becomes a reckless young man who in time is expelled from several colleges and universities. Mr. Thatcher provides Kane with money and options to own a few gold mines, but Kane decided to go into the newspaper business because `it might be fun'.  As the story continues, he marries a girl ( played by Dorthy Comingore)  from a prominent wealthy family. It is interesting how the movie shows the progression from a  young happy couple to  a marriage of that is less loving. As you may suspect, Kane meets someone else. This proves to be a downfall for Kane. At the time he is running for Governor and everyone assumes that he will be elected. His opponent uncovers his involvement with the other woman and  it becomes a scandal.  Kane marries the other woman and appears to support her in her desire to sing. It is clear, however, that his support is not to encourage her, but is a way for him to exercise power over her.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' portrayal of Kane helps us see him as a man who feels love for power and money.  Although he has grown up in a poor family, Kane overcame poverty with a desire to  have every thing. He only seems to be happy with money and having the people of his community under his control.  That is probably why he was twice married and twice divorced. His wives were very different. One came from a wealthy well known family, the other came from a working class family. One was developing an independence from him, the other allowed herself to be controlled by him.   Although the reviewer felt Kane would have done better if he had stayed with his first wife rather than marrying again, that would have gone against his nature.<br/><br/>
Joseph Cotten Played Jedediah Leland who is Kane's best friend .He was also an employee of Kane's newspaper.  Shortly after Kane married his second wife, Leland found himself in the unpleasant position of writing about her debut as an opera singer.  The performance, which was incredibly bad, Kane walked in to the office  and found  Leland passed out on the typewriter. A partially written  review about Kane's wife was in the typewriter and a bottle of whiskey was nearby. Kane took Leland's review, and finished it. After that, Kane fired him.  The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Did Leland get drunk because he did not want to write the review? Was he struggling between having to be truthful or being loyal? The movie does not give all the answers, but lets the viewer fill in the gaps. What is interesting about this is that while Kane finished the review, he did not change its negative tone. This leaves us with another question. Was Leland fired because he got drunk ? Was he fired because of what he wrote about Susan? Or was he fired because Kane thought if he struggled with the decision of telling the truth or hurting a friend he could no longer report the news accurately?<br/><br/>The reviewer gives this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating.  It is filmed era after era making the viewer believe that the years are passing by in every scene.  Other movies have `Flashbacks' in them, but they have not been as intriguing, as this one has been. It was  interesting to follow the reporter who interviewed close friends of Kane to try to find out who or what `Rosebud' is.  He  never found out, but we did.  When the workers were cleaning out Kane's possessions,  they threw  his stuff into a fire, one of those things was an old sled, with  `Rosebud' printed on it.<br/><br/>
For a movie over 60 years old the cinematography was terrific.  It was very well organized. When you think of Citizen Kane, don't just think of it as a regular movie."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","3","4","28 October 2003"," `Eh' at first, now my favorite.
","Or at least one of my favorites.  The very first viewing of Citizen Kane I didn't much care for.  I didn't hate the movie, and it had its originality and it was definitely different than anything than I was used to.  Maybe it's because at the time, I wasn't as into older films and the dramatic difference in film styles came as too much of a shock.  Who knows.  But a film widely considered by critics as one of the greatest films of all time had to have something going for it.  I gave it a second chance and really liked it.  In fact, I liked it enough to sit through both commentaries on the DVD.<br/><br/>What I love most about Kane is its simplicity and it's relaxed pace: a story about one person who never did anything too terribly exciting in terms of fighting in a war or some grand action scene(s).  By the end of the movie, a lot of modern film goers would argue that nothing happened throughout the length of its running time, but in reality, quite a bit has happened in the carefully planned and arranged narrative as we explore Charles Foster Kane's history and personality.  The film spares no detail in addressing Charles as he grew up and matured--what he was and what he became, and yet it never lingers on any one era of his life too long.  Mankiewicz and Welles spent just enough time in key places to communicate necessary points and move on, reaching each keypoint at its own comfortable pace . . . and, again, having grown up in a generation of epileptic cutting it did take me one full viewing to get used to entire scenes shot from one camera angle.<br/><br/>
I could go into detail on other landmark aspects that other reviewers, no doubt, have already covered - however, I don't see it necessary to repeat it all.  Besides, if anyone is interested the DVD features two commentaries by authoritative sources, Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert, both of whom do a better job than I could.  I will, however, say that like other `old' films such as Hitchcock, I thoroughly enjoy seeing films like Kane because in the craft I can see the cornerstone of generations of films that followed. It's like reminiscing over an old photo-album.<br/><br/>And being a film-music fan, I have to comment on Bernard Herrmann's first film score.  While not my favorite, it deserved the Oscar nomination that it received.  Very few composers have come onto the film-scoring world as strongly as Herrmann did with Kane, and very very few scores have the heart of Herrmann's Citizen Kane.  From poking fun to at 'cliché' Opera to the depths of its leitmotif surrounding rosebud, this is a beautifully crafted score with one of the greatest ranges of sounds to contrast with the film's narrow subject matter.<br/><br/>All in all, I love Citizen Kane because it utilizes all the techniques of its day (and even inventing quite a few) as tools to tell a story, but never does Kane lean on those tools to compensate for anything.  It doesn't hide behind hours of boring Kung Fu or hundreds of CGI droids, it doesn't invent some unwelcomed quirkiness to be `artistic', nor does it spill blood and guts like there's no tomorrow.  It tells its story, and the film is judged by the story it tells *like all films should be*"
"spacemanspiff87","Null","3","4","13 November 2003"," Simply a classic.
","Citizen Kane is considered to be one of the top movies of all time. Citizen Kane was directed, co-written, produced and stared in by George Orson Welles. Welles is most remembered for his role in this movie, his many talents and his radio broadcast that caused thousands to panic. At only 25, Welles made this movie. It was the first of it's kind with new and amazing camera and sound techniques. Though Welles acted in and directed in many other movies, Citizen Kane was and is the most famous.  None had the same impact as this movie. Was it the story line? Was it the innovative techniques? Or was it the controversy it created? All of those things rolled into one made a classic.<br/><br/>    Citizen Kane was modeled after William Randolph Hearst, a famous publisher/politician at the time. Hearst went to Harvard but was expelled and still went on to run his fathers newspaper (The San-Francisco Examiner). Although this movie is based on Hearst's life, in the beginning it shows that he was adopted by the bank basically because the mother didn't want control of their gold mine anymore and also because the father was potentially abusive. This part of the movie is just for the stories sake and not a true example of what happened in Hearst's childhood.<br/><br/>	 The movie does accurately follow the rest of Hearst's life though, plus or minus some things. From taking over the newspaper, to being a politician, to the construction of the Hearst Castle, the movie takes the viewer on a quick journey through Heart's life. The symbolism in the movie is very interesting. When the camera slowly approaches the Xanadu, it comes through the gate with a big iron `K' on it. Two important things are in that scene, but most people wouldn't notice those things unless they were really looking for them or were warned about them before hand. Also, Xanadu was built up on a hill, higher than anything else around it. Was that how Hearst was though? When the camera goes through those intimidating iron gates, the viewer may get the feeling like they are going somewhere they aren't supposed to be. The first scene of the movie seems like it is the most important. As Kane dies, he mumbles one last word, `Rosebud'. But what did that mean? That's what the rest of the movie is about. Reporters interview people that knew Kane to find out the meaning of rosebud. The people being interviewed have flashbacks which pretty much tell Kane's life story. The reporters never find out the meaning of rosebud, but we the viewers do. Rosebud was the name of a toy sled of Kane's. The viewer then has to decide for themselves what the sled meant to Kane."

One that I like in particular is the scene in Mr. Thatcher's story, the one part in 1929, when Kane walks to a window, and is below it, but when he walks back to the table, he is seen taller than the windows. Wow!<br/><br/>Another thing is the scene in Charles childhood, when the camera is showing Mr. Thatcher and Charles' parents talking. In the background, in the mirror, is Charles still throwing snow outside. That showed how long of a take that scene had.

","The first time I saw ""Citizen Kane"" was in a Film Theory class where none of the film's finer points escape the notice of class or teacher. From factors which include history of the period in which the story is told, camera techniques, and most importantly the ground-breaking work done on the film, by then novice filmmaker Orson Welles.<br/><br/>With the background story and attention to detail that a film class can illuminate for you, ""Citizen Kane"" can be an entertaining film to watch a number of times, as the camera angles and tricks employed are still interesting and appealing. What makes them more intriguing is to find out how unconventional they were at the time, and immediately recognize how truly commonplace they remain over fifty years later. It's hard for someone of my generation to appreciate unaided the finer qualities of this, the most stunning feature debut of all time.<br/><br/>It's probably equally difficult for any feature filmmaker to not compare their first work to ""Citizen Kane"", and wonder how it measures up. The truth is, most directors can enjoy a far more popular reception of their film quite easily in comparison, as ""Citizen Kane"" was not received well due to the glaringly obvious portrayal and insult to media mogul William Randolph Hearst. While widely regarded as the finest film ever made this century, it lost the Best Picture Oscar to ""How Green Was My Valley"", which also goes to show how the Academy can often miss the mark completely.<br/><br/>The truth is, ""Citizen Kane"" is a film lover's film. If you are not impressed by or aware of the technical details like lighting, editing, angles, tricks and bold innovations, you probably won't like it. There are other classic films that are perhaps more simplistic, which require not one iota of background explanation to understand, appreciate and enjoy the film. These are widely regarded as popular classics of a timeless nature, of which ""Kane"" doesn't seem to be.<br/><br/>In an interesting and ironic twist in reflection of the film today, ""Citizen Kane"" will always remain a colourless, unaltered masterpiece much to the chagrin of William Randolph Hearst emulator Ted Turner. Turner's attempts to have it colourized were met with failure as contract specifications as laid out by the late Orson Welles clearly prohibit any such action or tampering with the film. For those of you who feel they will never watch it because it's not in colour, that's fine. We don't need you and you wouldn't like it anyway."

","The AFI named this the number one American film of all time.  This honor is truly deserving.  With a powerful script and and fantastic aesthetics, Orson Welles is able to weave his greatest masterpiece.  An anonymous reporter delves through the past of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane in order to find the significance of his dying word: Rosebud.  Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that one word is only one puzzle piece in a larger picture, unable to describe an entire life.  Cimematographer Gregg Toland uses sequence shots and deep focus in a way never before imagined, in order to tell a story through long takes and few cuts, a feat never before accomplished with such success.  The end result is a must-see American classic, where we truly see one man's whole life go up in smoke...literally."

"frank_olthoff","Null","3","4","2 July 2001"," Rosebud, Xanadu and the Inquirer: worth seeing a hundred times
","With the impressive surrealism of ""Caligari"" and the gross realism of ""Potemkin,"" ""Citizen Kane"" remains a masterpiece of film history. Orson Welles, its 26-year-old creator, achieved a lot with his ensemble of fine character actors and actresses. Despite its age, there is still some touch of its near-to-sensational inventiveness to be felt, which is basically due to Gregg Toland's brilliant photography which combined low-key crime story lighting and grand melodrama camera craftsmanship. Art direction and special effects, too, are conducive to the whole. Although awarded only one Oscar, Welles established his reputation as a genius, and there is an ironic hint at his earlier ""War of the Worlds"" success when Kane warns a reporter in the beginning: ""Don't believe everything you hear on the radio."" Its working title being ""American,"" the picture's original criticism of newspaper tycoon Hearst is worth more than a latterday footnote, although its omission seems to add to the timelessness of ""Citizen Kane.""<br/><br/>Of the players, I still couldn't make out Edmund Cobb (as a reporter), who appeared as the bad guy in some 170 or more B westerns from 1930 to 1950, plus a couple of A's such as ""Winchester '73"" and ""River of No Return."" I did actually discern Alan Ladd this time, I think. - Welles does a good acting job, too, as does his favourite, Joseph Cotten (""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" ""The Third Man""). Moorehead and Sloane of the Mercury Theatre stock company are wonderful, but Ray Collins' short performance as Jim Gettys, virtually reduced to his voice as he hardly mimes and moves, is outstanding to me. This is a pic worth seeing a hundred times, not least because of its humanistic message."

Can I hear some Macklemore please? Maroon 5 even? would it kill you to put some music from THIS century?? The 20th century please?<br/><br/>Just so the other guys no, Warning: there no top less ladies in this not even one in the whole movie yes you heard me right they didn't put zero breast or boobies!!<br/><br/>You wanna see a good movie Ridiculous 6 is on Netflix right now & is, much better movie with lots of joke and action, guns even a ninja.<br/><br/>Any way Citizen Kane: 1/10<br/><br/>I'm glad I just watched this on my iPhone instead of shelling out 15 bucks to see it in the theater plus $$$ for popcorn and drinks. This movie is BORING as watching grass.<br/><br/>P.S. don't bother sticking around threw the credits cause this movie has no bloopers or gag real or nothing like that after"

I can't lie to fully enjoying this film. But I get the huge essence after watching Citizen Kane. The essence that probably found the meaning itself, as a time going away. I think it's superb legacy, the reminder to all film industry. Maybe, we doesn't care too much at that time, but finally time has reveal itself. That's why I think how wonderful it was Orson Welles vision. I know the Orson Welles himself has died even before I was born. But, can you believe that twenty four years old Orson Welles makes a landmark of the motion picture. I can only said, it's a landmark of storytelling. Amazing storytelling that endured beyond the generations. <br/><br/>As a ""rosebud"" itself, Charles Foster Kane legacy highlights that finally changes peoples argument about him.

","It is not hard to see why this is considered to be one of cinema's greatest movies ever made as this movie hits every element perfectly.<br/><br/>After a wealthy newspaper tycoon dies, journalists scramble to find out the meaning of his last word ""Rosebud"". Then we see the history of his life and everything he encountered throughout it.<br/><br/>The acting is magnificent. Especially coming from Orson Welles who in my opinion gave one of the best performances ever put on screen. But every other actor offers something great to the movie and not a single one of the main actors did a weak job acting. They all gave strong performances.<br/><br/>Wells direction is terrific and he is able to use basic elements to craft something truly brilliant with this picture. His work behind the camera is immaculate and it brings the viewer into a truly special experience.<br/><br/>This movie is engaging from the very first scene. Some people may not like the talk heavy dialogue but if you like slow paced movies (which I usually do) then it shouldn't bother you.<br/><br/>This movie has stood the test of time. It has aged well and it shows no sign of losing popularity. Is it one of my favorite movies of all time? No, but the reason it gets a 10/10 is because of its impact on cinema and how much it contributed to it. The only American film which comes close to topping this masterpiece is ""The Godfather""."

It is a pioneer in film and one of the greatest story lines and characters ever captured in cinema history. It has gone down as one of the greats for good reason. It is well written, acted, directed, filmed, and deserving of more Oscars than it won.

","Hate to agree with the pretentious, boring film students who basically worship their copy of Citizen Kane (and rebuke every other classic or new film) I used to go to school with, but this is truly one of the greatest films ever made. I've watched it a handful of times and it never fails to stun me.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is perfect, it'd be a waste of time to list all the characteristics of this film that make it the legend it is- but I'm just gonna waste a little. Welles was so gifted. The cinematography is beautiful the whole way through. Fantastic use of lights and shadows. He was so artistic with his techniques, every scene was planned down to each detail. And the variety! Wow, so many different techniques with Welles' touch on them. His style is like visual candy, and every shot is sweet.<br/><br/>All performances were excellent! Amazing they all came from the same place, and this was the first film for all of them. I was especially blown away by Welles, of course, considering he created one of the most iconic characters in film history. His performance was spectacular, from 25 year old Kane to old Kane, brilliant. The make-up applied to age the characters was so impressive. It looked better than some of the make-up work I see these days even. The character development was impeccable. The script was great. Good dialog, never lags, was always interesting. The non-chronological format was expertly executed, the transitions passing through years, transitions from flashback to present- seamless every time.<br/><br/>There is nothing about this movie that I don't like. Such a monumental achievement, it's such a shame that Orson Welles had so many problems with the film industry. Can't imagine what he'd have left behind had the studios let him have total control.

"martino-sanzovo","10","4","6","5 April 2015"," The missing piece
","Who is Charles Foster Kane? Is he a Communist? A Fascist? An American? The ""No Trespassing"" sign that we see at the beginning of the movie tries to warn us. Yes, throughout the movie we will get different narrations which describe Mr. Kane; but will we go over the fence and will we really understand who Mr. Kane is? The unseen reporter (Mr.Thompson, shot in darkness) seeks the last great news: Rosebud! Is Rosebud the missing piece? Will it explain everything? Mr. Kane, the great man, by pronouncing this word just before dying returns to his childhood, the childhood stolen by a banker. Charles Foster Kane comes back to a piece of wood that meant the only real moments of happiness in his life. ""If the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough"" tells us Welles/Kane; and the news is big but the unseen reporter cannot solve the riddle. At the end of the movie the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle seems to be Mr. Kane himself; we get his story from several (unreliable) narrators but we don't feel to have trespass the Kane's barrier. Orson Welles (director, producer and main actor) delivers a masterpiece through an extensive use of dissolves, deep focuses and flashbacks. Music and sounds give rhythm to the film and Welles' outstanding acting completes the picture (by the way, Di Caprio's best performances certainly took a lot from Mr. Kane). Citizen Kane remains up-to-date after more than 70 years and will be immortal; it is strongly recommend watching it more than once to appreciate all the techniques used by Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland."
"brchthethird","10","4","6","15 February 2015"," Classic Hollywood at its finest
","CITIZEN KANE is one of those films that often makes critics' top ten lists of the greatest films ever made, and has built quite a reputation as such over the 70+ years since it was released. It's also one of those films that people might be familiar with, but may not have seen. And until now, I hadn't actually seen it myself. So, does it live up to its reputation? Yes, it mostly does. The story, if somebody out there doesn't know, is about Charles Foster Kane, who is taken from his parents at a young age to live with a powerful businessman and, once he comes of age, takes over control of a newspaper. Over the course of his life, which is recounted almost entirely in flashback, you see a transition from an idealistic, principled young man to a reclusive shell of his former self. I thought it was a very well-written, well-shot film that gives a very balanced portrayal of a polarizing figure. All of the performances were excellent, especially Orson Welles, who was the brainchild behind this film. I also took notice of the incredible camera-work and cinematography which made effective use of light, shadow and space as well as some really sharp camera angles which provide visual insight into power dynamics that are an integral part of the story. However the most important aspect seems to have been a man who desperately wants love and approval, but doesn't know how to get it except by trying to buy it. It is this single part of Kane that makes him a compelling character, despite being such an enigma otherwise. There was also the film's central nagging question of what his final word, ""rosebud,"" meant. I thought that the answer, which is revealed in the film's final moments, was a bit underwhelming but extremely effective as a narrative-driving device. Overall, this is a classic film that deserves to be seen by all, if for no other reason than that it is an important part of film history."
"panag-parask","10","4","6","16 January 2015"," Simple... But powerful!
","So I decided to write a review because I saw lot of people do wrong to this movie and others being a little unrealistic. The following is purely my opinion on the movie. I'll try not to go into much detail about the movie itself. Let's just think first when this movie was made, 1941. The story starts with Charles Foster Kane ( The protagonist. ) dying and breathing out his last words which were ""Rosebud"". So, from the beginning of the movie there's an enigma, what is ""Rosebud""? A journalist who'll write an article about the death of Kane tries to find the meaning of this word. So, with a lot of flashbacks and a flawless storytelling process we get to know who Kane was, where'd he come from. He's nature, he's good characteristics and his bad characteristics. We get a taste of how his life progressed. What I liked about Citizen Kane except from it's mystery and simplicity is how well we got to know our protagonist. By the end of this movie you may or may not understand what was the meaning of ""Rosebud"". I just have to suggest one thing, try and watch it. If you like it, you'll watch it again. If you don't, give it an another try and if you still don't like it then you never will. It's one of this movies that passed the test of time and still matter because in it's core, it's a movie about a human being. It was a classic ""must-see in your lifetime"" movies that really lived up to their hype!"
"powermandan","10","4","6","28 July 2014"," Rightfully Called The Greatest Film of All Time.
","Just what makes a great movie? One that is sure to stand the test of time and take your breath away? It must have: a compelling script, strong development and chemistry in the plot and between the characters, excitement, emotionally-connecting, great camera tricks/computer enhancements, great sets and costumes, and has a strong message. Very few films possess all of these traits and Citizen Kane was the first one to do so. The make-up is flawless, the camera tricks are sheer genius and unrepeatable, astonishing acting, and you feel just about every kind of emotion possible. Citizen Kane has been raved as being the greatest film of all time more than any other movie. If Casablanca or The Godfather outrank it in a list, Citizen Kane is right behind them. Everybody that disagrees with this not being THE best will certainly think it was great to say the least.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane follows the rise and fall of a controversial newspaper tycoon with reporters trying find the meaning of his dying word: ""Rosebud."" At the very end, you find out what Rosebud is and it explains nothing. Orson Welles leaves it up to you to figure out why Rosebud is so meaningful and how it is always relevant. Kane wanted people to love him and wanted various things to make himself happy. The richer he grew, the less happy he became. Rosebud symbolizes the last period of his life where he was ever truly and shows that money cannot buy happiness. Money not buying happiness is a subject that has always been talked about and will always be talked about. But Welles executes it in such a way that is sure to have a lasting impact on the viewer. Sure the movie possesses everything positive about a movie, but the way the message is delivered makes it more than a just a piece of cinema. No other movie has ever been flawlessly made with a strong delivery of an important life lesson.<br/><br/>4/4"

Since he had everything except bonafide love, he truly wasn't---unlike Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life--- the richest man in town. He filled his sled-less life with statues, newspapers, giant houses, and a marriage to an untalented dimwit. But we've all made those mistakes. Most of us just don't act like megalomaniacs of Rupert Murdochian proportions along the way. And we tend to avoid cryptic words like ""Rosebud"" with our dying breath. Most of us would just admit, ""I miss my sled.""<br/><br/>Orson Welles wrote, directed, produced and stars in Citizen Kane, making the single greatest debut in cinema history. His cast (comprised mostly of New York theatre buddies) matches him step for step and Welles' collaborators behind the camera are wonderful too. Was there a better cameraman in old Hollywood than Gregg Toland? None of that would matter, however, if the script by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz wasn't so fantabulous.

"bkrauser-81-311064","10","4","6","27 October 2013"," A Personal View of Citizen Kane
","What can be said about Citizen Kane (1941) that hasn't already been said? Sights and Sounds magazine came out with its decennium list of best films ever and for 50 years gave Citizen Kane top prize. Last year Citizen Kane was relegated to the number two spot by the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo (1958). Previously anyone worth their stuff would have to admit that Kane is at least among the best movies to ever exist. So to spell it out, even with some light bruising, Orson Welles's freshman feature has some high expectations to overcome.<br/><br/>I won't justify the critics by writing a manifesto on its artistic value. There are too many essays out there already who have done that in the past seventy years. Besides which, despite my enthusiasm for film and film history, I am by no means an expert. Therefore my ""academic"" justifications would seem disingenuous and misleading. Instead I will be introspective and give you my person reasons why Citizen Kane is, to me, one of the best movies ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>My interest in Citizen Kane peaked when I was in my late teens. This is when I started to take film seriously for its social and artistic value. Citizen Kane has appeared on multiple lists of important movies and therefore I was simultaneously intrigued and intimidated by the thought of watching it. After all the works of Federico Fellini and Robert Altman are for the most part plebeian to me despite being universally acclaimed. I have no serious means to justify my reasons for disliking Altman or Fellini so if I was not a fan of Welles I was clearly an unlearned philistine.<br/><br/>Strangely enough I was compelled to watch Citizen Kane only after watching Reefer Madness: the Movie Musical (2005). The Showtime original feature made veiled references to William Randolph Hearst; the larger than life newspaper tycoon who became the inspiration for Charles Foster Kane. I knew that Kane didn't exactly glorify the man so the scales were tipped and I rented it.<br/><br/>The first five minutes of the movie I had to remind myself I was watching something made in 1941. The use of shadows, mirrors and the assortment of camera techniques could easily fit into a modern Hollywood thriller. Cinematographer Gregg Toland used deep-focus camera techniques to fixate on both Charles Foster Kane and the space in which he inhabits. The technique was used extensively during the last act to create a sense of eerie emptiness, whereby Kane's world was enveloping him.<br/><br/>Deep-focus cinematography is just one of the many reasons Citizen Kane is from a technical standpoint near perfect. The story switches back and fourth between flashbacks, told from a myriad of different people. Their opinions effect the overall impression the audience gets of Kane and as a result, we cannot truly believe everything they say. Kane is seen as warm and brash in one flashback, then seen as cold and distant in another. What results is a movie whose central character leaves you with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>I suppose the movie's enigmatic tone is what interests me the most about the film; along with its brazen political underpinnings. It was pretty clear upon release that Citizen Kane was a film a clef, and William Randolph Hearst who wasn't exactly pleased by its release. He accused Orson Welles of being a communist and according to legend Hearst arranged for a naked woman to jump into Orson Welles's arms when he entered his hotel room in New York. There would also be a photographer in the room to take a picture that would be used to discredit him. Welles stayed away from his hotel room that night so its unknown whether this is true.<br/><br/>What was true was Hearst may have sunk the film. It was a financial dud for RKO films and it would only go on to win a single Oscar for best screenplay. Welles would go on to direct a hand-full of American films before settling in France, however his autonomy was compromised. He would never have complete artistic control for a major studio financed film again. This is not to say his other American films; The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Touch of Evil (1958), and The Stranger (1946) weren't excellent. But if Welles had more freedom to do what he wanted, he might have had more than just Citizen Kane and The Trial (1962) to brag about.<br/><br/>While I could go on and on about the brilliance of Citizen Kane, the best way I can summarize it is to say that among the list of movies accredited as ""the best ever,"" Citizen Kane is among the least overrated. The plot is great, the story structure is great, the artistry is great; everything about it is great. The best? Well that's ultimately up to you.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"raphaklopper","10","4","6","17 October 2013"," The BEST movie ever made??? Well, I'm not sure, but at least is one of them!
","Many critics today consider this the best movie ever made in the history of cinema. This statement has led many people today think the film is very overrated. Which statement is the right one it is impossible to say, but I think I can understand both opinions.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" begins after the death of the journalism magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), who moments before dying uttered the word ""Rosebud"". Days after of journalism hype over the news of his death, the journalist Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is sent by his boss to investigate the life of Kane, in order to discover the meaning of his last word, in which no one knows. Then he begins to interview all living people who knew and met Kane. Going from his best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten); his secretary Bernstein (Everett Sloane); the 2nd ex-wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore). The journalist begins to discover that he plunged into the life of a lonely man who from childhood is obliged to follow the will of others. Nobody around Kane cared about him, and then he began looking through the acquisition of things the worship from the people, but it all led to his tragic and painful end.<br/><br/>Many said at the time that Orson Welles (who also directed and wrote the film) based the life of Kane on a real tycoon from journalism William Randolph Hearst. Welles at the time denied such claims publicly, especially after Hearst negatively criticized the film saying it would denigrate his image. But the comparisons are almost obvious: Hearst was known to have transformed the simple New York Morning Journal to a sensationalistic newspaper (buy news from other newspapers or invent them) the same thing Kane did with the newspaper ""Inmaker""; Hearst built a castle with his name, the Hearst castle in Florida, and Kane made ""Xanadu"" in the Gulf of Mexico, both Hearst and Kane had nationalists and communists concepts (they were part of a political party but then denounced them).<br/><br/>The critics doesn't idolize this movie for nothing. Mainly because it is WAY ahead of its time, to imitate the life of a tycoon on a fiction film was almost crime at the time, but not only that. Welles gives the film a magnificent direction with gigantic footage such filming today require multiple cameras (more than 20) and at the time they used a very limited number (less than 5). Including a amazing photography and beautiful cinematographic with spectacular scenery.<br/><br/>Not only in direction but Welles gives the film one of the best screenplays ever written, primarily because it can be smart and fun giving a modern language and humorous moments. But above all, gives a timeless narrative to the history, that is, it doesn't follow a single timeline, going back and forward to the past and the future all the time telling pieces of Kane's life from childhood to the arrival to wealth. This technique was very advanced and almost impossible to do at the time. And along the incredible story of Charles Kane, the film uses elements of politics, romance, and even musical. And for several moments, it critiques the rich society and American politics (another thing that at the time was almost a crime).<br/><br/>But of course, today many people will find problems in the film compared to today films. It is almost inevitable a film having problems, and ""Kane"" is no exception of this. The main problem is with so many characters in the film, somehow it fails in making us care about them (except for Kane), but once again we have to have in consideration the constraints of the script and cast at the time.<br/><br/>Speaking of cast, that was also a great revolution. All actors were newcomers, making their first appearances in movies. Not only this fact, but also the fact that they are all extraordinary. Since Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore simply superb, but who stands out is Welles himself. He in their 20s, considered the wonder boy, then took his skills as an theater actor and radio announcer and not only give a excellent directing and writing to the film but also a magnificent performance from start to finish.<br/><br/>People have to take in consideration the time that the film was made and not criticize it comparison to today. Early there, it was the beginning of the 2nd world war with much of the economy focused on armaments, Orson Welles with a magnificent direction, superb script and splendid performance managed to make a mark in the history of cinema that should be remembered forever! <br/><br/>10/10"

","Orson Welles both directed and starred in this classic film, regarded by many as the greatest film ever made, which is a claim I have some sympathy with, though it isn't my choice. Still, this is a masterpiece, brilliantly weaving its narrative in flashback, as a group of reporters try to make sense out of wealthy Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's last words, ""Rosebud"", and interview the surviving people who knew him, like his best friend and colleague Jedediah Leland(memorably played by Joseph Cotton), his ex-wife Susan Alexander(played by Dorothy Comingore) and butler(played by Paul Stewart) who claims to have heard Kane say the famous word. What's most remarkable about this film is how innovative and fresh it still is, directed with energy and style that hasn't aged a bit. Script is brilliant, both funny and insightful, with lots of witty and quotable dialogue. Direction is atmospheric and fast-paced, with an effective use of shadows and looming camera angles that present Kane as a towering giant who overshadowed everyone, yet had a most tragic life, despite his wealth.<br/><br/>An all-time classic not to be missed."

","I don't know if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" movie, but this comes as close as anything I have ever seen. I recently re-watched Citizen Kane for the first time since high school. I don't know why it took me so long to watch it again, probably because the first time I saw it I was a little underwhelmed. I'll just chalk that up to immaturity though, this is most certainly one of the best films I've ever seen. Students of film history can tell you all about the innovative camera techniques and such that make this film very important. I prefer to just focus on the actual experience of watching it. First of all, every scene (and I truly do mean every scene) is absolutely visually stunning. You could pretty much take any individual frame and hang it in a gallery, it is that meticulously put together. Aside from that, it's just a great story. I don't usually find biopics about ""great men"" very compelling, as they have a tendency to elevate people to this almost god-like, larger-than-life status that causes me to just become disconnected and not care at all about the main character. Citizen Kane does precisely the opposite, it takes a ""great man"" in the eyes of society and brings him down to a human level. Ultimately Kane is just like everyone else, a man in search of lasting happiness that proves more elusive than it seems it should. If you haven't seen Citizen Kane, or even if it's been a long time, then go watch it as soon as possible. You certainly will not regret it."

","Citizen Kane, 1941<br/><br/>When I first saw this film, it was back in my 10th grade Journalism class - pretty fitting due to the content of the film. When our teacher asked, ""What is considered the number one film in the history of American movies?"", different answers floated around, but no one in class had heard of Citizen Kane. Surprised by this, our teacher played us the film and following the showing, 90% of the students in my class hated it. Said it was boring. Said they didn't get it. Said they didn't understand why it was the best film. Personally, at the time, I enjoyed it. I thought it had a good story, a great leading actor in Welles, and some cool tricks of the camera. It wasn't till the fourth or fifth time that I really saw the films true beauty and understood why it was such an iconic, classic movie.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a flawless film. Genius director Orson Welles' debut picture was arguably the greatest film in the history of cinema. Given complete freedom to write, direct, and act by major studio RKO, Welles certainly made his mark in Hollywood with this unbelievably beautiful picture. Welles' style and innovative techniques really shine here and completely revolutionized the future of filmmaking for all movies after it. <br/><br/>As an aspiring director and writer, this is a pivotal staple in the history of classic films and one that I could watch endlessly just trying to analyze every shot. It truly is an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie if you want to see filmmaking at its best."
"Kane20","10","4","6","2 July 2012"," Review - Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane has been lauded the best film ever made by many people. Do I particularly agree? No. But nonetheless, I think it is a great movie. It has some of the dated characteristics of cinema of it's period, the 1940's, but a lot of it's characteristics are still strong nowadays. I understand that the plot has some parallels to the real life story of William Randolph Hearst, but I don't know all that much about him, so I'm going to talk about only the film, which is great itself. The film is an important figure in the history of cinema, technologically and in terms of storytelling.<br/><br/>The story is really not all that complicated, but the way it unfolds is great and engaging, and almost makes it seem complex, and it's told from a number of perspectives. The film opens up with the death of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the owner of the Inquirer, a New York newspaper. Just before dying, Kane utters the word ""Rosebud"". Then an approximately ten minute long newsreel summarizes the story of Kane, representing the public's view of him, and an overview of the story. Then, for the rest of the film, we are shown more details and depth of the story via flashbacks as news reporters go around and obtain information about Kane and his life.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't seen the film, I won't fully spoil it for you. I'll just give an overview. Kane achieved success and rose to power, but eventually suffered a major blow to his reputation, and he crashed. Along the way, he even gets married and divorced twice. With the aid of his closest friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Kane starts builds a nationwide newspaper empire. He is ruthless as he achieves this, yet generous at the same time in a few ways, such as being willing to lose a million dollars a year to gain more newspaper circulation. Eventually, he runs for a political position, but his success to this is lost as his rival uncovers his affair with a ""singer"", and after this, his reputation is destroyed and his life's success declines. There is more to the story, but, like I said, I'm only giving a summary; I'm not giving the full story away, for those of you who haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>All the while, we, the audience, and the reporters in the film, wonder who Kane really was, not just the story of the events of his life, from his rise to his fall, but who he really was underneath. They believe that a key to finding this out lies in his dying word, ""Rosebud"". At one point in the film, a reporter, Thompson, says, about the word, ""Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost."" At another point, someone (I don't remember who) says, ""I don't think one word can describe one man's life"". The entire movie is a puzzle, a puzzle of Kane's life, and not just that, but of who he really was (for lack of a better, deeper term). ""Rosebud"" is just one piece, a missing piece, of that puzzle, but it may be an important piece. Although, then again, maybe not. We do eventually find out what the word represents and what its origin is, and it represents one of the important messages of the movie, but I won't spoil it for, again, those of you who haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>The film is great in terms of its storytelling. In addition to its storytelling, the film is also an important point in cinema in terms of a few other factors, such as cinematography. One of the most striking of the cinematographic effects is this stark contrast between brightness and darkness. Also notable are the camera angles - which create many unique shots throughout the film - and the use of deep focus, enabling images both in the back ground and the foreground to stay clear in focus. I also liked the music score. Bernard Herrmann, who also composed the score for Psycho (1960), created an effective score with very good combinations and uses of harmony, orchestration, melody, and other musical elements, and really supports the drama and moods of the film.<br/><br/>So, in summary, while I personally don't think Citizen Kane is the best film ever made, I did find it to be great. Watching it was a very good experience for me. It's great in terms of storytelling and technical aspects, and, overall, like I've said, it's a great piece of cinema, and an important landmark in cinema history.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** (out of ****)"
"ceeingred13","10","4","6","1 March 2012"," A game changer
","I understand why people don't like this movie. 100%. Some very intelligent, very film savvy people that I know are not fans of the film and they are right in their complaints: It IS too long, a bit dry, not exciting, and so it goes...<br/><br/>But I love it. The cinematography and shooting techniques (as you've probably heard before) changed filmmaking and survive even to this day. The dialog seems silly at first blush, but when I hear what the characters are ACTUALLY saying, it is heartbreaking ""You'll hate it in Chicago, the wind comes right off that lake..."" really means ""Don't leave, you're the last one left that loved Charlie and Mr. Kane."" The acting is still good even by today's standards. If you can get past the screeching voice of Mrs. Kane the 2nd, you'll find that she's very capable. Welles is like a pot left to slow boil with occasional eruptions and Joseph Cotton handles his role with an admirable mix of humor and sadness.<br/><br/>I come back to this movie time and time again and it doesn't disappoint. I won't try to change anyone's mind about it because as I said, the critiques are sound, but I'm glad this movie exists."
"evan-sennett","9","4","6","26 July 2011"," Over-Rated?
","A lot of my friends call Citizen Kane over-rated. It is number one on the AFI top one hundred list and is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time. My friends say that it has great cinematography, but when it comes to story, it lacks.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was a great plot and very entertaining. Through the entire film, the audience is waiting to find out the meaning behind Charles Foster Kane's final words. It drives the plot well.<br/><br/>So, personally, I thought Citizen Kane not only had wonderful photography, but a strong story. Now, is it over-rated? Perhaps. To call something the greatest film of all time is saying a lot. There are so many films out in this world, and plenty better than Citizen Kane, but it was good enough for me to put it's poster upon my wall."
"Filmnerd1984","10","4","6","10 September 2009"," Unforgettable Masterpiece!
","An utterly amazing film from start to finish. Orson Welles proves himself to be a master of cinema. not only a great and charismatic actor but also an accomplished director. Citizen Cane is considered by many to be the greatest film of all time. i now know what they mean, because this film is visually impressive in addition to having a great script and solid characters. but none captures the screen as the leading man himself. i loved the use of camera work which is used often by Welles. he films the more central characters or more powerful ones i should say in a way that makes them seem 8 feet tall. in the scene where wife number 2 is having a hissyfitt over getting bad reviews from her husbands own newspaper, Orson stands over here laying a wast shadow over her puny existence. he does not say it, but the scenes portray a kind of inaudible dialog saying i am Charles Foster Kane, who are you to question me?. well it is open for interpretation, but that is how i experienced it. i am ashamed of myself for waiting so long to see this extravagant chapter in motion picture history."
"redryan64","10","4","6","16 January 2008"," What does a guy do when he starts off at the Top and Tees Off a guy named Bill, William Randolph Hearst, that is..
","It comes to mind of an incident occurring back at the work place, which was directly related to CITIZEN KANE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) and to the why to its having been almost universally held as being 'The Greatest American Film.' The 'work place' was the Chicago Police Department, the year was ca. 1991. The question of ""They're having CITIZEN KANE on cable all week long. Why are they doing that?"" The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, ""The names have been changed to protect the Innocent.""<br/><br/>As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered ""Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary."" Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; ""Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles!"" That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, ""Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end."" <br/><br/>But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as ""Suma Cum Laude"", or in the Queen's own tongue, ""With Highest Honors"".* <br/><br/>We of course know of his famous and infamous ""WAR OF THE WORLDS"" national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .<br/><br/>At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.<br/><br/>So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a ""standard, Rich & Famous"" Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently ""double crossed"" him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a ""the skies are the limit"" budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.<br/><br/>OUR STORY.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, ""Aye""! All opposed signify with ""No!"" The ""Ayes"" have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! <br/><br/>For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. <br/><br/>There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is ""Rosebud"" and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. <br/><br/>But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The ""secret"" lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.<br/><br/>All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.<br/><br/>As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the ""left coast"" it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.<br/><br/>And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE."
"pierre-rehnlund","10","4","6","8 January 2008"," One of the Best Film Ever
","If you ever are in Californina, USA, go and visit Hearst Castle, which ones were built by William Hearst, the Newsman, who stood as a model for the leading character in the film. Than you get an even deeper understanding of all the levels Orson Wells tried to show/act out in the film.<br/><br/>The story is fascinating how a man can be driven by things happening in his childhood, which of course probably is a speculation. the only person who would know is William Hearst himself and his is dead. But also Orson Wells extraordinary way of reflecting the inner and outer of the leading character is amazing! This is of course also one of the films you can see many times both for discovering new levels and also for enjoying what you know will happens already from the beginning."
"PWNYCNY","10","4","6","21 October 2007"," Remarkable movie.
","This movie is an expressionist interpretation of a story that, if told conventionally, would be flat. The story is expressionist because it is told from the point of view of the reporter who is trying to piece together the pieces of a puzzle regarding the life of Charles Foster Kane. The only clue the reporter has is the last word that Kane utters before he dies; it is that word that may hold the key to revealing the real Charles Foster Kane. Kane's public persona is a sham covering up a personality that is an enigma. The movie consists of a series of flashbacks as told by the people who were closest to Kane, and who despised him the most. The depicts Kane's life as a series of montages, with wide-angled and close-ups rapidly interspersed, depending on what feeling the movie is trying to evoke, all of which together convey the impression of a jumbled life in which the pieces don't quite fit together. At the start, Kane is young, dynamic, and determined to make things happen; by the end, he is defeated, deflated and behaving like a child. He is angry by the way he was rejected by his parents and has contempt for money, which he associates with the banker-guardian who Kane despises. Kane dedicates his life to spending as much money as he can, and in doing whatever it takes to maintain control, including building a palace and housing it with as many artifacts as he can buy as a way of insulating himself from a world which he finds hostile to him. Kane's life goes into a tailspin after he is caught cheating on his wife, destroying his reputation and revealing him as being a hypocrite. His second marriage, to his mistress, is also a disaster as Kane bullies her into becoming an opera singer just to prove to the world that he had in fact married a singer. He tries to buy her love and when she leaves him, he completely falls apart, utterly alone and unloved, having driven away the last person who had still cared for him. To suggest that Kane deliberately and maliciously used people would not be entirely correct. He was driven to act by psychological forces that distorted his ability to get close with people and ultimately led to his demise. As for the word rosebud, the reported never finds out what that word meant, but the meaning is revealed to the audience, leaving the audience knowing something that the reporter does not know. <br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a remarkable movie. It has withstood the test of time, meaning that the movie is not dated and presents a story that would resonant with today's audience, in fact even more so that when the movie was first released in 1941. The acting is great and the cinematography is astounding. Who really was Charles Foster Kane? He had so much money and was known as a man of the people yet was alone. The acting is great. Dorothy Comingore's performance is especially powerful. Her role is the key to the movie. Actually this movie could have more aptly been titled Mrs. Citizen Kane because of the central role of Ms. Comingore's character. The story is as much about her as about Kane. The movie is timeless, its themes universal and contains performances that cover the gamut of human emotions."

","""Citizen Kane"" is a very well-written movie with a great plot and wondrous character development centered around one man. What's more is how impressive of an achievement it is for the director, Orson Welles. It was his debut film and he directed, co-wrote and starred in it. It is a defining piece which, at least for me, serves as a basis for other films. I would categorize it as a drama/mystery film, though in some ways it resembles a tragedy. However, saying anymore would disclose too much information. The only advice I can give is this: when you watch it, watch it with a clear mind and be patient. The movie does take some time to get started, but patience pays off bountifully. After that the pace is perfect and keeps the viewer engaged. Not much more can be said of this film, just watch it and experience it for yourself."

It's #1 on the American Film Institute's top 100 best films. Charles Foster Kane is a publisher of a yellow journalism newspaper. He becomes rich and powerful and establishes a publishing empire. He builds a costly mansion for his wife, Xanadu. Citizen Kane is the story of his rise and fall. Joseph Cotten is Kane's friend and partner but their relationship deteriorates over the years. The structure of the movie is told in flashbacks which keeps the film moving. The movie was a box office flop. But for decades it's been discussed and dissected in film classes.

"shattenjager777","10","4","6","8 December 2004"," What did the poster say? ""It's Terrific!""
","I've taken my time before commenting on what is usually considered the great American film masterpiece, but at this point I feel up to it--having now watched the film eight times and read four books about it as well as watching the documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" twice. No, it doesn't take that much effort to understand the film, but research can embolden a person.<br/><br/>The first comment so many people now make is that ""Citizen Kane"" is not a work of genius, but they're wrong; it is a work of genius--four genii in tandem. Herman Mankiewicz was a self-destructive, crazy, egotistical Hollywood genius long before Orson Welles would define that phrase (though he was not, as some have contended in recent times, a Hollywood intellectual--he was a master of lowbrow screwball comedy in the 1930s--see Pauline Kael's book ""Raising Kane""); Orson Welles really was a genius, for all the things he wasn't; Greg Toland is perhaps the most famous and celebrated cinematographer in history to this day; and Bernard Herrman wrote seemingly every memorable film score from 1940 through 1970 (including what I consider the greatest film score of all time, ""Psycho"").<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" also did not receive bad reviews upon its release; it received unbelievable raves. I read over 20 contemporary reviews of the film and over half of them called it the greatest film of all time, and the least adulatory called it a ""good film"" but not quite a ""great film."" How we've had it come down to us from history that ""Kane"" received bad reviews upon release, I don't know; but it is patently untrue. It received fewer reviews than many films because of the Hearst boycott, but those it did receive were all adulatory.<br/><br/>Now that I've dispelled some annoying myths about the film, I'll speak of the film itself. Perhaps its most notable quality is its beautiful and strange look created by Greg Toland and Orson Welles (how much each did is a matter of some conjecture). It is loaded with brilliant high-contrast lighting; large, mostly vacant, stage-like sets; and odd camera angles that give it a distinctive look that would then be appropriated by the film noir genre.<br/><br/>However, what truly holds the film together is one of the greatest characters and performances in film history. Not truly William Randolph Hearst but rather an amalgam of big media types, including Hearst; Charles Foster Kane is an amazing character and Orson Welles's performance is nothing short of extraordinary--from the somewhat awkward dancing in the song scene to the unsure look on his face when Jed Leland asks for the Declaration of Principles to the way his physical mannerisms change as he ages, Welles crafts a wonderful performance. But if you're looking to define Kane by one moment in the film, it's not ""Rosebud,"" it's the speech Jed Leland gives about him, saying correctly, ""that's his story.""<br/><br/>The other performances in the film are also top-notch, highlighted by Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, Joseph Cotten (whose performance may even equal Welles's, though his part is much less showy) as Jed Leland, and the beautiful Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton.<br/><br/>Of all of this film's innovations, its use of music may be the most important. Music as a scene transition device was a radio trick, but since ""Citizen Kane,"" it's become standard in film as well. Bernard Herrman provided a score that is mostly brilliant, if at times a bit over-dramatic.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is fascinating and, above all, fun. It's loaded with great small pieces of humor (""Kane Elected""--""Fraud at Polls,"" for example) and has all of the intellectual and academic fulfillment one could want in a film. It's not, as are many ""great"" movies, something only for film-studying intellectuals; ""Citizen Kane"" is a wonderful work for the masses all the way around."

","I love to watch this film over and over again and every time I see something new, challenging and interesting. A film, which can be called a touchstone of film making in Hollywood,chock full visually and contently. Nearly every detail and every word is chosen exactly and the form backs up the content accurately, that is why it is an perfect example of formalist film making. In fact a simple story, rise and fall of a man, is told but with every possibility of the medium. All that wide angles, black and white shadows, surrealist shots reminding German expressionism, lighting and beautiful deep-focus cinematography using the field depth to its limits (arranging all the visual elements in a meaningful way) serve to the content and creates meaning. There is not much to say on its brilliant form, it is really something for its time. And when we come to the plot, the story is very well structured and told in flash-backs and from different point of views.<br/><br/> From psychoanalitic point of view, all film is about separation of Kane from his mother in small ages and his effort to fill that ""lack"" through his life. He collects many things through his life in order to fulfill his life and forget the big loss of his mother. He struggles with his symbolic father ,whom separated him from his mother, all his life and he leads his life missing the feeling of the ""unity"" in other words ""wholeness"" with his mother. In fact feeling of wholeness can never be gained in adult life and that's why he collects, collects and goes on until his death but of course he never succeeds to fell that unity again. A house full of stuff from every corner of the world can't fill his lack. That feeling finds body in fantasy objects like Rosebud, his sled, which we see it in his hands in their separation scene with his mother. In other words Rosebud is his ""object a"" (fantasy object) that fills his loss. We may say that Rosebud is the symbol of his lack of his mother. Also through his life he never gets successful with women and dies alone and his last word is Rosebud, which is very meaningful. I highly recommend it whomever hasn't watched it yet. It is indeed a classic, watching is great pleasure and a different experience."

For example, little things we take for granted in movies today were done first in Citizen Kane, like the filming of scenes that showed ceilings. Kane was the first Hollywood picture that had a storyline that wasn't beginning/middle/end, but on the contrary, the main character(Kane) dies at the beginning of the movie. The use of deep focus photography, ect ect. It may be a lot of boring tech stuff, but without knowing how it was used in Kane would take away from the experience when watching it.<br/><br/>Then of course, is the comparison with William Randolf Hearst, which I won't go into because you can read about that in your own spare time.<br/><br/>To me, this film is a brilliant display of the psychology behind a man who has SO much, but at the same time has less than the poorest individuals alive.<br/><br/>If you do the research before seeing this film, then I would say it would be well worth seeing.

"Travis69","10","4","6","10 December 2003"," Citizen Kane review
","Aside from being argued as the technical genius of films, 1941's Citizen Kane also delivered plenty of ahead-of-its-time issues to the forefront: monopolization and celebrity doom. Citizen Kane is a film that charts the four-step life of entrepreneur Charles Foster Kane, a dramatic on-screen version of William Randolph Hurst, who merged his vast array of national newspapers and radio stations into an evil empire. The buying out (or making up) of other papers, such as the Chronicle for instance, along with his usual yellowish editorial tactics, helped the Enquirer become the voice of America; again only to be propagandized by one voice: Kane's.<br/><br/>With popularity that skyrocketed nearly everyone but the president, Kane (the always masterful Mercury Theatre Radio guru, Orson Welles) looked to shoot even higher in politics-ala Larry Flynt-only to be dragged down by the same tabloid controversy he once seemingly mastered. This case will also recollect to the near chagrin Arnold Schwarzenegger took just days before election in this year's California gubernatorial race. Kane was sought fostering with a `singer,' much like the fun Arnold had during his `groping' days of Pumping Iron.<br/><br/>Nothing in the film seems to swarm with more controversy, however, than Kane's final word, and the very search for, `Rosebud.' Was this Kane's second mistress? Or yet another one of his four-billion statues crated into a mover's worst nightmare? As you'll discover in the film's culmination, Rosebud was the only love Kane had for whom or what it was, and not because Kane wanted the love back; a rarity, since the gist of the film is about Kane desire for everyone's love. Again, this opening and closing to Citizen Kane is surrounded by the same aura the tabloid-edged Enquirer swelled upon the nation; of course it seems likely Kane would not have had it any other way. And much like America will always watch Schwarzenegger films (even more so now because he is governor), America then still read Kane newspapers, as Citizen Kane himself was always news-and if perhaps not the greatest, the most important film of all time.<br/><br/>

","So sayeth Charles Foster Kane -- a bigshot stock-holder who is arrogant and cynical. But this is what interests us; not the honest american making his way through honest methods -- we like to see scandals and heart-ache. It enthralls us.<br/><br/>What made this film important was it's narrative, which transcended typical movie fare and pioneered new age film-making. The visual trickery and camera mastery is so apparent. Welles created this at age 25 -- I applaud him.<br/><br/>This film is artistic in its direction, but it's story is much more poignant, even today. One thing I remember off the top of my head was the cockatoo that lacked and eye - it squawked and then dissolved. Leaving John Q. movie-goer wondering what the deal was with this one. So, this guides us into looking deeper. There are moments of apparent visual trickery - and then there are moments of genius subtlety. The shadows that often look so really are often hinting at something behind the eye, something we have to feel instead of see. Is this the best ever? I don't think it bests The Godfather, but I think it runs a close race and dismisses other classics with ease.<br/><br/>A+: A grand achievement that will long be remembered. Hollywood directors should focus more on deeply intimate stories instead of their regular tripe."

","There are many reasons WHY I like Citizen Kane. One of the main reasons is how it effected me after repeated viewings. I was curious to know why this movie is considered to be great so I watched it. But the first time I thought it was only 'decent'. But CITIZEN KANE was the kind movie that grew on me. When Kane was a small child, he was poor, he was living with his parents, and he was happy. But as he grew up and began to live a rich and powerful life, he threw away the love he had before for power and fame, and in doing so, he lost one of the most important things in his life, and that was happiness. He had everything. Everything that he ever dreamed of, but that wasn't enough, he was missing something in his life. I always remember the saying that 'money cannot buy happiness', and to me, that was the lesson I learned from this movie. If I say any more I will probably spoil the movie but I will say that Orson Welles really brought the character to life. We, the audience really get to know him. From his humble beginning to his tragic end. And I guess that there is a Kane in all of us, how we might long for power and forget what means the most to us, but we should look back at this movie and take a deep look at Kane's life. This was a complicated character, and as we go along with the movie we can finally understand him as the character itself is built more and more by structure---------until the final climax, we see the looks on his voice and hear him say his final words."

","Even before ""Citizen Kane,"" Orson Welles, was Hollywood's favorite little prodigy and no one could wait to see how he would fare with his first shot at motion picture directing.  At 25 years old, with his directorial debut, he made the greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>There just isn't anything that you can't like about ""Kane.""  The story is compelling and timeless, the visuals spectacular, the artwork enigmatic and gothically beautiful, the ensemble acting an unsung triumph, the score haunting and suggestive, and through it all we can feel Welles' deft touch weave this powerful tale of a man's lifelong battle with himself like no other director could have dreamed of doing.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about Charles Foster Kane, himself, is we only see him as others did.  The only things that we, for a fact, know that he said or did were either included on the newsreel or the classic opening scene, where we know that he uttered ""Rosebud.""  Rosebud.  What a fantastic imagining by Herman J. Mankiewiecz.  An entire man's life is about to be judged because of a childhood memory he utters as he dies.  As touching and heartbreaking as the best parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The best part, however, about ""Citizen Kane"" is the effect it had on American movies.  As if this wasn't a great enough film to begin with, it had such a strong influence on future filmmakers that one can sometimes pick out Kane-esque shots.  In short, see ""Citizen Kane"" once or three hundred times and you will agree that nobody ever did it better than this kid did on try #1."

","After all the hype surrounding this movie I really had no idea what to expect.  I have heard people rave about `Citizen Kane', but I have also heard people on the opposite end of the spectrum.  I can honestly say that I really enjoyed it.  It might have been a little better had I not known what `Rosebud' was, but I cannot allow pop culture to detract from my appreciation of a classic film.<br/><br/>AFI ranks `Citizen Kane' as its number one film of all time, while I may not share this opinion I think it is definitely worthy of some praise.  As a directorial debut Welles shines.  In addition to directing the film he also co-wrote the script and played the lead role.  Many view `Citizen Kane' as a slap in William Randolpf Hearst's face, but I think there is so much more than that.  The underlying theme is a man's search for lost happiness. `Rosebud' turns out to be no more than a sled, but it symbolizes the only time In Charles Foster Kane's life that he ever felt love.  He spends the rest of his life trying to force people to love him, only to realize his mistake in the end.  It is this theme that captured me.  I could identify with it.  `Rosebud' was the key that allowed me to look into C.F. Kane's heart and understand him.  `Rosebud' gave the movie its humanity, a humanity that is so close to us all."

","It's clearly no secret by now that Citizen Kane is considered to be a pretty good movie. It's also no secret that it is considered to be the greatest film of all time by more people than any other film. Probably the only thing that is left to be said about Citizen Kane is peoples' opinions, and that's what I'm gonna give you, my opinion. <br/><br/>(spoilers) I've seen Citizen Kane several times now, and I still learn something new about it every time I see it. I've come to the conclusion that this film is so highly acclaimed because of the sheer brilliance of the direction, as well as the excellent acting. This isn't exactly an original idea, but when I say that, I mean that the story of the film itself was nothing particularly groundbreaking. In extremely simplified form, it's about a newspaper mogul who basically runs himself and his newspaper into the ground because of his incredible stubbornness. He spends his life of wealth cluttering his ridiculously huge house with meaningless junk, making it impossible for him to find the one meaningful thing in his life, Rosebud. I think that Kane's loss of Rosebud represents his fall from innocence, and the story of Citizen Kane is unbelievably well presented. Citizen Kane is literally an encyclopedia of film technique, because every single shot in the film is completely packed with visual information that goes far beyond just pointing at the action to show what's happening. <br/><br/>However, it's not the fact that Orson Welles utilized these techniques or the idea that he created or invented them, because nearly all of these techniques can be seen in films that came before Citizen Kane. The amazing thing here is that there are dozens and dozens of those techniques that can be found in various earlier films, but EVERYTHING is here, and there is so much going on and it is presented so carefully and with such a calculated result that its style dwarfs anything seen before or since.<br/><br/>
Citizen Kane is not a movie that is likely to thrill or keep an audience on the edge of their seats, especially a modern audience. It is definitely a drama, and it does move fairly slowly at many points, but it is such an amazing thing to watch if you know what to look for. The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my skull. But as I read and learned more and more about it, I realized what things symbolize in the film and I learned about angles and distance and character position and frame composition, which has made me come to realize more and more why it is considered to be the greatest American film ever made. Watch it more than once, because no one can see all that there is to see in Citizen Kane after just one viewing."

","This is the best movie of the century.  It was original and extremely well crafted.  Orson Welles was a genius.  Hollywood did not like him because at the time he was a maverick.  He didn't play by their rules. Citizen Kane had lighting and set design from the stage.  This made the camera angles even more extraordinary.  This was not common at the time. The acting by all was superb.  The story technique of using flashbacks has been copied and copied. It was by far the best use of this.  It is an original work.  It surpasses all of Welles' later works."
"johnqrs","10","4","6","7 October 1998"," More than just a chilling tale...(The Composition of a Masterpiece)
","The genius of this film is often only felt by the audience from the more external understanding of the mere sequence of events that take place. Now, that's an aspect of the film worthy of praise, as Kane *did* win Best Screenplay in 1941, and the script is, indeed extremely tight. (Does anyone else marvel at the line ""New York, Chicago, and Washington, maybe?"" uttered by Jim Kane towards the beginning? You of course realize this maps out Kane's entire life...New York Enquirer, Chicago Opera House, and a failed political career? Not bad, eh?) But the more subtle genius of the film is it's use of triangular construction and frame composition. Oh, my gushing is taking up too much space. But, my god, the use of shadows and angles should be paid attention to! The way the aural ambience of each scene differs and morphs echoes Welles' radio background, and should be paid attention to! He used processed backgrounds for *In-Room* shots, just to pack in the right amount of information, and frame it up how it wanted. He shoots the speakers in shadowed obscurity and has them come into the light right on the key line. The cockatoo that begins the Butler's account of Susan leaving him is purely expressionist film-making! The form cuts that make the film's skewed chronology move along seamlessly! Oh, for god sakes, watch the man work, people. This is how it's done."

","From a personal viewpoint I would cast my vote for ""Rashomon"" as the greatest film ever made, but I am more than happy for a procession of critics to hand this picture the ultimate accolade.<br/><br/>There are all the usual things you could claim about what makes this movie so special: innovative direction, ceilings on sets, etc., etc. What always makes me sit up more than anything is Ray Collins breaking the fourth wall near the beginning. Perhaps, like it's director-writer-star, this is more a film you can admire than love. While the film is purported based on William Randolph Hurst (someone I once knew had a theory that the lead character's initials were a subliminal advert for a fast food chain when spelt backwards), it is interesting to note how the obnoxious, domineering, excessive, lonely Kane is played by the allegedly obnoxious, domineering... Orson Welles.<br/><br/>But what makes Citizen Kane an ideal choice for the finest movie is that while embraced by the critical fraternity, it is almost exclusively a mainstream film. The directorial ""tricks"" are dealt with in an understated manner (though the panning shot under a neon sign and through a skylight was obviously so well savoured it's repeated twice, once in reverse) so that they never distract. Just like any other standard movie of the era, this one has romance, drama and song and dance routines. Okay, so many of these may be shot through with more depth than normal, and the circular, fragmented nature of the plot is not what audiences were expecting. But essentially this is not an esoteric work, but something for the masses. Even the psychology behind Kane - and this is my only real criticism - is overstated, almost spoon-feed where interpretation would do. However, this also fits in perfectly with the production's study of excess, the (now obvious, sadly) matte paintings that make up a huge mansion.<br/><br/>Ultimately, of course, this is a film that is asking questions. Away from the dark vignettes, where men hit women and cheat on their wives, we have the revelation of Rosebud. The film asks the question ""what is a man?"" and then delivers the perfect resolution. Then the finale gives us the biggest surprise of all - no, not Rosebud, but the roll call of all the actors in the film that had never been in a motion picture before. The shock of seeing a procession of extremely competent actors that had only just made their debut is stunning. Was this really only 1941?"

","I  have to admit when I first saw Citizen Kane in a film class in college, I did not like it. Years later, I soon discovered that it was not the film. It was the instructor who prejudiced my opinion. Now, after several attempts at filmmaking, I realized that this is a true classic. I understand the reason George Lucas, Steven Speilberg and others use this as a blueprint in making films. This is a technical masterpiece!!! The first of it's kind!!<br/><br/>Some people have a problem with this film. Maybe it's just because they don't know the history of film. Or maybe they don't consider this movie as fast pace as today's big-budget Hollywood productions. Or they simply do not like this film.<br/><br/>But one has to remember, this film was made in 1941. At the time, Wells encountered a lot of scandal and setbacks while making what this movie. But he endured and successfuly completed what the world now knows as ""Citizen Kane""."

","Citizen Kane has always been regarded as a great movie and even makes the IMDB's top 250 list.

Perhaps it's because I'm from a generation where 100 million USD budgets are commonplace for any ""epic,"" but CK lacks what makes a good movie for me. The ""new"" editing and filming techniques Orson Welles used were fairly uninteresting, his story was mildly entertaining at best, and all the focus on ""Rosebud"" was simply ridiculous. The scene where Kane says Rosebud moves fast and is edited jaggedly, yet the whole film revolves on it for people. I find that curious.<br/><br/>So beware of all the hoopla for Citizen Kane, I find it misplaced. It is a relic of the motion picture industry and should be stocked away accordingly."

","There's not much I can add to what's already been said about this much-discussed classic, but I would like to comment on the revisionist trend of Best Movie lists to downgrade this film from its traditional #1 position. For instance, the original list compiled by ""Entertainment Weekly"" critics rated ""Citizen Kane"" #1, but then a subsequent list moved ""The Godfather"" into #1 position. <br/><br/>Well, I've watched ""Citizen Kane"" with pleasure at least 25 times, but 3 times around with ""The Godfather"" is enough for me! And if critics are just sick and tired of rating ""Kane"" #1, then I can think of better replacements than ""The Godfather"" -- for instance, any hilarious comedy written & directed by Preston Sturges -- ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" springs to mind -- or Billy Wilder's ""Some Like It Hot"" (#1 on AFI's comedy list). I think comedy is ultimately more profound than tragedy, so I don't see why a comedy can't be considered for the top spot. Comedies also tend to be overlooked at Acadeny Award time.<br/><br/>But I suppose I'm unusual in that I think ""Citizen Kane"" has many fine comedic touches (the flustered vocal coach and prompter during the opera sequences would be one instance). I realize that, overall, it's a tragic drama, but there are quite a few comic highlights along the way. It's a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>Finally, in the interests of ""truth-in-advertising,"" I should mention that I have a personal reason for my interest in ""Citizen Kane"" --- I am related (not by blood, but by the marriage of one of my dad's sisters) to members of the Missouri branch of the Hearst family. So 3 of my cousins are, in turn, distant cousins of Patty Hearst. And my late uncle, Richard Hearst, told me of family visits by the real Citizen Kane, William Randolph Hearst, who handed out silver dollars to the kids (my uncle was one of the kids). All my Hearst cousins like the film --- but I suppose some of the California Hearsts might be less enthusiastic about this classic film."
"mcawesome","5","6","11","7 November 2001"," Overrated!
","Pick up any guide about movies, particularly one written by a professional movie critic, and ""Citizen Kane"" is rated the best or near the top of the list of movies ever made.  There is no question that Orson Welles coalesced many film-making techniques of the thirties, as well as innovations of his own, in producing ""Citizen Kane"".  Additionally, at the time of release in 1941, there was great pressure brought to bear on Welles and the studio not to put the film out due to its (fictionalized) portrayal of powerful publisher William Randolph Hearst.  All very admirable, but does it make for a great movie?  Not in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story itself is not all that remarkable.  The characters, including Kane, are not overly engaging and I never found myself caring what happened to any of them.  Parts of the film are staggeringly boring.  It takes a good 15 minutes for the plot -- or what there is of a plot -- to get moving. Yes, certain techniques of directing, camera angles, flashbacks, and the like, are interesting from a scholarly viewpoint. However, the real interest of a dramatic film should come from interesting characterizations, a good story, and tension amongst the characters.  In these critical areas, ""Citizen Kane"" is sorely lacking.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you are a film scholar, professional or amateur, or if you want to see what all the fuss is about. In my opinion, this film is wildly overrated."

","A technical masterpiece, making it a must see at least once in one's life. Watch it as a film-study exercise, but not as the great film it is claimed to be.<br/><br/>We follow the life of Charles Foster Kane, a fictionalized character based on the life of William Randolph Hurst. There are strong performances in the film, magnificent use of shadows, angles, sets, as well as the fact that Orson Welles wrote, directed, starred in and had complete control over editing it. (This was unheard of at the time. But this was not really the first independent film production. Look to Howard Hughes and John Ford for this.) <br/><br/>Good or great film-making is ultimately about story telling. For me, a film that moves me emotionally and/or intellectually, employs subtlety rather than insulting my intelligence, has true-to-life characters, presents believable situations, can be enjoyed over and over again, and stands the test of time, earns such praise. I confess that I do prefer to have a strong reaction to the main character, be it empathy, hatred, love or disgust, and some understanding and sympathy of motives. I am well aware that there are people whom are extremely difficult to completely understand, (John Ford, for example), but they are not a complete mystery.<br/><br/>I originally saw this film about 25 years ago. As a college student, I was very quick to parrot traditional perceptions and said, ""Great flick!"" rather than form my own opinion. I recently re-watched it, and am quite content to wait another 25 or more years before doing so again. When the audience has to don deep-sea diving gear to attempt to understand something about the character via interpretation rather than subtlety, then the film missed the mark. The only character I found evoking any emotion, empathy or real comprehension was Kane's second wife. The film ended without any real understanding of Kane or his why his final words are what they are, nor do you care.<br/><br/>Study the cinematography once in you life. But that's quite sufficient."

","It is virtually impossible to come across a 10 Best Films List from any ""serious"" critic or film institution that does not have Citizen Kane ensconced in the Number 1 slot. I have literally heard film historians who insist that if you don't like this film, then you don't like films. Well, I happen to love films and I do not especially like Citizen Kane and, refreshingly, I see from many of the comments there are legions of people that also do not appear to like this film much either. Much of the aggrandizement stems from the high esteem that the film industry and critics held auteur Orson Welles and the empathy they had for Welles in the obstacles that he faced in making this film. Yet while one can appreciate the single-minded ferocity an artist can have in bringing forth a vision – one must also admit that many times the end product of that vision is not a masterpiece. Welles' melodrama, which is a thinly veiled depiction of the life of legendary power broker William Randolph Hearst, put him on the wrong side of the publishing magnate, who did not like having his life be the subject of a film and set forth the dogs of war to try to hamper Welles. Many critics gathered around Welles and starting inventing superlatives to describe the end result as an antidote. At the time, this picture caused quite the controversy and became a cause célèbre. Unfortunately, decades after the death of Hearst, when many new film watchers barely know who he was, the film must be judged on its own merits and not the controversy it caused in its day, and that is where the film falls apart.<br/><br/>The film opens with the death of its central character, the obscenely wealthy Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) and his whispered dying word of ""Rosebud"". A group of journalists go on the hunt to figure out the meaning of what or who is ""Rosebud"", and we get to see Kane's life unfold in retrospect based on the investigations of journalist Joseph Cotton. ""Rosebud"" is the film's central mystery, but it is basically a McGuffin. People going into the film familiar with the answer will find the proceedings utterly pointless. Those unfamiliar with the identity of ""Rosebud"" may be less charitable once they realize that they have been gamed into hanging on for something so trivial. In fact, it is almost laughable as to how slight the storyline ends up being.<br/><br/>Welles depicts everything on screen at arm's length. There is no character to draw the viewer into the events that unfold or to win sympathy. They are all just ciphers moving in and out of the frames. Emotionally, the film is positively glacial. The acting, even by Welles himself, is outrageously stiff. Events befall the central character and have minimal impact and thus the viewer has absolutely no reason to be impressed by them. Fans of the film drone on and on about ""shots"" and camera effects as though great film's succeed on those merits at the expense of story, acting, style and substance. Welles, the director, overuses the canard of mammoth Gothic sets that dwarf his characters to emphasize their purported loneliness or disenfranchisement. This may have been impressive at the time, but now it merely seems a ploy to compensate for the tepid dialog and stale performances. Anyone who truly wants to give director James Cameron grief about his dialog really needs to go back and listen to Citizen Kane with an unbiased ear. Additionally, the much lauded darkness of the film and trick camera shots that earned Welles praise for his cinematic decisions become far less impressive when one realizes that Welles directed and photographed ALL of his films in this fashion, whether it was warranted (Journey Into Fear) or not (The Magnificent Ambersons). It was simply his directorial style and he offered no other alternatives in his career because it was all he knew how to do. Unlike other films of the era which are still impressive, even if we don't like their point of view (Gone With the Wind comes to mind), it is difficult to even understand how Citizen Kane rated as a great film in its day. Its central character remains aloof and the grand secret of Rosebud leaves most viewers I know shrugging their shoulders, if not lamenting the loss of time it took to find out about it. The revelation, rather than arousing sympathy or understanding for Kane, fails to make him any more accessible and, like the camera work, ends up coming off as a last-minute gimmick to try to make Kane the man seem more human than we have witnessed in compensation for the lack of development during the course of the film due to the weaknesses of the writing and acting.<br/><br/>And finally, for those film historians/critics who are still thumping their chests 70 years after the fact as to how the Oscar voters gave the Best Picture to How Green Was My Valley over Citizen Kane, the answer is quite obvious to someone watching the films with fresh eyes. HGWMV may have its share of downbeat moments and may not be ""perfection"", but it contains in its running time more emotion, character development and solid storytelling than Citizen Kane is able to muster on its best day.

","general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with ""new, improved"" special FX.<br/><br/>yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here is that the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.<br/><br/>what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.<br/><br/>this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possibly everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.<br/><br/>to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance - which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.<br/><br/>furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.<br/><br/>knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.<br/><br/>in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.<br/><br/>this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.<br/><br/>finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - have nothing new anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.<br/><br/>citizen Kane is not about a 'newspaper editor' - to suggest so is merely to admit one's ignorance. Charles foster Kane is a 'media mogul' - as we would call him today - which means that he belongs to the 'upper ten percent' of the population that decides the future for the other 90 percent. he helps to reform politics in new york city; he intimidates a president into going to war with Spain. he gobbles up entertainment media in new york and los angeles, simply to give his wife a stage on which to sing.<br/><br/>and - all of this is misguided. even his attempt at political reform fails because it has little to do with 'helping people' as he claims at first, and everything to do with his own ego and ambitions.<br/><br/>one of the tell-tale signs of ignorance to be found in reviews of it is the harping reference on the 'rosebud' motif.<br/><br/>the movie has nothing to do with rosebud - that's just a little joke on Welles' part.<br/><br/>finally one has point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.<br/><br/>citizen Kane is one of the most innovative films in cinema history, and it has been used as such by filmmakers literally ever since its initial release. yet these innovations are still as striking as ever - from the use of convex glass reflection in the opening sequence, to the amazing tracking in and out of the fireplace at the end.<br/><br/>if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.<br/><br/>and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.<br/><br/>still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate."
"didi-5","9","5","9","19 May 2004"," the greatest film ever made?
","Somehow you feel like everything has already been said about this movie: often at the top of best of' lists, certainly regarded as the greatest first film ever made by any director, and the best of all the films to be associated with Orson Welles.  Of course he was only in his twenties when he not only co-wrote and directed Citizen Kane', but also appeared as the central character over a span of decades  from fresh-faced young entrepreneur to crabby old man of wealth, trapped in his white castle of mirrors and jigsaws.<br/><br/>The structure of the film  a series of interviews about the man who has just passed on, plus incidents from his life in flashback  doesn't always come off, but for sheer scope and inventiveness this piece has few peers. We see Charlie' Kane right from the early moments of his life, when he is sent from his parents to a better life, fit to govern, through his highs and lows as a newspaper magnate.  We meet those who loved him, those who hated him, those who weren't sure.  We get swept along by the momentum of the movie.  <br/><br/>Other films would be directed by Welles in the future that are worth seeing (The Magnificent Ambersons, plus his own takes on Macbeth and Othello with himself in the lead) but Citizen Kane' is the most memorable and the most important.  His own Mercury Theatre group play the various parts within the saga  names such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead, both of whom would have long careers after 1942.  Others such as Dorothy Comingore didn't live up to their initial promise but at least have left us this film to remember them by.  <br/><br/>Citizen Kane' is certainly worth the time of anyone remotely interested in the history of film."

Them slowly aproching the dark castle, but on the way passing an empty cage labeled lions with a pair of monkeys sitting atop it. Beyond that a gondola, and through a golf course, a mote and draw bridge, and finaly up to the single lit window in the highest tower of the castle only to have the light diminish.<br/><br/>At the time of its release Citizen Kane was a revolutionary film. The camara technieque of fading from one chene to another. And still today it is a great movie. The movie Citizen Kane is unique in such a way that there is no other movie like it. It begins at the end of Kane's life. Kane's life story is told in parts by many people, from many diffrent pionts of veiw. From the uptite banker that took him in as a boy, and his best friend (if he had any), to his second wife.<br/><br/>The movie fallows a reporter that is searching for one thing and one thing only,Kane's dying word; 'Rosebud'. The reporter learns Kane's life story and gleans from it nothing that can help him discover the meaning of 'Rosebud', though its meaning is revealed to the audience at the end, and the movie comes together and what realy mattered to to Kane is told. And as it turns out Kane's happiest days were as a boy with his folks."

","When I got the CAV Criterion Laserdisc version of this movie, I didn't have any expectations what so ever. When the movie was over, I was so tranced and entoxicated that I couldn't believe what I had just seen.<br/><br/>What I noticed the most was the photography. The gorgeous black & white photography by Gregg Toland. The music by Bernard Herrmann was also something that I noticed.<br/><br/>Having only seen Orson Welles in 'The Man Who Saw Tomorrow' before, I was excited to see such a young man in the title role, making his feature film debut with such tremendous energy and wonderful acting. I said to myself, 'How can a man so young make something like this?'. Welles, only 26 at the time, showed such understanding of the motion picture and how to make so something beautiful, funny, exciting and terrible. How could such a genius become such an outcast of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Even 17 years later in 'Touch of Evil', hadn't he lost any of his touch of how to make something extraordinary. Like Martin Scorsese, 'Citizen Kane that makes you believe that anything is possible on film'.<br/><br/>This is truly a motion picture that will be the greatest of all of motion picture for another 50 years. It will be the crowning and the most tragic achievement in the history of the motion picture. The crowning achievement because of the film's quality and groundbreaking means to achieve it. And the most tragic because of the way Orson Welles was welcomed into Hollywood. But we can thank God that at least one film of Welles' best was untouched by the shortsightness of the studios.<br/><br/>If you like to see a wonderful movies with a tragic, funny story and gorgous photography, go and see this fantastic film"

"Asphyxiod","4","10","23","8 October 2005"," Pale !!!
","I rate ""Citizen Kane"" 4/10 and that too just for the ONLY 3 best things about this Movie - Cinematography, Acting & the suspense about 'Rosebud'.<br/><br/>After understanding ""Citizen Kane""'s high acclaim & its status as one of the finest movie ever made, I was very curious to see this Film. I was definitely disappointed by far end. Indeed its boring especially in first half & has some very inconsistent characterization & scripting. Many things remain unexplained.<br/><br/>The Philosophical strength I feel could have been understood by very less number of people because of its inconsistent characterization & many loose ends.<br/><br/>Its a story about Charles Kane who becomes heir to huge wealth when he was a child. Kane when grows up, instead of investing in Gold Mines or getting professional consultancies for his investments, intends to run a Newspaper company & starts endowing his wealth in it. Here is where Kane is shown as a Non-greedy, humble & wise person who aims to reach his readers with the best & truthful News, which he & his team can. But at the same time we learn later, that he is self-centered some times. He spends his wealth in a monumental palace known as Xanadu & disregards the aspirations of his wife. At one point he is shown wise, ambitious & a person who plan things & achieves success. On other side we see that nothing works good for him as he keeps failing in later part of his life. Not because of just some ill-fate, but because of some motivation & intelligence aspects which he was capable to do at some points but never attempts to do. Its a major contradiction in his characterization.<br/><br/>We learn that Charles Kane was just a Tycoon because of his wealth which he inherited. Whereas he was absolutely incapable of monumenting or expanding his empire. His approach to get involve in politics was for betterment of people & not for any status benefits. Just when he met Susan Alexander (a small time singer), everything after that turns wrong. He marries her & things turn worst. He looses the election, incurs huge losses in Newspaper business & finally we see him settled down in his Xanadu living his last days. After Susan leaves him, Charles die with his last words ""Rosebud"".<br/><br/>One thing is sure, We are never allowed to get into the character of Kane. Whoever saw this movie, cannot tell what kind of person was Charles Kane. This I feel is a definite Script error for Characterisation. Orson Welles instead spent much of his ideas & efforts in Art Direction & Cinematography. But that does not solve purpose. We are talking about movies, which means entertainment. Where is the Substance? Where is the intensity & drama & understanding of the characters ? We know that he runs a Newspaper Company. The Scenes concerning only shows how Kane counts his number of readers & how he throws party. What about his involvement & personal approaches which boosted his business ? What Speciality does Kane have ?? There is no answer to this. No Salient Features about Newspaper Company is shown !! The First half is boring, but the second half gains some intensity. We slightly get gripped with it. The second half, when Kane's bad fate begins to overcome his life. Kane tries high to captivate success for his new love. He builds Opera for her but she was not skilled enough to hold the audience's applaud. She fails. But that failure was of Kane. His decisions never fruitified. He keeps failing. Things go wrong & one his best friend who worked for the Newspaper, too leaves him.<br/><br/>But characterization.... still a problem. While watching the movie we get discomfort that Hey Man ... somewhere something is lacking !!! The Story just donot land up in right corner. There is no emotional bond created with the audience. We do not feel any relishment while watching the friendships & love relationships which Kane tries to maintain with various other characters. Although Charles Kanes emotions are tried to be reflected but we feel that it must've became a struggle for Orson Welles.<br/><br/>I cannot land up in a right corner about this Movie. Of course it is Overrated, but narrating some good points & bad points are necessary.<br/><br/>Plus Points : 1. Cinematography : In word is Excellent. 2. Kane's Psychological behavior : His Ego during break off with his Friend Leland / His belief & Self-Satisfaction for his Performing Wife, Susan. 3. Acting : I feel Orson Welles' Act as Citizen Kane is one of the finest amongst any classic movies.<br/><br/>4. The Suspense about Rosebud : It absolutely justifies the Psychological realization of the dying Charles Kane.<br/><br/>5. An innovative Non-Linear Story telling which probably was influential attribute during those days. <br/><br/>6. And the Best Scene of the Movie : The Night of the Opera - No words to describe it.<br/><br/>Bad Points : 1. Inconsistent Characterisation of Charles Kane 2. Weak briefing about the Working Pattern / Sources of Revenue & Team Work of the Newspaper Company 3. Boring first half 4. Very Bad Performance by Dorothy as Susan Kane 4. Xanadu scenes which were over directed & the reasoning of Charles Kane's decision to live in Xanadu which was not shown 5. Some pathetic scenes like Jigsaw Puzzle 6. Lengthy 7. Poor dialogs etc. etc. & many other bad points.<br/><br/>Finally, Citizen Kane MAY BE a story about a Person who is like any common man. His incapability for being a Tycoon & governing Monetary interests formed his down-to-earth personality which also becomes the reason for his failure like how Orson Welles failed in this over - directed project now an overrated classic !"

","More people who voted on this movie gave it a 1 than a 5 (1 being the lowest, 5 being medium, 10 obviously the highest). These people are brain dead. They don't watch movies to be challenged. They look at movies the way a child looks at a puppet show. They need to be constantly entertained every second before they lose interest or they'll walk off and find something more visually arresting to entertain themselves with. It's sad, but I believe it's true. Citizen Kane influenced film-making period. Not just a particular genre or a director - film-making. I can understand a person not understanding all its technical achievements, after all most of us didn't go to film school (I sure didn't). But giving a movie like Citizen Kane a 1 - the lowest possible rating for a movie - warrants total ignorance on the part of the viewer. I'm embarrassed for our society when I see these things happen."

I was surprised by how many negative reviews there are, but they all had the same basic complaint: ""It was boring!"" I find this significant, because it's the same complaint I always get from small children when I try to introduce them to a movie more sophisticated than, say, Spongebob Squarepaints. It's unfortunate there are so many people (presumably kids) out there unable to appreciate Citizen Kane, but it's their loss. The movie is a masterpiece and it's place in cinema history is secure. Its detractors should stick to rotting their minds with video games. This movie's too good for them."

","Citizen Kane. Here is a movie that has been almost universally acclaimed by every expert worth his salt as the greatest of all-time. The American Film Institute chose it. On the Sight and Sound Poll it was a near unanimous choice. Yet there is still a very large amount of people who have not seen this movie. It's not as mainstream of a Best Movie Ever as, say, The Godfather, but still this is inexcusable.<br/><br/>The most likely reason for this is that Citizen Kane is a black-and-white film from 1941. This may turn off modern movie-goers but not me. Convinced that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever and wanting to see for myself if Citizen Kane was as good as people claimed, I rented it just yesterday, February 28. Let me just say the first word that comes to my mind.<br/><br/>Wow. I'll say it again. Wow. Here is a movie that is over 60 years old, from the year America went into World War II. This film came out before Pearl Harbor, when Adolf Hitler was Fuehrer of Germany. Yet its direction is still unparalleled in the industry. The main reason for Citizen Kane's place in movie expert's hearts is for its insanely innovative technical prowess. It is almost impossible to explain just how revolutionary this direction is. Just about every movie since Citizen Kane has taken something from this movie. Yet it is still the golden light among movie direction. I was so stunned watching this film. Despite all the technical limitations of his time, despite the very simple methods of making movies that were prominent in the early 1900s, this film is so technically perfect that it is impossible for any reasonable man to deny its place among the very, very greatest movies ever. I just cannot explain in this space the perfection of this movie's direction. Orson Welles is an absolute genius when it comes to the cinema.<br/><br/>And apparently, not only did Welles orchestrate the technically finest film ever made, he is also a superb actor! Watching this movie I was immensely impressed with Charles Foster Kane and the actor who immortalized him. The entire time I was thinking, who could this be? I concentrated during the credits and found out that Orson Welles himself played the star in his signature movie. This is honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen, and Kane is the most memorable character this side of Vito Corleone I've ever met in my experiences with the cinema.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane was a world-famous newspaper tycoon, the most powerful media puppetmaster America had ever known. It is generally accepted that this character was based off of William Randolph Hurst, but that's beside the point. When he died in 1941 with his empire in shambles, he uttered one last word before falling. ""Rosebud."" One reporter is assigned to find out what this word meant. To do so he interviews the most central figures in Kane's life. It is through this story that the movie comes alive. Through this Welles displays all sorts of flashbacks, which are essentially the movie itself, of Kane's life. All of the important chapters in his saga are covered in an attempt to find out what Rosebud really means. In the process, we see a frighteningly deep display into a man who got everything he wanted in life and then subsequently lost it, his lust for material possessions to replace something else he had lost, his determination to have everything he desired what drove him through life. This all culminates in the ending which has to rank as the greatest and most thought-provoking I've ever seen. It is this ending that pieces together the puzzle of Kane's life and his struggle. It lays everything to rest, and at the end there is not one stone unturned. The ending makes everything make sense.<br/><br/>The acting in Citizen Kane is not especially memorable aside from Welles, nor is the soundtrack, but give us a break, this is 1941. Aside from that Citizen Kane features some of the most memorable scenes and subplots ever told. Three that particularly stand out are Leland's review, Kane's attempt at politics, and the attempt at turning his second wife into an opera singer. I won't spoil the story any further than this.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Citizen Kane is a movie that no intellectual human being should go their life without seeing. It is, simply put, a masterpiece, one of only two movies at this point I would give a 10 on IMDb. But is it the best movie of all-time? My opinions have changed in this matter. I now understand why all of the critics acclaim this above all else. In my heart I would still choose The Godfather, and as you can see I am giving Coppola's masterpiece a slightly higher rating, but in my mind these are the two greatest motion pictures ever created and nothing else can approach this pair of colossal giants. Perhaps it is because the Godfather features a wider cast of subplots and characters, rather than Citizen Kane focusing on one man, but in reality it is near impossible to point out any flaws in these two pieces of perfection. This is a movie that is both technically perfect and intellectually dazzling, a film that is both superb at face value and within our mind. It is a stirring piece of cinema that is and deserves to be more revered than any of its brethren. 9.7. <br/><br/>There is nothing more to say, but, <br/><br/>""I'm Charles Foster Kane! I am no politician who tries to save himself from the consequences of his own crimes!"""
"danielviam","10","6","12","28 April 2004"," The story isn't the point
","The real importance of ""Citizen Kane"" is not its story, although the script is a strong character study.  The strength of ""Kane"" is in its incredibly creative use of light, camera movement, and deep focus to create a film that at the time was literally revolutionary.<br/><br/> It is important to remember that ""Kane"" was Orson Welles' first film.  He had just attained both fame and notoriety with his ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast, and had only his radio background to sustain him.  RKO studios, then in serious financial trouble, saw him as a man capable of creating a riveting story, not as an innovator.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in Welles they had also hired a man capable of attracting brilliant men to his side.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland was at the time probably the best in the business; he is given top billing by Welles in the final credits.<br/><br/>At the time that ""Kane"" was made, film in America was in a rut.  The ideal, which movies stuck to, was to create a ""Natural"" look--no obvious lighting, the camera at eye level, no obvious cuts or transitions.  Welles, unfamiliar with all this, used obvious light, a VERY mobile camera, and wipes, fades--all the techniques that modern filmmakers used today. The American Film Institute, in its highly controversial ""Top 100,"" listed Kane as the #1 American movie.  Although many would disagree, I feel that its impact on the way films are made today might give it the merit to have that high place."

","In the early '70s Citizen Kane became the darling of some NYU film addict class instructors for reasons that defy logic. They wrote papers and articles and that caused a lot of shallow folks to come aboard on the film. However closely examined the movie is greatly overrated. The script is not really one of Herman J. Mankiewicz's best works, albeit Mankiewicz was a superb screenwriter. (Dinner at Eight, Wizard of Oz, Pride of the Yankees, etc)<br/><br/>The ""groundbreaking"" camera angles, for example, that are credited to Orson Welles (who was only 25 when he produce-directed it) should really be credited to Gregg Toland the DP on the film. However, Toland, it should be noted, was a student of the early German silent screen where many of the ""groundbreaking"" camera angles could be seen two decades before Citizen Kane. In fact, before Toland invited Welles over to his home to teach him the camera and how it's used (days before primary shooting) Welles scarcely knew which end of the camera took light."

","That about sums up my reaction to this manipulative film that so obviously wants to be intriguing. I suppose that in the era when this film was made, there was some good reason for supposing audiences would be enthralled to learn the inner goings-on for a famous and powerful man such as Kane. Those days are gone and I must report that everyone I know considers this film a dinosaur and utterly lacking in both plausibility and attractiveness. The very last thing I will do is to sit around attempting to learn the wheres and why-fores about a completely fictional person who I couldn't care less about. Kane was an unimportant nothing, in my book, be he fictional or the representation of someone real. The supposedly enthralling ""Rosebud"" clue was almost an insult to my intelligence - an obvious gimmick to hook the viewer. And in the end, it was nothing more than a cheap sham.

But 60 years after it was made, it still stands up throughout, from beginning to end, as a great film. Most of the films of that period have serious flaws that have become more apparent with age, parts where you have to make allowances for the time and the place and say, ""well, despite the handicaps they were laboring under, they did pretty good."" Citizen Kane asks for no quarter and gives none. It's as fresh today as it was when it was made. In the final analysis, it's not the much ballyhooed technical innovations like the ceilings and the depth of field shots that make it a stunning achievement, it's the story and the characters and the magnificent portrayal by Welles."

It might have been brilliant in terms of art, direction and on a technical level but, all of those aspects make a movie great? The answer is no. I think most people pretend to like this film just because is supposed to be great. Don't get me wrong, I think I can appreciate its achievement in the aspects I mentioned above, but the merits of this self-indulgent film end there. It was really boring, the plot was just average and the acting was terrible. I really hated Kane's wife. Comingore was a lousy actress, her accent was bad and all the emphasis she put when her character asked questions was like torture.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie is so self-indulgent that it almost feels like Welles knew beforehand all the praise he would receive in the future. What I can't believe is that this film is often compared to Casablanca (Well, compete would be more accurate) when people talk about classics. That was a great movie and there's no way this film can compete with it.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this title to anyone, unless you claim to be a film lover.

There's not much in terms of plot points going on here (shall we say 2: one in the first minute and one in the last? ..or do you want to consider finding ""Joseph Cotton's character has aged over the years"" as a plot point??).  Sub plots?  ..you'll fall asleep waiting for one.  The theme of ""a man working his way up to filthy rich/what he pays for it and what he holds meaningful in life"" is worth about 30 minutes ..tops. The ride there is visually stunning, if you haven't seen a movie since 1941.<br/><br/>A film student really needs to study this film because of the techniques and attention to ""film making"" - the ability to get exactly what you want: the ""production value"" (just like an engineerig student should know and understand basic addition and subtraction).  But to the average audience today there is ABSOLUTELY NO ENTERTAINMENT VALUE in this ""classic""."

","So as many know, in recent years, Citizen Kane has made the top of the lists of prestigious ""Best Films of All-Time"". <br/><br/>To be fair, that's an extremely bold claim, and those who make it have to understand they've already set expectations too high. I was aware of that, however, going in to my first time viewing as I've been there before with bold claims and know how to adjust to a more realistic preliminary mindset. Still, I did have some hopes it would live up to some level of greatness.<br/><br/>It didn't. It was a mess. This was just a boring mess of a movie, and I was beyond disappointed. I was so bored and disengaged, I turned it off about an hour in. <br/><br/>Not only was it boring, it was not even well done. The biggest problem is the ridiculously horrible editing. This movie is jumping all over the place with titles, voice overs, flashbacks, and current time scenes. That's effective if it's clean and not sloppy and if the film is entertaining, but this was none of those things. <br/><br/>Now, I admit, I'm not a black and white, old movie fan. I've tried to like them through the years, but the quality compared to the last 3-4 decades is so much less, it's hard to relish in what it must have been like when these films were first released. However, I usually recognize something in them that I could understand why it might have been so popular or successful during its time. <br/><br/>For example, It's a Wonderful Life and Casablanca had recognizable redeeming qualities. I rarely can ever raise an old classic film above an 8 rating out of 10, even when I find it good, usually due to the poor effects and camera work, in addition to other technicalities compared to more modernized, polished movies today and recent decades. <br/><br/>But I can still find a reason why they were popular and found prestige. With Citizen Kane, I couldn't. People can like this movie if they want and critics can list it as one of the top 10 movies of all- time, even put it at number one, but I couldn't stand it. <br/><br/>I truly found it boring, poorly made, poor quality, and a waste of my time and emotions.<br/><br/>3/10.

","We all know the story about the emperor riding butt naked down the street and all his loyal subjects chorusing ""what a wonderful, splendid suit of clothes"" - until some kid chimes in with the observation ""but he's as naked as a jaybird""!! Well, for me ""Citizen Kane"" - along with that other overblown, overrated yawn-fest ""Gone With The Wind"" which was made a couple of years earlier - is one of those ""emperor's new clothes"" movies that has fed on its own myth and which most people seem terrified of slagging off for fear of being branded a philistine. Sure, it may have been a ""pioneering"" and ""revolutionary"" kind of movie in its day. But does that alone qualify it for the tag of ""The Greatest""? I think not. The Wright Brothers invented the aeroplane. They were pioneers. They revolutionized transport. But a lot of others came along afterwards and did it much better. And so it is with movie-making. Citizen Kane and GWTW should be accepted for what they are - groundbreaking in their day, but twee and dated by modern standards."

","CITIZEN KANE pioneered some innovative technical practices we take for granted today, and it proved a worth vehicle for introducing some very fine actors & actresses to Hollywood. Ray Collins, Agnes Moorhead, Joseph Cotton and Orson Wells all made big impressions later on in their careers, but this film is just too boring and you don't care about the characters. First issue: boredom...CK is not boring because of the age in which it was produced - Gone with The Wind, Double Indemnity, Mrs Miniver, Casablanca, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Big Sleep all belong to this era and still hold almost every movie fan's attention from start to finish, even after repeated screenings. Perhaps CK is warning us against the evils of materialism, which is laudable. Kane has millions and spends compulsively until it doesn't interest him anymore. He acquires one fantastic woman, battles with her, then finds another. Wife #2 is a hotcha-girl and seems none too bright, but she's just ignorant and her character-development is the one truly interesting thing about the entire film as her gathering sophistication reveals an intelligent and finally independent woman. But, little else interests me very long. We're told about his wonderful, massive house and don't get to see much of it. Kane never seems to have much fun and I don't care why he doesn't. The odd, stark shots of theatres, libraries, offices, etc. bored me stiff the first time I saw the movie and are still just a bunch of stuff to plod through the next time I watch it. Second issue: Why don't I care?? We're treated to that ""Rosebud"" remark early on, but I can never find myself caring about it. So what if it's the sled he had as a little boy. The movie doesn't make me care about Kane either as adult OR child. Mr. Bernstein is a likable kiss-ass, he admits, and he's mildly interesting. Jed Leland goes to one of Susan Kane's operatic performances, gets bored with mediocrity and is too cowardly to finish a bad review, gets drunk, gets fired. Hoh-hum. Mean old Mr. Thatcher is a little interesting, and his final scene with Kane is a humorous island in a sea of mediocrity: Thatcher and Kane should be good, old friends - - they even finish each others' sentences, but they're old enemies and always will be. Then everybody gets old and/or dies. So what? God willing, that's what'll happen to most of us. This movie shows us that, as time goes by, the once young and lively become old and slow...then the Kane's life is over and there's a half-hearted search for Rosebud and nobody ever discovers the origin of Kane's dying remark.

","Citizen Kane is a film that I like to describe as fun to analyze but hard to watch. For a filmmaking buff, Citizen Kane is an all you can eat buffet. Welles' cinematography was revolutionary and his usage of lighting is incredible. There are so many things in this film that make it a technical masterpiece, and stills from the film are the perfect thing to include in a textbook on great movie making. That being said, the actual plot of the film is fun at times, but dreadfully boring at others. The take on storytelling of starting with the death of the character and then following a reporter as he pieces the man's life together was a clever one, but that life takes too long to get through when the journey isn't even the most enjoyable thing to experience. Kane's life was by no means boring, but there were times throughout the movie where it feels like the pacing goes to a halt for good reason. There are a variety of time jumps to get a nice sense of Kane's life, but more could have been done with the characters that knew Kane in the present, as without a more unique reaction to his death (which implies growth or change of those characters) it feels like these sections are mere detours that pull us out of the actual movie."

Good example would be Titanic.<br/><br/>I'll end my review here. I just challenge someone, anyone to simply list out why the reasons why this is the best movie of all time and please don't tell me how it revolutionized cinematography, if that's the case, the first movie ever made should be the best movie of all time.

"Turfseer","8","3","5","29 October 2007"," Kane falls down in second half
","It's difficult criticizing a movie that's hailed as the greatest movie of all time. From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas. <br/><br/>Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a ""love nest"" with the ""singer"". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.<br/><br/>Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script—what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc. <br/><br/>By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career—a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact of an American classic."
"398","8","3","5","9 June 2007"," Great Technique Fails to Hide Dull Subject
","Citizen Kane is one of the great technical milestones in the history of film. It is also a rather dull film that fails to involve the viewer on any but a technical level. The innovative cinematography far outshines the ordinary subject matter and the viewer is never viscerally engaged. The movie is cold and slow. <br/><br/>1. The first flaw is Kane. The whole film is built around an examination of the life of this character, but he is neither very important nor very interesting. William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration for Kane, is a minor historical figure in retrospect, as even the movie makes clear. Comparisions to Kubla Khan and talk of an ""empire upon an empire"" ring hollow. Kane has some influence but no real power. He fails to secure high office. He pumps for the Spanish-American War but opposes American entry into World War I. In each case, the decision for war is made by others. Thirty-seven newspapers and a radio station is hardly an empire and Kane lacks even the muscle to put a singer over with a skeptical public.<br/><br/>Nor is Kane an out-sized and fascinating character such as General Patton in the movie ""Patton"". Kane says early in the movie that he might have been great without money, but we see nothing to indicate that this assessment reflects anything but blind ego. It is only his inherited wealth which props him up at all. He is a failure as a politician. He is a failure as a businessman. He is a failure in his personal life. He is surrounded by talentless sycophants.<br/><br/>2. Kane is never put into the context of his times. This is a major failing of the movie. What do we actually learn about the United States from the 1890's to 1941. Race is swept utterly under the rug. The only black faces to be seen are stereotypical servants and musicians. What about the social issues of the time? Did Kane support prohibition? Did he favor immigration? Oppose lynching? What about women's rights? We find out nothing about his views, other that in some way his political collapse set back the cause of reform, apparently because he ran against ""corruption"".<br/><br/>3. The script leaves critical areas of Kane's life and character blank and unexplored. He becomes a father. The movie does not show us his response to the birth of a son, nor what sort of dreams and hopes he invests in the boy. We never see how he reacts to his son's death or the impact this tragedy has on him. The birth and death of an only child should be pivotal and life-altering events. They are thrown away in this movie.<br/><br/>4. The acting is in and out. Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins, Ruth Warrick, and Paul Stewart are excellent in small parts. Others, such as Erskine Sanford, overact. Everett Sloane is convincing as an old man. Joseph Cotton is not, and is poorly made up. Dorothy Comingore is strident and off-putting as Susan. Welles himself is often striking, but is undercut by poor makeup in some later scenes. Neither the characters, not the acting, except for Welles, linger in the memory.<br/><br/>5. The character of Kane is pretty well-sketched in halfway or two- thirds of the way through the movie. We know all we are going to know or perhaps care to know, but the movie lumbers on, with Kane sinking from merely arrogant to grotesque. The transition from the bright, promising, if perhaps unexceptional, young man, to the bizarre old recluse in a marble palace is shown, but not explained, and frankly, I thought the scenes at Xanadu were over-the-top.<br/><br/>All in all, a masterpiece of technique that deserves credit for striving for a more adult spin than most movies of its era, but a movie, which, ironically, has dated more than the less ambitious, accomplished, or artistic, rivals from that era."
"Writer228","7","3","5","6 November 2005"," Non-chronological history of the ups and downs in the life of Charles Foster Kane, based on the character of Randolph Hearst
","""Citizen Kane,"" released in 1941, was ahead of its time in cinematography. Many long cuts, showing action in real time, fill the film. The few short cuts are taken mainly to emphasize dialogue. This story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who fought the release of this film into theaters.<br/><br/>The story is not told in chronological order. The first impression we get in this film is of a run down mansion, inhabited by a dying old man, whose last word in life was ""rosebud."" The quest of the film is to discover the meaning of this word.<br/><br/>""March of the News,"" a satire of the theater weekly ""Time Marches On"" newsreel, is footage of Kane documenting his lifetime, and gets the audience inside the life of this powerful, yet uncaring man. The story of his life is told through a series of flashbacks, some spanning many years through one dissolve. Kane collects statues, paintings, animals in a zoo, and a vast area for his home and castle in Florida known as Xanadu, based on the ""castle"" of William Randolph Hearst, who did his best to destroy the film before it was shown to the public. Charles Foster Kane is a montage of several real-life characters, Hearst among them.<br/><br/>As a boy, Kane is removed from his mother's home because she has come into money, and wishes for the boy to be well cared for. In addition, the father is excited about receiving $50,000 each year during the boy's absence. The mother, played by a young Agnes Morehead of ""Bewitched"" fame, is solid, stoic and almost unfeeling at the loss of her child. Similarly, Kane does not visit his parents during the film, referring only to his mother's passing, and possessions he ought to go through.<br/><br/>The shot of a portrait of the newsmen of ""The Chronicle"" dissolves into a shot of his new ""Inquirer"" staff. Kane paid these reporters well to come to work for him. One senses Kane has no scruples, despite the fact he gets his way by being charming. During an office celebration, Kane dances charmingly with chorus girls, his dancing reflected in an elaborate shot with his image reflected in the mirror as his friends Mr. Bernstein and Jedidiah talk of him as a great and famous man, and all sing an original some about Charle Kane. <br/><br/>Kane announces his engagement, and consequent marriage to the niece of the President of the United States, Emily. He wants not only to fit in with the elite, but to have high society to bend to his whims. His is not a happy marriage, shown in a series of montage cuts over the breakfast table. His wife eventually leaves Kane and takes their son because Kane doesn't spend time with them, or understand and empathize with family feelings.<br/><br/>He treats his wives like another of his many possessions, telling the women what they are, what they will think, and what they will do. His second wife pursues a career in opera, which is a mistake because she has no talent. Her misery falls back on him, but he pushes her to continue.<br/><br/>Kane has political aspirations which burst like a bubble once his extramarital affair with the second woman is made public, and his first wife divorces him. The grandiosity in which Kane presents himself is actually very shallow, his work for his fellow man's benefit appears only in his early life. As an old man he is callous and uncaring of anything that doesn't have directly to do with him. ""All he ever wanted was love,"" recollects Jedidiah as an old man.<br/><br/>We learn of the meeting of Kane and his second wife on a street corner, as she leaves the drugstore with toothache medicine, and he has just been splashed with mud by a passing horse and buggy. Thety retire to her boarding house room, and his attempt at first seduction is quelled by her keeping the door open. Their relationship shown on screen is harmless, but the audience knows that more comes to pass between them. Kane loves Susan because she loves him, without realizing he is a wealthy powerful newspaper man. But, the more she knows him, the less she likes him.<br/><br/>Kane pursues the governorship of the state, expressing his concern for the ""working man."" His dreams for the Presidency of the United States die, but out of his grasp because his affair is exposed. ""A toast to love on my terms. That's the only terms that anyone really knows,"" says Kane when defeated at the hands of his precious working class, now represented by organized labor.<br/><br/>Kane is a man of wealth and power, and builds an opera house in Chicago for his wife to sing in. As well, his newspapers across the country give her rave reviews. Only his friend, and arts editor prints a scathing review which Kane finishes as the man, Jedidiah Leland, his friend from college days passes out from drinking before he finishes the review of her performance. ""Some kind of friend he is,"" shrikes his lame songstress, now wife.<br/><br/>Despite a palace of 49,000 acres of scenery and statues, and the still being built compound/castle of Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane, and he erupts into a violent temper explosion in which he destroys Susan's room. Kane lives his final years alone, in what Leland refers to as his coliseum.<br/><br/>As a group of reporters and photographers survey more possessions than can be counted, the audience sees Kane's sled, burning in an incinerator. Can one word really sum up the wishes of one's life?"

This is a film that many will relate to and revisit mentally. The strength of the film lies in the writing. The unique way in which the story is revealed and the smart believable dialog. The technical aspects are also unique and the use of light is superb. It's one of the best and certainly one of the first. Some of these images will sear themselves through your eyes into your brain.

It is the one funny part to this dull movie. This movie was also too long.

","*** Slight spoilers ahead, but already well-known ***<br/><br/>Get ready for another review rating this movie on the extreme.  This movie is quite simply... unbelievable.<br/><br/>But not the way you might think; this review will be rating to the other extreme.  Simply put, it's unfathomable that this movie cracks the Top 250. It's absolutely awful.  The main reason it's awful is mainly because it's UNINTERESTING.  It has nothing to do with ""boring"" or ""slow moving"" or anything like that.  In fact, I thought the ""movement"" was fine.  It's just plain uninteresting (and a little weird.)<br/><br/>There is nothing in the movie that grabs you and makes you genuinely interested in Charles Foster Kane.  Nothing.  There's nothing to cause you to dislike him or to feel especially endeared to him (or to any of the other characters.)  The famous, one-word death breath of ""Rosebud"" turns out to be nothing more than gimmicky, and 30-45 minutes after watching him saying it, hoping that somehow the movie would really develop something around that phrase, you finally decide you just don't care why he said ""Rosebud.""<br/><br/>There exists not one redeeming factor about the movie that makes you care at all about the outcome which is one of the very reasons, I would suspect, that many movies are watched through in their entirety.  And some of the scenes and scene transitions, aside from being uninteresting were actually a little weird.<br/><br/>Needless to say, my wife and I (who have watched plenty of other ""boring"" B&W movies and are quite tempered to doing so) couldn't bring ourselves to care enough to finish it.  Again...  Amazing that this movie cracks the Top 250 or receives the kind of reviews it does.  It belongs in the BOTTOM 250 worst films ever made.  It takes them all."

But it's not an amazing movie, and hardly has any reason to be considered the greatest movie of all time.  Plus it's also a very BORING movie.  I saw this movie because of all of its hype, expecting it to be magnificent....but I was disappointed and unimpressed.  Perhaps all the techniques that Welles used in the making of this film (cinematography, lighting, editing) may have been revolutionary in 1941.  But that alone is not enough reason to consider this film ""great"".  The plot is simple to understand, but it's not remarkable--nothing about this story would make it superior to other films. As a matter of fact, ""Gone With The Wind"" was made two years before ""Citizen Kane"", and technically, it was a groundbreaking film.

","Considering how critically acclaimed this movie is I expected something that wasn't difficult to watch; then again Orson Welles is a bit droll. When looking at the way that the passage of time was shown off as, a time lapse, along with the slow camera move through the neon sign and through the glass of a skylight it makes you wonder just how that was managed by Welles. The character Charles Foster Kane was extremely two dimensional, granted that is more likely than not, the point, but he was a man set up for failure right from the beginning. He started with his heart in the right place but that was it. By the end everyone that has initially loved this man hated him with a passion due to his incessant need for self preservation. Overall I can appreciate this movie for what it is to the film world, but the title ""greatest movie of all time"" is extremely undeserving."
"Doylenf","5","6","14","2 May 2001"," NOT the greatest of all time...I never bonded emotionally with this coldly clinical film...
","Many times I've been tempted to watch 'Citizen Kane' just to analyze why so many consider it the greatest film of all time. No more than twenty minutes go by and I find myself BORED by this so-called classic. I have to admit I am not a fan of Orson Welles and always thought there was a bit of the smokehouse ham about all his larger than life performances--be it 'Macbeth' or Rochester in 'Jane Eyre' or the attorney in 'Compulsion'. But it is much more than just not liking Welles. I find there is a pretentiousness, an artificiality about the whole film. It's trying so hard to be symbolic about the ""true meaning of life"", much the way 'American Beauty' attempted to show us that there is beauty in a plastic bag floating in the wind. 'Rosebud' is just as simplistic--quite a letdown, in my opinion, to discover that a child's sled is at the seat of the mystery surrounding Kane. Frankly, I just don't get it. What is so profound about this film that historians say it should be shown to young filmmakers as an example of great story-telling? I would rather succumb to the charms of 'How Green Was My Valley' (also in 1941) which took prize as the Best Film of 1941 than have to view this depressing piece of cinema that is supposed to be a thinly disguised portrait of William Randolph Hearst. Intellectuals may love 'Citizen Kane' and AFI must have a number of them on their voting board--but it does not deserve the high ranking they've given it. In my humble opinion, it fails to be even credible. The direction is self-consciously arty (see those unusual camera angles) and the acting sometimes borders on the ludicrous. Does not stand the test of time."

"sbmetiko","6","5","11","24 December 2006"," Good, But Ultimately Weak
","When you hear people talk about the greatness of this movie, it usually has a lot to do with its technical brilliance, which I can't contend with. But to call it the greatest movie ever made seems rather arbitrary when you compare it to a long line of equally inventive and well put together stories that have come since (not to mention more entertaining). The only reason I can imagine that it has risen to this level of acclaim is that so many people have called it the best that it makes anyone who disagrees look like they just don't ""get it."" So, Citizen Kane longs for the simplicity of his childhood, when happiness was so easily attained. If Kane could whisper to us he would say that what he wants is unconditional love, from someone who has nothing to gain. What he has been seeking is the love of his mother, who at the first opportunity abandons him, perhaps because of his rambunctious nature. He would tell us that when you only seek your own happiness you are incapable of love. I say I get it but it just isn't as clever as you'd like to believe it is. Agreeing that this is the greatest movie ever is like agreeing that the Citroen DS is the most attractive car ever. Everyone knows that it really isn't, but they humor it because it makes them look deep. I believe that movies serve a specific purpose, and if they fail to achieve this purpose they have failed, period. The way I measure the quality of a movie, is by its ability to do what a movie is supposed to. Fiction exists as a mirror, to reflect back at us the fundamental truths of the human experience. A good movie should be one that takes us to a place of emotional enlightenment. It scratches that part of the human psyche that only the most moving moments of life can accomplish; moments of sadness, joy, anticipation, excitement etc. But surely if a movie fails to move you it fails. I cannot imagine how this movie could have possibly floored anyone. I can recall many movies that have left me a lot more moved: American Beauty, Godfather II, The Shawshank Redemption, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan to name a few. Lastly I'll say this, Shakespeare was great for among many things being able to write a play that was commissioned by the Queen of England, but that was equally enjoyed by both peasants and nobles. That takes talent. Wrapping up your oh so clever point in an enigma is something that I believe many authors do in order to make themselves look clever. If they really had something to say, moreover to teach the world why would they wrap it up in riddles?"

Each shot truly is a wonder of technical staging, special effect, and cinematography, but the film itself lacks life.<br/><br/>The scenes are presented one at a time as different pieces in the puzzle of who Kane really was, but there are too many pieces and so little connectivity between them that they become a confusing blur from which little understanding is gleaned. The individual scenes themselves actually can be distracting from the overall film in that their rich qualities, lavish sets, and dramatic lighting often overshadow and overpower whatever information they contain. Even though the audience is supposed to be going through the same dilemma as the investigator, there are far too many lengthy subplots and red herrings. By the time the final scene is presented, the significance of what is seen is easily lost on an audience that has to think back across the entire movie to determine how it all fits together. So many with whom I have seen this film were asleep before that last scene.<br/><br/>The film was so well hyped at its release - and has such a great story of Hearst trying to destroy it, that it is a kind of legend in film history. I simply fail to see how it is the 'greatest' film ever made. Technologically beautiful, yes. An overall great film, no."

The only fun part about this film is when after finishing it you don't get the meaning of ""rosebud"" so you read the synopsis, and then get the meaning and be like ""ohhhhhhh that's cool"" - and that's the little fun you get.<br/><br/>Still, I appreciate history and get the idea.

","Citizen Kane is the motion picture which, since its release, has been widely regarded by almost all critics, filmmakers & even many viewers around the world as the greatest film of all time. And although I agree to some extent that, purely on a technical scale, this might be the most influential picture ever made but based solely on its plot & story, there are far better examples in cinema than this one.<br/><br/>Still, there is no denying that Citizen Kane is a boldly crafted feature which not only defied all the typical methods of filmmaking that were in use at its time of production but also ended up completely rewriting the manuals of filmmaking in the process. The film tells the story of a publishing tycoon whose death makes news reporters scramble around to discover the meaning of his final utterance.<br/><br/>While there is a lot to take in here, the best part of Citizen Kane remains its stupefying cinematography & the overall structure of its narration while the worst was, in simple words & in just my opinion, an insufferable boring story. So boring that it took me 6 unsuccessful attempts to finish it. But once it accomplished that, the end result was surprisingly better than what I was expecting from it.<br/><br/>The film presents an unusual portrayal of a larger than life character told through different people & is wonderfully assisted by its carefully crafted screenplay, innovative sharp focus photography, non-linear narration, inventive use of make-up, sound & transition effects, splendid score & a strong central performance by Orson Welles in front as well as behind the camera.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Citizen Kane is arguably the most experimental cinema of its era that has somehow managed to stand the test of time and is certainly one of world cinema's highly influential & important works whose significance to the film medium is simply as mysterious & profound as the symbolism behind the word, ""Rosebud""."

","Lauded as America's greatest motion picture of all time, Orson Welles succeeded in utilizing advanced techniques in cinematography, storytelling, and especially lighting and camera angles. Citizen Kane represents the pinnacle of Welles's film-making career despite the surrounding controversy during its time of release. The film had parallels between the eponymous character, Charles Foster Kane, and William Randolph Hearst, who was an American newspaper magnate. Welles combined innovative techniques of deep focus shots along with a kaleidoscope of angles. Different types of angles were utilized in order for the audience to deepen their understanding of each character. Despite the film's confusing newsreel sequence, Welles succeeds in utilizing unique camera angles and advanced cinematography in a perfect manner.<br/><br/>Released in 1941, the film became subject of controversy for the brutal portrait of Hearst's life. Citizen Kane also revolutionized how cinematography, a non-linear storyline, and a kaleidoscope of angles were used effectively. The famous eerily opening featuring a shot of the eponymous character's (Orson Welles) mansion, Xanadu. The camera depicts a foggy and murky atmosphere with a deep focus shot of Xanadu atop of the hill. The scene then cuts to a room with a dying Kane, holding a snow globe as he mutters ""Rosebud."" The camera focuses on the globe as it rolled out of his left hand and broke.<br/><br/>Welles employs different a non-linear storytelling which features the death of the main character in the beginning of the movie. As the news unfolds of his death, the famous newsreel sequence unfolds on screen. It presents a brief of narrative events in roughly the same order as the movie as a whole. The editing of the sequence was well-done as the narrator of the newsreel points out that ""Kane helped to change the world, but Kane's world now is history. The great yellow journalist himself lived to be history. Outlived his power to make it"" Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) was determined to find out the meaning of Kane's last word ""Rosebud."" He was assigned to discuss with Kane's former associates in an attempt to uncover the meaning of Rosebud. <br/><br/>Different camera angles allow the audience to understand the character emotions and tensions within a scene. For example, there was a scene that involves using a low-angle technique when Kane was having a discussion with his friend, Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten). He confronts him after his defeat in the election for governor against Jim W. Gettys (Ray Collins). In the office, where the discussion took place; Leland commented that ""(Kane doesn't) care about anything except (himself)."" As Kane walks closer to the camera, Leland said to him, ""You just want to persuade people that you love 'em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms."" The low angle emphasizes Leland trying to assure his moral superiority to Kane.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane made advances in cinematographic advances. Cinematographer Gregg Toland made a significant contribution to the style of the film through the use of deep focus. It refers to having everything within the frame, even the background, focused at the same time. There is a famous scene, involving Kane's mother, Mary Kane (Agnes Moorehead), having a conversation with his father, Jim Kane (Harry Shannon). Deep focus shot was effective in depicting the Kane family, discussing with Walter Parks Thatcher at the table. She figured out that she was given a stock in order to be given ownership of the Colorado Lode, a working gold mine. She signed an agreement to transfer $50,000 per year given to both to her and her husband. Charles Kane eventually owned all possessions by the time he reached the age of 25. The deep focus shot allowed the background which is inside Mary Kane's boarding house to be focused. We see Kane's parents signing the agreement and the distance of a young Kane outside, playing in the snow.<br/><br/>In spite of the movie's age and its confusing opening sequence, Citizen Kane has attained its status as ""the greatest film ever made."" The American Film Institute has ranked the film number 1 in the first top- 100 ranking in 1998. Using deep focus shots allow the characters' emotions to be understood through Gregg Toland's extensive use of back-lighting. What matters is to understand Charles Kane's ruthless rise of acquiring wealth, as he enters the newspaper business. The difficulty to interpret Kane's life has become apparent as reporters attempted to decipher his last word ""Rosebud."" This word was a clue that Kane was not just a mere symbol of his public accomplishments. Who, really, was Charles Foster Kane?"
"jon-fougner-966-434081","8","2","3","20 April 2013"," Citizenship
","At the peak of the debt bubble last decade, David Siegel, CEO and owner of the world's largest time share developer, leveraged his already leveraged fortune to build America's largest house. Dubbed un-ironically ""Versailles,"" the 90,000 square-foot monstrosity started to take root in the Florida Everglades. When the bubble popped, so did Siegel's fortune and family, and the home, half-finished, went to foreclosure.<br/><br/>Remarkably, documentarian Lauren Greenfield captured the rise and fall of this modern day Xanadu--gaudy enough to make Donald Trump blush--in ""Queen of Versailles"" (2012), which took top directing honors at the Sundance Film Festival. The comparisons it begs to Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), itself an untouchable fortress, are inescapable. Like Charles Foster Kane (Welles), Siegel used the scalability of market capitalism to accumulate unwieldy millions and then sought to sequester it, and himself, in a monument down in that state that Civilized people consider barely worthy of citizenship. And so each of these two men was first among their equals--but not quite even equal himself.<br/><br/>We watch Kane and Siegel grow fat, hubristic, and surly while they lose their wealth, reputation and family. But Kane has been remembered for 72 years, whereas Siegel will soon be forgotten. Why did we care so much to decipher Kane's Rosebud while we couldn't care less about Siegel's? Is it that Kane's life's work was vindicating our core value of freedom of the press, whereas Siegel's was indulging our ego, groupthink, and materialism with the thought that we could and should own a second home?<br/><br/>To see that it isn't, return to the news room debate that follows the screening of an obit of Kane at the beginning of that film. The editors query: What matters more?: What he did or who he was? Our quest as citizen journalists--proxied by Jerry Thompson (William Alland), whose back is almost always to the camera--resolves that the answer is the latter. To write the definitive Kane obit, we need to know who this love interest Rosebud is, Thompson presumes. We discover Rosebud was no woman, but rather the symbol of the last moment of fun, family and autonomy in Kane's life.<br/><br/>Money wrecks all that, and Kane's last-ditch effort to wreck the wrecker by tearing his love nest to tatters is too little, too late. Greenfield's film, on the other hand, never gives us a sympathetic, pre-wealth Siegel whom we might root for, or at least be curious about. We know only what he did, rather than who he was, and so it is mostly with schadenfreude that we witness his implosion.<br/><br/>Queen of Versailles isn't the only current release inviting parallels to Welles' chef d'oeuvre. Carl Deal and Tia Lessin's ""Citizen Koch"" (forthcoming 2013) digs into the funding of the modern Republican Party by plutocrats, including the Koch brothers. The doc is set against the backdrop of the aptly captioned Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 559 U.S. 310 (2010), which held that citizens do not lose their First Amendment protections merely because they channel their voice through corporations. Indeed, was Kane's constitutionally-protected yellow journalism any nobler than the Hillary Clinton hit job cooked up by Citizens United?<br/><br/>What these films and this case share in common is the question of what we may and should do with accumulated wealth. Ironically, that's a question that newspaper moguls have to worry less and less about these days. Just visit Sam Simeon, whose 90,000 square feet Siegel was likely trying to best. William Randolph Hearst's real-life Xanadu, overlooking the Pacific from its perch on the bluffs just north of San Luis Obispo, stands as a monument to the value that could once be extracted by controlling mass media. Perhaps motivated by Welles' film, the Hearst Corporation secured a more sympathetic legacy for Hearst Castle than Kane did for Xanadu by donating it to the state of California to be used as a state park. We'll see whether the ongoing decline of print journalism will force the corporation (which also owns various non-print traditional and new media assets) to sell the grounds near the Castle that, according to a state park tour guide in 2010, it still owns.<br/><br/>The less newspaper publishers have to worry about what to do with wealth, the more we newspaper readers have to worry about where to get the news. Part of the answer will be finding it ourselves, as citizen journalists. Traditional media, from CNN (iReport) to the TriBeCa Film Festival (Vine competition categories), will try to channel and co-opt that trend, but they can't put this genie back in the bottle. And so technology, which globalized us in the 20th century, will re-localize us after all."

I watched with avid interest reasoning it was a good film and a grand testimony to the late William Randolph Hearst. Despite his annoyance with it, Hearst tried unsuccessfully to have it destroyed.

Believing he is incapable of failure, he runs for Governor and attempts a high profile marriage. Despite power and position, Caine learns first hand there are some things money can't buy.

","If you know anything at all about film criticism then you probably know that ""Citizen Kane"" is widely hailed as the greatest film of all time. However, I think I can safely say that this film's high stature is due more to it's enduring influence than to it's particular merits.<br/><br/>Of course, I don't mean to imply that the film is poorly made, even by today's standards. Welles's direction can only be described as visionary. Combined with Gregg Toland's cinematography & Robert Wise's editing, the film has a look that's light-years ahead of it's time. And let's not forget Bernard Herrmann's fine score.<br/><br/>The story is an engrossing one. The enigmatic Charles Foster Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"", sets a reporter on a search to unearth the meaning of this cryptic final statement. We are whisked thru different periods in the man's life, piecing the puzzle together through the remembrances of others. The ending does not disappoint, elucidating the mystery with a subtlety rarely seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>The acting is well-handled throughout, particularly Welles as he portrays Kane from age 25 to death with the help of ingenious makeup artists. I do wish, however, that a few of the other performances had been more subdued and less overtly theatrical.<br/><br/>While I believe that there are later films that supercede ""Citizen Kane"" in terms of quality I will concede that there may be no more important film. Needless to say, this film is required viewing for anyone who purports to know anything at all about motion pictures."

","ORSON WELLES WAS A YOUNG LAD OF 25 WHEN HE STARTED WORKING ON ""CITIZEN KANE"".  MANY CRITICS HAVE FELT THAT THIS FILM IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE. IT IS HARD TO SAY WHAT IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE...IT DEPENDS ON ONE'S POINT OF VIEW - AND THAT POINT OF VIEW HAS BEEN SHARED BY MANY WHEN IT COMES TO REVIEWING THIS FILM. THE STORY BEGINS, OR RATHER IS THE END OF AN ERA, FOR CHARLES FOSTER KANE (WELLES).  HE REPEATEDLY WHISPERS ""ROSEBUD"". WE DO NOT FIND OUT UNTIL AT THE END OF THE MOVIE WHO HE IS REFERRING TO.  THE BEST SCENE IN KANE, I THINK, IS WHEN HE IS WATCHING HIS WIFE SING AN OPERATIC SOLO FROM A BALCONY THEATRE BOOTH.  SHE SINGS SO HORRIBLY AND THE AUDIENCE GIVES HER SOME MINIMAL APPLAUSE.  THREE SECONDS LATER, KANE STARTS TO SLOWLY CLAP AND THEN CLAP SO LOUDLY THAT THE AUDIENCE CLAPS ALONG WITH HIM - A SIGN OF HIS POWER AS A NEWSPAPER TYCOON.  THE MOVIE GAINED MUCH PUBLICITY LATER ON, ESPECIALLY WHEN RANDOLPH HEARST STARTED TO DENOUNCE IT.

","Well, this movie isn't recommended for nothing.  Although I will agree from film critics, its the best film ever made for technical reasons.  Which is wrong.  This is a masterpiece for more humane reasons.  Its because its the truth.  No film can achieve more than that.<br/><br/>Critics will tell you about the lighting, the cinematography, the sound, and camera angles and blah blah blah.  Much of this has been analyzed over and over.  True, this is an exceptional film because of those reasons.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a very innovative film (of that time) and much of the critics analysis of the film has merit, but its much more than that.  Welles had something so much for us with this film.<br/><br/>Its about our truth.  The meaning of our lives and the significant influences that make our lives complete or in this case incomplete.<br/><br/>* SPOILERS *<br/><br/>Kane's life was the latter.  Incomplete.  The last words out of his dying mouth.  ""Rosebud"".  The sled he owned as a little boy.  All of the wealth, influence, success, and friends he had in his lonely nonexistent life.  His very last words of that life was ""Rosebud"".  An insignificant toy he owned when he was a child.  All he owned, bought, or controled in his adult life had no influence in his adult life.   That truth about Kane's life is no surprise and is very sad.  Little wonder that this didn't make a dent in the Oscar selections that year.  It takes years for people (and critics) to appreciate what that means to all of us.<br/><br/>My grandpa died when I was fifteen.  My grandpa was a farmer his whole life. He raised crops from fertilization to full grown life.  Crop season meant everything to him at the time.  I went to visit him on his deathbed with my father, mother and my sister.  My grandpa had the clearest blue eyes you have ever seen, but on this day they were dull, cold, and fading.  He was rambling about death coming to take him and that he was at peace with it. At the time he was barely coherent and couldn't recognize anyone around him. I was very sad.<br/><br/>He looked at me suddenly and those cold eyes lite up and and he said ""Stephen"".  I went to him and told him that I loved him.  He seemed to be at peace with that.  Two days later he left us.<br/><br/>At the age of 15 I was very sad.  Now, at the age of 34, I understand my grandfather.  All of the crops his raised meant very little to him at that time.  It was his family and friends that meant the most to him.<br/><br/>It meant the most to Kane at his deathbed as well.  The only difference was he had only a sled when he was a little child.  That is very sad.  That is what Orson Welles was trying to tell us.<br/><br/>I will bet you every single dollar that Bill Gates (our Citizen Kane of our time) makes that none of it will matter at his deathbed.  I only pray that he is intelligent enough to know what really matters in his life.<br/><br/>Orson Welles made a film that is universal in its appeal.  I hope everyone sees it and appreciates it for how sad it is.<br/><br/>We can all learn from it.<br/><br/>That is why this is a great masterpiece of our and any other time.<br/><br/>Film students learn the techniques that make the critics love it.  Film lovers and realists appreciate it for the humanitarian ideals it suggests.<br/><br/>Grandpa.  Rest in peace and I'll see you soon."

","Citizen Kane is revered as a cinematic masterpiece, it's been voted as the AFI'S #1 American Film of all time, Orson Welles has been called a genius. This stuff, we all know. However, I have heard and read SO MANY opinions about WHY this movie ISN'T great or even good. In fact I cringed as I read that some one called it ""sucky"". I think there is a lot about this picture that people need to realize in order to appreciate it a bit more. One of the great complaints about this film is that it's not entertaining, I think it is, but let's also remember that their is NO requirement for films to be entertaining (not everything must be a crowd-pleaser). The simple fact is, Orson Welles ushered along techniques in film that have set the tone for most filmmakers since (much like D.W. Griffith in 1915). But it's not just camera work. It's context as well. The way Kane's story is told. I'd be interested to know how many people that have said Citizen Kane was not good, that might agree that ""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the great movies of the past ten years. They are told with the same storytelling tools. Simply put, Welles did things that just weren't done prior to Kane. Not only that, but he based it on William Randolph Hearst. He took on the most powerful man in America of the time. And he fought to have it seen through even after Hearst threatened the entire Hollywood studio system. The greatness of this film is not only what is on the screen, but the story behind it as well. The truth is, Orson Welles was making an American classic when he was only 25 years old. What were the rest of us doing at 25?<br/><br/>If you're interested in the battle between Hearst and Welles for Citizen Kane, check out ""RKO 281""."

","'What was Citizen Kane about, Dad', I asked  my father, who was busily consuming his pasta at the dinner table.  'It was about showing that beyond all the Hollywood schmaltz, there were still people with production values', he replied.  I sat silent mystified, wondering why he hadn't just given me a straight answer, and then went off to watch this mystic 'masterpiece' of 1941.  An hour into the film, I began to understand what my father meant, for, watching you don't really see the story of a business tycoon, but more of the product made by a man with a vision. Orson Welles, as well as creating what was basically a new genre- a biopic, raised the bar of quality to new heights with this movie.  The variety of camera shot increased, the voiceover was created, and the idea of having character perspectives instead of just a straight story was finally created.<br/><br/>It isn't actually a very exciting movie on the surface, however.  The story does not have the zip of something like Raging Bull (the life of Boxer Jake La Motta), or of course, Schindler's list, which needs no introduction. Yet while 'Kane' is perhaps not the best Popcorn entertainment, it is essential viewing if you want to learn about the invention of modern cinema.<br/><br/>I love this not because it puts a smile on my face, but because gives me an extra perspective when I watch the movies of today.

"eibon09","Null","2","3","25 September 2000"," THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME!
","Citizen Kane(1941) has not only endured the test time but the early negative criticisms to become the #1 film in cinema history.  There are three things that make the movie enduring.  First, the complex nature of the title character.  Second, the amazing technical innovations that changed the face of cinema.  Third, the ability to make people from generation to generation give nothing but admiration for this classic.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane was not the first choice for Orson Welles.  He originally planned to do a film adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness that ended up falling through.  Before this film, Welles was known for his infamous broadcast of The War of the Worlds.  Orson Welles is one of the few artists to succeed in everly level of visual art and communications.  He was heavly influenced by John Ford which helped him in making Citizen Kane. Because of his anti Hollywood atittude, Welles like a few others would be beloved by members of the French New Wave during the late 1950's.<br/><br/>The film is slightly based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, although some portrayal of the older Kane seems to be based on Joe Kennedy, JFK's father.  Its about a man who goes from being an idealistic crusader to a bitter and corrupt old man.  An amazing fact is that Welles had absolute control in making Citizen Kane(a rarity then as in now).  The film's expressionistic look with the use of shadows and weird angles helped begin the era of Film Noir.  It was both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon(done by first timers John Huston & Orson Welles) that helped create one of the greatest periods in movie history.<br/><br/>The film begins with Kane's death as the story looks back at his life.  A reporter is assigned to discover the meaning of Kane's last word.  The first flashback shows Kane as a young boy and the event that would have an effect on him for the rest of his life.  It goes from his time with his caretaker to inheriting a fortune to opening a newspaper company.  The second flashback looks at the early and idealistic period of Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>The fourth flashback focuses on Charles Foster Kane's first marriage, his political ambition/disgrace, and his failed marriage.  This flashback also reveals the affair that ruined his political career and first marriage. The next flashback shows his second marriage with Susan Alexander as well as her opera career, firing of Jed Leland, and the construction of Xanadu.  The film climaxes with Kane's loniness and yearning to return to his days of innocence.  The reporter comes to the conclusion that there is no conclusion to the meaning of Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>There are four remarkable sequences in Citizen Kane.  One, the opening scene.  Two, the passage of time scene where the distance between Charles Kane and his wife widen.  Three, the opera scenes with Susan Alexander. Four, the closing scene.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane was co-written by Herman J. Mankiewich and Orson Welles.  The direction helps carry the story along.  William Randolph Hearst hatred the film and tried to have it destroyed.  It didn't help that Hollywood resented Welles for being a genius and an upstart.  Citizen Kane(1941) and The Trial(1963) were the only films in which Orson Welles had complete artistic control.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a great film that was cheated out of many Oscars including Best Picture.  The director had used the John Ford/John Wayne vehicle Stagecoach(1939) as an inspiration for his feature debut.  In fact, Welles had watched Stagecoach about forty times during the making of the film. The cast and crew were members of Welle's Mercury Theatre.  The insertion of Kane into footage with famous world leaders is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Orson Welles does a balancing act of being selfish and sympathetic.  Orson Succeed under the three hat role of director, writer, and producer. Joesph Cotten is super as Jed Leland in his portrayal of a hurt and betrayed man. The themes of friendship and betrayal would appear in films like The Third Man(1949), and Touch of Evil(1958).  An early cameo is made by Hollywood legend Alan Ladd.<br/><br/>The ten greatest films of all time are 1.Citizen Kane(1941), 2.The Wild Bunch(1969), 3.City Lights(1931), 4.Battleship Potemkin(1925), 5.Raging Bull(1980), 6.The Godfather(1972), 7.Vertigo(1958), 8.Eight & a Half(1963), 9.Seven Samurai(1954), and 10.The Searchers(1956).   Its fitting that the Film Noir period began with Citizen Kane in 1941 and ended with Touch of Evil in 1958.  The film editor was West Side Story director Robert Wise. Welles had hurt his hands during the filming of the destruction of his second wife's room.  The somber music was done by future Alfred Hitchcock collaborator, Bernard Hermann."

","This is rightly regard as one of, if not the, best film ever made.  After wanting to see Citizen Kane for a few years now, I finally did but one day ago.<br/><br/>What makes this film so good is that it is thoroughly enjoyable.  Why, you may well ask and how can a film that is essentially so actionless and talky be so enjoyable?  Well, let me tell you:<br/><br/>Welles gives one of the all time great performances in film as Charlie Kane, as he plays him right from the age of 25 up to his death many decades later. Welles, a man in his mid twenties at the time is believable and compelling to watch as his character progresses through the years, swinging from likeable rogue to controlling old man to the pitiful, unsatisfied man he was before his death.<br/><br/>The cinematography is truly astonishing.  This film may look like so many others now but that's only because it invented the techniques, still used in cinema today.  From the ground breaking miniature photography to the expert editing, this film is a beautiful sight to behold.<br/><br/>Finally, the wonderful structuring of the plot shines through as the film remains easy to watch as well as mentally stimulating throughout.  The end is  a true piece of perfect cinema history as we, the viewer, discover what rosebud was all along and how it plagued Kane's life so powerfully through the events of the movie.<br/><br/>In all, see this film and form you're own opinion about it because this is one of the most important movies there is, and you really should have seen it."

","Citizen Kane (CK) is considered the archetypal art film, even by many of its biggest fans.  But at the time it was made many of the ""arty"" techniques it employs so effortlessly were new and innovative uses of sound and high-tech visual effects.  What Orson Welles (the 25 year old boy genius who wrote, directed, and stars in the movie) achieved in CK was the realization of cinema as multi - media capable of imparting rapid cognition.  We do not actually meet protagonist Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles) until half an hour into the movie, yet by that time we pretty much know (one version) of his life story.<br/><br/>Every scene, every line of dialogue, contributes to the whole yet we are left pretty much at the beginning (despite the famous surprise end) when the movie ends.  But you have the sense of having been on a long insightful journey.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is almost 60 years old, yet is still considered one of the (if not the) greatest films ever made.  This reviewer scoffed at the idea at college and has searched for more perfect films but has to admit that it remains fresh and terrific.  Why?  Because, like good fiction, CK takes you into a world that is almost real and through a tale that spans the ages.  It is still a masterwork."

","While I haven't seen enough of the AFI's top 100 to agree or disagree with it's decision to call it the number 1 movie of all time, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>First, the screenplay was fabulous. Welles's and Mankewiecz's work is a wonderful depiction of a man abandoned at an early age who simply looks for love to fill a void in his life. To tie it all together using ""rosebud,"" a symbol of Kane's lost innocence, was absolutely brilliant. The script never lost me for a second and it kept me fascinated to see each facet of Kane's personality and psyche come out.<br/><br/>I would like to silence the naysayers who speak negatively about the acting by saying that Citizen Kane was the first movie ever done by the majority of the main characters, including Welles himself. While I do agree that the acting is not amazing, the script certainly makes up for it.<br/><br/>One characteristic of a great movie is the fact that it has done something that no movie has done before. With its cinematography, Citizen Kane has done just that. Toland's use of depth and shadows in the movie was revolutionary, and surprisingly effective. It is also interesting to note that in the movie, the more powerful characters, like Kane, look down on the camera, while the weaker ones, like Susan, look up towards it.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a fine movie that deserves all the critical acclaim and controversy it has received.

","There are many films that could justifiably be considered the best movie of all time. Arguments could be made for Casablanca, The Godfather, It's a Wonderful Life or many others. All have their strong points, but none combine excellent detail with innovative narrative, characterization and story line quite like Citizen Kane does.  <br/><br/>This film is a delight that has withstood the test of time. While not particularly emotionally engaging, Citizen Kane is very intellectually satisfying. The symbolism of the picture is not difficult to decipher, but the themes, ideas and content of the movie demand contemplation. It's hard to watch this picture without looking inward and asking questions like what really brings happiness? <br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane's life starts off promisingly enough. He creates a powerful media empire, but his idealistic enthusiasm soon gives way to cynicism and loneliness. Despite his power and his abundance of possessions, contentment eludes him. He doesn't realize what he is truly searching for until it is too late to recapture what he has lost. <br/><br/>Told in non-linear narrative, the viewer learns about Kane's life through a series of flashbacks that occur through the eyes of various characters. This is a brilliant picture that's worthy of multiple viewings."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","2","3","5 June 2000"," A vanguard motion picture
","Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether Citizen Kane' is the best film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful woman.  It depends on whom you ask.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane' is not the most entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a world where independents abound?<br/><br/>The story is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles. The fact that this film was released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D. Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled. All of Hearst's newspapers were forbidden to mention the film. <br/><br/>
Hollywood was uniformly against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be having this best film debate at all.<br/><br/>The story has a simple moral; that money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man, and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her newspaper.<br/><br/>What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having influenced them. The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much dramatic impact. What was unprecedented was that Citizen Kane' was the first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling their story about Kane. So the next time you see a flashback, remember it started here. <br/><br/>
The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.<br/><br/>If Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the equation.  People who watch this film and ask, `What's the big deal?' are comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to Kitty Hawk and saying, `What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few seconds.'<br/><br/>There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental importance. It is the consummate 10."

","What can one say that hasn't already been said about this movie?  It's brilliance is trumpeted by better than I for years before and to come.  And yet, here's my two cents. ""Citizen Kane"" is a perfect film.  There's amazing camera work and editing techniques (not the first to use them, but the first film to use all of them in one film to artistic success), fantastic acting (they are acting 'on the line' or 'in the moment', and they are not over-the-top as was common at the time), a terrific story (made all the better by it's factual basis), and characters are ones that we care about (ibid). The frame is filled with small details that add to the scenes. The language and vocabulary are ones that remind us of the beauty that English can achieve, calling up mental images that are left un-painted on the screen but burn brightly in our minds.  The lighting is evocative, but not overly moody.  In short, everything works. The message is one of simplicity (be a human first, a collector and achiever second), yet is subtly delivered that you could easily watch this movie for the characters, the story, the action, the dialogue, or whatever you wanted to. That is the genius of this film - there is something for everyone to love in it, and it does it so successfully that it's difficult imagining anyone walking out of the theatre saying 'I can make better films than that.'"

","OK - I have not lived.  I am now 22 years old, and yesterday I watched Citizen Kane for the first time.  My reward for the £2.50 video rental price?  A lesson in film-making excellence.<br/><br/>Orson Welles is considered by many to have been an outstanding figure in Cinema History.  I can't disagree.<br/><br/>From the beginning, a dark, brooding mood contradicts the beauty of the snow-scene and the majesty of Xanadu. From then on, the direction never fails to be anything less than clever. Kane's darker side is seen more than once, but is depicted especially well when his shadow engulfs Susan, his wife.<br/><br/>And engulf is what he does.  His need for acceptance and love is painfully clear, as is the realisation that he cannot give it.  Shaped by an unhappy, disfunctional childhood, the way he tries to demand love is by smothering the lives of the people closest to him.  He wants the love of 'the people' too, but succeeds only in generating as much hatred as he does admiration. And is it admiration, or pity?<br/><br/>In the trailer to the film, Orson Welles asks the audience to judge whether Kane is a hero or a scoundrel - or both.  I still can't decide.  Any film that answers a question so clearly and yet leaves it totally unanswered is worth it's salt.  Yet to still have a positive impact, 60 years later, on a generation content to feed on 'post-film sludge' - desensitised to Hollywood's insistence on 'spoon-feeding' -  simply demands acclaim.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that its my favourite film, but seeing it placed in virtually every Film Poll's Top 5 list, I now know exactly why.<br/><br/>Orson - you the man!"

I am for sure not the perfect expert on older films, esp. speaking film noir, but this has been a great start. The film feels incredibly modern (because it was the setting stone for many photography and direction techniques that are still used today). I enjoyed the slower paced scenes and the faster ones - so many elements are used well. How? If a narrative element (character blocking, lighting, camera (tracking) shots, use of depth of field, props, ... the list is endless!) is used in service to tell the story in the most intensive way, that sucks the viewer in... well, then - it is A VERY WELL DONE movie for me. Movies are pieces of art, they are not reality but heightened hyper-reality, compressed into a small frame with images and sound; a piece of art that tells a story we can connect to, in the most possible intense, compressed, concentrated way. For me, nearly every scene is virtuously done. I admire the dynamic use of the camera, the choreography of the actors, the light to create black and white compositions.<br/><br/>Everything is so complex and intense - as a set designer it was a pure delight to watch every scene! Not because the set itself was the most detailed, unique thing I have seen to this date, but it blends in with cinematography so well. Photography becomes part of the set and the other way around - through tracking shots over tables (which are moved and put back invisibly) to great compositions with everything in the very large depth of field being well placed and in focus (deep focus).<br/><br/>Also I was impressed of the many different worlds this film opened. From the hyper-gothic mansion where Kane died, to the news paper factories and bureaus to the various homes Kane lived in with his wives and the great opera house. Splendid, a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>I will watch all the other Orson Welles films right after to see how his style develops over time!"

","It's terrific! Everyone's STILL talking about it! ""CITIZEN KANE"" (1941, Welles) is about the life of fictional character Charles Foster Kane as a journalist attempts to discover the meaning of the man's last word, ""rosebud"", by interviewing everyone who knew him. But did anyone really know him?<br/><br/>I absolutely love this film. Why should I tell you why? You'll have heard it all before. I don't think this is the greatest film ever made and in that regard it's certainly overrated (and severely underrated as a result, by viewers left cold after the hype) but it's one of my favourite films because it makes me think.<br/><br/>******SPOILERS******<br/><br/>""CITIZEN KANE"" is by no means perfect. For example, old Jed telling the journalist things he wasn't privvy to in real life is a glaringly bad error- but I suppose that might have been done on purpose. Personally I don't think it was. And the brilliantly delivered line ""Let's all go to the window"" must be one of the most hilarious deliveries in cinema. And it makes me laugh!<br/><br/>The cast are acting. Really acting. They've got their characters and they perform. There's no upstaging, no one tries toobhard, it's acting pure and simple.<br/><br/>This ""ROSEBUD"" is the great mystery of the film. No one really knew Kane, he didn't even know himself, and everyone hopes that the meaning of his dying breath will reveal all about the man. Of course the true meaning of the word is never found outa by the journalist, but we see it as significant twice.
Often people say that Kane longed for his childhood, his life before he was given away to Thatcher and brought up to be the richest man alive, and after owning so much extravagance he simply longed for his old wooden sled. That may be true on his deathbed, but it also played an important role in his downfall as a man. On his way to see his childhood possessions and, we can be sure, his Rosebud sled, he meets a young lady who soon becomes his mistress. This leads to him not being elected governor, him losing his wife and son, him becoming a joke of a news man, and him suffering the awful turmoil of her leaving him in his old age and realising that money and possessions have gotten him nowhere slowly. The first time we hear him say ""Rosebud"" he is dying and sounds as though he longs for whatever it is (which we learn to be his childhood to put it simply). That second time we hear him say ""Rosebud"", after his second wife leaves him, he is vengeful and clearly blames it and the rest of his childhood for the way his life turned out. In a way the word does explain everything about the man, but only to us.<br/><br/>*SPOILER FREE*<br/><br/>It's a great film but don't take it so seriously. Enjoy it for the satirical character study and groundbreaking exercise in filmmaking that it is."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","1","1","10 January 2020"," Citizen Kane 79 years later hailed the best film ever made is worth seeing
","Take a look at Citizen Kane, the defined ""perfect"" film from director-actor-screenwriter Orson Welles.<br/><br/>The story follows the life (and death) of Charles Foster Kane, the eccentric owner of the New York Enquirer who is on a rise to power and wealth throughout the publishing industry , both of these which he achieves through aggressive means of ""cutting and slashing"" everyone who might get in his way. Kane dies at the start of the film and utters a single word at his deathbed: ""Rosebud"", and the majority of the film is one reporter's mission to find out the meaning of the word.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has a tenancy to submerge it's viewers in the midst of the reporter's mission and the flashbacks of Kane's life that it almost becomes easy to miss the film's deeper meaning, which is love and happiness. More specifically still and it's how Kane gains this notion of love and how he loses it. This could be personified in how he is taken away from his parents at a young age, effectively losing their love, or how he gains the love of his second wife Susan, but casts her aside when he wishes for her to continue her career as a singer and she isn't having any of it. Ultimately this idea of gaining love and then losing it is littered throughout the film, and it's this concept that secretly drives forward the narrative. Kane is constantly desperate for people to love him as much as he loves himself, and by trying to make people feel this way he instead alienates them and pushes them further away until he reaches his state at the end of the film, old, sad and alone.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is not just notable for it's character-oriented narrative, but also in the way of how the mise-en-scene is presented. Whether it's from the purpose of editing, such as the opening sequence of the show-reel of Kane's life which parodies The March of Time in style and execution. Or to the way in which Welles manipulates the lighting by blacking out certain characters in scenes, specifically the scene where Kane hits his wife Susan as here his shadow completely covers her suggesting that Kane is a gigantic, towering threat that she is unable to fight and that she is blind to the danger he poses to her. Furthermore it's emphasised how Welles has clearly spent a lot of time working the set design too, from the almost perfect reconstruction of the newspaper publishing rooms to Kane's Xanadu he has really put in the effort to sell the idea to the audience that this man, Kane is indeed a very important character and as such deserves to have everywhere he sets foot in to be presented exactly as himself - important.<br/><br/>The cinematography is too very notable and in particular is the film's use of deep focus photography, by which everything that is in the mise-en-scene remains perfectly in focus throughout the whole passage. This technique is demonstrated the most in a scene where Kane is in his mansion, and he moves over to a fireplace that is located in the foreground of shot and as he moves over to it only then is it's massive size revealed to all. This use of the deep focus photography demonstrates fully to the viewer of the extent of Kane's ""outsized"" riches, which somehow still aren't big enough to outshine his biggest prize, his own ego.<br/><br/>Welles didn't just direct the film, but he wrote the screenplay and most importantly by his fabulous portrayal of Kane himself. It's hard to imagine then that this is Welles' first time acting on-screen, as he perfectly captures the emotional feel of Kane as a man who has all the materialistic items in the world represented mainly by his wealth and mansion, but yet seems to lack simple human feelings that is picked up on by other characters throughout the course of the film. In a sense then, Kane is not considered to be a proper human being as the functions that are normally attributed to human beings are in this case not given to him. Welles himself has dabbled with acting before having dominated the world of theatre by starring in Voodoo Macbeth, a modern day re-working of the classic Scottish tale. He had also worked within the radio industry before, working with Mercury Theatre to create a radio drama version of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons, Citizen Kane is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time having been billed as such by the British Film Institute in their list, Sight and Sound for 50 straight years. At the end of the film the reporter that was tasked with finding out the meaning to Kane's last word doesn't actually find out the meaning, despite having talked to various people who were close to Kane in his final days. He and the other reporters take to burning Kane's belongings, which to them are worth nothing, and as the camera pans to the furnace a single item can be seen and on it is the word, ""Rosebud"". The item is a bobsleigh, one that was ridden by Kane as a young child of just 8 years of age in the scene where he is taken from his parents. The significance of the item is that this may well be Kane's only true happy memory of his life, specifically a memory before he was taken away from his parents. And that maybe, in that single moment, Charles Foster Kane felt something that he doesn't truly feel throughout the whole rest of the film. He is happy."

Its themes of power, corruption, narcissism and yellow journalism are as poignantly relevant today as they were when the film was made. With that being said, Orson Welles' masterpiece is not a perfect picture. The wooden acting has not aged well and as much as I tried to love this picture, I never could. For me it always feels a little bit cold and detached. And even though with each new viewing I gain more of an appreciation for the filmmaking process, the picture never fully comes alive and I am left with the feeling of watching something that is undoubtedly historically important, innovative, influential and thematically rich but does not give me the full cinematic experience that a great picture of its caliber should.

"sjake3470","8","1","1","21 April 2019"," A Revolution in filmmaking
","Citizen Kane was something completely new in the world of predictable films. Using unique camera angles and alternate lighting techniques, it is arguably one of the most influential films of all time. Despite the fact that Kane was one of the wealthiest and compelling men in New York City, he was definitely hopeless. This is an exemplary model of how cash cannot purchase happiness on the grounds that regardless of how much an individual reaches to obtain the things around him, it means nothing if he is not happy. Money gives people stability and extravagance, but this does not imply that the individual will be truly satisfied. Like Kane, in spite of his astounding wealth, he had always gotten more money, only to spend it negligently to suppress his inner sadness. At the end of the film, Kane loses everything, and his expression ""Rosebud"" is eventually uncovered towards the finish of the motion picture, symbolizing Kane's youth."
"andrewroy-04316","9","1","1","8 December 2018"," A wonderful, intelligent movie that is likely the most influential overall to cinema ever
","Going into watching Citizen Kane, I was apprehensive that the movie would be beyond me or, through my modern age goggles, I would fail to see any beauty and see just another boring, old movie. I'm glad that those concerns were silly, as the script and makeup hold up quite well today. This is an intellectual film that touches on many aspects of life, but at its core is a deep character study of Kane. The uses of multiple timelines and pairing the early montage with the deep development we get throughout was effective in giving the audience perspective on Kane. We see Kane's self-absorption and lack of empathy play out and devolve his life from one of ambition and enjoyment to, as he eventually has everything material he could want, a sad one where he struggles to find meaning. I thought the rosebud plot point and reveal at the end was absolutely brilliant and actually did live up to the hype it built all movie. In a life where Kane chased fame and the love of others while never really doing anything for others or holding any deeper values or desires, in his last moments he is brought back to that day where everything changed, where he was given all the money he could want and that power so young (along with being taken away from his parents and his casual, carefree playing). He remembers those fun, jovial childhood times with nostalgia, and Rosebud, the sled, is a representation of the undiluted happiness he lost when he received money and power. While there may have been times it didn't engage quite as much (the opera related scenes felt a bit drawn out), it is a great movie whose influence on the great movies that came after it is obvious. I'll have to let it sit in my mind a bit more before I finally decide on whether it's a 9 or 10 for me (I'm leaning 9 now because while it was wonderful and brilliant at many points, it wasn't quite that enjoyable throughout and isn't one I'd think of as one of my favorite or most engaged watching experiences. Its argument would be similar to that of 12 Years a Slave, which was a 10 because it's just such an important, brilliantly made and relevant movie. Between intelligence and influence, Citizen Kane definitely has a case). Either way, it's a great movie and one that actually deserves its regard as an all-time classic."

A great example of how the lighting is artfully done is how you never see the reporters face throughout the movie.

"GoldenBlunderbuss","10","1","1","25 July 2018"," Not a review, but why this film is so important
","Following the death of Charles Foster Kane, a wealthy newspaper magnate, his final word - 'Rosebud' - sparks a national hunt for its meaning.<br/><br/>
To explain why Citizen Kane is a great film is to articulate why you should never head-butt door-mounted coat hooks - it's something everyone already knows and doesn't need to be rammed into their brains any more. So, instead of a proper review, this is going to be some of the more unsung reasons why you need to watch it (if you haven't already) or rewatch it (if you have).<br/><br/>The story starts with the death of Kane and his last word, 'Rosebud', the origin of which we won't discover until the final shot of the film unless you're privy to one of the best-known cinematic reveals. The film then jumps between the present time to past moments in Kane's life via flashbacks as a character gives their story to the plot-framing journalist seeking answers. The way it hops all over the place might seem common to us now (even clichÃ©d with flashbacks) but at the time it would've been their equivalent of watching Christopher Nolan's Memento for the first time.<br/><br/>The use of highly contrasted areas of light and dark within single shots, coupled with especially high and low camera angles gives Welles the power to make Kane appear like a beloved god, a feared dictator or a pitiful loner. Citizen Kane was a decade ahead of the curve when it came to using more technical aspects of filmmaking such as these to tell the story rather than rely solely on script.<br/><br/>The make-up to age the 23-year-old Welles (for that is how old he was when he made this masterpiece!) was deemed by the man himself as the most important aspect to achieve the feel of a biographical film ... and boy did they deliver! It's never weird or obvious; just subtly adding crow's feet, removing hair or doubling chins.<br/><br/>It's likely to be one of the first films (after Gone with the Wind) to have a real 'whammy' ending where the audience is equally shocked, surprised and perhaps saddened by the outcome - it makes you rethink everything you've just seen and repaint Kane as a different man the next time you watch it knowing the ending. It's also one of those endings that you probably already know as it's the fourth most-spoiled film twists after 'I am your father!', 'You blew it up!' and Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>While watching it, you'd be forgiven to listing a half-dozen films which might be a better in each category of filmmaking but few are as well rounded to such a high degree as Citizen Kane is. Having (re)watched it with all of the above in mind, it'll be easier to appreciate why (even after 75 years) Citizen Kane is still rated one of the best films ever made - followed closely by The Room of course.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, that you don't look forward to being cured of."""

","This film is currently rated as being in the 600s of popularity among film viewers. This says quite a bit about the general illiteracy of the American filmgoer. This is easily one of the top ten films of all time; and without any possible contradiction, it certainly belongs in every critic's top 100 films. Any critic who doesn't have it in their top 100, would not be considered a real critic in my book. 
 Is it the best film of all time, as proposed by several critics? I don't think so, but it certainly is in that kind of company. The story of William Randolph Hearst (not Hurst, as one misinformed critic had written) is a tragedy on several levels. And yet, its life's illusions we all recall, we really don't know life at all (apologies to Joni Mitchell). The film is magnificently shot to perfection. Shots that had never been tried before on film were common in this one. 
 This unauthorized biography got Welles into a lot of hot water with Hearst, who tried to have the movie prevented from being completed or shown on several occasions. The dialogue is superb; the actors are letter-perfect, and the story is mesmerizing. What else could you want from a film?"

","I had very high hopes for Citizen Kane. First off, the cinematography was amazing. There was a consistent yet still complex way to how it was shot. For example, there were scenes where the opening would be a close up of someone's face while at the same time you could see another subject in the background, just as in focus as the main image. This opened a few scenes and was stylistically a great choice. 
The plot was great, I loved how detailed and complex it was. The flashbacks were done very well and did what they needed to do. They helped move the plot along but in an artistic and helpful way. The acting was great. The only thing I had a hard time with was the overall point of the film, but I can see why people liked it so much at the time. However, even given its historic/political tones, as a viewer I found it to be a very basic, white washed story. It looked great and was told well but meant nothing to me as a young person in 2018. I still appreciate it. The moral that you should savor life and that money doesn't buy happiness was my biggest take away."

So how about this: if you haven't seen it, go ahead and give it a shot, but don't make the same mistake I did and see it on a relatively small screen.

","It's hard to describe a film like Citizen Kane. It's equally as difficult to find another movie that has had such universal acclaim, and at the same time, as much scrutiny. For over 75 years Citizen Kane has reigned as possibly the greatest motion picture ever created. It was directed, produced, written and brought to life by cinemas enigmatic master, Orson Welles. When media mogul and American icon Charles Foster Kane, played by Welles, suddenly dies, the world wonders as to the meaning of his last spoken word 'rosebud'. Only one man could arouse so much mystery and intrigue around something seeming so trivial, and even in death, the most polarising and powerful man America has ever known, still has the masses wanting more.
The story of Citizen Kane is told to its viewers within the first 15 minutes, and the finer details are witnessed through flashbacks by the people who were closest to him. Kane is a selfish, vain and utterly ambitious man who looks to further his own social standing not only through his professional life but through his personal endeavour's also. We see Kane as an innocent young boy, unfazed by his controlled surroundings, to a dictator like leader in command of his own fateful future. This movie, through the passage of time, has been challenged by many other classics as worthy contenders as the greatest film of them all and it has seemed to hold up as well as its rivals. But Citizen Kane is a film that marches to the beat of its own drum, it's unparalleled in many aspects and is unlike any movie seen before or possibly since. Simply amazing."

But once you get up close to it, and see all the cracks and runs and patterns in the rock, then it becomes interesting.

With his film came the idea of a closed-in, lifelike room, rather than the tall, almost infinite ceilings that dominated before.<br/><br/>Kane introduced so many techniques that are still used today, dynamic shots being one of them. It isn't the fastest, the most gripping, the most heart-stopping (except for that one outstandingly sudden parrot), nor is it the most compelling. It's somewhat like a Doric column in this sense.

","I am getting tired of people complaining over and over again. Saying that ""Citizen Kane"" is just a good movie, but over rated because of the impact it made and the new technologies and the camera work and the non linear plot, Bla Bla Bla.
Well, of course ""Citizen Kane"" made one hell of an impact. In fact, it's still considered the best movie of all time (up there with 1972's The Godfather) and although it's not my favorite movie of all time (coming close to), calling it so is definitely justified. <br/><br/>Where do I begin? Yes. The camera work is ingenious. Do you really believe that this movie was shot around the 40's? The moving camera, use of so many different angles, positions, directions and the clever lighting make ""Citizen Kane"" not just unique, but also immortal. It is a brilliant, masterful achievement in all regards of filmmaking. It didn't only revolutionize modern films, it invented them in some way. The non linear plot and use of so many call backs is just fascinating to watch. <br/><br/>But here is my point. Everybody agrees that ""Citizen Kane"" is a technical milestone and masterpiece but there really is much more to it. 
The storytelling is excellent as well and the plot is exciting (yes!) and compelling, just because you really want to know what ""Rosebud"" means.
Like a puzzle (pun intended) the movie starts explaining the more you watch but it never fully ends with explaining the whole situation. Orson Welles delivery of the highly complex and deep ""Charles Foster Kane"" is excellent and who will ever forget the opening scene? After all, that's pretty much the most iconic shot in cinema history (up there with Bond.. James Bond from Dr. No).<br/><br/>*SPOILER*
In the end, we finally get the reveal of what ""Rosebud"" is; But not completely. We know now what Rosebud literally is, but not really what it means. The most obvious interpretation is that Rosebud describes the importance of a childhood. It's breathtaking how deep and inexorable a missing childhood was for Charles Foster Kane. Although he achieved everything a man could ever dream of, he never fully loved his life.

","Citizen Kane is acclaimed by most as the best American made movie of all time. This had my expectations quite high going into the film. The movie starts off really interesting as it appears you are just watching a news reel, which were commonly shown before movies in that time. The way the movie is made is just beautiful from the beautiful sets to the amazing camera-work. This film was honestly difficult for me to hold my attention at times, as to me the stakes were never that high. Even though i think the movie struggles from that it is still a fantastic movie, the ending was a surprise to me as I was clueless about what ""rosebud"" had meant until the big reveal"

","CITIZEN KANE is one of the most brilliant films ever made hands down. Everything about it from the carefully planned out camera work and beautiful shots taken to the clever use of lighting and miraculous acting especially by Orson Welles himself. A very fast paced film but with a fairly straightforward plot line I believe is what made this movie stand out so much. Most movies that work at such a pace are often extremely difficult to follow and have the viewer lost after the first hour, but with CITIZEN KANE it all flows seamlessly. The use of flash backs is also very well done here and it is one of my favorite things about the movie, especially when they're used at the right times and aren't to weird in some way. CITIZEN KANE will always be an example of one of the best films ever made and perhaps it really is THE best."

","Citizen Kane had always been a movie I've been excited to see. Numerous sources all my life cited this movie to me as the pinnacle of cinema, a shining jewel in the crown of the movie industry. After seeing it, I have started to learn why. Citizen Kane, after the initial viewing, struck me as an amazing movie, but one that was lacking of charm. It did everything right, but didn't do it in a way that stays with you. The camera-work is excellent, using different angles to influence your perception of different characters. The heavy use of lighting and shadow really brought the movie together, and the writing was especially impressive, after going back and reading about William Randolph Hearst. However, the movie does nothing to stand out, in my mind at least, which is when it struck me. This movie was the best movie of all time for a while,And movies today still use what it brought to the table. However, just as people cite Ocarina of Time as the best video game of all time, the world keeps spinning, and newer movies take what Citizen Kane did and improve upon it to make truly good movies."

Between the unique camera work and the way the story is told I am able to see why so many people love this movie. Today we are able to see this kind of camera work and this storytelling style in a few movies but I can't imagine going to the theater in 1941 and seeing all of this for the first time, it would be an amazing experience."

","Yes, I understand that this is America, and everyone is entitled  to their opinion, and many like to ""rate"" things, trying to figure out who is best, who is second best, etc... Well, yes Citizen Kane has been called #1 on many lists. However, these lists are made by professionals, and they look as much at technical issues as anything else. And they are just lists. Let me say it again, and this applies to everyone's lists, not just the critics' : they are just lists. The great directors, Welles included, do not (and did not) make films to beat out other directors on lists. This is not college football here. This is art. And, it is entertainment. The film has been around for 57 years, and every sort of person has seen it in every sort of way with many different intentions. Therefore, opinions will vary to such a degree that any sort of ""absolute"" ranking, comparing it to other films, should be looked at as mere fun, just something to give film lovers something to talk about. If you see this film and you love it, it may be because the plot intrigues you. It may be because you appreciate the innovation of the directing, or simply that you love old movies in black and white!

"JRofMich","Null","1","1","21 October 1998"," CITIZEN KANE MUST BE REMEMBERED IN PERSPECTIVE!
","The film was made in 1940 and released in 1941. This was before television... was a media, before jet planes were a mode of transportation. And the rocket ships described by Isaac Newton in the 1600s and Jules Verne in the 1800s were representred by Flash Grdon imitations.  Accurate workable rockets were not to be even built until the 1950s and finally the moon in 1969. Orsen Wells had exploded onto the scene with his ""War of the Worlds,"" Radio drama abut the invasion of Earth by the Martians in New Jersey.  So vivid was the drama, and captivating, so real, that thousands called in while the ""MercuryTheatre"" production was still being aired, attesting to the invasion as actual fact.  Thus when Orsen Wells followed that late 1930s production with ""Citizen Kane"" the expectation was great.  However the people (especailly in the mass media of radio and film) were expecting to see a great work.  Orsen Wells was skilled and produced a very professional and innovative work. However it is this writer's contention that the mood had been set for Wells not to fail.  No one was to truly criticise.  For as in the story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", a serious critic would have been seen as UNWISE, for not being able to see the fine quality of thread and workmanship. One must also consider and remember that Mr. Wells, himself, had a foreceful, compelling, overbearing and almost threatening persona with which to contend.  One should keep in mind both this setting and the person of Orsen Wells when one reviews the work in Citizen Kane. Would an unknown have been criticised for having actors out of the lighting??  And yet Wells is praised for it, as ""artwork.""<br/><br/>Perhaps if we look at the era and the man, we are now free to criticise and admit that, although a work of art, it was NOT the very best Hollywood ever produced. No, not even up to that time. That honor should have been a DeMille movie for the sheer grandeur. And if one is seeking a truly innovative director, why not Alfred Hitchcock of that same era (and beyond). Citizen Kane must be remembered in its narrow perspective.<br/><br/>The current generation of film makers received their education from men and women of that Kane era. They should pause, reflect and yes, even perhaps critisize the great Orsen Wells production of Citizen Kane. It is to be remembed in its perspective moment of history as either great or not.  But the best film ever???"

""Citizen Kane"" is my favorite film of all-time, in my opinion the best film ever made on this planet. But I didn't understand most of it the first time I saw it, and I found myself bored with the movie much of the time. When I rented it again over a year later, I ended up watching it four times in as many nights, each time gaining more insight, admiration and, yes, enjoyment. In all, I have watched ""Kane"" seven or eight times, and each viewing is more stimulating and fun than the last.<br/><br/>
One thing I have discovered about cinema is that the greatest movies are the ones which you don't understand completely or even at all the first time you see them. But there is something or some things in those films which you enjoy a great deal, things which lead you to give them another chance. ""Citizen Kane"" is a complex movie, in direction, storyline, characterization and symbolism. It's complexities also make it one of the most rewarding experiences known on celluloid.<br/><br/>
I know that dismissing those who have dispareged ""Kane"" as idiots would be counterproductive to getting them to see the film. Most (if not all) of them are not idiots and are in fact intelligent and perfectly capable of understanding and liking the film. To those people, I say give ""Citizen Kane"" another chance.

","CITIZEN KANE isn't a bad film, per se; it's quite watchable, with some engaging characters and a storyline that keeps you guessing. The mystery angle of the narrative is interesting enough to sustain the viewer's interest despite the relatively slow pacing. But after watching it, I was left thinking, ""Is that it?"" and ""What's all the fuss about?"".<br/><br/>It's a common problem when viewers are first exposed to movies regarded as classics by those who profess themselves to be in the know, and one I've experienced before. Because CITIZEN KANE doesn't anywhere near feel like it deserves its one-time reputation as the greatest film ever made. It's watchable, but it's not even a film I'd want to watch a second time, now I know what happens. I was looking for extra meaning, for something, but it all feels quite limited and even a little hollow.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' celebrated stylistic flourishes only really occur in the opening and closing parts of the movie, while the central part of the film is quite ordinary. It's good to see the reliable Joseph Cotten in a strong supporting role, but the female characters are overly given to histrionics and there just isn't enough depth for my liking.

","Citizen Kane is consistently in lists of the best movies of all time. After watching it several times, it's clear that this ranking is no longer deserved. Sure, Orson Welles was a great innovator, and, FOR THE ERA IT WAS MADE IN, Citizen Kane had groundbreaking cinematography. It is well-written, very well-acted. But the cinematography, which many reviewers here and elsewhere dwell on ad nauseum, looks contrived and amateurish by today's standards. A good example is the often described slow descent of the camera into the nightclub. What makes other movies true classics (Seven Samurai, The Third Man, Casablanca, etc.) is some combination of excellence in script, acting, cinematography, music; but the key is that that amalgam of features withstands the test of time. It is as engaging now as when it was made. If you are a film student interested in the history of film, by all means study this film.

","Citizen Kane is a great film—the greatest of all time. Not by a long shot. It's a fantastical ""boy's handbook"" on how to obtain power and influence people with an attendant cautionary voice preaching throughout that such a road often leads to an end of the line tragedy: a soulless, emotional void and the regret of love lost. The reductive moral in operation here being, guess what?! ""Money isn't everything."" The grand mystery of Kane's one word deathbed utterance of ""Rosebud,"" is the great man's heart-rending memory of a sled he cherished during his poor rural boyhood. <br/><br/>The characters in this film are nothing more than paper cut-out stereotypes: the driven entrepreneur and policy maker, the blue blood, society wife, the low class blonde floozy. Joseph Cotton as Jedediah Leland, Kane's long time friend/nemesis, is the stand in for Kane's unrealized alter ego and conscience. A maudlin Victorian sentimentality keynotes the entire saga.<br/><br/>The storyline purportedly is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst and plot elements can certainly be linked to Hearst. Hearst reportedly reviled Welles' pictorialization of him as public and private man. It has recently come to light that Hearst's wrath had a much more tantalizing and intimate genesis. ""Rosebud,"" some sources claim was Heart's affectionate reference to the genitalia of his longtime mistress, Marion Davies and this appellation was known only to Hollywood insiders and Hearst and Davies alone. Welles had the audacity to undress this secret before the world and Hearst was furious at Welles' prank. ""Rosebud,"" over time has indeed become an esoteric buzzword. <br/><br/>Welles, it can be said, was a man with a determined vision, one that would not be contradicted or subject to compromise or concession. While this tenacity served him admirably, gifting him with a cinematic eye that enabled him to engender his films with creative lighting and camera angles, his talent for storytelling was compromised by an antique, naive worldview so blatant here in Citizen Kane. Orson Welles was a much better actor than filmmaker as his performances in ""The Third Man,"" ""The Stranger,"" and ""Touch of Evil"" bears out. <br/><br/>Orson Welles' greatest creation was the legend of his own genius."

One does not feel for the central character or any of the characters, in fact. The closest it comes to the portrayal of a human connection is when Kane fires his college chum from one of his newspapers. And there it ends. Even when Kane dies, we cannot feel anything for this man. And the biggest gimmick of all contrived by Wells was the ""rosebud"" mystery. According to Gore Vidal, Hearst referred to Davies most private part with this term. How can the viewer connect emotionally to this gimmick, more appropriate for a hoochie-coochie carnival act than a work of art.<br/><br/>Too stylized, too detached, too contrived, too gimmicky leaves the viewer unable to suspend disbelief and experience the reality of the story.

Overall, it's a great film and certainly worth seeing. But at the same time, it's not for everybody. I think a film for everybody must be action packed, but at the same time slowly paced.

","Warning: spoilers<br/><br/>The first time I watched _Citizen Kane_, the movie seemed to aim for psychological depth in its treatment of Kane, but several of the supporting characters were exaggeratedly silly in a way now appropriate for a TV sitcom. The apparent inconsistencies resolve when one realizes that _Kane_, of course, is a hit job on William Randolph Hearst, and that the depiction of Hearst and his lover are as over the top as the actions of the lesser characters. <br/><br/>Heart's sin, apparently, was being an unrepentant capitalist and occupying media space that Welles thought would be better allocated to progressive voices. Whatever Welles' motivation, he was willing to trash anyone to get to his target. Hearst's lover, Marion Davies, was starring in films before she met Hearst. I suppose Davies' only sin was being near Hearst, but Welles turns her into a talentless vacuum to accentuate Kane's utter narcissism. The documentary _Movie Moguls_ claims that 'Rosebud' was Hearst's pet name for Marion's private part. This would explain why Rosebud appears in the movie as a sled, something for Kane to ride. It also puts a different slant on the final scene, where Rosebud is committed to the flames.<br/><br/>Welles gave his cinematographer the freedom to revive the expressionist lighting of the more experimental films of the silent era. This gives the visual aspects of _Kane_ a powerful role in presenting the film's themes. How to light a film isn't the big lesson from _Kane_. Orson Welles was freezing, personalizing and polarizing his target long before Saul Alinsky. _Citizen Kane_ showed filmmakers how to go for the jugular."
"ninjacatcyrus","3","4","9","24 May 2010"," Why I don't like this movie.
","This movie is critically acclaimed as the greatest movie of all time. In addition to critical opinions, it is ranked 33 in the top 250. I went into this film, fully expecting to be blown away by the acting, plot, storytelling, and music. I was none of these things. I have no complaints with the acting, and the story is told effectively through the use of flashback.<br/><br/>The music is for the most part not bad, although it does not set the mood as effectively as the works of John Williams or Bernard Herrmann (Alfred Hitchcock), nor is it integral to the movie like the works of Danny Elfman (Tim Burton) or Enrico Morricone (Sergio Leone). One song in the middle of the film is supposed to be a composition written for Welles' character, and it is atrocious. I won't criticize the operatic parts, as they are intentionally sub par. All in all, the music is unremarkable.<br/><br/>Where this movie really fails is the plot. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Many movies, such as ""12 Angry Men,"" contain no action, yet rank among the greatest and most captivating movies ever made. This movie is not one of them. The plot drags at a snails pace, and not very interesting in the first place. A few things are well done, such as the slow reveal of Kane's first relationship, and the twist at the end with Rosebud is impressive, but hardly enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>Many people call Citizen Kane timeless. I disagree. While the media still exercises considerable power today, the very way we access information has changed in the digital age. However, the death of newspapers does not kill this movie, as by that logic, any period piece would bore audiences. What kills this movie is how boring the plot is. I found myself not caring about 20 minutes into the movie. By the end of the movie, I cared even less. This movie is terrible, and though I speak against the widely accepted critical opinion of it, I am not afraid to say it because I truly believe that this movie ranks with the worst of them. I would rather watch Manos the Hands of Fate, because at least with that movie I can laugh at how bad it is. With Citizen Kane I can only cry."

I have also heard that CK is one of the greatest movies of all time if not the greatest. However, after watching it I'm shocked to find that I was not as moved or touched or enlightened as I thought I'd be. I was expecting more of a deep emotional movie that would leave me with a feeling of wow such as Schindler's list. I feel that Woody Allen has written good stuff that has more general human relating qualities than CK.

The story is far from compelling and I never felt involved in the character's tale. The use of flashbacks doesn't paint a very interesting or complete picture of Kane, as there is far too much devoted to overlong anecdotes and not enough to the overall story. The Rosebud twist is a nice way to end the film, but I can't judge how surprising or shocking it was, as I had been spoiled long ago. Oh, and way too long, even at only two hours. It just drags on and on. I can see why it's a technical masterpiece, but other that that, it's nothing special."

I know that for its time it was technically brilliant and well ahead of its time. But I can think of other much better films from the 40s and earlier. To Kill A Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Night of the Hunter? This will probably get remade one day, and no doubt ruined. Bizarely enough, the welles character kind of reminds me of Michael Jackson.

"CyndiReynolds4","6","4","9","17 November 2003"," Though it was one of the greatest movies of all time I didn't find it so interesting
","According to many this is the best motion picture made.  Staring Orson Welles who also directed and wrote the story.  This is pretty incredible considering that he had never even set foot on a stage before. I guess you could say that he is a genius at that.  This interesting story takes on from the beginning. With its incredible lighting and shading techniques and the great way the beginning of the film fades from one photographic shot to another, as if each picture was blending into each other, this film was surely ahead of its time. `Citizen Kane' also introduced, to its audience, how much of an effect wealth can have over idealism.  The narrative techniques add a great deal to the film, it laid out the films setting for you.<br/><br/>The camera starts at a fence with a sign that states no trespassing, then slowly fades into a barbed- wire fence, and lastly to an iron fence with iron flowers.  Kane's estate, Xavier, stands upon its man made hill surrounded by its lush landscape and a zoo as big as Noah's Arc.  The camera, disobeying the sign, creeps past the castles gates and into the yard showing incredible shots of the surroundings of the castle.  Each photograph fades into one another bringing you closer to the castle.<br/><br/> Suddenly the camera reaches a window with the light on that gets turned off.  The shot fades to a hand holding small snow globe, unexpectedly the man whispers `rosebud' the snow globe drops and pieces of glass and water fly everywhere.  Later a woman covers the mans body as if he had died.  This first scene sets the rest of movie.  It shows what a powerful man Kane was. Across the world newspapers and radios were reporting this mans sudden death.<br/><br/>Although Welles work was great, along with most films, it had its side of controversy.  `Citizen Kane' was a movie strangely parallel to William Randolph Hearst's life.  Hearst was known for his great writing on the Spanish-American war.  His type of journalism was known as yellow journalism.  Hearst felt the film was a plagiarism of his own career and wanted RKO to burn every copy and negatives they have of `Citizen Kane.'<br/><br/> Orson Welles starred in, wrote, and directed `Citizen Kane.'  Though he never made a movie or starred in one, he was commended for his outstanding work.  He added much power and brilliance in this movie, which caused much controversy.   Though the film in its time was great and still today rated as one of the greatest movies of all time.  This reviewer gives it a six out of ten, just because it seemed like the greatest part of the movie was its cinematography.  I didn't find the movie line very interesting, but if you're an old film loving kind of person, this might be the movie for you."
"jasmanius","7","4","9","6 January 2000"," no match to Casablanca
","A few weeks ago I was in the position to see Casablanca and Citizen Kane in the same week, after not having seen them for a long time. I came to the conclusion that Casablanca was still a great movie, and that CK was not that good after all. It's actually very boring and slow. The acting is, except for the last part, not convincing and at times really outdated. The film-techniques that are supposed to be that great, didn't help the story at all, and that should be the main purpose of any technique. My conclusion is that CK is still a hype, and it doesn't deserve to be one. Maybe it's worth the 250th place in the poll, just for the supposed historic importance (which I don't get, but I give the 'learned' some credit)."

There are some great scenes. Professional all around, everything from story, dialogue, acting, cinematography, editing, music, etc. <br/><br/>A special note on the cinematography. Although it is professional and inventive, I did not care for it. It is too all over the place. I like camera work where you don't notice the technique. This camera work, you definitely notice. <br/><br/>One of the best scenes is towards the end when Orson Welles destroys his wife's room. Great stuff. If they had a TV set that would have crashed through the window and out to the swimming pool. Think drunken rock and roll band.

"Atreyu_II","6","3","6","10 April 2010"," This is considered one of the best movies ever?
","'Citizen Kane' is often regarded as one of the all time greatest films. But is it all that great? Of course, that is very subjective, but for me the answer is no. Considering all the hype around this movie, I expected something far better. That said, the movie isn't bad and it's an important film. Directed by and starring Orson Welles as the title character (a wealthy newspaper publisher whose life is the subject of the motion picture), it is a movie with many innovations.<br/><br/>For example, Orson Welles (who was an unproved director at the time) was given the choice to develop his own story, select his own cast/crew and was given final cut privilege. The screenplay, however, was developed with the help of Herman Mankiewicz. <br/><br/>This film created a new style of film-making by studying various forms of movie making and combining them all into one. The advanced cinematography is notorious in many levels: the extended use of deep focus, the peculiar way how low-angle shots were made, the use of an optical printer whenever a deep focus was not possible, the special effects, the nice scenarios, the in-camera effects and flashbacks, etc. Even the ending is different compared with other films. Ya see, after the words ""The End"", the following text appears: «Most of the principal actors in ""CITIZEN KANE"" are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them».<br/><br/>The plot is a ""roman à clef"" that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane. It starts with this death, which causes great impact around the world. Kane's story is narrated principally through numerous flashbacks, from his childhood in poverty until adulthood (with money and power, as well as all the negative consequences it carries). <br/><br/>The Xanadu estate is fictional, but in real life a city named Xanadu exists. The cast is interesting. Orson Welles is great as Charles Foster Kane, Buddy Swan as Kane when he was 8 years old and Paul Stewart as Raymond. It was nice to see Paul Stewart in this, too bad that only happens in the final part of the movie. Paul Stewart starred some years later in 'The Window' as the character Joe Kellerson. <br/><br/>I think that this movie starts off interesting but then it becomes boring and loses its interest. There were also things I didn't properly understand, such as all the ""Rosebud"" talking.<br/><br/>To conclude my review, I liked the cinematography but the plot and the movie itself were not quite what I expected."
"Ziya90","6","3","6","4 January 2010"," It is not the ninth wonder of the world
","Citizen Kane is in all the lists of the bests, according to many critics and audiences also, it is the greatest film of all time, because probably, technically or in other words, in terms of direction, it progressed cinema. However, I believe that it should be evaluated as a film, I mean above style, content and story. Citizen Kane is a good classic, yes its direction was beyond its time by far, but nothing more. It is an interesting biography of a newspaper businessman, an interesting work, but nothing more. And as I see, critics love this film more than us, because as said, they try to evaluate it in a objective way, it promoted cinema, so a masterpiece. Orson Welles's not only Citizen Kane was beyond its time, there are some other examples, especially, the story editing of Kane is beyond its time, brilliant (the story telling method used in the movie is not similar with any movie you have ever seen, from a picture projector, Kane's life is summarized!), but generally, as a film, it is just good, a plain movie. By the way, the people who see it the greatest don't explain why it is the greatest. Because, they cannot find any reason? The film is stylish visually and in contrast with a lot of people, I forget rosebud completely while watching the movie, because it swept me away. It is not the ninth wonder of the world. The eight wonder of the world was King Kong movie and almost it was in adventure genre. I am very happy that this is not 1st in IMDb Top 250."

","I would recommend getting the anniversary addition DVD and listening to the commentary and special features to those who didn't appreciate the movie. For its time it was a front runner. The 'star wars' of its day. As far as special effects and camera effects. Its hard to see all the innovation watching it today, because a lot of the innovations used in this movie are standard today. Welles is a genius, and was a stubborn genius at that. When they told him it couldn't be done he said 'watch me' and he did it. This movie is proof of that. I appreciated the movie and knew of some of the amazing things done for the first time in the movie, but when I watched the commentary, there was so much more that I was unaware of, I had a new found respect for the film and for the determination of the man behind it, who wouldn't compromise his vision."

","""...if I hadn't been really rich, I might've been a really great man."" - Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>I think that pretty much sums up Rosebud, at least to me.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing in the movie, apart from the story is at the beginning when Kane enters the Inquirer for the first time, Jedediah twirls around one of the office pillars. When the newspaper takes off, their celebration includes Kane, along with about a dozen dancing girls, doing the exact same thing. It could be nothing, but the reason I noticed it was because it seemed kind of odd the way Jed did it. He moves past the pillar, then goes back and spins around it. Strange... There is no denying, however, Welles' genius, A great film, deserving of it's No.1 of all time status."
"christina_fan2k1","9","3","6","15 June 2005"," Here goes! Read it please....
","So, here goes. While I'm only 16, I've of course heard about Citizen Kane. I honestly don't know that much of the back story. William Randolph Hearst sounds foreign and I can honestly say that I know nothing about Orson Welles. All I knew about Citizen is that it is widely considered the ""greatest"" film ever made.<br/><br/>When I saw that it was playing on TMC (one of my favorite channels), I figured that I should watch it to see what all the hype was about. I often watch black and white movie because I'm entranced by the stars, but the movies themselves often leave a lot to be desired. The timing, the pace, that corny music that always punctuates every important scene, it all detracts from the quality and value of the movie. The plot itself is often eclipsed by the mystique, the intensity of it's stars.<br/><br/>But this movie was different. I know some things about the technical aspects of film and theatre, and I can honestly say that simple things such as the lighting were arresting. When Suzanne kneels on the floor and Charles walks near her demanding that she continue singing, my heart tightened. Just that one shadow affected me more than anything has in awhile.<br/><br/>Now I understand the attraction of Citizen Kane. For once, while watching a movie, I felt suspense. Not the odd, manufactured suspense that movies today FORCE you to feel, but real suspense. Who or what was Rosebud and what did it mean to this man? I had to watch until the end (which is rare for me, I usually flip channels after 30 or so minutes). I had to see the final culmination of this man's life.<br/><br/>And whether it's 1941 or 2005, that drama and suspense is what truly matters in a film."

I recommend it. But you will understand it more if you are 13 or older cause sometimes it can be a little strange or a little complicated for young people.

"cpieper23","Null","3","6","3 December 2004"," More to Citizen Kane than meets the eye...yet more direct than the modern crap covering screens
","Citizen Kane was one of the first movies to portray the American Dream as anything less than attractive. As a child, Kane is fully happy as he plays in the snow outside the family's home, even though his parents own a boarding house and are quite poor. He has no playmates but is content to be alone because peace and security are just inside the house's walls. When Thatcher removes Kane from this place, he's given what seems like the American dreamâ'financial affluence and material luxury. To most this would seem to be a piece of Heaven blessing them with good fortune for a happy life. However, Kane finds that those things don't make him pleased, and the exchange of emotional security for financial security is ultimately unfulfilling. The American dream is an empty, hollow shell for Kane. As an adult, Kane uses his money and power not to build his own happiness but to either buy love or make others as miserable as he is. When one watches the movie it seems that his purchasing of the newspaper was a fun venture. But if you look closer into the reality of the film, the newspaper was simply a means of touching thousands of people, and ultimately gaining their affection. Kane's wealth isolates him from others throughout the years, and his life ends in loneliness at Xanadu. He dies surrounded only by his possessions, poor substitutions for true companions. His last word is ""Rosebud."" Child hood and that which he missed out on. ""I could have been great man without all of this money."""
"stardust106","Null","3","6","17 November 2003"," alright movie
","Citizen Kane is considered by most to be the best motion picture ever made, for those who see it, it still inspires awe.  If the people who believe this are talking about the spectacular views and innovative camera angles, then yes, I agree, but otherwise, I could have done without seeing this movie.<br/><br/> The simple plot line consists of a man on his deathbed, his final word, Rosebud. This man, Charles Foster Kane was a huge newspaper tycoon, who everyone either loved or hated.  As a memorial to him, a mini-motion picture is made depicting his life, but it is missing something.  The creators decide to throw in his final word, telling the audience what it meant.  Only problem is, as they talk to everyone who was ever close to Kane, his manager, Mr. Bernstien (Everett Sloane), his friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and his second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), no one can help, no one knows what or who Rosebud is. Eventually the audience finds out, but the characters in the movie never do.<br/><br/> Like I said, this is an excellent movie if you are talking about how Orson Welles filmed it.  He used new ways of getting a shot, like in the beginning of the movie where the audience sees the nurse come in to Kane's bedroom threw the shards of broken glass on the floor.  Or when light in Kane's bedroom is on, and then when he dies it fades out.  A really good technique Welles uses while filming was zooming in and out.  A great example of this is at the beginning of the movie when the camera is on the NO TRESPASSING sign on the front gate of Xanadu, after you see that shot, Orson zooms into everything on the grounds, then finally up to Kane's bedroom.<br/><br/> Kudos to Orson Welles.  Not only did he star in `Citizen Kane,' but he also produced, directed, and helped write the screenplay.  Unfortunately, that's where all the compliments stop and the criticism begins.  Like the acting, everyone, for the most part, played his or her roles very casually.  It didn't seem like there was too much emotion going on in any one role.  When emotion did surface, it felt overdone and over exaggerated, like when Mrs. Susan Alexander Kane is yelling at her husband, her voice is too shrill for my ears and made me want to stop listening.<br/><br/> If you were looking for a movie that has a lot of emotional value, `Citizen Kane,' would not be it.  However, if you were looking for a movie that is ahead of its time visually, you would be pleased as to what you would find in `Citizen Kane.'  All in all I would give this movie 6 out of 10 stars based only on Orson Welles excellent camera techniques."

My least favorite of his films is ""Citizen Kane"", a veritable compendium of everything that should be avoided in films: time spans that are too long, villainous heroes, insufferable pretentiousness and gross overreaching. This film unintentionally glorifies Hearst. He did not merit such a hatchet job. It honors him by implying there is complexity in the man.

","Who hasn't heard Kane hailed as the 'greatest film ever made'??  Having heard this 1,000 times, I watched Kane with high expectations.  All I saw was average character and plot development covered up by above average (pretty excellent, actually) cinematography (which, let's admit, is fairly dated by today's standards).  Yes, it was a ground breaking movie.  Yes, it inspired filmmakers all over the planet.  Yes, it changed the industry. Even admitting all this, I still feel that Kane is over-rated.  There have been much greater films made in recent times.  To call Kane the 'best film ever' is to do so for nostalgic reasons and to ignore that better films have come along since.  I can't pick 'the best film ever made' but I can list some that are better than Citizen Kane.  How about The Godfather, Schindler's List, Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, or even American Beauty? These could all out shine Citizen Kane any day."

"rudolftange","4","3","7","15 September 2016"," surprised and disappointed
","If you consider just the content, then all this movie does is make the following point: Charles Foster Kane wanted to be big and important to all American people, however he had nothing to give, he just had a lot of money. I should rather say that the movie hammers this point home, since the above point is stated explicitly by Kane's best friend and by his second wife (and probably one other person, I didn't want to take the time to check). Just in case you wouldn't get the message.<br/><br/>This movie is in my opinion crude and simplistic. We are dragged through the life of Kane at high speed. The movie doesn't flow naturally, there is no real development. It feels like nothing happens, you just get a single idea pushed down your throat. Throughout the movie there is the same atmosphere of doom and of emptiness. Even as a young man Kane is not an idealist. None of the characters is given any depth, there is no one you can identify yourself with or sympathise with.<br/><br/>The only quality of the movie lies in the camera work, the tricks with the lighting and the music. This should make it interesting for movie directors and people interested in the technical side of film making. I suppose it's is interesting to see how Welles manages to create a certain atmosphere in this way, but since it is always the same atmosphere, this is in my opinion rather limited.<br/><br/>I cannot possibly understand why this is considered the best movie ever made. The only (unsatisfactory) possible explanation I could come up with was: a) The average person is far more visual than me, or easier satisfied with single impressions, b) People like to parrot the ""experts""."
"scottemery","7","3","7","2 May 2012"," Citizen Kane - Not the Greatest Film Ever Made
","Citizen Kane has been labelled as one of the greatest movies ever made. The story of a newspaper tycoons life and how a reporter try's to find the meaning of his last word. Directed and starring Orson Welles.<br/><br/>It pains me to say it but I found this film disappointing. I tried to go through my mind after the film searching for why I didn't enjoy it and I considered that maybe it was because of the age of the film, but then I remembered that there were many films from this era that I loved so that didn't stick. The only thing I could say is that maybe it was because it was literally the first big film after the new era of sound and at its time was considered groundbreaking while now it seems tepid. Even this reason doesn't really feel right with me and honestly I think it's down to the following reasons why I truly found this film a let down.<br/><br/>The biggest hit to this film for me is the acting, it mentions at the credits that this film gave a first break for some of the actors and it really does show. Firstly though Welles acts his role perfectly as the love starved Kane, perfectly finding his electricity and his need for people to love him. Other than Cotton (perhaps the lead female deserves credit) I found the supporting cast poor in general but this is really to be expected as looking back to most pre 1960 film there are not normally more than two good actors in a film. This does not sound like much of bad point but I coming to why the acting in this film ruins it for me. There is one pivotal scene in the movie, the scene where the child is taken away towards the start. This scene was supposed to show the child's carefree nature and then how this is ripped from him by the corporation coming in and removing him from his family. The scene annoys me, the child actor does not portray the feeling of this emotion correctly and you watch feeling like it could of been done so much better and without this scene being done properly the metaphor for the film is lost. Now you may say this is harsh on the child actor but the people who made this film should have seen this and either re-shot with a different actor or thought of a different idea on how to work the loss felt by the child into the film.<br/><br/>My second criticism of the film is partly to do with the way it is filmed, splicing different segments of his life story in different order due to them being told by different people. While I must firstly say this sort of thing in 1941 is groundbreaking and perhaps the fact that they even attempted it shows my following to be a moot point, but I still wouldn't expect this from the ""Greatest Film Ever Made"". Because of this way of film making the scenes with Kane himself are short and sharp, showing change in character very quickly, see scene with his first wife having dinner, this doesn't allow a true character arc. With more time spent in each scene perhaps a feel for the character or an understanding of why he changes could be seen. Also I would of preferred the film to have been perhaps 30 minutes longer to allow for more of Kane's character to be seen with perhaps some delving into his childhood or more of why he no longer ran the paper.<br/><br/>I would like to make clear that while I did not completely love this film it must be seen as a groundbreaking film for its time and at the time, the best film ever made. It's use of camera angles and focus is far beyond anything seen in that age with some absolutely amazing cinematography. Two scenes stick out for me, but it must be said that there are many scenes throughout the film which look fantastic. Firstly where Kane is finishing Leland's review of his wife's performance and Leland slowly walks towards him from the distance showing Kane's madness and Leland trepidation of approaching him in one perfect shot. Secondly a scene where Kane signs away his newspaper shows Kane becoming smaller as he walks towards the window and then underneath it. It shows to our perception that the window is bigger than we think and that Kane himself has shrunk in stature.<br/><br/>Lastly I would just like to add that after reading the film I read several posts on this films wall wondering why more was not said about Charlie's son. The people on the boards point to it as a flaw in the film while I claim it to be probably it's biggest success. The lack of attention to the child by Kane and the film overall(more so as a metaphor in terms of the film) is down to Kane's own loss of childhood. Being taken from his family and forced to grow too quickly causes Charles Kane to becoming a wreck, a man who will do anything to be loved. He buys possessions and creates a temple, he tries so hard to help the working man by promising to remove corruption and bring truth, he does anything for his wives but in the end does not listen to them thinking only selfishly. All of these thing's he does for love and attention but in the end the loss of his family and childhood leaves a gaping hole in a young Charlie and though he tries to fill this void he cannot, showing the true meaning of this film, and of of ""rosebud"", money cannot buy you happiness. 7/10"

But I do not feel the solution to the ""mystery"" in question is very satisfying, nor does it make any sense with the rest of the picture. So, Kane turned into a terrible newspaper tyrant because he lost his precious sled when he was a child?? BIG DEAL. Obviously, all its innovations in the making of films are very nice, and film students should be required to watch. But the story is its weakness because it leads you to believe that there will be some great revelation about the meaning of Rosebud, and there's not. Look at The Usual Suspects for a film with a satisfying ending. Each film focuses on a question, Kane just never finds the right answer. It's not really a 1/10, but it angers me that critics call this film the greatest of all-time. Not even close folks, not even close."

So as the king paraded by everyone commented on how lovely the king's new clothes were though they could see nothing. Finally, a child pointed to the king and said ...""But he has no clothes, he's naked!"" ... and everyone understood that they were not dishonest people but that the king was a dunce.<br/><br/>That's exactly how I feel about this movie.

","I saw Citizen Kane (CK)  some years ago, but the sense of deep dissappointment still lingers on.<br/><br/>Some points.<br/><br/>1. The storyline in CK: Inching ahead, tiresome, drawn-out, and at some points directly boring. Other movies from this era (and other eras) are far better. When ""Rosebud"" is mentioned the umpteenth time, I lost all interest - simply too thin a plot for my likings. This doesn't have something to do with the age of the movie or that is it black/white, simply my opinion about the story.<br/><br/>2. CK as a portrait of the archetypical ""Great man, who ultimately fails"".<br/><br/>This is done a lot better elsewhere. Need I mention Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. Doughboy in ""Boys in the Hood"" also makes for a far better and more believable ""Great man, who fails at the personal/relational level"" as well. Of course, I realize that CK came before these movies, but that doesn't quite make up for all of it. I simply don't find CK believable or interesting as a character.<br/><br/>Some of my disappointment possibly stems from all the ""hype"" CK has received thru the times, but not all of it. Usually I tend to like what serious critics acclaim as ""great movies"", but this time I found myself completely at odds with the moviewatcher ""establishment"".<br/><br/>3/10"

","Citizen Kane, created by a twenty-six-year-old Orson Welles, is one of the most durable and praiseworthy films in the history of the medium.  And quite rightfully so.  With its incredible deep-focus photography, fractured narrative, fluid camerawork, and many other superlative aspects of filmmaking, Citizen Kane moved both the industry and the art form into previously uncharted territory.  A colossal achievement, the film richly deserves its place among the most revered and respected works of cinema.  In much of the critical writing on Kane, Welles often receives the lion's share of credit, but I cannot imagine the film without the contributions of Toland, Mankiewicz, Herrmann, Cotten, Sloane, and so on.  Even after multiple viewings, it is easy to discover new, previously overlooked details that are completely astonishing."

"shatteredstairs","10","2","4","6 November 2018"," My Own View
","What hasn't been said about ""Citizen Kane""? Well, not much, so this is just my take on the film. Personally, this film is one of my top ten favorites. However, I do find it to be quite overrated. Sure, I gave it a ten, but that's because it's a film I really love. At the same time, it is quite boring and lacks a transcendent statement and emotional output. I don't think any film deserves to be called the greatest, and if there was, it certainly wouldn't be ""Citizen Kane."" To me, this is just a film about the self-destruction of a man. There's nothing new or even that interesting about it. I agree with Ingmar Bergman that this film is indeed a total bore. So, why is it one of my favorite films? Why do I enjoy it? Mainly because of the way the film works. The way the narrative is told from the perspective of others isn't new, but was innovative for the time, and I think that's the key: it was innovative for its time. It was innovative when it was released, but it definitely fails the test of time when compared to other contemporary works like ""Casablanca."" You may think that I dislike ""Citizen Kane"" more than I enjoy it, but this isn't so. This is a beautifully shot film, there's no denying that. One of my favorite things about the film is the idea of Rosebud and what it represents. I find it moving that Kane's final word refers to his sled, and he remembers the last time he was truly happy as he dies. (I don't judge a film on what is absent, though I will say that I think the film would've been much more compelling had Welles shown the audience Kane's misery and homesickness during his time with Thatcher.) It's easy to feel sorry for Charles, but difficult to be invested in his character and care about him. I can only feel a bit of sadness for Kane. He's not a relatable character or even one you can really root for, but he is an enigmatic one. This is the sort of film where you see how someone can go from bad to worse and never get better. It's depressing, and not in a good way. It may even leave a bad taste in your mouth. But, it's enjoyable to watch, for me anyway. It's horribly overrated, but it's a film I love."

","When Kane first meets Susan Alexander he says he is on his way to (or coming from? I don't recall which) a warehouse where his childhood belongings are stored which he has not seen in many years. He doesn't mention the sled, but presumably that is the one thing which drew him to the warehouse. Kane is splashed and Susan laughs at him and one things leads to another. But my point is this: Kane would never have met Susan but for Rosebud. If Kane never met Susan he would never have been caught in the ""love nest"" with her and lost the election for governor. Kane might have had another mistress, but this seems unlikely. Kane is not very interested in sex - perhaps because he feels he is making love to the whole world. His interest in Susan is primarily idealized and not physical. So but for the meeting Susan, Kane would likely not have had a scandal and would have been elected governor. We are told he would then have almost certainly been elected President. Also he would not have lost his wife and his son would not have been killed in the car accident. As President, Kane could have been the most powerful man in the world. Instead he loses this chance, loses his wife and loses his son - all because he happened to be on a certain street at a certain moment. And the reason he was on that street at that moment was Rosebud!<br/><br/>So maybe when Kane says ""Rosebud"" he is not thinking of when he was a carefree lad playing in the snow. Maybe he realizes that because of Rosebud his whole life went spinning in a completely different direction from what it otherwise would have taken. By pure accident Rosebud ruined his life and shut him off forever from everything he otherwise could have been and could have accomplished. And maybe that is why ""Rosebud"" is the last word he speaks."

","When I was fourteen I saw two movies that cemented my love for classic films. One was John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath and the other was Citizen Kane, touted as the 'greatest movie of all time.' You can imagine how skeptical I was going into watching Kane with literally the highest praise you can give a movie hanging on it. However, I was not disappointed. In fact, I was blown away. I was glued to the screen the whole time, fascinated by the actors, the story, the gorgeous Gregg Toland cinematography. Like countless young film fans before me I suddenly had to see more. More movies by Orson Welles, more movies from before I was born, more movies with decades of praise under their belts. Unlike a lot of modern film fans, I don't bristle when Kane is referred to as the greatest movie of all time. I understand why it's called that and take no offense on behalf of films that are more personal favorites of mine to watch. It's difficult to compare movies when tastes are so subjective. Citizen Kane is called the greatest primarily due to its technical accomplishments and how influential it has been, on filmmakers as well as fans. I can certainly attest to the latter from my own experience as it was highly influential in turning me onto movies as more than something you pass the time with. It is a masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest films of all time, if not THE greatest."

","I cannot find adjectives that describe the film in a proper tremendous way. Some of the best directing, cinematography, and editing of all-time, Welles' imagination is the force that makes Citizen Kane fly over any other inferior picture when it often takes the crown as the greatest film ever made. This is the way movies should be made. The filmmaking of 1941 is unmatched and my guess will continue to be. Welles is a genius and his mise-en-scene could be studied for years. Citizen Kane is smarter than most of the audience members who've seen it since the release. <br/><br/>The journalistic side of Citizen Kane is also something that makes it shine as something special, the film feels like (and quite literally is) a reporter researching a story on Kane, each person he interviews is like a different paragraph in the news story. The profound message revealed in the closing 60 seconds is brilliant, true, and simple, that we never know the whole story to a person, personal complexes are the ultimate form of privacy and mystery.<br/><br/>Orson Welles had to have been bitten by a hyperactive insect in order to successfully put himself in the central role of lead actor, director, and writer. Though solid in the acting department, his masterwork in the other departments are monumental. He must have envisioned the film as he penned each scene. His direction is electrified with bouncing energy while telling the tricky story, allowing the audience to find sympathy with Kane as a character.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>Rating: 10.5"

","Please let me give you one short critic: -""Citizen Kane"" is old, but is needed. It's breakthrough over technical implementations made it classic and a milestone. Overall, it's not fun as we are accustomed in the Hollywood way. It narrates the life of a man, in the view of others, while searching his ultimate secret lying on his last word: ""Rosebud"". Movies usually involve people in front of a conflict, solving it, learning the lesson. ""Citizen Kane"" is an racconto of a life, it's a progression of lessons and conflicts.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" lasts so long because it's story vents every story of man; not in the content, but in the manner of being told. Every man has his story, every man and women will lye on their bed before dying and try to remember her life by one image, one word, one feeling, one movie. Although Charles Foster Kane, the Citizen, (a memorable Orson Wells) has wealth, a lovely wife and power, he cannot buy what he misses most and he falters over the memory of his most (and everyone's) precious moment: childhood, where every story begins; and where we want to go when it ends. The innocence that is sacred, irremovable. The beginning of every story."

","WELLES, Orson. In 1938 a young, chubby man had a radio show in New York, in which he listed recipes for housewives. His listeners often called in, and they exchanged tips. One day, one by one, call after call came in about how little green men were killing women, raping animals, and offering free cakes. This last part particularly caught the young man's attention, and by the time a call came about how delicious the cakes and cookies were, he stormed out of the KCNYMA building and looked around for cakes, shouting ""Leave some for me!"". What he found on the street weren't Martians distributing cakes, but three journalists and a cameraman who were laughing hysterically. It was a practical joke. The footage of this hungry young man screaming for food at the sky was a unique hit during pre-main-feature reels shown in theaters across the nation. This young man was Orson Welles.<br/><br/>It was this incident which spawned the phrase ""to make an Orson out of yourself"". <br/><br/>This remarkably gifted actor, writer, director, producer, and devourer of small antelopes will best be remembered for ""Citizen's Cake"", a classic about a powerful magnate who like a magnet drew chocolate and vanilla to his enormous never-saturated belly. With this delicious masterpiece, which is still served in many cinemas with a cream topping, Welles also managed to make a movie that was well ahead of its time. Sadly, it is now well behind the times, like most 30s, 40s and 50s classics, and people only watch it to see the $200,000 cake which the cinematographer captured so superbly in all its fattening glory. ""Citizen's Cake"" was also the first movie to be served with a main course and desert. Welles has revolutionized the world of motion-pictures with his unique-yet-simple idea of combining film with food. <br/><br/>His next movie, ""The Magnificent Chocolate Pudding With A Cherry On Top Which Amberson Made"" (previously filmed in 1925 as ""The Pampered Tummy"") won rave reviews for its stark, brutally neo-Breugelian depiction of a family of obese farmers during the Great Depression who refuse to put down their expensive chicken-legs and eat salads like everyone else. When it premiered in 1942, it was served with mayonnaise sauce and then apple-pie for desert, causing the likes of Charles Laughton and Edward G.Robinson to jump out of their seats and applaud until the palms of their hands bled (or until they got hungry again). When the movie opened nation-wide, many theater-owners gladly re-furnished their theaters to include tables on which roasted pork meat was served during the first half of the movie. During the second half of the movie, in which the farming family is faced with a salad-dressing they don't want, Welles decided on serving to audiences a special fish dish with little cookies shaped like dead Japanese soldiers. Considering that this was 1942, Welles couldn't have come up with anything more brilliant.<br/><br/>Just when it seemed that he could do no wrong, his career took a downward slide. Welles was never content with being predictable so he discarded the idea of making yet another food-serving movie. He mused long about what next great invention he can bring to the world of cinema, and he came up with an idea that was as brilliantly original as it was ridiculously unprofitable: he was going to start a movie without finishing it. <br/><br/>""Bits And Pieces"" was the working title (official titles don't exist for unfinished movies) of a semi-drama about a family of zombies who decide to go to college so they may get socially accepted by their human neighbours, some of whose relatives they had eaten in the past. When the youngest zombie decides to drop out, the other zombies excommunicate him from Zombie Church, forcing him to join the humans, who are planning revenge. The humans are about to tell the young zombie of the secret zombie-killing machine that they built, but just at that moment the movie ends, leaving the viewer disappointed and upset. Critics loved Welles's concept, and praised ""Bits And Pieces"" for its ""post-Eisensteinian reaffirmation of neo-Brechtian values that condone anti-Viscontian attacks on social pseudo-Marxism"". The audiences, on the other hand, looted the theaters when they didn't get their money back.<br/><br/>Totally oblivious to the financial disaster of that movie, Welles decided to expand on his unique brand of cinematic ideas by making another incomplete picture - only this time even the part that is filmed won't be edited in the proper order of the ""story's"" events. The working title was ""What? Where? Why?"" and was perhaps a drama roughly about some people doing some things. It was a major flop, but the critics were once again happy, calling his work ""the most accomplished unaccomplished work of part-art to ever partly semi-grace the screen"".<br/><br/>Welles's next project was even more unlike any other ever before: he started a movie that was not only going to be unfinished, unedited, and unwatchable, but a movie without a script and without sound. The working title for it was ""The..."". European critics called it ""the most satisfying cinematic creation of the 40s"". Fans didn't call it anything: no one went to see his movies anymore. And they couldn't even if they wanted to because they weren't shown anywhere. At Cannes the film won for Best Movie Of All Time Even Though It's American and for Best Existentialist Movie That We Love Because We Won't Admit That We Don't Know What The Hell It's Really About And Call It Existentialist Because That Sounds So Very Mighty Impressive. <br/><br/>Welles then decided on the ultimate ""non-movie"": a film without editing, sound, a script, and even without actors and dialogues. Only Welles himself appears in the movie, in two brief scenes in which he stands semi-nude on a city dump and looks as if though he is about to say something. <br/><br/>I hit the word-limitÂ… (e-mail: vonj88@yahoo.com)"

","The ending is what really got to me. When Kane finally realizes he's become what he's hated, what he originally fought against. It's such a real tragedy of a human train wreck. Kane tried so hard to be a good man (without really knowing what one was), to use his power and wealth for the truth and benefit of his friends. I think it emphasized the importance having a loving family during childhood, especially a mother.<br/><br/>The film laid the groundwork for many future villains of the silver screen: Norman Bates, Darth Vader, Lex Luthor, Dr. Evil. But it's fearfully symmetrical to our own society. Even if they aren't eccentric media magnates like Hearst. How many people could have turned out differently if they had someone that loved them since the day they were born, and even before? Is it truly art that imitates life, or does life imitate art? How many wealthy men swear to use their power for good but inevitably do not? And how many are loved by the world solely for their wealth and celebrity? Millionaires, billionaires, so called artists, athletes, people we worship? There's this scene where Kane is standing in front of what seems like thousands of people, and behind him the giant picture of himself as he's running for office, like many tyrants the symbol of the man becomes greater than the man himself. <br/><br/>Basic lessons like how money can't buy you happiness, how philosophically everyone needs friends, and the way the film builds to a crescendo, all of it up to that memorable scene. Rosebud. That ultimate loss of childhood innocence and wishing with every bone in your body to take it all back, like it was a terrible nightmare. Not unlike the story of Frankenstein, this movie is about the making of a monster."

"hall895","8","2","4","12 August 2005"," An epic facing the test of time
","An unquestioned masterpiece of its time Citizen Kane holds up pretty well decades later. While some may find it a little slow by modern standards all in all it is easy to see why it is among the most celebrated films of all time. It is a fascinating story brilliantly told. It is also a film which was innovative on so many levels, most notably for its stunning cinematography. Brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed by Orson Welles, Citizen Kane was a true triumph.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is the life story of Charles Foster Kane, rather obviously based on real-life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. In a rather unique twist the film begins with Kane's death. Through the use of a newsreel obituary we are then told Kane's entire life story in the span of just a few minutes. But we will soon see there is so much more to this story. For a man who lived so much of his life in the public eye, Kane was in fact quite a mystery. One mystery he leaves behind is the meaning of his dying word, ""Rosebud."" A reporter is sent on a mission to find the meaning of that last word. Through interviews with those who knew him and flashbacks which tell the story behind the story we will follow the fascinating life of Charles Foster Kane. And perhaps if we can discover the meaning of ""Rosebud"" we can unravel the mystery of exactly who this man was.<br/><br/>From beginning to end this is Orson Welles' film. His performance as Kane, spanning an entire lifetime from idealistic young man to bitter, old recluse is simply stunning. The film soars whenever Welles is on screen, especially in Kane's vibrant youth. When the film stops to let others tell Kane's story some of the magic is lost. All of the other performances, from a cast of mostly unknowns, are commendable. But this is Kane's, and by extension Welles' movie. Welles is a commanding presence and the film suffers for his periodic absences. Kane's story is a fascinating one and the circular manner in which it was told makes it even more thrilling. With each succeeding flashback another layer is peeled away and we learn more about who Charles Foster Kane really was. It is a life of tremendous peaks and mortifying valleys. For the viewer it is a thrilling journey to follow. It really is one of the great character studies of all time as we see Kane evolve over time and see what drives this extraordinarily successful yet seemingly unfulfilled man. And of course there is ""Rosebud."" Can a man of the stature of Charles Foster Kane really be explained in one word? That is the film's great mystery and it is a fascinating one. Put it all together and Citizen Kane gives you a truly unique and memorable experience."
"nomoregie","Null","2","4","12 December 2004"," A Different Take on Citizen Kane
","I have only watched Citizen Kane once, but I can already understand why so many people consider it a great movie. I am not speaking of the technical aspects of the movie, but of the actual story and the many layers to the story.<br/><br/>There is the first layer of the story which has received the most attention.<br/><br/>This layer is the story of Charles Kane, a wealthy tycoon who ruthlessly used his wealth and power to control and gain the affections of others. I think much has already been said about this layer so I will not explore it further.<br/><br/>To me the true beauty of this movie is the great deal of mystery that surrounds Charles Foster Kane. The fact that the story of Kane is told by others adds a great deal of complexity to the movie. Many of the commentaries I have read on CK, seem to believe that the focus of the movie was Kane and that the other characters are there as windows through which we can view Kane. Unfortunately, after having seen movies like the Usual Suspects and Memento, I have a great deal of skepticism regarding events relayed to the viewer by a character in the movie. As we saw in Usual Suspects, such accounts may simply be utter fabrication, or as in Memento, they may be so clouded in self deception that they bare little resemblance to the actual truth. I believe that in considering Kane one must consider the characters who told the life of Kane. Those who give the harshest portrayal of Kane deserve the most scrutiny. At first glance is may seem that there is little information given about these characters, but almost every scene with a supporting character sheds light into that character's nature.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most damaging account of Kane is given by Leland. However, one most remember a few things about this 'honorable' character. First through another character we first learn that Leland is an aristocrat who has lost all his wealth. We then watch as through much of the first part of the movie Kane satisfies his every whim and need. During this period we do not here him complain about Kane's cruel nature. It is not until Kane is humiliated in his bid for the Governorship, that Leland decides that he no longer needs Kane's friendship. But instead of resigning in protest, he asks to be transferred elsewhere. Just when his supposed friend needs him the most, Leland abandons him but still expects to be financially supported by him. In fact, it is rather difficult to pinpoint moments where Leland acts as a true friend towards Kane. Many of Leland's comments and actions reveal him to be a very selfish man who harbors a great deal of jealousy and resentment towards Kane. Thus Leland's account of Kane is hardly an objective accurate portrayal of the man. <br/><br/>I think an examination of many of the other portrayals of Kane, by an analysis of the characters giving the accounts will yield much deeper insights into the movie. To me this movie has some similarities to Lermatov's 'A Hero of Our Time'. At first glance both stories appear to about deeply flawed men. However, the true theme of both stories is an indictment of the society and individuals that destroyed the potential greatness in these men. Kane's utterance of 'Rosebud' at the end of the movie is a manifestation of his desire for a different type of society, one that nurtures people through love and friendship, as opposed to one that worships money and power."

","""Citizen Kane"" is awesome, but it tied together a lot of stuff that was used in bits and pieces previously in other great films. <br/><br/>If you view ""Stagecoach"", ""Rebecca"" and even ""The Grapes of Wrath"", you'll see little things in them that Welles borrows and expands on (both in terms of technique and performance). He obviously spent a lot of time screening great flicks prior to making CK. <br/><br/>I read somewhere that he was especially influenced by John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" and if you take a look at that film, which by the way was shot in 1939, you'll see stuff like great low angle snap shots of actors, similar claustrophobic set design, deeper focus then normal due wide angle lenses rather then lighting/depth of field and some little bits where Ford used sparse sets/props and shafts of window light to convey atmosphere (very theatrical).<br/><br/>Light and shadow play is even more dominant in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" and watching a pristine print of Rebecca you can't help but be reminded of the lighting, art direction and framing techniques used in ""Citizen Kane"".<br/><br/>Not to put Welles and CK down in anyway -- CK deserves all the praise it gets and more, but I hate to see great films prior to it get ignored.<br/><br/>So, if you enjoyed the atmosphere and quality of ""Citizen Kane"", do yourself a favour and see the other pics I mentioned. The decade of 1939-1949 produced some incredibly moody, marvelous b&w cinema including ""A Portrait of Jenny"" and of course the crowning jewel, ""Citizen Kane""."

","I finally had a chance to look at this film and I have to say that it was all I expected and more. The things that struck me about it was that there were two main messages. One was the fact that its main message was that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely. Kane turned out to be like most men who achieve power and when they do they aren't satisfied with the power they get. It also showed how Kane would step over any and anyone to get that power. Also, this film showed how the media tries to manipulate people and this is especially true in today's world of 24 hour news and the internet. Even though Kane was said to have been based on William Randolph Hearst, the person of Kane could also fit media barons like Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch, especially Murdoch. Murdoch is definitely someone in the Kane mold and if anyone had a chance to make a film like this today, they probably would use him for the model.

The film starts out with a very dark scene, a castle on a hill, symbols throughout the whole scene, such as a sign saying `No Trespassing' which shows the character Charles Kane was a very private man. Then the scene shows Charles Kane played by Orson Wells dying in his bed with the last words of  `Rosebud'. The movie fallows his life by interviewing people who knew Kane and journalists trying to figure out the mystery of Rosebud.<br/><br/>Orson Wells must have been so busy by directing , producing and starring in such a great film. Even though he was doing several jobs in this movie he still put out a great acting performance portraying an angry, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, lonely man. He made it very believable. Agnes Moorehead who played Kane's second wife  Mrs. Mary Kane did a great job at playing an annoying wife. The viewer watching this movie will most likely get annoyed watching her.<br/><br/>The depth of this movie was amazing. It was very symbolic and artistic, which made you think.

Although loosely based on the life of the infamous William Randolph Hearst, `Citizen Kane' depicts a power hungry man who's life spirals from the lime light down in to darkness. This movie filled with superior lighting, music, camera work and acting is possibly one of the best movies of all time. The movie actually starts off at Charles Foster Dane's death. As he whispers the name Rosebud. A snow globe is dropped and shatters. With this the flame of Kane's life is blown out. The audience is then shown a news report about the incidents of Kane's life and opinions from critics. When this news reel is over, a room full of reporters decide that they need to figure out what the word Rosebud meant in Kane's life. This leads to the rest of the movie as they interview Kane's closest friends. In which the characters in the movie never find out, but only the audience alone is shown the missing piece of the puzzle. The beginning of the movie starts out with the upward shot of Xanadu, Kane's castle. The end  of the movie is shown  with a downward shot. This shows the beginning and end of Kane's life, and is just one of the great camera shots in `Citizen Kane.' Another wonderful shot is when Kane is shouting at Gettys. He is looking down stairs that descend in a spiral. This symbolizes the same spiral that Kane experiences in his life. Probably the most profound shot in the movie is when the candle is blown out during Kane's death. This obviously shows that Kane just died. Rosebud, the last words of Kane serves as the plot for this movie. Although the audience finds out in the end that it is the name of his childhood sled, it can also symbolize other aspects of Kane's life. A rosebud starts to sprout and bloom in the spring. Which symbolizes hope, and a new beginning, but then it soon blooms and dies. This is much like situations and people in Kane's life, after one rose blooms and falls he must find another. Kane was a man that was always searching, but never found  a rosebud that never dies but always in bloom.<br/><br/>This movie on a 1-10 scale is rated an 9"

Similar to how Jimmy Stewart wants an image of a woman(Vertigo), Charles Foster Kane longs for something that isn't there.  Humankind is always longing.  What you need or want becomes what you have, and so you need or want more, and so forth.  Kane is a man who can have everything he wants, yet he still longs for the unattainable."

I saw this film in a college class I took on movie making and thought it was wonderful. Time has not ""dated"" it at all. Its still as wonderful today as when it was first released. The opening is the best when they have that ""news on the march"" that details Kanes death and tumultuous life. Welles based Kane on William Randolph Hearst and his powerful newspapers did everything they could to stop it from being released. It was only with the passage of time that people realized how great it is. I for one loved the symbolism of ""Rosebud"". People say that it was only the name on his toy sled but it was more then that. Kane had achieved great wealth and power but died a bitter, lonely unhappy old man. All his wealth couldn't buy him happiness. In his last moments, he was thinking back to the simple joys of his childhood. In a sense that toy sled tossed into the fire was Kane's Paradise Lost. Orson made a bad mistake, he directed the greatest film of his career at the very beginning of his career and basically had no where to go but down. The Magnificent Ambersons, Journey Into Fear, The Stranger, The Lady From Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mister Arkadian, Touch Of Evil, The Trial, Chimes At Midnight.

","...but Citizen Kane remains one of the great cinematic achievements of all time.  The greatest?  Who's to say?  There are many criteria upon which to base one's opinions of films, so I think it's impossible to say that ANY film is, in its totality, the greatest film ever made.  What this film IS, however, is a tremendous achievement and a cinematic landmark...as well as an incredible chapter in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>A boy genius comes to Hollywood and writes his own bill...he can write, direct, and star in his own full-length motion picture.  Initially working around the idea of a film adaptation of Conrad's Heart of Darkness (a feat which would not be accomplished until Coppola's Apocalypse Now).  The end result, however, may very well have been THE most controversial film in the history of cinema.  Natural Born Killers has NOTHING on Citizen Kane, in terms of controversy.  But beyond all the controversy, fascinating as it is, Orson Welles's achievement here is astonishing.  Even if Citizen Kane isn't the greatest film of all time, it is certainly the most auspicious and brilliant debut that a 25 year old filmmaker has ever made...in Hollywood, or anywhere else.<br/><br/>I'll spare you my admiration of Welles's direction, Tolland's cinematography, the make-up, the lead performances, and the writing.  I'm sure you can find that in countless reviews for this film. <br/><br/>
What I wish to express is the reason that some people cannot see the brilliance of this film for what it truly is.  Citizen Kane was made in a different era...a time when films didn't have to move at fever pitch in order to keep a viewer's attention.  It was an age before MTV, an age before the attention span of the average audience went to hell.  Films moved more slowly and gracefully in the '40s.  But when audiences who were raised on glitzy, rapid-fire edited, car chase-laden action movies go back and attempt to watch true classics like Citizen Kane or Anatomy of a Murder, they find those monumental films to be ""slow""...or ""talky""...or even ""boring.""  It's unfortunate...but it's true.  Ever shortening attention spans have rendered many great films unwatchable by millions of viewers.<br/><br/>All I can say is that Orson Welles achieved magic and true brilliance with this film...and that its impact on the world of cinema will never be duplicated.  Perhaps that's what it means to be ""the greatest."""

Citizen Kane's plot centres around one word, `Rosebud', Kane's dying word. It is difficult to imagine that a great two-hour film was based on this single item. The search for Rosebud's meaning was a tongue-in-cheek jab at what Kane's life represented, the use of yellow journalism and the omnipotent power of the media. The great Citizen Kane was reduced to what he used to make his own fortune, sensationalism and gossip. The great irony of the movie is that Thompson proved to be greater than Kane; he came to realize that a man's life cannot be diminished to the sensationalism of one word and its meaning.    <br/><br/>Kane's life was depicted from five different angles and from five different people. Although each of them had different view of who Kane really was, none of the five individuals knew the meaning of Rosebud. During Thompson's search he encountered many different versions of Kane's life, but only one was common. Kane was a man who had it all, except what he wanted the most `Love'.<br/><br/>Symbols are used throughout the film to stress the concepts that are of vital importance. These symbols include colours, sound, and space. During the film, white symbolizes purity. In the beginning of the film Kane is still pure, as he is only a little boy. To symbolize this purity he is surrounded by white snow. A second time when white is used to symbolize purity is found when Kane meets Susan, while he is wearing white. Immediately after Kane meets Susan, he begins to see her as a mother figure and decides that he must have her. Sound also plays a crucial role. From the outset of the film this effect is used to draw the audience's attention to certain important details that will affect the development of the story. One of the events where sound is used in this fashion is the scene where Kane's mother is negotiating his future. At the same time that Kane's mother is breaking up the family, Kane is playing outside and he screams `Union Forever.'  <br/><br/>Welles uses space in a fantastic manner; he is able to portray the relationships between the characters by the distance between them. Even if there were no words in the film, the plot could sill be discovered by simply observing the transition of the distances. The distance between Kane and his wives tell of the degradation in Kane's relationships with both of them, there is no need for words. <br/><br/>Welles' use of timeline may be the beginning of what has been called the MTV style. Citizen Kane broke the rule that a film had a specific beginning, a single ending and a long middle. The film starts at the end, proceeding to some place in the middle, only to go again to some part close to the end, and goes on and on.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is not easily placed into one category of film or style. This film has characteristics of both Melies and Lumieres, it is surreal, but at the same time realistic.  As for technique, this film can be ranked among the best ever watched. On the artistic side of the film, this is still to be decided. Citizen Kane is one of those films that can be viewed over and over, and each time there are new things to be discovered. As criticism towards society and the media, Citizen Kane is powerful but at the same time cruel. It brings the message that `love on your own terms' can be the perfect recipe for dying alone. Citizen Kane has made it to my favourites, but is not on the top of the list."

","The A.F.I. list came out not too long ago, and so everyone clamored to see what the number one film ever made was.  Of course emotions were high, as well as tempers.  Of course different people were rooting for different films, as to be expected.  I remember the exact moment when I saw the list. It is actually in the latest issue of Newsweek magazine.  Right there, in black and white, in the number one slot...  ""Citizen Kane.""<br/><br/>I had never seen ""Citizen Kane"", actually, and the list prompted me to do so.  When I saw the film itself, I was shocked.  Here was a slight film, understated, and very simple, really, that had obviously rocked critics everywhere, that had done the impossible.  Here is a first-time filmmaker trying something new, experimenting, if you will, and he ended up making what is considered the greatest film ever produced in America.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed.  Welles' performance, as well as all of the others, were right on the money, the script was remarkable, and Gregg Toland's camera work took everything I thought to be reality, crumpled it up, and threw it away, never to be rediscovered.<br/><br/>I really see little reason to review ""Citizen Kane"" as a film.  That has been done enough times, goodness knows.  What I do see fit to do is recommend it.  The average viewer will be bored, of course, because there is no action, no real adventure to be found.  But there is drama, especially for any who see film as film, not so much as a story.  There is suspense, I think, so many times, simply because of a camera move or a well-timed change in placement.  This is film as film, not as anything else.  Absolutely do not miss.<br/><br/>**** out of ****."
"bartelby-4","10","2","4","25 August 2000"," The Missing Link
","Citizen Kane is many things. It is the film cited as an example of perfect, visionary filmaking. It is the movie which has arguably changed filmmaking and film viewing more than almost any other. It is one of the few movies everyone must see to appreciate the art.<br/><br/>But it is not the greatest film of all time. It is not the best. It is not the most loved<br/><br/>When asked what I believe is the greatest movie of all time, I simply say, ""Not Citizen Kane"" Why? I don't know. Personally I do not believe the greatest movie of all time has been made yet. Cinema is only a hundred years old and it, hopefully, has a long life ahead of it.<br/><br/>We all know Citizen Kane. Even the unfortunate few who have not seen it know about it. I'm not going to bore anyone with the details of what makes this movie so great. In one sentance, however, it changed how filmmakers view filmmaking. It said that there were different ways to tell a story, to shoot a story. It bridged the films before it with the films made after it. Almost every movie that came after Kane have been influenced, directly or indirectly by it. It is also an example of a filmmaker, Orson Welles, having complete control over a film long before the rise of the independents. As a first time driector this was rare. And for Welles it never happened again in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Kane is the missing link that ties the young, fledgling art of filmmaking to its more grown up version. It made sure that everyone knew that film, cinema, movies, was an art form, and not just some piece of whimsy.<br/><br/>But there is a missing link in Citizen Kane as well. There is something lacking in the movie, something that just isn't there. It's got the drama, but it doesn't have.... .....heart? a soul? compassion?<br/><br/>I don't think it is fair to say it doesn't have any of these. These do not make a movie good or bad. I think, instead the missing link in Citizen Kane is empathy. It is not something that Welles forgot to put in the movie, but something he intenionally removed. It is a connection between the audience and the film, in which by the end of the movie we feel closely related to the main character. But Charles Foster Kane is an ellusive, mysterious man. We can only see his life through the eyes of other people, none of whom understand him. Because of this, Kane is crafted as an enigma, a character with more questions about him than answers.<br/><br/>Welles obviously wanted this to be the case. But that does not allow us, the audience, to really relate to him. We look at him under a microscope in a lab. Citizen Kane is a scientific experiment. It's a very good one, but still just an experiment.<br/><br/>If you look at other Hollywood movies of the time, Wizard of Oz, Casablanca or It's a Wonderful Life, three of the most beloved movies ever, it is easy to make a distinction between them and Citizen Kane. All three were put together with less finesse or confidence then Citizen Kane, yet all three are cherished in a completely different way. If any of these movies are on TV, people seem to always switch the channel over. I don't know many who would watch Citizen Kane any old day of the week.<br/><br/>Kane is an academic movie in many ways. Perhaps a bit too sterile, too aloof to be really loved. Many would call it the best movie ever, but not necessarily their favorite film. This is not bad, just a fact. I believe that Welles wanted Kane to be just a bit aloof, maybe not loved, but well respected, viewed more as a triumph of aesthetic and technical perfection then as a sentimental classic."
"Sadies","10","2","4","2 October 1999"," A phenomenal story about a man who had everything, except for his youth
","This is a true masterpiece about a man who had everything and yet nothing.  A bit Fitzgerald; in which it does come from the same era of ""the lost generation.""  Citizen Kane depicts an era of mass civilization and a very materialistic America.<br/><br/>But this movie has a bit more of Holden Caufield in it.  As we know, Holden, is a depressed young man, who tries to find his path to follow in life.  So he goes to the Big Apple; searching and failing.  Then he realizes that his path is ""youth.""  He wants to be ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" and capture the youth from falling toward a world where civilization is corrupt.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane depicts a man who has utterly everything and can get anything. In a way they exaggerate Kane's wealth, in order to show that even a man who has everything cannot be happy, without security.  This man is an unhappy man, who's material life encompasses him.  He can't enjoy what he can have, because he can have everything.<br/><br/>""I don't believe any word can describe a man's life.""  This is ironic; because the word ""Rosebuds"" symbolizes Kane's life.  A man who is at his deathbed, grabs everything that had meaning in his life.  Kane recognizes this, when he holds the snow-paperweight.  It takes him back to one winter day, that would inevitably change his life.  The one day where he loses his innocence and his pure sight; once he is introduced with a life with money (after he is taken custody to stock market pirate).<br/><br/>I can see how people can see this movie as boring, this movie was a bit long-winded, but it is surely not a bad movie.  There was a reason to say everything, and indirectly allows you to appreciate the strong relationships any individual has with there family and friends.  For those who ONLY like action packed/visual effect movies, you have no idea what youa re missing out on.<br/><br/>10/10"

","How does life find what it wants to do and should do? Or how to find faith? How did Kane decide to use the newspaper's voice, influence the current situation, and even implement reforms? I only saw the result, maybe it was just an accidental thought. Everyone is looking for what they want to do, even if they fail, there is no regret to struggle for this in life.<br/><br/>Maybe if it were n't for his mother to make that calm and heart-warming decision, there might not be this legend at all. Some people say that he can make these achievements, which is closely related to him being in the upper class of society, standing high and looking far, and at the same time he can do things to defend the rights of the people because he is not a rich second generation from the beginning There were poor parents who loved him. If he did not get rid of poverty, the ""rose bud"" would not become his missing heart fragment. He would have ordinary family feelings and ordinary small days, but there would also be missing, perhaps a dream that could not be approached, maybe not Love and so on. Life is inevitably lost or unavailable, wealth is rich and sad, poverty is troubled by poverty, his mother chooses the first one for him, what has happened to other people 's reproach or praise, what does it matter Just wish.<br/><br/>When Kane saw Susan as a typical American, he also wanted to examine whether he was a typical Chinese citizen. How typical? A question that cannot be solved by oneself now. Speaking back to Kane, he found Susan 's small wish and tried to help her realize her wish. Unexpectedly, this ""extramarital love"" was shaken out. Was it really ""extramarital love""? Li no longer has love, but for Susan, this simple and kind girl, not to mention love, may just be interested, devoted, and helping her, but this news will hurt Susan, so he Divorce and marry her can save her, but the strong noble wife does not need his rescue. Kane, who controls the media, was defeated by the media. This scandal trapped Kane's image of betrayal, lost the support of voters, failed to run for governor, and ended his political career. The people could not tolerate sand. They only wanted a governor with a good background, and Kane was hit hard when he ignored the post-service reforms proposed by Kane. After remarriage, Susan 's selfless help changed Susan 's nature, and she no longer slowly and steadily improved her. For her own reputation, she should be transformed into an opera actress as soon as possible, proving that he can really help Susan Dreaming, helping the American people dream, prove that he is still the original Kane.<br/><br/>As for Susan who said she never wanted to be an actress in an opera, this was all Kane let do, but did she never want to sing? I still remember her helpless and lonely expression when she talked about her mother 's talent for singing, whether it 's Kane or us outside the film, it 's easy to read her desire to sing, and Kane as a helper The people who dreamed of her, supported her, trusted her, nurtured her, and maybe following the original path of Kane, she could be successful in small circles, and they were all happy. However, life is full of accidents. The scandal came out. This secretly supported move had to be put on the table for everyone to entertain. Kane accelerated the star-making plan, but Kane did not find out that she could no longer fulfill her dream Persevere in the brigade.<br/><br/>Perhaps Kane 's attitude towards the American people was reflected in his attitude towards Susan. When he saw the people 's small wishes and set about to realize it, he even took the responsibility in the first person, ""I"". At first, the people faced this The big rich man who stood in his camp was rejoiced by it. The people (Susan) could not keep up with the pace. He walked too fast. The people (Susan) would rather stay in the original comfort zone than to take the wind. Rain. The turbulent situation in the process of rewriting the pattern will blind the eyes of the people, thinking that it is not as good as the original stable life. Adding a fire to the key point can continue to change, and pouring a pot of cold water can make the people quickly retract the comfort zone. The scandal is the cold water that wiped out the fire of trust.<br/><br/>A stable family environment is so important for gaining the trust of the people. Kane may want to recreate this appearance after remarriage, but fails in the face of Susan 's fragility. Friends and people do not understand why he must let If the new wife succeeds, you can see that Susan will not succeed. Only Kane is confused and may not be clear. It may seem to him that helping Susan succeed will regain his prestige and at the same time prove that he will also succeed. When friend Li Rand could not bear to be caught between the false comment and the broken relationship of the friend, Kane let go of the friend's hand, which was good for both parties.<br/><br/>Kane was unknown and unknown, is he a hero? Is the situation creating a hero or is the hero born in the situation? He played brilliantly in the role of media tycoon, but he was defeated in the role of politician. How would he evaluate his life, but realize the dream for the subject but ignore the subject itself? Never regret it?"

","Citizen Kane has incredible cinematic components built around an amazing story. The film is filled with non diegetic music that expresses the tone of a particular scene; also used in transitional moments, fading between scenes. For example, when Walter Thatcher is reading the newspaper headlines managed by Charlie Kane, the music is loud and fast, expressing how ridiculous the headlines are.<br/><br/>The camera work and editing throughout the movie is quite smooth. The fade in and out between scenes, long shots, and smooth point of view transitions really make this film feel unique for the era it was released in. For example, during the scene when Charlie's mother was finalizing the deal with Mr. Thatcher, there was an extremely long shot that covered a good chunk of space and time; the movement of the camera during this scene was extremely smooth."

","Despite what so called ''experts'' or critics might tell you, Citizen Kane is not really the greatest movie of all time, as it is many times referred as. It is not the flawless picture that so many people say it is. And it is quite obvious that people who disagree there are of the mind that somehow external over the years evolving influence negates everything (That is somewhat flawed) in the film itself.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is definitely not the average 40s picture. It starts off without any opening credits, something quite unheard of in movies of that time, and instead just shows the movie's title in illuminating letters, after which one of course gets the iconic opening panning shot towards Xanadu. Despite all its merits, there are obvious flaws notable in the movie, namely during the first half, and especially during the expository introduction sequence of Kane's character. This slideshow with a horribly wooden voice telling us of Kane's past life is like a spoon with irrelevant information maliciously and tediously being put into the audience's mouth. Not to mention the fact that nobody could have actually heard Kane say ''Rosebud'' as there was nobody in the room when he said it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, modern day scenes in which a more or less faceless reporter tries to uncover the meaning behind those words, which were Kane's dying words, are simply devoid of all interest. Director Orson Welles decided to film the shots of the reporter mostly in the shade, and their faces are rarely visible, and when the reporter is speaking to a person of Kane's past, the camera is only fixed on the latter. Admittedly, this is not such a significant flaw, as Citizen Kane's real strengths come from the flashbacks, told quite brilliantly in non linear fashion (Though at some points a character has one of these memories that those characters couldn't possibly have, due to them not being there, but that's kind of a nitpicking flaw). Welles wants to somewhat dehumanize the reporting angle by the obvious lack of lighting, and seems to want to focus solely on Kane.<br/><br/>Of course, technically speaking, Citizen Kane is a piece of brilliance. It utilizes incredibly lighting in particular, and has a sort of direction that was also quite unheard of during this time (The close up of Kane's mother standing at the window and panning backwards to change to a mid-shot in a single frame, for example). It is easy to spot the influence of a lot of later works in these kind of techniques, evident also in camera positioning & blocking (The many shots of a character in the foreground, middle & background, creating the most dynamic of pictures & frames, adapted famously later on by Kurosawa as a trademark ). And there is thus little doubt of Citizen Kane's status as a piece of technical brilliance.<br/><br/>The acting by Orson Welles is superb, and he pretty much outshines all opposition with ease in this picture. Of course, it also helps that Kane is the only real in-depth character of the bunch, as every other character is only there to enhance Kane's state of mind. It is fascinating to watch this flawed person descend into despair due to his inability to love anything other than himself, and his character arc is indeed quite superb, as is the aging process (Keep in mind, Welles who plays Kane was only 26 in this picture) that occurs during the many years that pass by. One could say it is a slight flaw that none of the other characters really have their own goals or their own inner conflicts like Kane, but as they contribute significantly to Kane's character arc, this in comparison seems like a minor issue.<br/><br/>The non linear storytelling, as stated before, is superbly written in, although the things only really get under way when Welles is onscreen. It is structured like the perfect mystery in this sense, as the audience slowly get to the truth behind the final utterances of Kane, that truth which will hold the key to the cause of the conflict within Kane.<br/><br/>Though it makes use of a horribly obligatory wooden newsreel exposition opening, and though it is not without its logical flaws, Welles chews up the scenery, and the technicalities speak for themselves. It is not as great as it is many times hailed as, this status being purely the result of its everlasting influence, but it is still as a stand alone film a superb picture, a picture of man at his most imperfect form, destroying one's self from within."

","What can you do with a monument like Kane? Well, all I think you can do is just walk around it admiringly, time and again, because undoubtedly you'll see or hear something you've missed before which, at least if you're me, will only deepen your appreciation of Welles's breathtaking daring and genius in bringing it to the screen as his debut feature. Just consider that, his first film.<br/><br/>Of course it's no one-man show, as he has help from numerous gifted collaborators on the movie, from screenwriter Joseph L Mankiewicz's brilliant screenplay, to Gregg Toland's yardstick-setting cinematography, to Bernard Herrman's completely simpatico soundtrack plus of course Welles's own troupe of Mercury Theatre players who bring it to life.<br/><br/>But it's still unmistakably Welles's film from his frequently inspired direction, razor-sharp dialogue contributions and of course his tour-de-force acting performance in the title role. Probably the most dissected, on a scene-by-scene basis, movie ever made, even watching it today you still get the sense of risk involved in the enterprise, from its novel way with even the titles sequence, the dissolves between scenes to suggest the passage of time, low-angle camera set-ups scoping enclosed rooms, ceilings included, the expressionistic lighting, the monumental interiors, the overlapping dialogue, I think I'll stop there or I'll end up running away with myself.<br/><br/>It helps that the story at its heart is so involving and of course credible if you do the read-across from the real life near contemporary William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies relationship to Kane and Susan although I rather believe Welles's frequently made assertions that it wasn't just based on them. The film just bursts with great lines, dramatic situations and memorable scenes far, far too many to mention, in fact the only real weakness I can discern is that identified by Welles himself in later interviews as the dollar-book Freud pursuit of Kane's enigmatic dying utterance ""Rosebud"". It just wasn't necessary to add this layer of sentimental mystique to the film.<br/><br/>Otherwise, feel free to watch this movie any way you like, whether as a technical study in camerawork and set-design, as a scabrous attack on the graft-dominated policies of turn of the century American politics, a biopic of a great but deeply flawed man or even as a tragic, misbegotten love story. All the supporting cast are great in Welles's own considerable shadow, but if pushed I think I'd have to give a special best-of-the-rest mention to Dorothy Comingore as the hapless Susan.<br/><br/>It works on all the above levels but most of all it rightly stands as the apex, at that time at least, of what Hollywood cinema could achieve. Some would say it still holds that position today and I think I would struggle myself to put the case against it.<br/><br/>As the poster itself says, people will still be talking about it so long as pictures are made."

","""There's only one person in the world who's going to decide what I'm going to do and that's me.""<br/><br/>When I first watched this movie, I barely made it to the end. Superb photography, direction, editing, music, a strong atmosphere, excellent study of personality ... and boring. For some reason, it was unbearably boring to me, and it completely sidelined all qualities. Whoever I told I didn't like the movie considered me a fool, and for years I couldn't bring myself to give it (or myself) a second chance. I made the same mistake with Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". After decades of quitting halfway through, when I finally watched it in its entirety, I came out of the theater thrilled. It motivated me to re-watch some more cult classics that I hastily wrote off. ""Citizen Kane"" didn't have nearly as strong an effect on me as ""A Space Odyssey,"" but this time I saw it through without yawning and it left a much better impression than before. The objective qualities that make it a timeless masterpiece are undeniable, and now that I've read a bit about the film, I'm additionally impressed by some amazing facts. This is a Chaplin-like achievement for Orson Welles. He co-wrote, directed, starred and produced it at just 25, personally picking up the Academy Award for screenplay and nominations for directing (and this was his feature film directorial debut) and leading role, as well as 6 other nominations for the film, including the Best Picture. He was the first-ever to be nominated for the directing and leading role for the same movie. Movies ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""Rebecca"" (1940) had a major impact on Welles and many similarities in the story, set design, and shooting techniques can be seen in this film. There is a lot more interesting information that I read before I re-watched the film and that helped me to see it in a whole new light.

This is a movie everyone should see at least once, the story starting with the death of Kane and then going back through his life give the movie a unique but great flow."

","I'm watching this as a modern movie and TV watcher. There's a whole history about the making of this movie, whose life it was based on, and the place & importance it fits in, in American cinema. That in itself could be a movie. You can read about all of that online. My perspective is just for the movie itself and what takes place in it. In other words, was the story good and compelling and richly told? Was the acting and directing good?<br/><br/>The movie is told through flashbacks. A reporter is trying to figure out what the last words of a tycoon, Charles Foster Kane, means. Right before he dies, he utters ""rosebud."" The reporter goes on to have conversations with many people that knew Charles throughout his life.<br/><br/>I figured out what ""rosebud"" was right from the beginning. I'm guessing most viewers will too. Charles is a bigger than life world-famous newspaperman that engages in yellow journalism. Throughout the movie, you see that Charles wants to be loved and praised, and has many if not all the qualities of a narcissist, hence my title.<br/><br/>It's in black and white and there are many shots that are shot overhead for scenes. Orson Welles starred in the movie but also directed. The cinematography is different and refreshing, at least for me, a modern movie watcher. There are some jokes, for example in speeches given by Kane, which may not seem very funny to today's viewers but gets big roaring laughs in the movie. Remember the times are different, so keep that in mind when watching.<br/><br/>As the tale is told you see some great acting and interesting characters. You see how Charles, a charismatic young man, rises to fame and eventually falls. A lot of people around him get hurt. Everything about the man goes back to an incident that took place when he was younger.<br/><br/>I found the movie particularly relevant because there are some world leaders today, that are narcissists. People that love to be loved, praised, and love to be popular, and the people around them end up being destroyed. Since they are world leaders, the citizens also suffer.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie for people interested in the subject of narcissism, like biographies, love the use of flashbacks to flesh out a story. I gave the movie a 8/10."

","It's an amalgamation of elements that make Citizen Kane great. The alchemy that Welles did with them is the secret of the power of this film. Anyone who has the opportunity to compare Citizen Kane with other Hermann Mankiewicz scripts or similar genre will realize that that directorial creation was what truly made it revolutionary, grandiose, pioneering and incomparable. Marking each page of the script with his personal brand, vital magic, irresistible energy and unique style, Welles became not only a randomic movie-maker, but a modern myth, melancholic, insufflated with genius, author of landmarks. As if he had sold his soul to the devil to be able to enter history, Welles became from there on an unwanted guy, synonymous with problems, debts, frustrations, unfulfilled deadlines and unfinished projects. Selling himself to the highest bidder while trying to explain his artistic vision of cinema, he spent decades justifying himself and wondering if reaching the top with his #1 masterpiece had been a blessing or a nightmare."

","This movie is about Charles Kane and his story. If you've watched the movie, you already know what happens. But what I want to focus on right now is the meaning and importanceof the pivotal ""Rosebud"" scene. On his death bed, Kane utters the word ""Rosebud"" before passing. Throughout the movie you learn this refers to the scene where Kane is taken by Thatcher to be raised and to be taken care of. That one moment is Kane's biggest turning point in his life, and his biggest regret. To Kane, that was the last time he was happy with his life. The last moment before he felt like he had no control, his life predetermined and leads to him feeling unable to change his life, leading him to rebel and so on throughout the movie. To me, this movie screams two important lessons of life. The first being to enjoy life to the fullest while you still can, have fun and enjoy what you have, while the second is to do what makes you happy in life. Live life your own way, the way that lets you be on your death bed without any regrets, and to avoid points in your live akin to the ""Rosebud"" scene."

","Finally, I got to watch Citizen Kane, and there is no confusion about why this is commonly considered one of the greatest films of all-time. I watched many movies that have been described as ""Revolutionary"" and ""Game-changing"". But besides that Citizen Kane really deserve to be called so more than any movie I've watched in my life, it's could be the oldest movie that is as influential as it is timeless. I felt I was watching a movie the has been released couple years ago, except it's shot in black and white. An ecstasy of light and shadow, of clashing textures and graphic forms. A haunting cinematography that makes Citizen Kane one of the best-looking movies to date. an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting. Yes, it's above all a visual achievement. But all these innovative techniques shouldn't be questioned whether they still hold up or not. Because they don't just hold up to this day, but they are as fresh and contemporary as they were in 1941. But all that is from the technical standpoint, so what about the screenplay, the narrative, the story?<br/><br/>As Orson Welles took many risks directing Citizen Kane he also took risks writing it's Oscar-winning script with Herman J. Mankiewicz. And of course by risks I mean the unprecedented use of flashbacks, and the non-linear storytelling. And While I can't say this way of storytelling paid off perfectly, I have to admit that this structure has changes the game forever in film-making. It took me a while to be engaged with the characters, and the story itself. That's because the pacing was confusingly fast at the beginning, and some important aspects and details in the story needed to be more focused on. <br/><br/>It also dragged, and almost lost me a couple of times. As I mentioned above, the build up for the titular character could've been way better, at least to make me invested in the character from the start.<br/><br/>With that being said, the more the time goes, the more I became engaged with the story, and invested in all the characters, not only Charles Kane. And I couldn't help but hope for some explanation about the fate of Kane. <br/><br/>After some more minutes, I realized that Citizen Kane is a character study, actually, a very complex and compelling one. The story became more poignant and moving. By the way, if you still haven't watched Citizen Kane because you think it's a pretty serious and bleak film, you better watch it ASAP. Because it's actually funny! Yes, sometimes it's funny in a cynical way, but it is always a light-hearted movie, and easy to watch. But that doesn't mean it's a feel-good movie at all. As I mentioned, it the story becomes more touching and emotional as it proceeds, and it's represented in a flashback structure to reveal some mysteries about a publishing tycoon's rise and fall who dies corrupt and alone. So I think you get the point.<br/><br/>All the performances are impeccable, and Orson Welles' performance is as terrific as his direction. Also, Joseph Cotten is great as always. 
Also, the dialogue is so clever, and there are a fair share of very subtle lines.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is far from perfect, IMO. Nevertheless, it somehow lives up to its reputation as a landmark achievement in film. But what's striking now is how utterly modern it is in direction. <br/><br/>(8/10)"

","This is a film revolving around the life of a popular business tycoon, Charles Foster Kane whose life ends with the mystery word 'rosebud.' While the newspaper attempt to solve the mystery film takes us back into the life of Kane- to struggle of his mother, his rising as a business tycoon and his tense relations with his two wives. 
The film revolves on the entangled life of a rich person who tries to win over everything with his money and influence. Susan Alexandar's (Dorothy Comingore) entry is pleasant but gradually Kane's monopoly and her monotony makes things worse into her leaving Kane. 
The movie has many literary satires expressed smartly through the cinematography and direction like false journalism and reputation. Overall the movie is a testimony of the extra weightage given to money makes a man poor- emotionally and socially. This was less of entertainer and more of learning stuff that gives it a classic element."

","""The greatest film of all time"". ""The most influential piece of cinema ever"". ""Orson Welles is the best actor to have ever lived"". ""Technically flawless"". Can we just take the time to appreciate the praise this film has acquired since 1941. It is undeniably rare for a silver screen picture to stand the test of time, but Citizen Kane has. However, the monumental rave for this classic naturally heightened my expectations to astronomical heights. Chronicling the life of the fictitious tycoonist Charles Foster Kane, a journalist attempts to uncover the meaning of his last word ""Rosebud"". There's so much to admire about Orson Welles. To have the audacity and confidence to direct, produce, co-write and act in his first motion picture is impressive to say the least. His transition from theatre to screen felt seamless. Technically, this film is masterful. Welles' use of lighting to create shadows, symmetry, long takes and innovative tracking shots have clearly influenced many films since its release. The flashback narrative structure was pristinely incorporated to create a cohesive story about a man who slowly becomes corrupted with money and power. Acting was superb, particularly from Welles, considering this was a screen debut for the majority of cast members. There's nothing much I can add that every critic hasn't already raved about. But. I must profess. I personally do not think this is perfect. The story, for me, just didn't keep me engaged consistently. Several scenes dragged on forever to a point where I started becoming distracted by my own surroundings. The showgirl dance scene, Susan's singing rehearsals and even the introduction which simply slowly zooms in on Xanadu. Maybe it's because I'm fairly new to classic films, or maybe I just found Kane to be an uninteresting character. We could all endlessly dissect this piece of art and write a dissertation on how perfect it is, and it is without a doubt technically perfect. But I shan't give it full marks just because every film critic has."

Orson Welles' passion project, on which he had the coveted 'final cut', could easily pass as much more modern fare thanks to some frenetic, unique camera-work and effective scene transitions. The plot of 'Citizen Kane (1941)' is compelling, told using longer takes that really give the excellent actors room to flex their proverbial muscles, and the flash-back based narrative does a good job of keeping you invested in the life of a man you know already to be dead. Yet, the mystery at the centre of it all, the iconic 'rosebud', comes to a close with a lack of proper resolution. It does shed some light on the motives of the central character and isn't meant to be the main focus of the feature, though. There's more in the craft of the piece than in the narrative, especially on re-watch, but the story and characters are compelling enough that the experience is an enjoyable one, all the same. 8/10"

","I came across this old film in the bargain bin at my local pound store and couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it before<br/><br/>OK, only kidding. Let's face it: you'd have had to have spent your entire life living in a hermetically sealed bubble to not know about Orson Welles' debut film, which is almost universally hailed as the greatest movie of all time. It's an interesting – and divisive – title for any film to be saddled with, that World's Greatest Movie tag. Imagine being branded something as modest as the world's greatest commis chef, or world's greatest dishwasher, and see how quickly people would start trying to bring you down from your lofty perch. There seems to be a lot of people wanting to know what's so great about Kane, mostly because every groundbreaking film-making technique generally – and to a degree, mistakenly – attributed to Kane, now forms the core of every film school's Big Book of Movie-Making, thereby blunting Kane's once industry-changing impact. The film deserves recognition because of its place in history, no doubt about it. But is it any good? <br/><br/>Well, yes, actually. Citizen Kane provides the audience with an intelligent, insightful and sophisticated character study of an egotistical megalomaniac and delivers, in almost every shot, something meaningful that contributes to our understanding of Kane. A rich vein of irony runs through the film. For example, the photograph in the opening newsreel of Kane with his son and smiling wife below the newspaper headline announcing his nomination for Senator is taken the moment before his wife reveals to him she knows about his mistress. Kane's political aspirations die within an hour of that jubilant photograph being taken. Welles doesn't bother to point that out, crediting the audience with enough intelligence to not require a guiding hand.<br/><br/>I doubt whether any Hollywood film prior to this one had penetrated so deep or so vividly beneath the surface of its character. As the film progresses, Kane's material wealth grows in direct correlation to the loss of his personal relationships, until he is alone in a vast, monolithic castle on a hill. In the first half of the picture the character of Kane is permanently surrounded by others, but as his political aspirations fade and his personal shortcomings come to the fore, his figure either becomes smaller or he occupies the screen alone.<br/><br/>Perhaps Welles the actor is one of the film's biggest liabilities: his acting is unconvincing at times. Welles himself felt he tended to over-intellectualise when he acted, and I think he was right. Whatever the reason, he doesn't always inhabit the character the way he should to be totally convincing. Joseph Cotten, one of Welles' Mercury Theatre players also making his debut, gives probably one of the most convincing performances, while Dorothy Comingore as the hapless songbird who becomes Welles' second wife, becomes so shrill towards the end that you begin to wonder why he would want to keep her around.<br/><br/>Is it the greatest film ever made? I don't know. A lot of people ridicule the idea, but many of them are of a younger generation, and fail to come up with a realistic alternative. It's pretty good though, I know that, and is easily superior to anything else Hollywood was putting out back then. It makes you wonder how much more Welles might have achieved if Hollywood hadn't been so intimidated by his precocious exuberance."

","On the DVD cover it writes that the classical story of power and the press. I don't agree with this since the later part of the movie focused too much on the love development between Kane and the singer. It may be right to say that Mr. Kane was so concerned about power and control that he also wanted to prove something in her distorted love with the singer. Love was not about the feeling between man and woman, but a kind of tool and platform to demonstrate something and manipulate the social relations. Mr. Kane's failure was not because of loss of power but due of reasoning. Further again, the role of press was not clearly developed, and I would rather classify this movie into a love story."

","There is a great deal of talk of Citizen Kane's technical achievement, and so there should be. In 1941, this film broke ground that still marvels today, and arguably is the earliest (famous) example of non-linear story telling. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and the near endless list of famous shots (my favourite being the infinite images in the hall of mirrors) make this movie watchable without even trying to understand it.<br/><br/>But above all, Citizen Kane is a wonderful story - a great tale of a man with everything who really has nothing. This movie is perfect story-telling and a great American tragedy.<br/><br/>Kane needs to be seen over and over again. I defy anyone to watch it and accurately predict what scene comes next. But still, it flows well and never comes across as disjointed. I have seen itabout 9 times now - each time I pick up more and enjoy the film more. <br/><br/>Orson Welles was an absolute genius and Citizen Kane is proof enough. **** out of ****."

The other even more ridiculous defense of this movie's integrity is that Charles Foster Kane was the big-screen version of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst.

It is rated as the number 1 movie in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.<br/><br/>Orson Wells, child prodigy and coming after his War of the Worlds stunt was given a free hand with this film, his first director role. So it had a lot to live up to. Failed at the box office, but later rediscovered, the film experienced a revival. The story was supposedly based on Hearst, a media Baron (although this was denied by Wells). Hearst went to some lengths to try and ban the film.<br/><br/>Looking at it now, it is very dated. It does make some very telling points about human nature and the newspaper business. But I cant help but feel Wells tries too hard at being ground breaking, both in choice of a controversial story and in its cinematography. While the film was ground breaking, I didn't find it was a particularly entertaining film at all."

","This is the greatest film of all time. Well god help films. If all films were like this, I can tell you now that I would have no interest in them what so ever. ""Citizen Kane"" is out of print, well at least it should've been.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, I did enjoy the first 30 minutes, the first 10 which explained Kane's life in a nutshell held up very well even for today's standards. It seemed fast, it seemed interesting and i seriously thought that this could be a really great film! Then we were introduced to Kane the child, a bit of back-story (well actually a lot of back-story) and then we got to Kane being a newspaper mogul, starting out and it was about here that I thought, this must only have half an hour left. It actually had an hour and a half left, I had been watching it for 30 minutes. I stuck with it and I don't think I've ever had a night that long in my life! It's only a 2 hour film but it felt like it was four, and I'm really not exaggerating here! It was so boring! I think I nearly dropped off in some moments, I don't really care about this man who had success and then lost it all because I've seen it all before but in a much more interesting way! I know this film is as old as the hills but we're in the 21st century now, and so I have to compare to the standard of films we get now! I watched ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" the same day as this, a film that's almost 3 hours long and I had no problem with the length because it didn't feel that long at all. In the same way it tells of a man's life, but it's interesting! So the boredom factor is my biggest problem with this. The story was nothing I've not seen before as I said. But, I suppose the directing was impressive. Particularly in the opening 10 minutes and in some scenes I noticed some eccentric camera moves for the 1940's. but on the whole, the camera was as static as most film noir.<br/><br/>This is all I have to say on this. I think it's over-rated, over-long and over-here! Maybe it has some hidden meaning, but that's wasted on me. Just because a film has flashbacks doesn't make it the greatest film ever. What the hell is rosebud anyway!"

","I am not a big fan of Citizen Kane, it's just one of those films like The Dark Knight, where everyone says it's the greatest film ever and then you go see it with high expectations only to be disappointed. But is Citizen Kane a terrible film? Well that will all depend on what you are looking for in a film. If you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good, has a good story, and likable characters than Citizen Kane is not your movie. The movie is a Film Noir with elements of both realism and formalism that make the story dull and confusing. It is very depressing and hard to get into, and Kane, the character is a total a**h***.<br/><br/>However for those of you who are studying film making, you need to watch this movie. Citizen Kane is what is known as a text-book film, it is long and boring but every shot in the film is perfect and these are all techniques that every inspiring film maker should watch and study. Films schools will make you watch this film anyway so why not get a head start right now. Meanwhile I'll just sit here and wait until you are done.<br/><br/>(2 hours and 30 minutes later)<br/><br/>Finished!? See what I mean about the story. It's dreadful, depressing, and it makes me want to kill Charles Kane... Again. <br/><br/>But what makes this film very disappointing for me is the ending. Although well photographed it tells you that all along Kane's last words ""Rosebud,"" was in reference to his sled... Are you kidding me! I had to sit here for two and a half hours watching this only to learn that the guy was talking about his freak-en' sled! <br/><br/>Oh well, I guess I can't complain too much, it is Citizen Kane after all, the movie that made Billy Wilder movies awesome by creating a new genre of film."

","That is not to say I didn't love it, this film is absolutely brilliant in every respect. I just more admire it rather than adore it, but I completely understand its reputation as a classic. The cinematography is enough to earn the film's reputation, every shot, every angle is exemplary and has so much visual drama, and you never know from looking at Citizen Kane that it was made on a shoestring budget. That is not all though. Bernard Hermann's score is superb, the story while not easy to understand at first is interesting and the screenplay is thought-provoking. Not only does Orson Welles direct impeccably, he turns in a magnificent performance as Charles Foster Kane, while the supporting acting is excellent too. People may dismiss Citizen Kane as boring and dull, and I have known people outside of IMDb to say that, but I have yet to hear any of those people to say it is not well-made or directed.

Am I unfair? Possibly, but when Orson Wells rejoices in background noise over spoken dialogue, not so much<br/><br/>Actors are awfully static, and they do not convey emotions, they do not raise empathy, I found it impossible to connect with them.<br/><br/>The shooting is sometimes innovative, fairly modern, but I do not judge the merits of a film for the impact it had on other films, nor how good or how new it was when it came out, I judge it for what it produces on me now.<br/><br/>As for the story, the ""mystery"" of Rosebud being the sort of philosophical thought that a man always longs for his childhood happiness, sorry about that, but it does not justify 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I resent the lack of clues towards that mystery too. It seems that Orson Wells thought ""I'm going to do the biography of a media tycoon, what could I do to pretend there is a story?"" and then came up with some sort of vague philosophical idea about the meaning of life, et voila!<br/><br/>If you disagree with this opinion and think ""He did not get the true meaning of the film"", just remember this one thing: I judge a film for what it brings to me now, not for what it brought others a long time ago. <br/><br/>By today's standards, Citizen Kane has fallen into the ""old boring film"" category."

","This movie shares, with Casablanca and The Third Man, the dubious distinction of being one of the most overrated in the history of cinema. It is also not entirely clear why the Orson Welles myth should persist until today. Kane's existential progress is presented superficially, without a coherent framework. His achievements and failures are portrayed choppily, more in the form of sound bites than analytically. Technically, the movie seems rather amateurish: Welles hectors rather than explains; the diction and delivery of most characters sounds stilted and unnatural; it is often difficult to find out who is talking, as most of the male voices sound the same and the characters turn their backs to the audience, and/or hide under wide-brimmed hats. One could go on. The fortuitous discovery of a goldmine on the property of a lower middle class housewife stretches credibility. Trying to discover the meaning of one word (the film's rather trivial leitmotiv) seems hardly worth the time and effort involved. An altogether forgettable experience."

Imho the main reason is none of the characters are likable and several Bernstein, the reporter, second Mrs. Kane are annoying and shrill. Even Kane himself , can anyone honestly say they care about him? Most or all great films have at least one or two characters the audience sympathizes with or at least finds interesting, here there's no one and there never has been anyone, for this reason Kane is shallow , shrill, and pretty dull when you get past the technical wizardry."

","""I am, have been, and always will be one thingan American!"" says Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) at the beginning of the new motion picture Citizen Kane. Buckle your lap belt because this will be the most entertaining portion of the entire film.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane tells the story of Charles Foster Kane, a multimillionaire newspaper magnate and his death. Depressing already, I know. But when his final word is ""Rosebud,"" everything shakes up a little bit. One reporter is determined to find out the meaning behind this word and how it relates to the life of Charles Foster Kane. As things unravel and unfold, the mystery becomes clear.<br/><br/>Directed by Orson Welles, a.k.a. the actor who played Charles Foster Kane himself might suggest something. Welles has directed two films before thisand acted in both of them! In The Hearts of Age (1934), Welles played the character named Death. Also, in 1938, he directed Too Much Johnson and was Keystone Kop. In addition, Welles has contributed to the Swiss Family Robinson as an uncredited voice narration. Although, Welles seemed comfortable with the character and acting while having a great sense of humor.<br/><br/>Other acting included Joseph Cotten (Too Much Johnson) and newcomers to the motion picture industry Everett Sloane and Agnes Moorehead. I believe we will be seeing much more of these two in the future.<br/><br/>Cinematographically, the movie was narrated in chapters, which made it easier to follow. Adding a challenge to the movie was the never-ending flashbacks that could throw you off. There was the ever-popular fading in and out of scenes and creative camera angles that would grab the viewer into the movie. One major camera transition from the outside rain into a bar really flabbergasted me. I was thoroughly impressed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Kane did not affect me. The acting was young, the plot was not easily understandable, parts were left bare and some parts of the movie were left on a limb. Also, many character's faces were left dark. This could be taken as a signature from the director, and brilliant at that, but it was not necessary for this particular movie.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this movie to someone who enjoys looking way beyond the face of movies. It is very political and difficult to follow. If you are in that mood and can handle back-and-forth movies, take a gander at this one. Otherwise, you may want to stay far, far away."

","If you want to make a movie seem even better than it already is, don't ever tell someone it is the greatest movie ever made. Not only will you most likely be telling the truth, you will also avoid setting a potential viewer's expectations far too high.<br/><br/>Over the years, countless professional and amateur film critics have been herolding Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all time. It is logical, then, that when I watch it in 2002, it should be the greatest movie I have ever seen. As you have already guessed, it is not. This movie is for a certain breed of people. It's dark realization on screen and an obvious lack of a character the audience can readily sympathize with can easily turn off many-a viewer. I found myself making a serious effort just watching the TV, obviously something that rarely happens.<br/><br/>Potential viewers be warned: you will not be blown away the first time you watch this. The ""killer"" ending has been spoiled for everybody and the many great themes contained in this rich (maybe too rich) story will not be picked up when first watching this. My advice to anyone watching this for the first time is to wade through the twisting, often uninteresting plot, then rewind and enjoy the characters and images without having to worry about following the story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while Citizen Kane must have been the best movie when it came out, contemporary viewers might find it unappealing at first viewing and anticlimaxes thanks to the now-unsurprising surprise ending (not its fault, but something to consider), which in my opinion makes it fall short of best movie status. For a movie to work on many levels, which Citizen Kane does (but certainly isn't the only one) it must first work at the most superficial and let the viewer dissect it on his own. If you want to watch a fun classic that also has something to say, I recommend Casablanca."

Whereas his radio broadcast of The War Of The Worlds was an excellent piece of radio history, I do not believe that his ""genius"" was much in evidence behind the camera, rather, he should have stuck with the medium of sound, or to working for other directors, such as Carol Reed on The Third Man.

It was simply a description of the life of an ""ordinary"" man. Nothing particular at all.
Ordinary does not oppose to rich or important. I mean his life wasn't particular. I am amazed how one managed to create a movie out of it.

","Having watched Alfred Hitchcock's 'Shadow Of A Doubt' just yesterday, then viewing 'CK' today - both of which star Joseph Cotten - I was struck that these were two distinctly different genres. However, for me, what makes a film is how it engages with the viewer, and for me, there is no comparison between the two. That is to say I was underwhelmed with 'CK' and it just didn't engage me. That is not to say that there are not some very nice set pieces of cinematography in it. I would imagine that, back in 1941, this was so different to anything out there that it was regarded as quite groundbreaking. But in fact, I actually prefer Welles's 'Touch Of Evil' (reconstructed version) to 'CK', however that's only my opinion.<br/><br/>In summary I would say, rather than being influenced by top 100 film lists and getting enticed into the whole 'rosebud' PR stunt, watch what Hitchcock described as his own favourite film i.e. 'Shadow Of A Doubt'.

The script is a long, disjointed and ultimately little interesting retrospective of Charles Kane life, where even the ""Rosebud"" plot turns out to be a letdown.<br/><br/>If a remake, similar in every way, of Citizen Kane was made today, it would be considered average at best, which shows well that the historical context and the movie being some sort of pioneer influences the judgements a lot, at least more than the inherent quality of the film and its script in particular."

Best movie of all time? Far from it in my list. Citizen Kane only appears to me as having great outer beauty but lacking the brains to carve out inner impression.

","I watched this for the second time in my life, with my oldest boy. Although we love stupid movies, there is also a soft spot in our hearts for well-crafted older movies as well...<br/><br/>Was this movie well crafted? Yes, although not on an empirical level. Welles seemed to be producing this film on a gut level. He seemed to know which rules to break and when to break them. Indeed there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie. Most of the women in the movie are better thrown back into the cast of Macbeth. I understand that the women are intentionally bad to illustrate what Kane experienced with the fairer sex after his mother gave him away. Brilliant casting of Agnes Moorehead in that role, by the way...<br/><br/>Kane's two best friends are a gad-about and a sychophant. The only reason that you feel anything for these men is that Kane turns out to be such a dastard...<br/><br/>I think, though, that basing a movie upon the psychology of a man was a very dangerous premise. Let's face it: Welles was a genius. Not only in his production of the film, but in his acting. His scene with his second wife where he begs her to stay with him is utterly amazing. He has an age in his face that makeup could not possibly have been responsible for.<br/><br/>The movie world was growing up. This movie walks a line between older dramas and modern dramas.

"baumer","5","3","9","17 August 1999"," WHY?
","I'm 27 years old.  I first saw this film in first year film studies at Carleton University.  It was required viewing for the course.  I hated the film then.  I thought that maybe because I've had five years to grow and mature that I would give this film another chance and watch it for the third time in my lifetime.  Guess what?  My opinion has changed.  I hated it then and now I just dislike it quite a bit.  And the question that I have is why? Why is this film the masterpiece that people say it is?  Is it really because it revolutionized film back in the 40's?  Okay, so it invented the wipe and it had lots of different styles of lighting.  That may make it brilliant on a technical level, but come on people, you cannot tell me that this is not one of the most boring films ever made on the face of this planet or any other planet that has theaters to watch movies in.  How can you get excited about a film that creeps along like a snail moving across a highway in the middle of nowhere?  I really feel like Welles is taking all of you  for suckers.  Because I think he set out to make a boring film just to see if audiences would have an orgasm over it because of its technical brilliance.  I still think he is laughing.  I know I would be.<br/><br/>There was really nothing to like in this film except for one thing.  I can honestly admit that Welles' acting will stand up well today.  He does play Kane with energy and he is believable.  Almost all older films have cardboard actors that speak to fast, have little emotion, overact or are just plain bad actors.  Kanes's second wife in the movie was so laughable that I eventually fast forwarded most of her lines in the film.  She whined and cried and moaned and she was boring.  You ever seen Aliens?  Remember Newt, the little girl that Ripley takes care of, well that is Dorothy Corningmore's character as a little girl.  What a joke.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has pulled the wool over everyone's eyes for six decades!!! Critics, well I can understand them liking this piece of garbage, they have to or they look like they are incompetent fools.  That is their job.  But the general public?  Are you people on a really bad acid trip?  I welcome any emails that would please try to explain to me the greatness in this film.  Please, contact me.  I really am dying to know.  Why is this a tragic film?  Why is this an American masterpiece?  I am begging for some insight, because I haven't heard anything or read anything that says how great it is. All I have read is a bunch of people conforming to popular opinion that this is THE MOVIE to see.<br/><br/>I can name about 500 films that I have seen in my life time that are better than this and some of them I probably don't even like that much.  I would even go so far as to say that a really good Friday the 13th film is better than this joke of a film.<br/><br/>Well, I guess diplomacy is not one of my strong points, but I really don't understand the beauty, importance, tragedy, wonder or any other compliment that has been bestowed on Citizen Kane.  It just doesn't do it for me. You want to watch a great film that has everything that this film apparently has?  Watch Jaws, JFK, Apocalypse Now, Aliens, Mississippi Burning.  That is just a handfull of films that are what I consider to be the best films ever made.  I don't think that this is on my list of worst films ever made anymore ( it used to be ), but it easily tops my list of most overhyped, ridiculous boring films to ever disgrace our screens."
"LolaVavoom","3","2","5","29 March 2020"," Alas, I simply cannot understand the hype
","After many years of procrastination I have finally decided to watch Citizen Kane. There has been so much said about it that I expected something truly outstanding.
Alas, I simply cannot understand the hype. I was astonished to discover that it has been called the greatest film of all times by so many. Try as I might, I just could not quite see that. Perhaps I should have seen it as a teenager, surely it would have left a better impression then. Unfortunately, neither the story nor the visuals speak to me. It does seem unusual and I appreciate that it would have been really innovative at the time however the story appeared to me as empty as a tin bucket - a lot of melodramatic noise with very little substance and mostly underwhelming acting. So much hype about a simple story about an arrogant man with a chip on his shoulder who turns abusive and controlling instead of achieving anything worthwhile, an ode to an empty life.
I am glad that I finally saw it and can remove it from my list of cultural pieces I wish to be familiar with. Perhaps I am missing something important there although the desire to find out more is very slim on my part.
To recover from this lucklustre experience I decided to watch again The Very Same Munchhausen (1980) which I consider to be if not the greatest then certainly one of the greatest films of all time. Every sound, every look, every word speaks volumes and there is so much meaning behind every scene. Perhaps my taste is just different. In any case, I can now move on to other items on the list such as Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Death in Venice."

"Tweekums","10","2","5","12 June 2017"," One of the greatest films ever
","As this classic film opens Charles Foster Kane lies dying in Xanadu, his palatial home in Florida. The last word he speaks is 'Rosebud'. A newsreel film about his life in which we learn how he acquired a failing New York newspaper, rose to prominence, stood for the governorship, married and divorced (twice) before retreating to Xanadu and becoming a recluse. After this reporter Jerry Thompson is told to find a different angle to the story; in particular the meaning of 'rosebud'. Over the course of his investigation he talks to Kane's second wife; reads through the archives of Walter Thatcher, the man who raised young Kane; he also talks to his business manager, Mr. Bernstein and former closest friend Jedediah Leland.<br/><br/>As Thompson sees each of them we see snippets of Kane's life how he was effectively sold as a child when gold was found on his mother's land; his idealist sentiments when he took over the newspaper; how he later manipulates public opinion; stands up to a corrupt governor only to be brought down by a scandal that ends his first marriage; a second marriage where he is determined to put his new wife, a singer, on the stage even if she knows she isn't good enough and ultimately how after others can't stand his controlling ways he dies in his private palace.<br/><br/>This film is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made; this isn't just because it contains a fine story that is told in an interesting way but because of how innovative it was at the time it was made. This alone makes it a must see for fans of cinema. Orson Welles dominates the film; playing Kane through a variety of ages as well as writing, directing and producing the films. Even so he isn't carrying the film alone; all of the main cast are very impressive. The mystery behind 'rosebud' is intriguing but ultimately proves to be a McGuffin used to get Thompson to look more deeply into Kane's life and it is this life that drives the story. The way the story is told via a series of flashbacks works well as each person Thomson talks to reveals another aspect of Kane's life. Overall I'd say that this is a great film and certainly an important one; I don't know if it is the greatest but it is certainly in the running for that title."

He then walks to the foreground again, and once more the window looks normal.<br/><br/>This seems to say ""Look how clever I am, to do this"". This cleverness pursued for its own sake is the hallmark of Welles in general and Citizen Kane in particular. As Welles himself said in the film which provides the other bookend to his career, F For Fake: ""I am a charlatan"".<br/><br/>This is not to say that Kane is not a good film, merely that its constant gimmickry detracts from it. It has as many special effects as a modern day science fiction film and Welles, being the infant terrible he was at the time, has an endless need to put in as many trick shots as possible even if they seriously overbalanced the rather slight storyline. Never do a simple shot when you can have a camera crane in, then dissolve, then have a piece of furniture open up and so on. All this has made the film beloved among cinephiles and uncriticisable among anyone else.<br/><br/>But is the story any good? Does the pacing and narrative hold up?

"HulotderSpeiler","10","2","5","1 April 2009"," The ""Greatest Movie Ever Made""
","All critics agree, this movie is the best, not many people agree, including me. But the fact remains that the most trained eyes of judging film see this movie as the best, probably seeing more than we see. Aside from all this, there are visuals that will stay with anyone longer than the story. What comes to mind first? An opera house, six shadows falling across the room, leading to one man, a thousand Kanes walking, a snow globe, a sea of statues, jigsaw puzzles, and snow going over a sled. This cinematography is what would come to someone in a dream, or an empty thought, years after they have seen the movie. Maybe they have forgotten what it was from, it hovers on the edge of the mind, but no one will forget all of Citizen Kane, no matter what. Although many movies rely heavily on cinematography, very few have that cinematography more memorable than the movie. I am not saying that the movie is, on the whole, forgettable, I am saying that if someone forgets it, they will always feel part of it on the edge of their mind.<br/><br/>However, cinematography is far from all of the film. First off, this film is blessed with an immortal story, not a very exciting one, but an emotional one. It is so human that we are all moved by it. We feel sorry for him, not in spite of how awful he is, but because of it. His plight is understandable to anyone, no matter how different he is. Anyone can empathize with him because deep down, we know most of us would suffer like him in his position. This beautiful story, backed by excellent screenplay, and told through cinematography so great that Orson Welles, famous for ego, allowed the cinematographer's name to appear on the same card as his, also has the bonus of great acting. It is so demonstrated especially in the scene where Kane trashes his wife's room. It is a masterpiece in almost every sense of film, and from a first time director to. To use one of the characters analogies: each aspect of film-making is just a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, fitting in with all others and, after careful hunting and searching, it all fits together to form one beautiful picture."

Welles is also superb in the lead role, playing the title character from young adulthood to old age, with the assistance of some excellent makeup. However, as impressive as it is, none of the supporting characters are all that well drawn out or acted and the use of music in the film feels inappropriate and it detracts from certain scenes. In terms of film techniques it was groundbreaking in its time, and is still quite admirable even by standards today, but as an overall film it is just not quite as satisfying as what it could have been. Still, it certainly is interesting in terms of plot, with issues of love, fame and happiness amongst others in the film, and it certainly is a film great."

This movie just may raise your expectations of what you consider drama and entertainment.

It's easy to see why this film is so feted, but in my opinion it is an illusion, a three card trick. After all, Orson Welles loved illusions and tricks. Maybe you CAN fool some of the people all of the time."

","I finally came to the conclusion that this film is the most overrated hunk of crap ever to slash upon my television screen. The story was boring and I honestly tried to keep myself from falling asleep on the first 10 minutes, so I just turned it off and began watching Evil Dead. Evil Dead kicks this movie to hell.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane needed more zombies and people with shotguns, when we buy a DVD we want action, we want to enjoy the movie, but instead we were just drowned in a silly BORING plot about Rosebud. You've got to admit, this is an awful movie to say the least, I shoudn't have wasted my money on such monstrosity. The characters were boring, the plot was boring, the setting was boring, the whole movie was just PLANE BORRRRINGGGGGGGG. I cannot visualize people actually liking this movie, honestly i can't. I never want to watch this movie again. I have wasted 10 minutes of my life sitting through a boring poopy smelly movie, I would rather spend my 10 minutes sniffing penguin poop.<br/><br/>It needed Zombies, David Hasselhoff, Bruce Campbell, David Lo Pan, Shotguns and Agent Smith.

"Rupert__Pupkin","5","4","14","30 January 2005"," Pretty mediocre
","90% of the positive reviews written on this movie say the same three things: Citizen Kane is an amazing movie because (1) The cinematography was pure genius (2) It was way ahead of its time and (3) Orson Welles was only 25 when he created it.<br/><br/>I get tired of people saying that a certain movie was ""ahead of its time."" Usually that means the movie isn't as good anymore. Truly great movies don't lose their luster over time. I would argue that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is every bit as good today as it was 60 years ago. Citizen Kane, on the other hand, has certainly lost something. Even people who love the movie usually concede that point.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane was certainly revolutionary and was an extremely important film in the sense that it inspired so many future directors and cinematographers. But when it comes right down to it, it's just not that interesting to watch. You shouldn't love a movie because of what it used to be. A truly great movie is timeless. And great cinematography does not make a great movie (see ""The Thin Red Line"", the 90s version)."
"Paul-250","5","3","10","9 May 1999"," The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time!
","Here goes! Citizen Kane regularly tops the list of American critics' best films of all time lists and runs in the top ten in European critic ratings, despite having been a huge commercial failure at the time of its original release. It is a serious, well-acted and groundbreaking film certainly, but to describe it as the best film ever made is ludicrous; in fact I would rate it the most overrated movie in the history of film. Because I don't like Welles? Not at all. Welles had one of the most original and creative careers in world cinema and Othello (1952) would probably rank in my own top ten list. So why my scepticism? One of the biggest problems I have with the film is that, like Apocalypse Now, it requires a certain political position in order to fully appreciate it. Pauline Kael, the doyenne of American film critics, is on record as saying that the film was an important cultural statement for left-wing Americans at the time, and that is certainly true. But a film which has that kind of appeal usually makes assumptions that are far from universally shared, and often ungenerous ones at that. Hearst was a bete-noir of the American left whose newspapers had decades earlier encouraged a jingoistic war in Cuba. Did that give Welles the right though to dissect his life without even knowing the man (he later met him once in a lift) and, in particular to characterise him as cold an ungiving at a personal level? (It is worth remembering, in this context, that when Hearst later fell on hard times his wife apparently so starved of love sold her jewels and remained with him). The film has too much the feel of a hatchet job. Someone could make a similar movie today about Rupert Murdoch and it might be well-acted and beautifully shot but you see the problem! Welles was only twenty-five when he made this movie and it shows. Certainly he had a right to an opinion and a right to state it, but life is a little more complex than you would know from this movie.<br/><br/>Defenders of the movie often point to the originality and quality of its cinematography and the influence it has had on American cinema in particular. This is undoubtedly true. In the same way that Eliot, Joyce and Nabakov changed literature, Welles helped to change cinema. But Picasso was unquestionably the most influential figure on twentieth century art and yet his influence would not necessarily be universally accepted as benign.<br/><br/>I am not suggesting that the influence of Citizen Kane was malign, but influence and quality are discrete concepts. As for the cinematography itself is it really as original as many American critics seem to think? What about early Eisenstein or, at the risk of being non-pc, the extraordinary cinematography several years earlier of Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph Of The Will? A serious film? Yes! An important film? Unquestionably! The greatest film ever made? Move over! It is simply too cold ever to be that."
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","11","19 September 2005"," Now that we can talk about the movie's various aspects...
","Okay, I can't stress how great a movie ""Citizen Kane"" is. I swear that it has no bad qualities. Telling the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a William Randolph Hearst-like magnate, the movie broke some taboos when it first came out, and was unfortunately a flop at the box office.<br/><br/>Now to talk about other things. For starters, this was Agnes Moorehead's film debut. She is of course best known for playing Endora on ""Bewitched"". That means that Samantha Stephens and Charles Foster Kane have the same mother! Ironic, since the two have practically nothing in common (she has no bad qualities, he has no good qualities).<br/><br/>And, does anyone remember that time when ""The Simpsons"" opened with a spoof of ""Citizen Kane""? Mr. Burns was lying in bed remembering his teddy bear Bobo, the way that Kane was lying in bed breathing ""Rosebud"".<br/><br/>Oh well. The point is that you just gotta see this movie. Very few movies have been this good. On a scale of one to ten, ""Citizen Kane"" is a twenty."
"Anton_Klink","7","2","6","22 February 2017"," Did Orson Welles travel back in time to make a movie about the post-truth era and its greatest champion?
","The protagonist Charles Kane is a brash and jovial woman-grabbing, wife-cheating, promise-breaking, populist-talking, election fraud claiming, gilded and opulent billionaire of inherited fortunes, who is a ""champion of the people"" and who's favourite pastime is to manufacture and spread fake news. When campaigning to become governor, he even makes a promise in a speech at a rally to appoint a special district attorney to investigate, prosecute and convict his political opponent. Not to mention that he has a fabulous retreat in Florida by the name of Mara... I mean Xanadu. Does any of that sound familiar? I cannot believe I am watching a movie from 1941. Ever since the movie's release, people have been talking, how much ahead of its time ""Citizen Kane"" was. Boy, if they only knew.<br/><br/>Apart from the uncanny coincidences with modern times, the virtues of the movie itself are numerous. The script is witty and the mystery keeps us guessing. The direction, cinematography and camera angles look modern even today and must have been ground-breaking back in the day. Jumping back and forth in time keeps the viewer on his toes, which also brings us to the age transformations displayed in the movie, as those are simply marvelous. Especially believable is Orson Welles himself, either as an energetic young man, a more reserved middle aged one or a visibly aged old one. This must be the first movie, where I don't get the jarring feeling of seeing a young man play the part of an old man or vice versa (although the same can't quite be said of the actresses, who must have resisted being made up to look old). Having pulled together all the different parts needed to make a movie work, you really feel like you are seeing the work of a genius here. No wonder this movie is considered one of the towering masterpieces of cinema. If my hunch is correct and a certain political figure has taken away and implemented all the wrong messages from this movie, it is still having a very real effect on everyone's lives today. How many movies from the 1940s (or even at all, up to the most recent ones) can claim that? A unexpectedly tremendous achievement indeed."
"delicanesen-438-592279","3","2","6","9 September 2016"," Maybe it only is generation gap
","If your name is Sarah Esther Bonos, please do not watch this film. Ate Sar, listen to me. This may be on the list of the must-see movies of all time but don't bite into it. We have watched so much more worthy films.<br/><br/>Maybe it only is generation gap: people in the Citizen Kane era might be more appreciative of the plot or theme of these kinds of stories but today's generation has a lot more depth to offer. I would like to give Citizen Kane all the glory rendered to it because I am not a film- expert. I am not well versed when it comes to cinematography,stylistics, etc. But today's kinds and types of movies are (or thankfully enough has become) better than Citizen Kane. I hope this do not come across as mockery to this film. It just did not suit my ""era,"" so to speak, and that is all.<br/><br/>When I watch movies, stories make the most impact to me. Story-wise, Citizen Kane is circumloquacious and superficial. The twist is also a 'meh.' When you get to it, you'll ask yourself: 'so that's it?' <br/><br/>We are introduced to a supposedly great man by the name of Charles Foster Kane. Then we are allowed to take a peek of his life from the points of view of those who have come to know him. Finally, the end reveals how Charles Foster Kane's life is really not defined either by his popularity or people's opinion about him. Instead, Charles Foster Kane's life is harnessed in one word - the final words he uttered before he died: Rosebud.<br/><br/>There is a line in the movie that says: ""I don't think there's one word that can describe a man's life."" But by the end, we are shown how this is an irony. Charles Foster Kane's life is Rosebud - the name of the sleigh he received as first Christmas present away from his parents. He is Rosebud because he was playing with a sleigh on the snowy day when he separated from his parents. He is Rosebud because this sleigh represents his yearning to be with his parents once again. If he grew up with his parents, he would not have longed so hard for someone to love him the way he wanted to. Love would not have been a requirement for him. He would have welcomed it freely. But no, this is not the case for Charlie Kane. He grew up far from his parents. He was sent away. He was unwanted. That is why he has this constant sense of desire to gain people's love. That's basically it.<br/><br/>I just do not think it should have taken two hours for a story like that to be revealed. There are a lot of layers you can create to a story within the span of two hours. All the yada-yada about Charles Kane - his dry greatness, his influence and non-influence in politics, his popularity - they are just fillers to the story. The entire time, the movie is suggestive. Charles Kane is great. Charles Kane is rich. Charles Kane is the man of the masses. Charles Kane is a philanthropist. As an audience, I don't like to be fed with impressions. If the character is great, let me recognize it myself. Don't put it to my face. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, I was ""told"" that Charles Kane is an interesting character. But as I have discovered afterwards, he is not. He is dry. He is unintelligible. He is not charismatic at all. He is an old-school confused fraud. That is how he appealed to me.<br/><br/>In addition and as a final note to this review, I would like to mention that the musical score is bad. There were several moments in the movie that I had to lower down the volume of my laptop because of this loud annoying musical score whenever Kane is about to be introduced. I don't know, maybe I really am stupid because I do not get it at all. But Citizen Kane is frankly ordinary to me. We have made several worthier and weightier movies; and I am glad that we continue to make more. A look in the past is not bad when it gives you hope for the future."

","As you sit in your office, room or coffee shop, as you read this excellent review, you could quiet easily walk out the front door, and stop any passerby and ask them a simple question 'what is the greatest film of all time?' Some would say the Godfather, others would say Casablanca, but the majority would point to Citizen Kane. Is there a joke the world gets that I don't? Is there a massive party that I simply didn't get an invasion too? Because I can understand the 'some' and the 'others'- but I although I would rather point their attentions to Chinatown or Manhattan for title of greatest ever. But I'll let them off just this once. But the overwhelming inclusion of Citizen Kane on lists of the greatest films of all, is frankly ludicrous and a complete and utter head scratcher! Such was the extent of the head scratching I almost bore a hole into my skull. For me Citizen Kane is no more of the greatest film of all time, as much as you could say Zack Effron is great actor. Citizen Kane is simply the most over hyped film in the history of the universe. <br/><br/>Orson Welles produces, writes, directs in this picture as well as playing the title character Charles Foster Kane. A newspaper tycoon who dies almost at the start of the film, and through the eyes of reporters, Kane's life is slowly unravelled before our eyes via an anti- chronological narrative. Driven by the desires to discover the significance and meaning behind 'Rosebud', the one word Kane utters on his death bed. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Citizen Kane on a purely technical endeavour is absolutely superb. With the effective use of innovative angles and stunning manipulation of deep focus lenses too represent the various viewpoints of Citizen Kane on a visual plane is absolutely staggering and ingenious. But despite this people seem to forget that film making is the art of storytelling. I repeat film making is the art of STORYTELLING. True it relies heavily on aesthetics and visuals representation of conveying of said story, but story is still the main event of any film. Narrative is substance and A list stardom whereas the visuals are merely the supporting act. <br/><br/>Although I have to credit Welles on his heavy handed involvement in the film, but I feel the film would have reached greatest heights in my eyes, if he were to have relinquished some of the roles to people of greater experience, because don't forget the fact that Orson Welles was merely 25 at the time (Looks like need to get a move on). A fact I believe that might have been the bases of the reasoning behind the decision by American Film Institute (AFI) to place Citizen Kane at number one on their list of 100 greatest American films of all time. Which is insane, just because he was young doesn't mean he should receive any preferential treatment. Just because a kid in primary school makes a finger painting, doesn't mean is should stand in an art gallery next to a painting by Picasso. <br/><br/>But if Citizen Kane were to still remain on the list of 100 greatest, long after I'm gone. I'm adamant it will be of no heroics on Welles part and the story behind Citizen Kane, but more from the hard work of the likes of Gregg Toland (cinematographer) and Robert Wise (Editor) and there technical achievements, that have acted as magicians and tricked the whole world into believing that Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time – Dynamo and David Blaine takes some notes, that's what I call real magic!"

","So, I'll give this film credit for the message it sends with the importance of youth and the whole searching for rosebud idea. It seems like an overplayed film theme but Citizen Kane does a decent enough job with it. With that said, I will now proceed to rake this film over the coals. I hated it. I felt like it was dull and incredibly uninspiring. Like I said before, it had potential with it's message but it never delivered. There's an incredible lack of focus on his youth and most of the film falters in my opinion as it doesn't make Kane out to look like a confused man, it makes him out to be more tyrannical and sinister. He; cheats on his first wife, beats his second wife and forces her to perform an opera to prove that HE is not a failure, and on top of that he fires his ""best friend"" from his paper for writing an honest review of his wife's pitiful performance. Oh and he never sees his son, so what kind of youth is he providing for him? Now on top of all of this, how is this film innovative? I've been taking History of American Cinema at my college and I don't see anything that is new and adds to the way movies are made. I was expecting a real masterpiece and boy was I ever disappointed. I just don't understand how this film is so well spoken of."

","I'll never understand the praise that this film gets. I can understand the photography was innovative and at times quite stunning for the time period, but other than that I cannot find a way to love this movie. <br/><br/>""Rosebud"" is perhaps what keeps the audience to stick around through this boring 2 hour movie. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are largely flat and lacking a certain depth, emotionally. From the beginning of the film, I could tell where it is going, and I would have a much better time respecting this movie and it's somewhat interesting story if it was at least an hour shorter. That way the cinematography could be appreciated, and the meat of the story told, without putting people to sleep."

","Nothing that I, or anyone else, will ever say either here or anywhere else will ever change the immense aura Citizen Kane carries with it. Here is a film that has been voted number one of all time by the American Film Institute twice over a span of eleven years and has garnered copious amounts of praise from Sight and Sound's own decade-spaced lists. The sum of it all is; yes, the film is fascinating just as it is thoroughly engaging and brilliantly made. It's not because of the credentials that I give it a maximum rating, nor is it because it would be the 'easy' thing to do, it's purely because the film is genuinely one of my favourites on film making and historical grounds.<br/><br/>Orson Welles knows what he's doing here, he's delivering a tale revolving around the image of one man from many others' perspectives. These people include his former second in command, his employees and at some points, one of his wives. But the brilliance is that Welles allows the audience to have the final say in what they think of this character, this character that Welles has quite deliberately cast as himself, with the most wonderful of twists at the very end rounding off the piece. Do we forgive him for what he was through no fault of his own when he was whisked away as a child? The ending doesn't exist as a cop-out to excuse his ruthless behaviour but only adds to the layers of study established beforehand.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is genuinely enthralling, a film that doesn't chart the rise and fall of a character but rather kills them off in the very first scene before allowing a central character, who's a reporter, to try and deconstruct the myth of such a wealthy and successful individual. 'Getting there' seems to come across as Citizen Kane's focus, but the burning question isn't how he made it, rather what he meant when he uttered the word 'Rosebud' on his death bed before smashing a snow globe, something that within that tiny dome lies the clue as to what he meant; but won't become immediately obvious until we have had Kane's childhood locales and surroundings established. As he gazed down at the small, snowy surroundings in the dome; it is a recollection of sorts of days and innocence gone by, something he was removed from rather than naturally moved away from.<br/><br/>The film follows, in non-linear format as it shoots into the past at different spots in Kane's life, said reporter named Jerry Thompson (Alland) as he attempts to answer the question posed to him by other journalists following a newsreel presentation. Just what did he mean by his last word? Arguably, the most famous one worded quote in cinema's history. The introduction of Charles Kane himself is disorientating and fits unevenly with the rest of the film; a proud and booming newsreel detailing Kane's life in the media and politics before advancement into some sort of mental illness akin to hording. The question follows the footage and it is proposed that the myth surrounding Kane is deconstructed, immediately establishing the idea of how one person can come across as one thing through either the media or word of mouth whereas getting down to brass tacks with them opens up all sorts of alternatives.<br/><br/>The first time we see Kane in 'real time' and indeed hear him speak, he cracks a joke and generally seems to have the audience on his side. This immediately goes against the prior opinion that he was a 'bad' man or a communist or a struggling individual. Kane seems charming, funny; even quite nice and from the newsreel to the real image Welles has firmly established it's about finding out the facts of the situation rather than settling with the fiction.<br/><br/>Initially, the film centres on Kane's becoming of a newspaper mogul as he, Mr. Bernstein (Sloane) and Jedediah Leland (Cotten) look to buy out an existing paper firm in New York. They do so, and the expulsion of the 'old' as poor Mr. Carter is relieved of his duty and the introduction of the 'new' (complete with the 'best of' from rival newspapers) sees Welles establish his character as one who is going to take the reins and just plough on ahead as this new force to be reckoned with. With this, his ideas of 24/7 news and 'all of the news all of the time', reverberate with us due to the technological climate we live in now whereas in the film, others can only dismiss it as impossible. So while outlandish at the time, and we recognise that, we get a feel for what Kane's envisaging in that one exchange.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, we observe Kane's subsequent divulge into politics and two failed marriages and the film takes a breather for Mr. Thompson, alá the audience, in the present time to ask further questions and really try to get under the skin of the situation. One of the film's more harrowing shots is Kane's reaction when an associate reads out the review his wife got at the previous night's opera as written by an employee. It's a progression of anger and confusion mixed with doubt as he wonders if it is jealousy, poor journalism or just the straight damn truth. Later, his wife will finish another performance and Kane attempts to cue a standing ovation, but he's lost his grip on the world and those around him – he no longer carries the influence he once had and consequently, every one remains silent. But it's really all just scratching the surface and the brilliance of the film cannot really be summed up here; just know that while easy to dislike through its reputation, is difficult to deny its intrigue once viewed."
"jesus_ninja_pants","4","2","6","13 April 2007"," Ultimately disappointing
","Citizen Kane is one of the most overrated movies of all time. I admit my skepticism is biased but i have good cause; To begin i would point out that this movies is utterly boring and since the point of a movie is to entertain this movie fails. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy some pretty ""boring"" films such as Stalker, but this movie truly offers me nothing entertaining. Although Citizen Kane is meant to be an insightful look into a mans life, it really isn't. All dialog is witty and sharp in a way completely lacks any human emotion. The way in which Kane's life is examined is done so in such a disconnected way that no sense of meaning can be taken from it. All in all it is a very vague, long, and boring movie presented in a way that reminds me of old time radio broadcasting where a blunt story is relayed through a series of even more blunt sound effects only in this instance blunt images are used.<br/><br/>Why is it rated so good then? The true reason is that Citizen Kane was a stepping stone in cinematography and special effects. Considering this aspect i can understand why it may have been revolutionary at the time; But in the modern day, it seems like nothing special."
"millenium88","10","2","6","21 September 2005"," I concur with
","the general view that ""Citizen Kane"" is probably the greatest American movie of all time.<br/><br/>The problem for me when it comes to films that are highly rated is that my expectation prior to actually seeing the movie is already very high. So high that 8 out of 10 times, the movie falls flat of that high expectation.<br/><br/>So it came as a mild surprise that ""Citizen Kane"" did NOT disappoint me when I saw it for the first time this month.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good in the first place is its dialog. The clever use of words by Herman Mankiewicz is both refreshing and titillating, adding a whole new dimension rarely seen in movies since or thereafter.<br/><br/>Running a close second is the superb acting performance given by the entire Mercury Theater ensemble. Leading the pack of course is Orson Welles' memorable portrayal of Charles Foster Kane. The 25 year old actor delivers a powerful and convincing debut presentation of an entire life encapsulated in 2 hours' worth of storytelling.<br/><br/>And what else can I add to Gregg Toland's pioneering cinematography that has not already been voiced out by so many expert and amateur critics alike?<br/><br/>Last but not the least is the music..... Bernard Herrmann is just wonderful. Listen to appreciate. Words are not enough.<br/><br/>Great story, great acting, great movie presentation..... are not these the elements of a great movie?

"Snow Leopard","Null","2","6","6 December 2001"," Still Pretty Impressive
","Still impressive after all these decades, today ""Citizen Kane"" is probably more admired and analyzed than it is enjoyed, but there is plenty to admire. Even for those who just want to watch a good movie, not to analyze one, there's a lot to see.  True, it's not really 'the greatest film ever made', especially because there isn't really such a thing, anyway, as 'the' one greatest film.  There are a lot of great films, and by almost any standard this is one of them.<br/><br/>Welles used his own skill and creativity along with his talented cast and crew to create a story that is a compelling character study and a thoughtful look at some significant aspects of life.  The main character was based on a notorious figure of the era, but Welles made it much more than a story limited to his times, by bringing out what was behind his characters, and making the audience understand what the characters did not see about themselves.  There are Kanes in every era (and also equivalents of those around him), some as large as the character himself, and others merely small-scale replicas.  Since the story is based on characters and on ideas, rather than on action, it can seem slow if you are expecting more activity, but it's a story that has something to offer.  <br/><br/>Its outstanding technical accomplishments and historical importance may not be so obvious now, only because Welles's ideas and techniques have influenced so many later movies in one respect or another, making much that was imaginative then seem commonplace now.  But it was quite an achievement all the same, and worthy of the attention it is still getting."
"jcarlos-96740","10","1","2","14 April 2020"," A cinematography masterpiece
","This is one of the few cases when a movie lived to his hype! I was only 3 minutes into this and I was already amazed about how could this movie be from 1941, the cinematography in this was way ahead of it's time. Orson Welles couldn't really have done nothing better when it comes to directing, the scenes were all, and I really mean all perfect! I won't even waste time talking about technical aspects because this is simply flawless! I thought that I'd seen beautiful movies in my life but this one is unmatchable! At the age of 25 he made his debut movie and not only directed but starred and gave us this beautiful piece of art.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story I really liked the storytelling with a summary of everything that happened in Kane's life in the public eye with that beautiful ""News on the March"" and then the movie proceeds to give us a closer look to who he really was by interviewing people close to him and giving us flashbacks about the past with the purpose to discover what his final word ""rosebud"" meant. It is though important to mention that the perspectives that the people who were closer to him gave to us are simply that, perspectives which the stories could've been influenced by their relationships.<br/><br/>The meaning of this word arises such a beautiful debate and reflection. The most common and direct understanding is that it refers to his childhood and times of innocence. The times when he was poor and had nothing were also the happiest of his life meaning that wealth can't buy happiness, we can have all the things in the world like Kane had and still feel empty and sad.
The second possible meaning has a much more interesting theory and is not so obvious. In the night that Kane met Susan he says that he was going to a warehouse to revisit some memories of his past and at this point is pretty obvious that the main thing that he wanted from there was the sleigh, so that sleight was the cause for him to be in that street that night and therefore meeting Susan. And what happens after he and Susan met? They start to have an affair. His political rival discovers the affair and uses that to expose him and then he loses the election and his wife also discovers and that causes their divorce. After the divorce his ex-wife and son died in a car accident and we only know this by the news on the beginning of the movie but Welles doesn't show us his reaction or anything to that. That changed everything because he was on the path to becoming governor and maybe one day president but now all he have is Susan and builts a million dollar opera house trying to prove that his wife is a special singer and that he made no mistake for being with her. And at the end when she leaves him he says ""rosebud"" because he remembers that was the pursue of that sleigh that made him go out that night that changed his life forever, the ideia that one single decision can change your entire life. The meaning of rosebud is ambiguous, maybe it meant the only time when Kane was truly happy and that he misses the most or maybe it reminded him of the reason to go out on the night that changed his life forever, or maybe it has another meaning but one thing we can all agree and it is said by that journalist at the end of the movie: ""No word can explain a man's life"".<br/><br/>For a 1941 movie was not boring at all and this is not coming from a old man, I don't seriously know how can someone find this boring. I really hope that no one attempts to remake this and ruin it because it can't get better than this even if it had colors. It's a movie that not only cinephiles but everyone should see at least one time in their life times!"

","It's been nearly 80 years since the original release of Citizen Kane and I imagine that any film fan worth their salt already knows the secret behind 'Rosebud', the final word uttered by newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) immediately before popping his clogs. But even if you are well aware of the significance of the word, this classic drama is still a must-see if only because of its status as one of the most important and critically acclaimed films ever made.<br/><br/>Somehow, I made it to the ripe old age of 52 without seeing Citizen Kane, but finally popped it in the DVD player to see what all the fuss is about, and while I wouldn't class it as a masterpiece myself (I believe I have very different criteria to most for that accolade), I did enjoy the film, finding it an engaging study of a powerful character, brilliantly portrayed by Welles, who goes convincingly from cocksure youngster with big ideas to an old man with more than a few regrets over the course of two hours.<br/><br/>Told through flashbacks recounted by various acquaintances of Kane, to a reporter trying to unravel the meaning of Rosebud, the film flits back and forth through the wealthy man's life: his childhood, when his parents became filthy rich and sent him East to be schooled; his building of a news empire; the Great Depression; his two marriages; a failed political career; and old age, as a recluse in his sprawling Florida mansion, Xanadu. It's a rocky ride through the ups and downs of Kane's life, in which the happiest moments were before a shed load of gold made him one of the richest men in the world (which should be a big clue as to what Rosebud refers, if you've spent your life living under a rock and don't already know).<br/><br/>The lack of a gratuitous sex/shower scene, ninjas, barbarians, talking animals, cyborgs, exploding heads and dwarfs mean that Citizen Kane doesn't get full marks from me, but even though it's far removed from my usual fare, I still had a good time (Welles had a great eye for an interesting shot, that's for sure). 7/10 -- glad to have finally ticked it off my list of essential classics."

","The fact that this film continues to inspire and demonstrate the craftsmanship that can go into film is extraordinary. Orson Wells delivers a tale of an epic individual who lives a life of many regrets. Through revolutionary techniques from extremely well thought out shots, incredible detail in scenery, and the use of light, are but a couple of examples of how Wells is able to orchestrate this masterpiece. The score is incredibly powerful and the overall morales the story teaches to this day have been cherished from generation to generation. Citizen Kane is without a doubt, a masterpiece in itself."

","Many old movies that are proclaimed as the some of greatest of all time can be very boring when watched today.
I've had had experiece with many movies.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is not one of those movies.<br/><br/>The first time I watched it I was surprised by how entertaining it was. It was fast paced, snappy, full of etremely effective dramatic sequences, dazzling camera work and an incredible performance by Orson Welles.<br/><br/>And it' still just as good today.<br/><br/>I love it."
"Dello_","9","1","2","19 March 2020"," Excellent but not the G.O.A.T.
","I was very interested in ""Citizen Kane"" because of all the praises I've always heard about it. I have to say that the movie is really good and its age is nowhere to be found, something that only the great movies are capable of. The screenplay is brilliant because it narrates the life of a man (I've read it was inspired by a real person) in very particular way: the first thing that happens in the movie is the death of the protagonist (Mr. Kane) and all the narration follows Mr. Thompson, a journalist that is in charge of solving a mystery about this man and the film jumps between different periods of Mr. Kane's life. There's a study about his life, his motivations, his merits and his weakness showing the results of the choices he made or others made for him. It's also great how the viewer perceives him because of the peculiar arc that he goes through. The other great thing of the movie is the direction that is inspired and enriches every dialogue. But now that I praised the movie for his qualities I want to say that I feel this movie is ""a bit"" overhyped. It's great but there are quite a few better movies. Is ""Citizen Kane"" a precursor? Yes. Did it influence the cinema industry? Absolutely. Is it like Dante Alighieri's ""Divina Commedia"" that a lot in vane has tried to reach? No, in the following 80 years there have been some (but not so much) better productions.
If you are interested in watching ""Citizen Kane"" you should clearly do it, but do not except to see the best thing of your life because you can probably been left disappointed."
"schroederagustavo","10","1","2","18 March 2020"," Still an amazing film
","Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and often mentioned as THE greatest ever, so expectations are undoubtedly high before watching a movie like this. It's been 80 years since this movie came out and it is still gripping, relevant and awesome. Leaving behind the countless ways this movie innovated and inspired countless other filmmakers to come after it, Orson Welles' masterpiece works as a drama, a movie filled with suspense and simply as a brilliantly told story about a very powerful man's life. I believe the last scene in the movie puts everything together nicely, when the newspaper guy says something along the lines of ""I don't believe one word can define a man's life. Charles Foster Kane was a man who got everything he ever wanted in life and then lost it. Rosebud was something he couldn't get."" I think this refers to how every single decision we make in our lives is important, and ends up tilting things towards the better or worse. Even though Charles Foster Kane found material success, his relationships suffered and therefore his own soul suffered, too. Rosebud is the representation of something pure that he can never get back: his childhood.<br/><br/>The way the story is told is very smart, as well. Showing us the story of Charles Foster Kane through the perspective of the people who knew him, people who loved and hated him (often both) and also of some who only kind of knew him. This allows us to realize that his life was very complicated and there no is real answer to whether he was a ""good"" man or a ""bad"" man. But it just shows that he was a very interesting character and his life was definitely worth paying attention to.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made. Is it the greatest? Well, I don't think anyone can answer that to any reasonable degree. It's certainly ""up there"". Like any other piece of art, the film is timeless and in 2020, upon third viewing, continues to impact me in how good it actually is as an extremely well told story. Great dialogue, first time acting for many and Welles' first feature film as a director. Awesome direction, cinematography and feels relevant to this day."

"movie_fan18","5","1","2","14 December 2019"," Despite Its Timeless Story And Impressive Photography, This Is A Highly Overrated Film That Fails To Maintain Audience Attention
","Recently this year, I went to the shops to buy some Blu-rays (yes, I don't use streaming). There on the shelf, I spotted a title that caught my attention. It was an iconic movie by the grand name of 'Citizen Kane'. Knowing what it was, I immediately yanked it out of the shelf and examined it. I could feel the disc communicating with me. 'Please buy me', it begged. 'You know what I am. I'm the greatest film in cinema history!' The temptation was irresistible, so I gave in and bought it to discover whether it's worthy of its championed honour or not.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' highly respected 1941 classic tells the story of a millionaire named Charles Foster Kane (Welles) and his unexpected death. About to die, he spontaneously utters the word 'rosebud', leading to an investigation conducted by a reporter in order to find out what the word meant. Their search makes them encounter the divorced wives and close friends of Kane's. They explain to the reporter their perspectives of Kane and the experiences they faced with him, both positive and negative, to help him discover the mystery of 'rosebud'. These explanations also allow the audience to piece together Kane's extraordinary life.<br/><br/>To me, Kane is simply a 1940s version of Donald Trump (or any other celebrity really). What makes the story timeless is that the subplot involving Kane's life focuses not only on a celebrity's contributions and impact on society, but on his/her own personal life. Kane may have done many remarkable things and earned tonnes of cash, but his relationships with his friends and his wives deteriorated mainly because of his dominating and selfish nature.<br/><br/>For a film that is almost eighty years old, it does feature some very impressive cinematography (it was nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar but it didn't win, it only won Best Writing), but a good story and good photography don't just make the greatest film of all time - every other aspect of filmmaking (eg. acting, entertainment, screenplay) must be top-notch in order to deem it the honourable name. The biggest problem the film suffers from is its lack of entertainment - the movie drags, is very talky and induces sleepiness when viewed at night. I watched 'Kane' during the day but I had to force myself to continue watching this tedious picture. It has unlikeable characters (especially its protagonist) and the script is filled with unnecessary dialogue, which was probably done in order to make the movie seem sophisticated and to make those fibsters who awarded this a ten-star mock the people who found it dull by commenting that they are 'not intelligent enough' or 'just don't get it'. I must be honest, but if a professor or some college student needs to reveal the concealed meanings of the film to help me enjoy it, the film is clearly not the best. Now, (spoilers ahead!) to save two (more like four) precious hours of your life, I think I have the right to explain what 'rosebud' actually is: it is the name of the sled Kane rode as a boy. There, I said it. Sounds random, right? According to a few sources (such as Roger Ebert's review), it states that the sled is a symbol of the innocence of childhood - it made Kane think about a much purer time in his life when he died (hence why he said it). It's a nice little connection, but it's not obvious to work out.<br/><br/>So, is 'Citizen Kane' the greatest film of all time? Absolutely not. And it's not one of the best either - I've seen much better films in my life. Those critics and 'geniuses' that awarded this a perfect score have a lot of explaining to do to prove why it's so good. If a random person walks up to me and claims that this is the supreme movie of all, I instantly think that they clearly haven't seen it and they're just jumping aboard the bandwagon. It's a very boring movie that will disappoint and waste your time. It's a great example of a film that should've really been a short film or a book. If you are interested in it, just read the plot on Wikipedia: you will get as many thrills as watching it and it will only take you a twenty-fourth of the film's entire duration to do it. Skip this and try 'The Third Man' instead.<br/><br/>Rating: 5.5/10"
"collegegirl5180","7","1","2","17 May 2019"," A classic!
","Citizen Kane, directed by Orson Welles is a classic of its time. Starting at the ""end"" rather than sequential order, Welles uses clever editing and constrats of hero and villain, giving the movie a unique touch. One thing about this film is its increased used of noticeable mise-en-scene, and its use of sequenced shots. The cinematography of this film was much more advanced than others of its time. The lighting of this film also made it as successful as it became. The lighting was deliberately placed to emphasize certain characters and setting. The camera was also placed at a low angel which gave the film a different feel than most. Overall, the film itself was pretty straightforward, but the lighting and cinematography gave the film the added aspect to make it worth seeing."
"chaswe-28402","10","1","2","24 November 2018"," Undeniably brilliant
","Kane is a great film: creative, courageous, original, deep and gripping, mentally stimulating, inventive, superbly shot, written, acted. It tells you things about the world and yourself. It is youthful, vigorous and vital. All the actors in Kane are beyond excellent. This film stays with you for the duration.<br/><br/>A number of the reviews on this site therefore make incredibly odd reading. It seems to have become the fashion to denigrate this remarkable film, and topple its position on the list, all the way down to number 72. Unbelievable ! Not too long ago a collection of self-appointed arbiters called Sight & Sound critics replaced Kane with Vertigo as their greatest film ever. Stupefying ! Vertigo ! That fantasy that didn't happen ! .<br/><br/>The nay-sayers appear to have no sense of history, and be incapable of relating a work to the times it was created in. Not that Kane is dated. In fact, its picture of American power, wealth, politics and corruption was re-enacted yesterday, and is still extant. All that was required was for Kane to shout ""lock him up"" when orating against Boss Jim Gettys. In his own words, Kane was an American. He wanted to make his country great, although he was only running for Governor. His life illustrated a profound truism: if you want to be a success, make sure you inherit a fortune; then you can make deals which lose a million a year for 60 years."

It's a drab chronicle of some man's life.<br/><br/>From Tarkovski and Bergman to Riddick and Guardians of the Galaxy I can find entertainment in movies in many shapes and sizes. But be it brainless action, suspense, existential pondering or mere wordless atmosphere, a movie has to give me something to munch on. Citizen Kane doesn't. I'll watch it again, for sure, but as of now, my impression of it aligns with Bergman's. A glorified bore of a movie."
"JohnHowardReid","10","1","2","13 June 2018"," Citizen Kane was voted the year's best film by the New York Film Critics
","Citizen Kane was voted the year's best film by the New York Film Critics. Ford narrrowly defeated Welles for Best Director.
Citizen Kane was also honored as Best Film by the National Board of Review, while Orson Welles shared Best Acting with twenty other players - including George Coulouris for Citizen Kane.
Citizen Kane came in number four on the Film Daily's 1941 poll of American film critics (behind Gone With The Wind, Sergeant York and The Philadelphia Story). A large group of international critics polled by Sight and Sound in 1971 were somewhat more generous. They named Citizen Kane as the Best Motion Picture of All Time.
In 1947 author Ferdinand Lundberg sued Welles, Mankiewicz and RKO for copyright infringement, claiming that Citizen Kane was partly based on his biography, ""Imperial Hearst"". The trial resulted in a hung jury, the case being eventually settled out of court when RKO paid all legal and court costs and a sum of $15,000 to Lundberg.
Shooting: 29 June 1940 to 30 October 1940. French release title: Le Citoyen Kane First shown in Paris: 3 July 1946.<br/><br/>COMMENT: It's a while since I've seen Citizen Kane. Must be nearly 5 years. Admittedly, television is not the best way to view the movie - in fact any movie made before 1970 - but beggars can't be gourmets. (I am speaking of course of public television. It would be unthinkable to watch Citizen Kane sprinkled with commercials). This explains why my recent reactions tend to vary. Sometimes I turn off the set at the finish and I think, Oh Lord! What a movie! And I sit alone in the dark for an hour, too ecstatically exhausted to move. Other times I think, Yes a great movie! Marvelous performances all around (all the more impressive when you are reminded in the film's wonderful end credits reprise that most of the principal players ""are new to motion pictures"") and some absolutely breathtaking scenes, but... Perhaps a little slow in places, perhaps a little too laborious, forced even? Perhaps Joseph Cotten's scenes could be trimmed? The voice of conscience is always a trifle boring, and Cotten is hardly a sparkling player anyway. Such heretical thoughts! I well remember the first time I saw Citizen Kane. Back in 1956 it was. The rights had been sold. An independent cinema in a distant suburb held a farewell screening of the 16mm print. Even in these far from ideal conditions, the film burst over me. It took months to recover from the shock. Citizen Kane was the most exciting movie ever made. Every single frame was an adventure in pictorial tension. It was so innovatively moody, so overpoweringly bizarre, so enthrallingly daring, so fascinatingly credible, who but a genius could have lit its sets, mastered its script and so admirably coaxed its colorful legion of players? First opinions are often the best!"

All you need to know is this: EVERYONE who has some association with film has seen Citizen Kane at least once. It's become the go-to example for comparing other movies against. And for good reason; Orson Welles constructed a classic that has survived its controversial blocking from William Randolph Hearst. And thank goodness the film survived that spineless-snake's shameless campaign to destroy the film outright. 'Fuck those' who dare destroy art that tells the audience a truth they NEED to see and hear: some men with a God-complex can leave words full of mystery, like 'Rosebud'.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a film of mystery, tragedy of a man who had it all, and ultimately leaves the world wondering what the hell his dying word meant. 76 years since its initial release and Citizen Kane is still perfectly watchable and essential film history for anyone and everyone who claims to be a lover of cinema.<br/><br/>IF you haven't seen Citizen Kane and claim to be a cine-buff then you haven't lived a full movie life quite yet; but you're already more than halfway there. 5/5 stars"

Whole movie spins around last word that Kane said which was Rosebud and throughout movie a man is getting stories about Kane and everything that he did. There is a lot of tension and mystery in the movie as plot goes with some incredible dialogues but after some time movie starts to feel like it's going to take forever to get even slight evidence of what really matters in the movie. How time passes it is evident that our leading man has changed very much and he just wants to be understood but everyone is leaving him slowly and it is killing him. There are some hits of what Rosebud might be because of globe with snow inside it brings memories from his childhood and that it had to do with time when he was still with his real parents and in final scene you are revealed that while his snowboard is burning down that was the mystery.

","This film focuses on the figure of Mr. Kane, an important news baron that just passed away, leaving the journalists grappling with its mysterious and enigmatic last words. Directed and written by Orson Welles, who also gives life to the lead role, this film also has the participation of other players and is considered by many the best film ever made.<br/><br/>First of all, its necessary to clarify one thing: despite the opinions of many people consider this movie the best ever, these considerations are ALWAYS subjective and likely to be discussed. Each person has the right to think of another way, like it or not, period. Now let's get down to business.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie for the first time I was not able to understand or to see why it was so acclaimed by critics. Currently I'm most able to understand the reasons. The actors glittered in their roles, particularly Welles, who would become one of the film's biggest names in his time. The script is simple, but it tells a good story, which addresses such important issues as the simplicity and true happiness. Its a film made with love by those involved, where every detail has been thought and rethought. The use of non-linear narrative, through the use of constant flashbacks, allows the public to see the life of the deceased millionaire, a missing character, but always present. The scenarios are excellent and even the camera angles were thought innovatively. For all that, this film was considered a landmark. It doesn't have a history that goes stay forever in our memory, but it was a film that showed to the industry that certain narrative techniques, light, shooting etc. were truly possible.<br/><br/>So, my advice is to forget the critics, specialists and experts. Forget that is an acclaimed film and see the movie, enjoy the film before you think about it."

","I've seen this movie twice, once in my film history class, and once at the local theater.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie, it's awesome.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is beautifully directed, it's artistic in its direction, and the set-pieces are breathtaking. <br/><br/>Orson Welles is fantastic in the title role, he's mean, he's evil, he's charismatic, and he has a lot of charisma. I loved the artistic choices that showcased the character. There are moments when the character turns nasty personality wise, he becomes consumed in darkness, and you can barely see his face. I loved the scene during the Opera performance, Kane knows the show is bad, but he continues to clap, when he stands up, he's covered in darkness, he claps louder than the audience, and now you can see he's only clapping because of his ego.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane showcases the rise and fall of a tycoon. ""You know, Mr. Bernstein, if I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man."" - Charles Foster Kane<br/><br/>When the movie started, I kinda wasn't into it, it felt like a really bad comedy, I was worried that the entire movie was going to be like that, and I was dead wrong. After the introduction, the movie changed gears, the opening was just a documentary in the making, and the people making it where missing one crucial piece, Rosebud.<br/><br/>Kane's dying word was, Rosebud. What is Rosebud, it's Kane's old snow sled, when he was a child, he played with it, and it symbolized his innocence before he became wealthy and powerful.<br/><br/>The movie chronicles the story of Charles Foster Kane through the eyes of friends, employees, public information, and his ex-wife, however, there's still a mystery involved because the crucial information can't be found, Rosebud.<br/><br/>Rosebud is a piece of information that isn't discovered. By the end of the movie, Rosebud is burned, and the secret dies with Mr. Kane. I like that the movie wasn't traditional and it ended on a sad note. At first I was upset by the ending because they just burned the damn sled, but then it's symbolic because his whole life wasn't privatized, and this one significant thing is his only real secret. Rosebud is a remembrance of his youth and when things were innocent, it's the only real pure thing in Kane's life, he gets to die with a sense of that long forgotten purity, and he takes his purity to his grave. A piece of Kane died when he left his sled behind, but then he got that piece back when he actually did die."

Citizen Kane was utterly fantastic regarding its technical aspects, and full of groundbreaking visuals. There were plenty of different and interesting camera angles being used. Every shot was meticulously planned, and the cinematography was outstanding. I really liked all the little lighting tricks, and the lighting really added to the atmosphere of the film. The editing was also interesting and really brought all the shots together. Welles managed to put together a complex story loaded with symbolism. It's understandable that many people find Citizen Kane boring, but the story is simply a slow build, and takes a little bit of patience on the viewer's part.

""Citizen Kane"" directed by Orson Wells also stars the incredibly talented director as our protagonist Charles Fster Kaneloosely based on the successful life of William Harst. what truly makes this picture so unique is the form of which is is shot, filmed, and edited. not only is this story told through a reporters research of the late mr. Kane but it is expressed using flash backs of the life and legacy of the wealthy and successful publisher. what is also very powerful about this film is that wells wrote directed and starred in this American classic. wells wrote a legacy of his own. this entire film is not even for a second about the what is happening to the world, or a society, or a family, or to a relationship, or a man. it is dedicated to observing and analyzing one character."

","This is a terrific film. The screenplay is outstanding, the acting is great as is the cinematography, which broke ground evidently. By having many morals ranging from wealth to happiness and getting every little detail right. Orson Wells crafts a picture that tells a simple, subtle story that works brilliantly in capturing your attention from the first frame onwards. The cast do an immaculate job in their performances and each actor brings something unique to the screen to really make this film standout among other classics. Wells direction is terrific and he is able to craft a story that uses basic elements to create something truly remarkable with this picture. This film will have you thinking well after it is over."

","When this movie first starts out, we hear the famous Charles Kane mutter his last word, Rosebud. As the audience views this scene, we are left to wonder who this man was and what that one last word is supposed to mean. Of course, the people surrounding Kane are curious as well what this man could possibly mean. Fellow reporters are determined to find out what this man could've meant and almost go crazy trying to discover what he would mean. We are taken through a series of flashbacks of Kane's life and how he became so successful and why this last word was so important. This movie is all about the journey of success, power and greed. I would recommend this movie because of all of the mystery and suspense provided throughout the movie."
"mleonardo60","Null","1","2","10 March 2016"," Citizen Kane (1941), Orson Welles
","The first feature film made by Orson Welles, it is hailed by many as the greatest single movie of all time. While I may not agree with that statement, it would be difficult for me to disagree. It is one of, if not the most aesthetically pleasing films of its generation. A modern film-maker would be challenged to shoot a movie as beautifully as Citizen Kane was shot, even given modern technologies and CGI.<br/><br/>When it comes to characters, one would have a difficult time finding a more dynamic one than Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). Kane is essentially three different people throughout the movie, and the viewer is convinced of each personality the character takes on.<br/><br/>If Citizen Kane is not the greatest film of all time, it could never be ruled out of the discussion."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","2","20 February 2016"," A great story that stands the test of time.
","I was very glad that I knew almost nothing about this movie before watching it outside of its being very acclaimed. It's pretty clear why it's so well renowned due to it's great central character and driving question of ""who or what is Rosebud?"". Without giving any spoilers, I was totally shocked by the revelation of Rosebud at the end. It really ties in well to Kane's personality, because Rosebud reminds him of the only time in his life that he felt loved and wasn't just millions of dollars of inherited money.<br/><br/>Kane is a rather tragic figure. He is a nice guy that wants to do something good, but has that insatiable desire to be loved by people. This desire is the flaw that keeps him from relating to people and drives all of his actions. He tries several different ways to get people to love him, and most of these means seem positive on the surface. But somehow Kane just can't trust himself to fully commit to something. He ""thinks it would be fun"" to run a newspaper; he doesn't think it would be fulfilling or fruitful or a good experience. And while he puts a lot of effort into running the Inquirer, he has no sense of how to make profit with it. Part of his dilemma also takes root in his money. He recognizes that he has more money and time than he knows what to do with, so he throws his money away on whims like building an entire theater for his second wife Susan. He thinks that he can buy his friends, but his money can't buy their trust. His wives, though completely different in personality, both leave him because they feel unloved by Kane. By the end of the chronology, everyone close to Kane has abandoned him including his entire newspaper staff, two wives, and his parents.<br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of the minor characters. Jedediah Leland is the most pessimistic and has little sympathy for Kane. Emily, Kane's first wife, is not given much screen time, but is the first example of how Kane hurts the people he comes in contact with and leaves them feeling bitter. Mr. Bernstein seems to have some more sympathy for Kane, but still sees his flaws. Susan remembers him with hatred for his the ignorance and materialism that Kane treated her with. I wish they could have gone a bit more in depth with the reporter researching Kane's life. In some ways it's his role to be an Everyman and giving him a personality might kind of tell the audience how to react rather than letting them react. Still, I can't remember ever seeing the reporter's face clearly or hearing any real emotion from him. It's interesting to see how all of Kane's old friends turn out later in life and how they remember him. He seems to have left a pretty notable impression on each of them, but none of them remember him fondly, or at least that isn't their primary memory of him.<br/><br/>As it was made some seventy years ago, it doesn't come off as very technically striking. But the directing is remarkably engaging for the time it was made. Some of the acting felt a little unrealistic, but for the most part the characters feel real. This is especially noteworthy considering that, as is stated in the credits, most of the actors had never been in anything else. Orson Wells is great as Kane with his intense expressions. The only time his acting felt off was when he trashes Susan's bedroom after she walks out on him. However, I would assume that scene was done in only one or two takes, so the acting is excusable. The script also kept the characters distinct and kept the story moving at a good pace. I especially liked how it hinted at some things that came later in Kane's life such as Susan and Xanadu.<br/><br/>If you're someone who mainly seeks entertainment from movies, this won't probably entertain you like modern movies. But if you are willing to watch with some thought and enjoy a deep story, you won't find many that are better than this. Anyone looking to write stories, whether for film or not, with strong characters should watch this. I would really recommend that you watch the whole thing through if only to learn the meaning of Rosebud. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."

"raticalim","8","1","2","6 February 2016"," A Movie Worth Watching
","As a film student who wants to make films of his own, I had to watch Citizen Kane. The greatest movie of all time? A masterpiece? Well I wouldn't say that it's the greatest movie of all time. However it is worth a great deal. It's a movie with a central theme you see in a lot of cinema, television, and novels of the past few centuries (it is a very common theme you could apply to anything really). However Citizen Kane does it in a very unique way. The film centers around a man who's been given everything in his life. His education, his fortune, and his pride. All of these things were gifted to him by the choice of his Mother. Seeking to give her son a better life after discovering she owned a wealthy gold mine, he is ripped from a quaint life in the west to a life of riches and (as mentioned before) higher education and class. The film centers around ""Rosebud"", the point of stability that Kane uses in his older years to remind him of a different time. And one man's quest as to what Rosebud means. Ultimately the quest for Rosebud is abandoned, as only the man himself might know what it means. It is discovered at the end that it is his sled that was named Rosebud the whole time (I kinda had a hunch at the beginning after he is gifted a new sled to replace it at the beginning of the film). What this means to me is Kane looking back on older, better times. Before his life was made more complicated. Kane states at the beginning that he's close to what he wanted to be, but that he'd rather have earned what he made. Kane wanted love in his life because he was deprived of that when he was young. He would've rather spent life with people who loved him, that he loved in return. Rosebud is the trust between his family and him, something he lost when he was taken from them to a different life. Perhaps the life of a different man. Rosebud is everything that Kane lost, and perhaps more. Overall the movie holds up pretty well for its age. This movie isn't the greatest of all time, because there is no greatest film of all time. Every film has something to offer to different people, and you won't find the same thing in every film. However Citizen Kane is a film I recommend you see at least once, just so that you can decide for yourself if Kane is right for you."

","Orson Welles' great movie (justifiably called a masterpiece) is loaded with so many complex details that it is hard to sort them all out and make any one main point about it. But I think if we talk about the subject matter, or one of the most obvious sources of inspiration behind it, we can be a bit clearer and more direct.<br/><br/>Mostly, I feel the film itself talks around who Hearst really was. When I was in film school, a professor expounded upon the gimmick of Rosebud, as the hook that keeps the viewer going till the end of the story. But I think the real-life William Randolph Hearst, then still alive and known to all in the western hemisphere, was the true gimmick. Welles picked someone more well known than God to parody, knowing this thinly veiled spoof would at least appeal to the news tycoon's detractors, as well as those fascinated by his extravagant lifestyle. Not to mention his sordid relationship with his mistress.<br/><br/>It would be the same today if Oliver Stone made a film about Rupert Murdoch. We wouldn't expect it to be a documentary necessarily. But we would expect it to be about power and control over the media. And about a flawed human being."

The acting is terrific and the and the suspense building up in the film was fantastic. The lighting was dramatic without being too over the top. Its very interesting how Wells uses low camera angles to make the central characters seem absurdly tall, this is a very successful technique. The ending was outstanding and very satisfying.

","This film was great, the way that time was portrayed was pretty cool: using the makeup department to tell us how old Kane was becoming and also what was happening. In the opening scene we see Kane, an old man in bed saying his final words, then we're brought to the past, a childhood memory of Kane with his ""Rosebud."" Flashbacks was one of the most important tools in this film. Throughout the film we're brought from one point in time to another, each scene holding some type of significance. The way in which the cinematography carried out each scene was incredible. This film was sad in a way. We're giving this character (round character), a man who wants to be successful and a man who wants to be loved by everyone. He doesn't realize that he doesn't need love from many to be happy because he already had it from is second wife...or is it his third? I'm not certain but in the end its terrible, he suffers."

","Citizen Kane is widely regarded as 'the greatest film of all time'. After seeing it at the top of the American Film Institute 100 list i decided to actually watch it and i can safely say that after i watched it, you can certainly see why. spoilers ahead so if you haven't seen it don't read on.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a few dark and dreary shots of Xanadu, (essentially a palace owned by Charles foster Kane) building up tension before zooming close to the small snow dome ball he has in his hand, Then he utters 'Rosebud' the most famous line in movie history. The snow dome ball is then dropped and the story begins.<br/><br/>After a short documentary on Charlie Kane has been shown the men at the magazine begin to sought after the meaning of his final utterance.<br/><br/>Charlie Kane's parents inherited a mine which happened to be rich in gold. His parents sign the bill to Walter parks thatcher which gives him the authority to raise Charles in extreme luxury. This scene is very sad indeed the boy is reluctant to leave his parents but in the end succumbed to Mr. thatcher and sets away with him we see a close up of Charlie's sled which then becomes neglected in the snow. <br/><br/>That is a huge scene and a sad one at that. The investigative reporter Thompson triggers every flashback by questioning his old alcoholic wife Susan Alexander Kane, his old wilting friend Jedediah Leland and his rich associate Mr. Bernstein.<br/><br/>We learn about his beginning in the publishing business from Mr. Bernstein from when he took over the inquirer to the marriage of the presidents niece. When the flashback is over Bernstein says ""maybe rosebud was something he lost, Kane was a man who lost everything he had"" At this point we are intrigued to learn more about Mr Kane who seems to be an enigma.<br/><br/>The story then builds character depth for Charlie and the rest making us feel a lot along the way, i can say that the cinematography is a huge part in this and the way Welles acts as Charlie Kane is exceptional, the supporting cast are great too Joseph Cotten puts in a key performance. latter stages of the film will now be explored.<br/><br/>The penultimate flashback about old Charlie Kane and the rockiness of his relationship with Susan, she sits alone in Xanadu playing jigsaw puzzles to pass the time feeling lonely and bored the subsequent shot, she begins to argue with Charlie saying that despite having all these items bought for her none of them mean anything implying Charlie has bribed her into making her think he is a generous man who cares and making her love him, the next shot shows Susan leaving Charlie it then backs out of the flashback to Susan telling Thompson that she advises him to speak to Charlie's butler at Xanadu he sets off to find him.<br/><br/>The final flashback is triggered by Raymond the butler, we see a wonderfully acted scene by Orson Welles trash up the room throwing everything down in it's path bed sheets, shelves, mirrors, everything you could think of apart from one thing the Small glass snow dome, Charlie picks this up and says ""rosebud"" we know from this shot that because it stopped the crazy outburst it is something extremely sentimental to him but at this point we are still not sure exactly what rosebud means. The members of the magazine are reunited with Thompson at Xanadu which is completely full of statues and other material objects purchased by Charlie Kane, They ask Thompson did you find out what rosebud means ? he responds ""no i didn't, i don't think a single word can describe a single mans life my guess is that rosebud was something he lost or something he couldn't get, anyway i don't think it would have explained anything"". The famous shot of the camera slowly making it's way past all of the junk to the sled he once had as a child, we here the butler say ""burn all this useless junk"" the sled is then thrown into the fire where we see the close up of 'Rosebud' the paint then curls and the film ends.<br/><br/>This film gives me a huge bone chilling feeling every time i watch it to the final scene where we see rosebuds meaning it fills us with deep sadness and huge empathy towards Charles foster Kane, we found out that rosebud symbolised innocence, a memory of a once normal childhood playing in the snow, youth and happiness. <br/><br/>This film tells us that although you can be the richest man in America you can still be extremely lonely, happiness can not be fulfilled purely by money nor can it buy love or friendship there is a famous line in the film where Charles Kane says ""You know Mr. Bernstein if i hadn't have been really rich i might have been a really great man"" Charles Kane just wanted to lead a happy life like most of us."

He knows how to work the business and make it so you get pulled into his art. His style is very creative and inventive. He makes the story exciting while making the graphics work beautifully along with it. When watching this movie you can tell this was a high point in movie history and I would recommend it to anyone.

A group of reporters try to find out what he meant by this. Most of the movie is told in flashback form when the reporters interview people.

","I think that Citizen Kane's story line is to simplistic and unbelievably boring. I think that it does hold some neat aspects to it since it does jump around from the past to the present, but even with this element, it is surprisingly easy to follow. Because of this, it made watching the movie very dull and tedious. Since it was boring, the entire time I was watching the movie I felt that I was trying to figure out if I was missing a bigger picture or I wasn't grasping the true meaning of the film. I felt like I was missing something which maybe took away from the film itself. But then during those final scenes did it all come together and make sense. In the end it wasn't that bad of a movie. <br/><br/>I did LOVE the lighting aspect in this film. It was a very bright film! I loved the way that the light reflected off the character's faces.

"JosephPezzuto","8","1","2","21 October 2014"," Reel Look: 'Citizen Kane'
","""Rosebud..."" When experienced screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz collaborated with Welles on a screenplay originally called ""The American"", it was going to be based on the life of Willaim Randolph Hearst. Hearst in his time had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services. To top it all off over his achievements and successes, he then built to himself the flamboyant mansion of San Simeon; a castle that only came to be furnished by rummaging through the remains of numerous countries. What more can be said about this milestone in cinematic history that has not been said to death? I, in turn, will continue to do so thus. Let's take a look.<br/><br/>In retrospect of this phenomenal film full of depth and physical manifestation, Orson Welles' tour de force 1941 masterpiece 'Citizen Kane' indeed earns the rights to be regarded as ""the greatest movie ever made"" due to its magnificent themes, metaphors and camera angles. Here, we meet William Randolph Hearst (a twenty-five year old Welles), a newspaper tycoon who eventually metamorphoses into an aging, lonely old man with hardly a spark left for a soul. Hearst was the Ted Turner, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet of his day, encompassed and ensnared in an egocentric oasis. The aftermath of Hearst had effects on both the movie and Orson Welles' career by engaging the viewer into a world where power and greed can eventually lead into emptiness and depravity. Hearst and the character of Charles Foster Kane diminish slowly together on a long, sorrowing note, ending their lives with a somewhat similar void that could never be gained back. His dying word ""Rosebud"" (an extreme close-up of his giant rubbery lips before releasing a snow globe that crashes to the floor) encapsulates and summarizes his very existence as a man of power has every aspect and viewpoint snatched from his once-iron clutches. A news reel obituary ""News On The March"" tells the life story of Kane, as one of the viewers, a reporter named Jerry Thompson (William Alland, a thankless role in which we never see his face) is tasked to discover the meaning behind that last puzzling word uttered ""Rosebud"" via interviewing friends and associates of the now-deceased magnate. We then sojourn through memories and hauting shadows of the past of a once wealthy man with a hollow existence, echoing that from promising beginnings with newspapers to that of the abandoned Xanadu. Through vivid memory and recollections, we go back to when, as a boy, we see he was taken east to a boarding school, losing security, hope and innocence all too soon by his parent's forbidding choice for a ""promising future"" (his mother played by Agnes Moorehead). This role would be played throughout he spectrum of his whole life, leaving him completely drained of something he lost and could never gain again. An example being when tries to make his mistress and second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) an opera star, only as the camera pans up to a stagehand above holding his nose. Kane had spoken and entertained millions, but as his life came to a close, he died alone in his enormous and luxurious palatial estate in Xanadu that had died along with him, surrounded by priceless artifacts from around the globe that he could never take to the grave excepting a single untouchable source: his own inner turmoil. A vast palace of great and powerful splendor was now an empty shell, along with its now deceased and powerless owner. Kane may have died in the picture nonetheless, but Orson Welles' unforgettable portrayal of him and his directorial debut boosted his career even higher to continue on to making more wonderful films.<br/><br/>The metaphors in this film are very clear for someone with a keen and observant eye. It is these bravura moments that truly capture the essence of the picture itself. For example, when Kane is sitting with his first wife at the dinner table, the camera shows a newspaper headline and then goes back to them. As this goes on, we see them separating more and more from each other as a new headline appears. It is showing the viewer on where their relationship is going and how it is going to end: estranged with nothing but a large gap between them. Another moment is when Kane is alone in his darkened, barren office talking with an inebriated Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten). Here the camera angle is show looking up at them from the ground, implying a defeated Kane feeling as hollow as the newspaper room in which he works. A third example is when we see the many Kane reflected through the parallel mirrors, each one the same shape and persona. It is here that Kane is who he is, which will always be his enigma for the people he knew as for himself.<br/><br/>This spectacular masterpiece should not be missed by anyone. On this being the second viewing of this film in my life, and probably not being the last, I too have noticed things that I have overlooked before. Though I have only scratched the service and papers upon papers have been written about this cornerstone of cinema, seventy plus years later it still remains a powerhouse of brilliant achievement for Welles and for the generation of cinema that forever raises the bar of genius filmmaking."

","A masterpiece about a man who is obsessed with himself and his earnings and his pride.<br/><br/>It's about a man and his Rosebud, and the rosebud symbolises so much than we can even understand.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a fictional character mind you, yet is done so realistically by Orson Welles.<br/><br/>This was the greatest off beat film in 1941 coz when more films were on war related issues or thrillers this was on a person a megalomaniacal self obsessed and an eccentric character. This was a film made by a man who for the first ever in the Hollywood history was given complete control by studios and asked to make any film he wanted. Orson Welles made this film, a masterpiece. Orson is extremely passionate and has a great visual there are no close ups or no heavy background score yet there is an inherent tension created just with lighting and the expression.<br/><br/>Wow, a man who is so near yet so far far far away. It symbolises a lot in this film. Charles Foster Kane walks in his final stages and what has he got is nothing. Just before this shot, he holds a piece and says ""Rosebud"" which were his last dying words. The film begins with people trying to know, media trying to know what is Rosebud, the last dying words of Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>It means so much, it means blossom, it means innocence, it means serenity and all is lost. At the end when Leland says ""All he wanted out of life was love"". And Charles after being whatever he was, has lost it. <br/><br/>Its subtly symbolic, technically by far the greatest and characteristically, enigmatic and unforgettable. You just can't have so many good things in one from a first time director, but Orson, the guy made an unmistakable masterpiece that has stood the test of time and even 70 years, it's Blu Ray seems great and the sales speak for themselves what a film this is. <br/><br/>A 5/5 for one of my favorite films and intact I have seen it so many times and yet I keep learning so much. This reminds me of one thing ""Character, Character, Character. The characteristics of characters drive the emotion of the cinema, great characters make great cinema"".<br/><br/>I still can't get enough of this film. Will revisit this film time and again for sure.<br/><br/>Two things, that were technically far more superior than most movies in 1940's was lighting and sound.

","What else can be said about CITIZEN KANE that hasn't been already said? Some viewers describe it as the greatest movie of all time; others consider it rubbish. Produced by the wunderkind of the classical Hollywood era, the film incorporates most of the Mercury Theater cast who had spent most of their time working with Welles in New York.<br/><br/>Thematically speaking, it is an incredibly daring film for its time, in that it attacked precisely those forces of capitalism that drove the Hollywood studios. Like Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), the studios enjoyed a monopoly over the production and distribution of their products; and could distribute whatever forms of propaganda they wished. If we accept that CITIZEN KANE is in part based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, then the link between Hollywood and the newspapers becomes more pronounced, as Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), the would-be opera star who fails on her debut, is a fictional representation of Hearst's belle Marion Davies, who had an equally distinguished Hollywood career.<br/><br/>Welles' satire of the shallowness of capitalism is chiefly communicated through the interaction between Kane and his closest associate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), who works closely with Kane on improving the circulation of the ""New York Inquirer,"" but soon realizes how Kane's judgment changes almost daily. The list of ""principles"" that Kane sets forth, when taking over the newspaper, become lost as the tycoon becomes more and more obsessive in his desire for power. In an important sequence, Kane opens an envelope sent by Leland, and finds the principles crumpled up inside, together with a torn check. Money, it seems, cannot buy everything.<br/><br/>What sets CITIZEN KANE apart from other movies is the complexity of its visual score. Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography is just magical, especially in the scenes taking place at Xanadu (Kane's residence), where the sheer size and scope of the property has been emphasized. There are some memorable shots - notably the image of Kane as reflected in a hall of mirrors, suggesting that nothing exists beneath the surface. Welles and Toland also achieve some memorable sequences shot from the floor upwards looking at the characters - a strategy that not only emphasizes their sheer size (and domination of the frame), but reinforces the film's major theme of the desire for power. Such shots are contrasted with the shots at the end, where the camera tracks backwards, focusing on Kane's possessions which become smaller and smaller and more and more insignificant as the shot continues. The film subsequently cuts to a shot of Xanadu with flames coming out of the chimney, emphasizing the total destruction of Kane's world.<br/><br/>The experience of watching CITIZEN KANE demands our attention; every sequence, it seems, is carefully structured, with a precise concern for lighting and scenic design. The cast are just brilliant; every actor, it seems, has been ideally cast for their roles. This is the kind of film that can be watched again and again; on each viewing, it seems, something new can be discovered."

","This review is made 72 years after the movie came out, by now, people are becoming more addicted to movies with great special effects, CGI, and careful editing for it to be appealing to themselves, they never try out new genres, they just stick to one.<br/><br/>This movie however is a must-see for them, it's a movie to all people of all ages (technically not all ages).<br/><br/>Orson Welles's film debut is an astonishing start to his career. This movie had memorable scenes & lines that for everyone who saw it will remember it forever. The fast talking and complicated plot might be confusing to most children, but that's just an element most old movies should have.<br/><br/>This movie might have might have mixed reviews, it still keeps its title for one of the greatest films of all time."

","This is one of those historic movies that people are either raving about, or trying to bash it. This argument weighed on my mind when I first watched this film, but I found quickly that it has been praised for great reasons. Orson Welles, starring, directing, and producing, did a great job in all three roles he had. Much of this film is told through flashbacks, and goes to show the rise to prominence of Charles Foster Kane, but keys in on the mystery of Rosebud. What does it mean? The mystery will not be revealed here, you have to find out for yourself. This film was named an iconic piece of American cinema for a reason. To fully understand and appreciate it, you have to see the film. Only then can you judge and decide."

","This film deserved to be seen in the theater with friends, not at home. When I saw this film I was unprepared by the excessive background information. It is a story about a man who was very wealthy,that's really all you need to know. If you enjoy films just take the time to see this one. Have fun using your imagination, think of this man's life, think of your own and think of what the director is trying to create. I hope your first time seeing Citizen Kane will be enjoyable.The second part of the plot was shorter but it's a key part of the film. It starts with a shot of Kane, at this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words ""Rosebud"", and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's associates to find out what rosebud could possibly mean. The conversations between the journalist and Kane's associates turn into flashbacks which forms the whole film wonderfully and create an unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to not follow."

","It is easy to see why some people wonder how Citizen Kane appears first or at least in the top five on all-time great movie lists. It lacks so many things that we like about movies. It has very little action and there are few if any characters that are likable or for whom we feel anything. There is nobody we worry about or cheer for. The storyline is also minimal and the final revelation prosaic rather than genuinely meaningful. The word ""Rosebud"" was a McGuffin and just a rather contrived excuse for doing a fragmented biographical piece on a newspaper tycoon. The film has been lauded for its cinematography, innovative direction, stylization and perhaps its soundtrack both in terms of music and sound effects. However, for many it becomes a case of the director packing too many tricks into a film rather than using them only when they truly add to the meaning or impact of certain scenes. Hitchcock loved having a subjective camera search for its protagonists as in the start of ""Psycho"" but Hitch knew when to say when with his cinematography techniques. Lastly, I can understand that some would say that by the constant over-rating ""Kane"" over the past seven decades, it has led to a blindly uncontested acceptance of its greatness. Few would dare to call the Mona Lisa an over-rated painting of a renaissance woman who just wouldn't say cheese.Perhaps the thing that is most unappealing to some is the lack of warmth or charm. Is it just too clinical? Is it the product of a mind that had little or no real empathy with the rest of the human race - somewhat like Kane who campaigned for the rights of the people without the slightest hint of understanding their point of view?<br/><br/>Now for the nevertheless. Nevertheless, I can understand why some people still see ""Kane"" as a landmark film that should be acknowledged as a turning point in film making. It does have scenes that remain astonishing even by today's standards. It is a demanding film which requires adult concentration much as symphonic music needs us to fully engage with it. It is not a pop song. And there is no doubt that those who like ""Kane"" do really like it and are not just playing at being aficionados. There is something that touches those who like or even love ""Kane"" that is personal and perhaps difficult to define. <br/><br/>I just wonder whether in fifty years' time, after the 20th century people like me are gone and perhaps the myth and mystique surrounding ""Citizen Kane"" has faded, will it still be considered anywhere near the top ten all-time great movies. Will its rather mysterious hold on many people persist? I am pretty sure that few in the 1940's on first viewing would have predicted that it would still be considered top five in 2014."

","I just saw this classic film for the first time and did so at a rep theatre and it was jaw dropping how amazing this movie actually was. It probably helped that I went into this expecting it to be a cheesy melodrama and very over rated because I also saw Magnificent Ambersons previously and thought it was not nearly as good as I had been led to believe by people. But Citizen Kane is everything that it is advertized to be. The acting is top rate and I would put the performances of the cast up against any other movie I have ever seen. The writing and directing is also top notch and the story is very entertaining and interesting."

","The structure of ""Citizen Kane"" is circular, adding more depth every time it passes over the life. The movie opens with newsreel obituary footage that briefs us on the life and times of Charles Foster Kane; this footage, with its portentous narration, is Welles' bemused nod in the direction of the ""March of Time"" newsreels then being produced by another media mogul, Henry Luce. They provide a map of Kane's trajectory, and it will keep us oriented as the screenplay skips around in time, piecing together the memories of those who knew him.<br/><br/>Curious about Kane's dying word, ""rosebud,"" the newsreel editor assigns Thompson, a reporter, to find out what it meant. Thompson triggers every flashback, yet his face is never seen. He questions Kane's alcoholic mistress, his ailing old friend, his rich associate and the other witnesses, while the movie loops through time. But it remains elusive: By flashing back through the eyes of many witnesses, Welles and Mankiewicz created an emotional chronology set free from time.<br/><br/>Along with the personal story is the history of a period. ""Citizen Kane"" covers the rise of the penny press the Hearst-supported Spanish-American War, the birth of radio, the power of political machines, the rise of fascism, the growth of celebrity journalism. A newsreel subtitle reads: ""1895 to 1941. All of these years he covered, many of these he was."" The screenplay by Mankiewicz and Welles (which got an Oscar, the only one Welles ever won) is densely constructed and covers an amazing amount of ground, including a sequence showing Kane inventing the popular press; a record of his marriage, from early bliss to the famous montage of increasingly chilly breakfasts; the story of his courtship of Susan Alexander and her disastrous opera career, and his decline into the remote master of Xanadu.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" knows the sled is not the answer. It explains what Rosebud is, but not what Rosebud means. The film's construction shows how our lives, after we are gone, survive only in the memories of others, and those memories butt up against the walls we erect and the roles we play. There is the Kane who made shadow figures with his fingers, and the Kane who hated the traction trust; the Kane who chose his mistress over his marriage and political career, the Kane who entertained millions, the Kane who died alone.<br/><br/>There is a master image in ""Citizen Kane"" you might easily miss. A man always seems the same size to himself, because he does not stand where we stand to look at him."

","Through all movies this is the score which I give to this one. For its time he deserves more. But we are in other moment of the time/space continuum.<br/><br/>Most probably every one of us had period in his life in which he wanted to be very rich. To be famous and known from everybody. To wealth and fame we can add the utopian idea this character to be noble, selflessness, robinhoodian. And what is the price for this when it really happen? This movie shows the life of Charles Kane, personification of the mentioned image above. He, from flash and bones, lived in the beginning of the previous century. Torn apart from his native home and his parents, the real things which he has are friendship and love. But they could not fill the opened wound.<br/><br/>About this - what we want and what we receive, how much our life is our property and about the value of the material goods.

"Dabaens","8","1","2","25 June 2013"," Raised the bar for presentation & storytelling.
","Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' is a classic film about a successful American entrepreneur, Charles Foster Kane, and retraces the events of his life up until his mysterious last words, ""rosebud"". The film encompasses a unique style of cinematography for its time, some of which had never been tried in film before. Every small aspect of this film has a significant meaning that serves a purpose to each scene, and is sometimes hard for the average viewer to pick up. Things like the positioning of the props and the lighting cast on the characters' faces are purposefully conducted to express the filmmaker's capabilities. The film's cinematographer, Gregg Toland, incorporated a lot of new and unusual techniques for that age, and set a whole new standard for presentation in movies.<br/><br/>The most notable quality of 'Citizen Kane' is the use of mise en scène throughout the movie. Each character is placed in a specific place on the set, in order to allow the camera to free flow through the scene, capturing multiple angles of the same scene. Everything is in plain view without any obstruction, not to mention all in sharp focus due to Toland's use of deep focus. The setting is usually grand and sometimes seems somewhat deceptive at times. For example during an interview with one of Kane's old colleagues, we see him sitting at a table with a fireplace burning behind him, which looks like it's only a couple of feet behind him. As the camera pans back, he eventually gets up and walks to the back of the room, and then finally up to the fireplace. He is surprisingly dwarfed by the now obviously large fireplace. This kind of trickery with depth perception is one of this film's most captivating perks.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of symbolism within this movie, and actually tells a lot of the story than most of the dialog. As we're taken through the scattered scenes of Charles Foster Kane's life, we begin to get an idea of how huge this man's life has become. But it also becomes apparent of how empty it actually is. The setting of his incredible home Xanadu, enormous and grand, is also cold and empty. And as he begins to lose what little he has left to cherish, his final words start to make a little more sense. In the final scene the camera soars over a sea of boxes and crates, all of which were Kane's many belongings. In my eyes, all these boxes began to look like a massive city, which I think reflects the enormity of what Kane had accomplished in life. But none of the contents have the purity of his old sled, ""Rosebud""."

Even if you know nothing about the storyline you'll be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't at least heard of Citizen Kane.

","I saw this movie a couple times and each time it was just as interesting if not more interesting time the next time. It is about a tragic story of a man that had everything, but really had nothing. The acting is pretty good, but after a while the main character, Kane, becomes annoying to listen to (i think that was the point). For a black and white film this movie has a lot of character. The camera work really made the film i think. The use of lighting and shining light on specific spots really added to the mystique. This movie really deserves to be considered one of the best of all time, it touches on a lot of social issues and what really should matter in life."

","The photography of this movie and the concept of this movie is highly unique. The movie starts on a set that one could only think of being in a Snowglobe. Then after it goes off onto the life of a reporter, to say the least. Then the Life of a millionaire, and then the fall and crash of a man's life. With all this being the same person. The story is told beautifully about why he does the things that he does. And it goes to show that a man with everything can have nothing at all, at the very same time. Great Concept. The way Orson Welles has this story portrayed is very different. But his style in how he does all his movies, are reassured that they are incorporated in this film. The illusions and metaphors are incorporated in this film, but are made remarkable by the help of Gregg Toland."

","""I don't think any word can explain a man's life"". This quote stays true to its movie, Citizen Kane directed by Orson Welles, as it cannot be described with one word alone. Citizen Kane has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time–however, I think that fact itself ruins the movie for many viewers, including myself. Though the movie doesn't hold up to what it is praised to be, characters Charles Kane (Orson Welles), Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane), Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris), and Jerry Thompson (William Alland) all play their respective roles in the film excellently.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is to be appreciated by a small group of people from today's audiences, mainly those who loves older films or have a love of classic mystery films, that aren't cliché murder-mysteries, and as I have previously stated, I believe Citizen Kane is just an OK movie. I feel as though many people go into the movie knowing that it IS the highest acclaimed movie of all time, and are let down when they get into it. Orson Welles did lots of things that no one had ever done before at the time, and nearly every film maker was in some way influenced by this movie from thereafter, so much that all of the techniques have become modern clichés. I understand why it was groundbreaking at the time, however, as time passes, so does everything else. This again does not mean that I believe that Citizen Kane was a bad movie, I just believe it has become dated. I give this film an 86/100."
"jman52","10","1","2","25 February 2013"," Is it the best movie ever?
","I watched this movie the other day and I was amazed at how well it was put together, but is it the best movie ever? I will tell you that Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I watched it with my friends and they couldn't get why Rosebud was his old sled from the beginning. I thought it meant that Kane never wanted to be adopted and wanted to have a simple life, instead of the rich and famous life. The movie was directed brilliantly. You could tell Orson Welles put his all into this movie. He also won an Oscar for Best Screenplay, but it should have won all the awards it was nominated for. The acting is also brilliant, especially since most of the actors in the movies were new to film. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested."

If your interested to learn what made movies what they are today then I think that you should see this movie. It has some really great cinematography work in it and it's hard to believe that this was Orson Wells first movie. the lighting has a great dramatic feel to it. Orson Wells is a great director and actor, just the fact that he played the main character in the movie as well as being able to direct a fantastic film shows how brilliant he really is.

","I have to praise this one for its futuristic and completely innovative camera work. I was shocked when I first saw this movie, I had never expected such defined, glowing, steady and adroit camera movements and cinematography. I don't know how Orson Welles did it after hearing from a number of sources that this was his first film ever and that he had little filming experience in general. I just know that the whole thing contains a great message. The narration is insane too, the complexity of time within the film, and the plot as it's winded in so many different directions. The film in its style and speed feels fresh enough. But the story is not a new one, although it is a thought provoking and well-told one, it felt a bit too much for me in this day and age. There were elements of age within the film, certain things that didn't mean as much today for me. Orson Welles has an unforgettable charisma as well as a face which is contagious, he puts those elements to good use."
"gearmod","9","1","2","15 December 2012"," New Appreciation
","I was channel surfing the other day and caught a segment of Citizen Kane that gave me an even better appreciation of Orson Welles. Orson Welles is one of my cinema idols and several of his films are in my favorites list; Citizen Kane, A Touch of Evil and The Third Man. The fact that Welles wrote, directed and starred in his films gave him total control of the art he produced so if you like it he gets the credit and if you don't he gets the blame.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a staple of classic cinema and the first time I saw it was during the 1970s in a high-school film appreciation class when I was 16. At that time I didn't have a full understanding of the movie and yet because I was a budding photo enthusiast I do remember how impressed I was with the cinematography; the manipulation of light (in black and white) and the unique perspectives of the camera. I didn't know at the time Welles directed all that. Since high-school I've probably only watched the entire film maybe twice.<br/><br/>The segment I saw the other day is the scene between Welles and Dorothy Comingore when Kane first meets his future wife Susan. They are in her apartment parlor having a dialog with tight close-ups and subsequently she plays the piano for him while singing arias. Watching that scene, especially the tight close-ups of Welles, it truly reveals what a hugely talented genius Welles was. His eyes and carefully created expressions provide an incredible depth to his character rarely seen in film.<br/><br/>While the movie was a fictionalized biography of William Randolph Hearst I have the impression Welles simply chose that story as a frame to hang his art on."
"miss_flowers","8","1","2","10 December 2012"," Great
","Citizen Kane is yet another classic that one spends entirely too much time hearing about and entirely too little time actually sitting and watching, which I think is incredibly unfortunate, as the movie is absolutely brilliant both plot-wise and in technical terms. It is well lit at the appropriate times, but not without the occasional blown out or 'underexposed' shot to demonstrate certain circumstances like being in a dimly lit library or being outside. The lighting is actually very interesting to watch in this movie due to Welles' tendency towards very dramatic lighting schemes. The editing, also, works very well, with clips 'layered' over top of each other to show the passing of time and other such things. The sound is very clear, as it had a trend of being in the very early days of sound where you could hear every noise, from a pillow being fluffed to a room being torn apart. All in all a fabulous movie that I would watch again and again."
"Scrius","Null","1","2","26 November 2012"," Greatest Movie Ever Made? Debatable. Deserves to be Recognized? Absolutely!
","Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is reputed to be the greatest movie of all time. Roger Ebert calls it his number one favorite and it is believed to have revolutionized the world of cinema, as it was known during its time. That sort of compliment carries more weight and depth than many realize. While I would not go so far as to call Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made, it cannot be denied that it is a work of extreme ambition which defied conventional standards and deserves to be recognized and respected for its brilliance. <br/><br/>It's my belief that few understand the courage that was needed to stand against up William Randolph Hearst, a very influential figure in American media and politics, whose ambition, like Orson Welles, knew no bounds. After learning about the unflattering portrayal of him in first feature film of the 24-year-old Welles, Hearst went out of his way to ensure that the production never saw the light of day. To my great relief, he did not succeed. <br/><br/>The great potential of Welles became known during his time at the Mercury Theater. Although he was a newcomer to the film industry, he was granted total control of his signature work and had many of his theatrical colleagues to assist him. Even a novice at filmmaking sorely lacking in experience can go far with a good editor and director of photography. Welles took all the credit, but it's more than likely that without the luxury of cinematographer Gregg Toland and young editor Robert Wise, Citizen Kane would not be as praised as it is today. <br/><br/>A portrait of William Randolph Hearst's life, Citizen Kane follows the events of Charles Foster Kane's death. Reporter Jerry Thompson is tasked with uncovering the meaning of Kane's dying word ""Rosebud"". Was Kane a good man, an egotistical tyrant, or a sympathetic tragic figure? Thompson interviews everyone who was close to Kane, providing the audience the opportunity to examine the titular character through their perspectives. Deprived of a normal childhood, Kane attended and failed in a number of schools before gaining control of the sensational newspaper The New York Inquirer and eventually entering politics. A man of noble intentions, he degraded into a megalomaniac over time, leaving him empty and alone in the end. The meaning of ""Rosebud"" remains a mystery to the characters in the movie but not to the audience, as a sled from his youth, the only time when Kane was ever truly happy, is burned with the rest of his forgotten treasures. <br/><br/>Citizen Kane can be considered a textbook of cinematic techniques. Even if you are not impressed by the collection of memorable and well developed characters or the means by which the story is told, from a technical standpoint the film is groundbreaking, with atmospheric and environmental effects used to convey the plot and the brilliant use of cinematography to capture all the emotion and mystery through the use of varied angles and darkness. All in all, simply impossible not to appreciate!<br/><br/>How unfortunate it is that Citizen Kane received a negative critical reception upon its release and failed to win all but one Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay) out of its nine nominations. Orson Welles was a born artist who lost everything as Kane did and spent the rest of his life trying to live up to the promise shown in his magnum opus. His career declined, but his legacy will forever stand as a testament to one man's creative vision and the steps he was willing to take to fight for his dreams. There are those who claim that Citizen Kane is overrated. Is that so? Perhaps. But regardless, there is much to be admired for avid filmmakers and anyone else who enjoys a thought-provoking narrative experience. One thing I can say with certainty is that the efforts of Orson Welles were not in vain."
"a-choppa","9","1","2","24 October 2012"," The death of a powerful media proprietor causes a news team to research the meaning of his last uttered word.
","Orson Welles' ability to not only direct but play the leading role in a film is something that's not seen that often today, or recognized. I found it creative that the film started at Kane's death and then went backwards in an effort to show his life journey, while the reporter, Jerry Thompson, searched for the meaning behind Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"". It showed the growth of a man born in poverty who makes it lucky when a gold mine is discovered under his mother's property. Kane grows to be a charismatic man loved and looked up to by many. However his personal life lacks, as what happens to most people who experience such wealth and power. It was a lesson of the things that matter in life. The scene where Kane throws and breaks many objects in his room after his wife leaves him. This scene shows a different side of Kane, and as the viewer I felt a lot of sympathy for him, as though he was looking back on his life wondering if all the wealth was really worth it."
"kendraocon","8","1","2","19 October 2012"," Really good movie!
","I thought Citizen Kane was a really well written movie. The movie kept you interested the whole time, he didn't seem to repeat much of the same techniques or types of scenes which I thought was the most interesting about it. There was definitely some odd point of views and perspectives, but this movie was odd in a good way so therefore it worked. When they first started off the movie, they showed the body of Citizen Kane, I liked perspective of the camera, you were aligned with his body. They also were showing newspapers of Kane's death, with an added voice. I liked the scene were all the men were gathered in one tiny room trying to find out how to publish his death, with the light seeping in from the windows hitting causing a outline of light to hit their faces and heads while the rest of their bodies were black or dark. You don't know what rosebud is and either does anyone in the movie, I liked that point of view. The light in this movie is just awesome,they used low key lighting. They did a crane shot when they were introducing Ms. Alexander, I like how they changed up the camera angles and did not keep it at just plain old eye level. With the mystery type of movie, I think the different angles, perspectives, lighting and other techniques just made the plot even stronger. I also loved the lighting in the room in the Walter Parks Thatcher Library, it looked like light beams were shining down on the floor and the man was very confined in there, with just a long table and a chair. You really understood Mr. Kane with all of the flashbacks of his life, they brought you back to his childhood and you could sense how much this child would change. I thought it was interesting about the flashbacks and that they were through other peoples eyes and not Mr. Kane, they were still sharp and very clear to understand despite them being from someone else's eyes."

"Artimidor","9","1","2","6 March 2012"," ""Rosebud"" leaves its indelible traces
","When RKO Radio Pictures gave young radio celebrity Orson Welles the opportunity to work on two pictures of his own little did they know that these two projects nearly would cause the company to go bankrupt. ""Citizen Kane"" was one of those films where the then 25 year old director and star Orson Welles pulled every possible trick from the books to make an impression, yet - while immediately critically acclaimed - nobody wanted to see the result. By now however the movie's profound influence in American film making is undisputed. And there's a lot one should know about it.<br/><br/>For one as far as the technical side is concerned: Welles shot in deep focus (front and back are both in focus at the same time), used subtle optical illusions, framed his scenes brilliantly, pioneered with invisible wipes, worked with models combined with sets and matte drawings, cleverly placed cameras to force strange angles, even moved furniture there and back again while in a scene, played with mirrors, shots that emphasized size and grandeur or dwarfed a person - the list goes on and on. ""Citizen Kane"" however is also all about acting, as there's no moment when the viewer doesn't buy Kane's age whenever he is seen - be it in is early twenties or on his deathbed decades later. The character's body language and mannerisms are believable throughout, and when we get to the final reel and finally learn the secret we feel that we really have the key to understand that person. Ah yes, speaking about ""rosebud""... That's the third point that needs mentioning: The depth of the story. It's core was inspired by tycoon Randolph Hearst, whose media outlets promptly boycotted the film in reaction, Hearst even wanted to buy the film in order to destroy it... Ah, Welles apparently was on to something! But there's of course a lot of fiction as well in ""Citizen Kane"" thanks to screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, and so ""rosebud"" leaves its indelible traces in everyone who ever tried to get to the bottom of the mystery."
"Bob Pr.","9","1","2","10 December 2011"," The more I've learned about this film, the more I've enjoyed it
","If you see this movie without any advance knowledge, it's a good story with good acting. But the more I've learned about its background and history, the more fascinating it's become.<br/><br/>Orson Welles (OW) was only 25, famous for his radio acting group, but with no previous movie experience when given carte blanche to make a film completely on his own with all editing at his discretion. <br/><br/>OW and the writer Herb Mankiewicz (HM) discussed using several notable contemporary characters (e.g., Howard Hughs) as take-offs for the main character to be portrayed in flashbacks. They settled on newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, possibly because HM had been friends with Hearst & his mistress, movie star Marion Davies, until HM's always getting drunk at their parties led to their excluding him (which ticked off HM).<br/><br/>The film's principal character of ""Charles Foster Kane"" (CFK) is an amalgam of fantasy plus some features of Hearst as well as others, (including OW's huge ego, OW's huge temper, OW's being orphaned and brought up by a non-relative). CFK's promotion of his 2nd wife, ""Susan Alexander,"" as an opera star was based very closely on the otherwise unrelated actions of a (real life) contemporary Chicago tycoon, Harold McCormick, with his 2nd wife.<br/><br/>When Hearst learned of CFK's resemblance to him, he ordered his publishing empire (28 metropolitan USA newspapers + many radio stations) to make NO mention, carry NO advertising AT ALL of this film. That quashed its reception in the USA in all but a few metro areas. It was only after 1955, when RKO sold its film library to TV, that ""Citizen Kane"" (""CK"") began being widely seen and appreciated. French ""New Wave"" directors were also extolling ""CK's"" innovative greatness.<br/><br/>""CK"" made a number of breakthroughs. Previously: <br/><br/>-- film narratives had been told sequentially and from only one point of view. In ""CK"", CFK dies at the beginning and the rest of the film is a series of flashbacks; a reporter seeks out CFK's life and several characters give contrasting views; <br/><br/>-- cinematography had filmed scenes in residences horizontally, as if viewing a theater set; CK's cinematographer excavated holes in the floor to make some shots from unique levels; <br/><br/>-- a dining table was incrementally lengthened in repeated scenes of CFK with his 1st wife to enhance the growing distance between them; <br/><br/>-- plus many, many other innovations.<br/><br/>Probably due to Hearst's restrictive measures against the film, ""CK"" did not make money for RKO. Since its resurgence, many experts have called it the greatest American film ever (or, sometimes, greatest film ever).<br/><br/>I saw it several months ago in a KU faculty alum film series and, just again, in another monthly film series. While it was enjoyable the first time, it became more so the second time because I knew and attended to more.<br/><br/>For those interested in these areas, I highly commend the Wikipedia article on ""Citizen Kane"" (as well as theirs on ""Orson Welles""). Wiki's article on ""CK"" (IMO) seems fairly balanced (while some books/articles on ""CK"" are not) -- & as a bonus, you'll learn which part of whose anatomy that ""Rosebud"" was a euphemism for!"

","I am not going to tell you anything about this movie... yet, but what I will do is give you a short history of my opinion of the movies I've experienced and loved, and why I rate them as I do, so that when I do actually give my opinion on CK, you will have some idea about the context and weight of my words...<br/><br/>The first movie that really got me hooked on cinema was Fantasia. I was just a child, but I'd never seen anything so wonderful and artistic. It was an incredibly moving experience, even for a 6 year old. I love it still, and always will.<br/><br/>The next movie that rocked me to my core was 2001:A Space Odyssey. I was only 12 in 1968, but it affected me like nothing else to that time. Back then you could buy a ticket and sit in a theater all day if you liked... and that's exactly what I did (watched it 3 times in a row)! One of the most influential movies of all time, and an instant classic... cinema as high art. Astounding!<br/><br/>Then along came 1972...I was not old enough to appreciate the true Genius of The Godfather at the time. I think I must have been a bit put off by the violence, but I knew it was outstanding anyway. I did however get rocked again at the age of 22 by The Deer Hunter. It chilled me to the bone and broke my heart. Christopher Walken's Nick haunts me to this day. I don't rewatch this movie often. It is just too painful, but it remains one of my all time favorites. A GIANT among films!<br/><br/>Up to this point in my life (22) I was beginning to be aware of a movie called Citizen Kane that was often said to be the best movie ever made. I also became aware of another such old timey movie called Casablanca with similar accolades. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately... hard to say), I did not see either movie until I was in my mid thirties. Thankfully though, I finally did...<br/><br/>I'll say it right now... I am not a great fan of Casablanca. It's a classic, yes. It's an excellent movie, yes... but the greatest off all time?! Not to me. I find it dated, stiff, and unconvincing. I can never suspend my disbelief that Bogart and Bergman actually loved each other. Without that, the movie simply falls apart for me. Oh well...<br/><br/>and that leaves CITIZEN KANE... <br/><br/>I simply cannot get my head around the fact that a 25 year old directed/starred in/wrote this movie. It is just not possible! This level of depth is always reserved for seasoned artists of the highest caliber, not young men just a couple years out of college! Unfortunately for Welles, he made CK so early in his career that it may have destroyed him as an artist... CK is that good! He gained tons of weight and made Paul Masson commercials (while drunk?) saying such things as ""We make no wine before it's time..."" How sadly ironic...<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is the one true ring, the ""Ring That Binds Them""! I hope I can live long enough to experience it's cinematic equal, but I doubt I will. If you have never seen it, you are indeed lucky... and you must do two things immediately...<br/><br/>Go out and buy a lottery ticket...<br/><br/>then go out and find a copy of the best movie ever made, and watch it.<br/><br/>There is no way you can lose! :-)"
"Bloodwank","10","1","2","25 September 2011"," Truly one of the deserved classics of all time
","How to understand a legend, and the man within. Thats the enterprise that drives Citizen Kane, a mission of layers that begins and ends with Xanadu, and Rosebud. At first we get the newsreel account, facts and knowledge but its a mean rendition, notes that point but say little. And so the process begins of unwrapping mystery from memory, the search for Rosebud. Xanadu says as much as the final revelation though, stately pleasure dome never finished. Coleridge never finished Khubla Khan to his satisfaction, his committal to verse on an opium dream interrupted by a guest and left to inadequate completion, and here Xanadu is a symbol of Kane and his own quest for dream interrupted. Even as the film unwraps the man through memory and its branches, in the end understanding can only be limited, the man who resides ultimately within his own mind is only understandable to himself. Which is not to say that the film is oblique, on the contrary it is a fine, scalpel slicing dissection of a man, his rise and fall, his companions and works. Orson Welles gives a towering performance as the title role, from a young turk beaming with energy and arrogance, to crusader then to stubbornness, unerring commitment to himself above all things sowing his downfall. For all the character's flaws Welles brings sympathy and tragedy to the role, in bringing clarity and perfect nuance to every stage he conveys to the audience a deeper understanding than what is said by mere words or events and thusly provokes sympathy even when one would perhaps like to dismiss him. The cast around aid the journey well, the exasperation of George Coulouris as Kane's guardian and fluster of Erskine Sanford as a traditional newspaper owner usurped by new practice make for wry amusement in the early stages, Ruth Warrick handling with great subtlety the first shifts towards downfall as Kane's first wife, Dorothy Comingore (though histrionic in places) deeply affecting as his simple, honest and lovable second. And best of all Joseph Cotten as an old friend bearing the greatest insight and hardest fall. With such performances and finely judged writing its a classic tale of corruption, greed and the peril of relentless drive. But underneath it all the search for a man within a legend. And one of the greatest things the film does is not just highlight futility but cast doubt on the very search. Its in the cinematography, the use of light and shadow. In general terms the superb work of Gregg Toland gives the film an often shadowy mood suggesting depth even when the actors aren't at work, but whats really interesting is the refusal to give face to the journalist pursuing the story, only those he speaks to, only what is relevant to Kane himself. In shrouding the journalist and his masters particularly in shadow and dark a great gulf is established between the world of Kane and his contemporaries and those who seek to unfurl said world. If Kane's wives and companions are at a remove from him, the seekers after truth are removed even from them, impossibly far away from deeper insight. Which gives the film dual interest to me, the mind, how it seals itself off and the impossibility of knowledge. Perhaps Citizen Kane is not the best examination focused as it is on a fairly classical story, but its certainly one of the very most accomplished and entertaining. One of my favorites so far of the established canon of cinema, and hugely recommended."

","Although wealth is often associated with success and, consequently, happiness, reality often proves otherwise. Being a billionaire may equal to being lonesome and unhappy. A lot of examples show clearly that being ultra-rich can mean being ultra-sorrowful.<br/><br/>The cinema production that memorably depicts an absorbing story where wealth cannot fill the puzzle of human personality (rosebud) occurs to be CITIZEN KANE, the first feature film (film à clef) by Orson Welles. Based upon the true life story of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, the movie offers a wide range of cinematic thrill and psychological development, which make it a key production at multiple levels. And indeed, it appears challenging to review such a film, the CULT FILM that so many great film critics and scholars have already analyzed before. Certain modesty is needed. Yet, every single viewer is able to add something new that others have not seen before. I could experience that when seeing the film on the big screen lately on the occasion of its recent 70th birthday with other people. The exchange of viewpoints occurred to be a true exchange of perceptions. Let me address some points underneath where I will combine our impressions with some widely acclaimed opinions.<br/><br/>When viewing Welles' movie, one's attention is directed towards the main character not through the traditionally linear storyline but through a flashback and other flashbacks within. We are led to know the newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) who dies in his vast dreamlike estate Xanadu, an oasis of his mind and wealthy life, and whose last, mysterious, absorbing word is 'ROSEBUD.' May he remain mystery, an enigma? Is his caution sign 'No trespassing' powerful enough? Or may anyone dare go deeper... Flashbacks, narrators and the attempts led by newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) help us get to know the man who has won so much, who impersonated the American dream, yet who is tormented by something mysterious - a man in the endless search for something that could make his life bright. Although so many people are around him, he finds himself alone... Despite some criticism, the portrayal of Orson Welles is truly special and sophisticated.<br/><br/>All the supporting characters (the cast rather new to the motion picture industry of the time) are genuine, we empathize with most of them, they are the people whom Kane encountered in his life and whom reporter Thompson questions. However, after longer inspection, we realize that they are/were nothing but background, more to say, aims by which Mr Kane gains success. They appear to be shadows that slowly disappear from his selfish mind: the two women seemingly loved by the magnate, his wives Emily (Ruth Warrick) and Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his political rival Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), his friend and first reporter on the paper ""The Inquirer"" Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the loyal friend and employee Mr Bernstein (Everett Sloane). All are gone at the face of selfish loneliness...Beautiful exemplification of falsely directed personal success and selfish desires that manipulate and affect a person/people in the capitalist world. It also refers to the deception of politics. Where are the working men he seemingly cared for? Where are his rivals he challenged? What remains are cold statues and enormous halls. Can he prove anything to himself at the face of death --- this genuine, inevitable, merciless fate? <br/><br/>The thought provoking content goes with brilliant artistry and cinematography's innovations. Great camera work in the large interiors, Gregg Toland's cinematography boasting of deep focus shots (where everything is in sharp focus), and Maurice Seiderman's make-up appear to be stunning. Among the most memorable scenes, let me name just two: the thrilling action in Kane's conversations with his wife Emily and the atmospheric gloom in Thompson's visit at Bernstein. The way Xanadu's interiors are shot, the use of light and shadows leave a lasting impact in viewers, too. In such moments, the mystery of man nicely goes with the mystery of images. The music by Bernard Herrmann with his effective ""Breakfast Montage"" and the wit in the parody of vocal coaching supply the movie with the artistic/entertaining merit.<br/><br/>It is important to note that CITIZEN KANE is the double work by Orson Welles. In how much he was appreciated by many film scholars, let me quote the French New Wave filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard who said: ""Everyone will always owe him everything."" Welles, as an actor, beautifully portrays a man whose will and whose heart are the supreme driving forces, yet who does everything with consideration of himself. There is no doubt that he makes a lasting impression in the role. As a director, the views were quite diverse. Although we can agree that his stylish direction indeed helps the film considerably, certain criticism occurred on the topic of Welles' collaboration with Herman Mankiewicz on the screenplay. The criticism was also the result of proclaiming CITIZEN KANE officially the greatest film ever made. There is no doubt that such a fake expression will meet reproach. Some eminent people criticized Welles' film as ""an all-American triumph of style over substance"" (according to Ray Carney) or as a 'total bore' made by Welles, the 'infinitely overrated filmmaker.' (according to Ingmar Bergman). <br/><br/>All things considered, it would be an unforgivable condensation to say that CITIZEN KANE is merely a historic movie. It is much more...if not directly, it addresses the core of individual/social views on success and means of achieving it; it shakes the self-view of people and interpersonal relations; it brings to light the personal disasters hidden in the world-acclaimed maxim: 'the end justifies the means.' People as means and wealth as the end? Yet, what stands for this 'wealth?' Things that say nothing, statues that feel nothing and...the merciless visitor that takes all? Then, the childhood memory, even if shortened of something, occurs a simple, redeeming relief...<br/><br/>And what were our impressions after seeing the film? It inspired thinking and feeling."

","I have read all the reviews of this film, praising it to the heavens, calling it the greatest film of all-time. However, I could barely sit through this tiring story with it's dull characters and enigmatic ending. The fact that it had beautiful photography does not make it a great film. I have had more enjoyment watching a Monogram programmer, with all it's static photography and stock music score. At least some of those films filled their time slots with something lively, even though it would be considered illogical or contrived. There must be a reason some people revere this film. Something I just don't get. I can think of hundreds of other titles that could vie for ""The greatest film of all-time."" Just not this one."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","16 July 2011"," Charles Foster Kane's dying words announcing the birth of Modern cinema ...
","In a vast and gloomy property, you're welcomed by a sign as cold as the cloudy night sky, 'NO TRESPASSING' dominated by a big ""K"" atop the door gate. The atmosphere is like getting ready to mourn the life that is gasping its last breaths, and then in one of the many rooms that populate the manor, a mouth covered by a big brushy mustache whispers ""Rosebud"" in a solemn echo. A life has gone, and a big snow globe falls to the ground and shatters in thousands of pieces. A man is dead, a masterpiece is born. ""Rosebud."" <br/><br/>How can you define a life, a man or anything that carries so much contradictory and complex interpretations, in one word? The attempt to understand a figure as larger-than-life as Charles Foster Kane, the press magnate, through his dying word is not only the mystery that ""Citizen Kane"" tries to solve, in a Utopian effort, but also the greatest cinematic secret ever created. I know this superlative has been overused ad nausea to describe Orson Welles' masterpiece to a point the movie that currently thrones over the American Film Institute's Top 100 became the epitome of cinematic greatness, but this is not without reasons.<br/><br/>What strikes the most when you watch ""Citizen Kane"" is the way the movie exudes a modernity that gets more palpable after each viewing. The film tries to understand the man that embodies the American Dream in its most appealing and appalling aspects. A man who, as a child, was torn away from his family to be precociously raised in manhood, until becoming the ruler of one of the most influent newspapers in America, as an idealist and social oriented figure first, before being alienated by his own egomania. Never has a character study, literally, challenged our intelligence in such a thrilling way. If the movie is not the first one to use non-linear narrative, it sure is the one that transcended the entertaining value of flashbacks.<br/><br/>This is the first element that is remembered when we evoke ""Citizen Kane"", the way the journalist, interestingly seen in shadows like making one with the audience, interviews some protagonists of Kane's life : the surrogate father, Mr. Thatcher, his banker, Kane's best friend, his ex-second wife and his butler, each one of them giving a particular insight on Kane's personality, sometimes idealistic, a bully, a mix of contradictions that maintains the enigma more than it solves it. The editing that swings between crucial parts of Kane's life using so many artistic cuts and masterful ellipses is the key element on ""Citizen Kane""' newness, but not the part of the technical achievement.<br/><br/>The modernity on which relies the general appreciation of ""Citizen Kane"" is so omnipresent that if I didn't want to take the movie's greatness for granted, I would say that Orson Welles tried every new trick he could, turning the film into some kind of arty experimentation. But this is a critic I used with another milestone film, Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless"" where I thought the absence of a story distracted from the directorial accomplishment. For ""Citizen Kane"", it works, the uses of deep focus is never gratuitous, like in this memorable shot where Mary Kane signs the papers while you can see, young Charlie Kane sledding in the snow, foreshadowing, the end of his innocent days. The delightfully elliptic editing showing the downfall of Kane's marriage, as he and his wife get more and more distant, the use of shadows, close-ups, and this never-ending feeling of irony, like this moment where the camera dramatically rises over the opera's curtain to show two workmen express their appreciation of Susan's singing talent, the extraordinary make-up transcended by the acting talent of Orson Welles, and even Joseph Cotton to play other characters, the innovation technique in ""Citizen Kane"" could be a subject for a long thesis. Let's just say that it paved the way for modern cinema like ""The Birth of a Nation"" did during the silent era. <br/><br/>Now, is this the only reason that can explain why ""the movie is so great, is such a big deal""? I think the story contributed to more than 50%. ""Citizen Kane"" is about understanding a man whose ambition exceeded the limits of his functions. He didn't want to inform, but to be loved, to rule America with his own visions, to be the one who'll say to people what and how to think, prophesying the current media totalitarian monopoly even in democracies. And this is only one element of a vast psychological jigsaw puzzle whose central piece is still 'Rosebud'. There's no particular strategy when you solve a jigsaw puzzle, but the journalist follows the most usual one, assembling the common elements, and then joining them together.<br/><br/>Why such a need for love? Maybe the loss of his mother is the Oedipian driver that inspired him to get more in touch in people? Maybe his failure in politics transferred his blind ambition on Susan, the second wife? Or maybe money and power, corrupt the purest souls, and the more powerful, and richer you get, the more detestable becomes the idea of being criticized. In the last appearance of Charles Foster Kane with many reflect mirrors the multidimensionality of a man who still intrigues and fascinates now. And in one of the all-time greatest performances, Welles embodies Kane as the precocious genius who's to cinema what Kane tried to be for America.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't successful, but time did it justice, ""Citizen Kane""s is now part of American Culture like Mark Twain or Jazz music, and one of the most iconic films ever with these scenes forever graved in our memories, ""Rosebud"", the 'New on the March' reel, the dance scene, Xanadou, ""I'm Charles Foster Kane!"", and of course that immortal ending that gives the clue about the one true thing that was ""Rosebud"", as the most valuable and irreplaceable part of any man's life .."

","When I first saw this film I blown away. It was the first older film I ever saw and thought, ""simply amazing!"" It really turned me on to the classics and opened my mind to the concept that in terms of how great a movie is it doesn't matter when the film was made. Orson Welles was only twenty six when he made ""Citizen Kane""(1941)! Some men will spend there wholes lives trying to create a movie as amazing as this and most will fail yet Welles hit this one out of the park at such a young age! On top of that it was Welles first film ever made! The success might be credited to that Welles was given full creative control of the film by RKO Pictures. The use of sound in this film is unreal, and it seems like every scene can be deconstructed to find 100 different meanings behind every characters action and the objects/places that surround them. This Film à clef uses exceptionally peculiar narrative and direction to tell you the story of Charles Foster Kane. Starting from Kane's last words, going to a news real, then jumping between the interviews of reporter Jerry Thompson to the flashbacks of the ones he questioned. All this accompanied by daring and creative cinematography and amazing acting by Orson Welles and his crew solidify this piece as cinema gold. Don't get me wrong this is in no way my favorite film but I'd think even a person who despised this film would have a hard time saying it wasn't the greatest film known to man. For this I give it 10/10."

","Now, I can understand why Orson Welles and Citizen Kane gets so much praise. Citizen Kane is immediately engaging beginning with Kane's death. Welles tells the story of Kane through an unconventional and innovative narrative that flows easily as Kane's story unfolds. Citizen Kane is clearly one of the most praised films due to Welles himself. Aside from the amazing script, Welles is a very talented actor. Welles is completely believable as Kane at 25 as he is at 80. Welles is also responsible for an innovative and inspiring directorial effort. Each scene is beautiful and the camera movements are very fluid.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has at least a thousand amazing little things that make the film what it is. I would highly recommend this film to anyone."

","I can honestly find no fault with Citizen Kane. Not a second of film wasted. Overflowing with brilliant music, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, sets, pretty much everything a movie can excel at. And the best part is that it forever changed movies for the better<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a man trying to figure out the meaning of a very famous newspaper tycoon's last word. As he interviews the many people who knew Charles Kane, we get to see the life of the most fascinating movie characters of all time. The story is unfolded in a way that the audience becomes completely entranced in his life. We also want to hang on every word in order to know what Rosebud is. <br/><br/>Every frame of this movie is filled with innovation. Orson Welles gives us every kind of edit, camera angle, and movement to convey the feeling he wants to give. He effortlessly switches from a feeling of doom, to very happy and joyous scenes, to really sad scenes very effectively. Bernard Herrman's score also helps lots in creating the mood. I'd even say it's his most under-appreciated score.<br/><br/>Everybody in the movie gave strong performances, and just about all the actors deserved Oscars. This is also one of those rare movies where every character, major and minor, is completely interesting. You could probably write an essay about everybody that appears on screen.<br/><br/>I could probably go on forever about how great this work of art is, but I think I'll stop here since its brilliance has already been covered a gajillion and two times.

","I had to see this film? Why? Because it was hailed as 'one of the greatest films ever' etc etc. Also seeing it in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was very eager to check out this film, and not really knowing anything about it.<br/><br/>And it is truly a masterpiece. From the first fifteen minutes, I thought I was going to watch a film that was indeed told like a short film shown back in those times, only to be surprised when the audience got out of their seats. The first fifteen minutes is a summary of Charles Foster Kane that shows his life experience and eventually his death.<br/><br/>What I had no idea was how many references the cartoon the Simpsons have made to this film - I honestly had no idea it was from this film. Well I'm glad I know now. What is truly gripping about this film is that it starts off with a poor boy who strikes it gold and eventually takes over a newspaper business, and has his soul turned into one of greed and possession; a man that many of the characters in the film who have known him claim him to be a man who is incapable of giving love, but wants to be loved on his own terms.<br/><br/>Then you have the mystery of his last dying words 'rosebud' that you discover at the end what this mystery thing is. And it all makes sense that this was something he has treasured and is incapable of getting it back. I'm not going to reveal it but the metaphor is pretty much something many of us may think of later in life.<br/><br/>I loved how the story was told - with it's flashbacks and insights into this character from a perspective of each person who knew him. It's almost like a detective sort of story only we aren't looking for crimes, but more rather the crimes he has done to the heart of the people around him, and in turn his own.<br/><br/>Finally I am glad to have seen this and to realise why this is hailed as classic. Orwon Welles is just terrific as Kane and gives a performance that will surely be remembered as one of the most magnificent in cinema."
"Supachewy","10","1","2","17 October 2010"," Truly a Masterpiece
","The drama mystery Citizen Kane is directed by Orson Welles and stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, and Dorothy Comingore. The film takes place in 1941 with flashbacks from as far back as the late eighteen hundreds.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dieing in his castle with his last words being rose bud. At a news station a reporter is assigned to find out why Kane said those as his last words so he goes to everyone that Kane knew to find out. He discovers how at an early age Kane was taken away from his family to become a big success, how in his early twenties he began to run a newspaper, how as he got older he became one of the most powerful men in the country. The reporter learns about Kane's two marriages and divorces and how he also ran to become governor. This film is about the ups and downs of a life of an extremely wealthy man, and has one of the greatest morals of any film ever.<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film was absolutely brilliant. It is extremely intriguing how it was set up as a mystery to discover the meaning behind Kane's final words rose bud but in doing so the audience discovers the life of Kane. The characters were all extremely elaborate and realistic and the film was entertaining the whole way through. The moral is great and films these days do not have morals anymore, which is why I don't really like them as much as the ones back in the day.<br/><br/>Welles's direction was stunning. The camera movements were absolutely outstanding, few films direction can compare with this ones. It is extremely difficult to be the lead actor and director which is why I give extreme props to Mr. Welles. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when he is making his speech to the people when he is running for governor because I really like him, but then I also like when towards the end he is destroying some of his things it really makes me able to feel the pain he is going through. Also I believe the opening scene in the film where Kane dies is one of the most iconic scenes in film history.<br/><br/>The acting for this film is as well wonderful. Orson Welles gave the performance of a lifetime, letting me love him when he is supposed to be loved and hate him when he is supposed to be hated. Everyone else in the supporting cast such as Cotten and Comingore did a fine job, but nothing award worthy. Welles really carried the film, if he did a poor job this film would not be widely regarded as the best film ever made.<br/><br/>The score for this film is also legendary. It really adds another layer to the film making the emotions sink in even deeper. The film is known for its revolutionary sound and again I can think of few films that use sound as well as this one.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 10/10 because it is perfect in every way. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see great quality in a film."
"JoshuaC96","8","1","2","16 October 2010"," Citizen Kane
","I liked this movie quite a bit. The movie starts of with an almost horrific tone. The first scene is more dark and ominous than Frankenstein. The cinematography in the movie was really interesting and used effects that I haven't seen in other movies from that time period. For instance, the movie used a lot of really low and really high camera angles, which were pretty cool. I also liked, during the scene when Thatcher was speaking to Kane's parents, how you could see Kane through the window outside playing. It was really cool because you could see how happy he was with his life the way he had it, while at the same time people were planning what would turn out to be an empty, unhappy life. I also thought that how the plot moved forward by jumping around in time through flashbacks was really cool. Everything in the film; the lighting, camera work, music, and overall atmosphere came together to make the story seem epic, which helped make the film really impacting. As depressing a movie as it is, it's really great."

","After almost 70 years, only 38 of them during my lifetime, I decided to watch and review the legendary Citizen Kane. Orson Welles directed this classic in 1941 starring himself in the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. The film began with Kane's death in the palatial Zanadu estate he had created for himself. The final word in his last breath ""Rosebud"" would become the catalyst for the story line going back through Kane's life to determine the significance of the word and some purpose to how he lived his life. <br/><br/>In the early 1940's the world was coming out of a brutal war and still recovering from the depression. The story, when taken in this context is telling the story that wealth and financial extravagance does not equal fulfillment. Kane's influence and financial status could not gain him the one thing he lost as a child; love and acceptance. Agnes Moorehead portrayed Mary Kane, Charles mother, who gave her son to the care of a Financial Adviser, Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris) who would also oversee Kane's trust. Charles Kane being plucked from his simple childhood and placed into the care of a person who considered him a commodity produces a theme of a rich child trying to right the world and gain love. In the era this movie was produced, the concept of gaining great wealth, especially as a child, would have seemed quite incredible. The fallen child star stories were not publicized at that time so the idea that wealth and influence can scar a person at that early age would not have been as prevalent. Welles took this theme and created a concept that simple family life with the love and attention of those closest was the best way to provide fulfillment to a child. <br/><br/>Much in the same way that modern day superhero stories like Ironman and Batman portray people of great wealth and influence trying to right the wrongs in the world, Kane tries to use his wealth, newspaper, and political savvy to change the world. Unfortunately, he does this from a skewed perspective and does not turn the reflection on himself and the choices he made in relationships and in business. Kane's marriage to Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) underscored the concept that money could build relationships and gain him companionship. He purchased singing lessons, promoted her singing abilities, and even build an opera house for her to perform. Still, his search for love failed as he tried to buy her affections. In the end, when she did leave him, it broke him and seemed to make him realize that the one thing he longed for was kept out of reach simply because he didn't know how to love. <br/><br/>When looking at the era, the message for me seemed to take on a new meaning. Today, the theme doesn't seem terribly unique and the grandeur of the sets is not to be compared to current day CGI. Still, there is a haunting message that has resonated due to Welles' telling of the story. The careful placement of mirrors when Kane is walking through Zanadu and harsh lighting techniques utilized as he nears the end of his life, give perspective to what Welles was trying to say all along, that money can't buy love. As I watched this movie, the beautiful direction and cinematography really moved me as an artist. I not only understood what Welles was trying to say but could appreciate the careful and intricate way he said it."

","""Citizen Kane"" is truly fantastic. It is understandable why film critics often cite this as the best movie of all time. The way the story is told is particularly interesting. The story is a mesh of other people's point of view. It makes Kane's life a sort of puzzle that the audience tries to piece together. Kane is a very complicated and enigmatic man so the puzzle seems to be a never-ending one. I am not quite sure if Kane being based on a real life person (the famed publisher: Hearst) adds or detracts from the story. It is definitely worth mentioning though.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' direction takes us on a never-ending cinematic roller-coaster. It seems as if every technique in the book is crammed together. If you want a lesson in direction, watch this movie. Welles also works actively with both the foreground and background, creating a rich scene. All layers of this film remain in focus and a lack of cuts showcases just how fluid the camera is. Low-angle shots often make ceilings the backdrop. This is a rather strange and unique technique that is nonetheless interesting.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent but it is really the story that sticks with you. Kane realizes in the end that he became everything he set out not to be. ""Citizen Kane"" shows us the evolution of childhood innocence to the sobering reality that experience leaves you with. Whether or not Kane is a monster is for you to decide."
"MovieDude1893","10","1","2","1 March 2010"," A Great American Work of Art
","Citizen Kane {dir Orson Welles, 1941}<br/><br/>****/****<br/><br/>Orson Welles's Citizen Kane has been heralded far and wide as the greatest film ever made. It tops lists released by such reputable establishments as Sight and Sound Magazine and the American Film Institute. Are these showers of praise justified? Who is to say really. The power of Kane lies not with it stature as ""best"" anything. It is simply a great American work of art, a cornerstone of popular culture and cinematic craft, a landmark and a classic film. <br/><br/>Do not allow those highfalutin descriptions in anyway discourage you from seeing the film. Contrary to what some believe, the film is more than an exercise of style over substance. It is a groundbreaking technical exercise and a sparkling entertainment. That delicate balance between art can best be attributed to producer/writer/director/star Orson Welles, who in his first film uses every visual trick he and cinematographer Gregg Toland can muster (at one point Welles even resorts to making shadow puppets). <br/><br/>All the craftsmanship in the world would never be able to take the place of an intriguing story. Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz constructed a doozy, a fascinating portrait of a man of almost mythical power. This is the rare film to explore the personality of a tycoon like Kane. Both the performance and the character are wonderfully fleshed out. Charles Foster Kane is charming, tyrannical, lovable, loathsome, yet always distant and enigmatic. That last trait, Kane as an enigma, is a stroke of genius on the film's part. For all the details the film gives us regarding Kane's life, it never supposes that we can draw any final conclusions about the man and his motives. In his portrait of an American dream gone wrong, Welles leaves us with a startling fact: No one man's life can be reduced and crystallized into two hours worth of celluloid. Welles is at once seems to capture a wide breadth of human experience, while also acknowledging that the scenes before as a merely a small part of the whole. But what a joy these small parts are. We are treated to watching Kane's rise and fall beginning as a dashing young turk signing his well-intentioned Declaration of Principles, to a megalomaniacal recluse, living alone in his castle full of useless treasures. Kane's descent is brilliantly visualized. He is consistently shot from a low angle, yet this seemingly dominating stature is increasingly put into a more ironic context. We watch his power wither into desperation.<br/><br/>Yet, even in the end, the film never loses Welles's winking sense of humor. With the final reveal of the origin of the term ""Rosebud"" (the film's central MacGuffin, as Hitchcock would call it) one can imagine Welles (the consummate magician) exclaiming ""Taa-daa!"" with a grand theatrical gesture of the hand. For with this film, Welles establishes himself as the masterful magician of light and shadow. Yet despite all of the light Welles brings, Kane remains a figure of mystery, and a fascinating character. It is that central element of fascination that keeps so many film goers returning to Citizen Kane again and again. That may not be ""best"", but its not far off."

","The movie gives the feeling of being thoroughly designed and structured. In a number of situations such meticulous fore thought suffocates a film, having no space for the cast to breathe. But Orsen Welles (director), with his great skill and actor ability, smoothly side-steps this trap. By creating characters which are inconsistent, but yet interesting, Welles gives the gifted cast roles to elaborate on and run with. The dialog, sometimes first-person and sometimes voice-over, is humorous, convincing, clever and well-structured. Plus the plot of the movie never gets lost at any point. In addition, the script is exactly to the point saying what needs to be said. A further neat point is that sentences tend to overlap as people argue and struggle to get their point across, just like in real life. Orson Welles' Citizen Kane is a movie of recommendation and will never disappoint."

","Is this the greatest film of all time? No, but it is certainly one of the greatest, an audacious film debut for boy genius Welles. In fact, Welles perhaps goes a little overboard with his showy camera angles and juxtapositioning of lights and shadows. This is such a groundbreaking film, however, that he can be forgiven for his excesses. Toland's magnificent deep-focus cinematography adds to the visual elegance of the film. Welles does fine in the title role, although he was never a great actor. Cotten is terrific as one of Kane's friends, particularly in his scenes as an old man. Despite all its greatness, however, it is a film to be admired rather than loved."

","One need only look around at the unbelievable number of boneheads on illegally monopolized cable ""news"" channels to draw some very clear parallels between the ""Kane"" of Old and you-know-who of New. Orson Welles may or may not have been sounding a warning back in 1941, but hindsight would certainly suggest as much. Granted, the monopolization of ""The Fourth Estate"" may be almost incidental to the goings-on in CITIZEN KANE, but it's there and clearly delineated. Illiteracy has skyrocketed in this country over the past four decades, going hand in hand (not uncoincidentally) with the rise of television viewing- and, by controlling television (as per George Orwell), we've seen- and continue to see- the ""re-imagining"" of History. It's proving difficult to shake the parasites loose, too, because they've so entrenched themselves in the guts of the mass media that their eventual (but inevitable) departure will leave a gaping hole in our national psyche. The end result of 40 years of two-faced Politics (and complicit lying by the boneheads who've bowed and scraped for so long at the feet of they mastas that they no longer know how to stand upright) leaves one feeling more than a little left out in the cold. Never trust them again- no matter what means they use to try to reach you."

","KANE is a movie of Shakespearian beauty and depth. Its beauty is an intelligible one; I must humbly admit it took me several viewings, much reflection, etc.,to be able to taste it. KANE is like STALKER, like AMBERSONS, etc.it teaches us that the first impression is crap, is nothing. What should I say about its impressive style, where everything is needed, necessary, useful, functional. There's nothing better; each shot is absolutely functional, each device is needed ,and required by the story. Nothing is formalistic, empty. It is the very opposite of Tarantino, who is made entirely of abundant unnecessary tricks and devices and stylistic gizmo's. The boss picked by Welles to be portrayed in KANE is uninteresting; Kane is of perennial importance. I know no other movie more richly and subtly thought and, in a superior sense, crafted. Missing KANE is missing what is best in cinema. This movie will never be equaled. What heartbreaking beauty! <br/><br/>Mme. Kael defined KANE as an exuberant, muckraking attack on an archetypal economic baron;this is prettily vague. Anyway, taken with the necessary qualifications, Mme. Kael's definition is blatantly false and misconstrued. If Hearst would have been other than an economic leader, a boss, he would have felt flattered by Welles' portrayalto such a degree is Welles' approach purely Shakespearian in vigor ,health, richness and concision. (One might nonetheless argue that Mme. Kael spoke about exuberance; she did, but I do not think that she meant the Shakespeareian one!) .In KANE, the wonders are of all kinds. There is no other movie equally rich, dense and stylistically exemplary and flawless. Each frame, each angle has a character of inner necessity and truth. KANE is not a pamphlet against a capitalist boss. It is an impressionistic, cognitively mature take on the human heart and its meanderings. <br/><br/>The vitriol of Hollywoodian indiscretions is what has already perished, vanished. Welles went undoubtedly much, much beyond that. It is even less a myth; it is poetry and realism. A strictly functional style. The style, the morphology are strictly subordinated to their function. (The opposite example, the textbook example of style over content is GODFATHER.)In KANE, one has as much content as he has style; the content is always served by the style.<br/><br/>And what performances!What a superior wit!What a pure, unblemished art!<br/><br/>This is realism; this is superlative realism. The richest representation of life, in cinema, that I am aware of. Balzac would not have written this script better. Some lines gave chills to Averty. A better thing will never be written. This Shakespearian dramatic edge has nothing to do with the supposed pamphlet. The best thing made in cinema's art till now. To give trite epithets to Welles' directing would mean being vulgar. Centuries will pass, cultures will succeed one anotherKANE will endure. In each generation, a small elite is able to taste KANE; be a part of it!<br/><br/>I did not like it the first time; even less I understood it. I only began to feel it, on the second viewing, after many years. <br/><br/>Kane was cinema's great shot at the noblest poetry. Kane has more to do with Shakespeare, than with any reallife businessman. It's sad many perceive in it but the most exterior appealthe satire."
"Steffi_P","9","1","2","1 January 2008"," ""It isn't enough to tell us what a man did, you've got to tell us who he was""
","Citizen Kane  one of the most acclaimed features of motion picture industry. Today, it's perhaps the most beloved film of those within the industry itself, topping the Sight and Sound directors' and critics' poll as well as AFI's 100 years, 100 movies list. But as with many a great and pioneering feature film it is also surrounded by a great deal of myth and misconception.<br/><br/>For me, the biggest misattribution regarding Citizen Kane is that it was highly innovative  a revolution in film history. It isn't  it's really more of a return to form. Many of the things that make Citizen Kane stand out actually hark back to the silent era. Perhaps this is not surprising given Orson Welles' unique position  a talented young man who had already proved himself in several other fields, hastily teaching himself the basics of film-making and then putting together a very individual yet finely crafted picture. Given all this, it makes sense that Welles is in many ways like those early pioneers of film who were creating cinematic styles for the first time without previous generation of filmmakers to be influenced by.<br/><br/>Take first of all Welles' independence. Welles is now looked back on as the ultimate director's director, bucking the studio system and controlling every aspect of production. This however was a freedom enjoyed by many silent directors, before the studios had consolidated their power, and the film-making process was a lot quicker and simpler. However, Welles' evasion of studio influence was significant, coming as it did at a time when the studio system was at the height of its dominance.<br/><br/>Now let's look at Welles' style as a director. The first thing that hits you when you start watching Kane is the rhythm  first how we home smoothly and eerily in upon the Kane mansion, how the images dovetail into one other, and then the startling change of pace with the ""News On The March"" segment. Ironically, even though it's a good mock-up of a straightforward newsreel, this is actually one of the most tightly constructed and cinematic sequences in the entire film. It's not just a rhythmic editing pattern, but each shot ""agrees"" with the one before and after it, the pace and style of the movement in each shot gives a consistent flow to the whole thing. This sense of rhythm harks back to earliest days of film  Melies is probably the first to use it, and Griffith and Eisenstein developed it, but an overt sense of rhythm declined with the coming of sound, with a few notable exceptions such as Busby Berkely musicals and Disney cartoons. What is really great in Kane is how the pace of the picture is carried through into Orson Welles' acting  you can see he is totally sensitive to the rhythm of his own work with every move he makes.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, Citizen Kane also represents a return of expressionism in film, that is the externalisation of ideas and feelings through technique and symbolism. Not that expressionism ever totally died out, but Kane is constantly and overtly expressionistic, almost as much as the silent films of Murnau and Hitchcock, with moody lighting in sombre scenes, high and low angles, massive distances between characters to demonstrate emotional detachment, the pelting rain when we first encounter the middle-aged Susan Alexander and so forth. Of course this is another reason why Kane is a director's favourite  touches like this are the chances for directors to express themselves and create something more than simply shooting a script. All this is sometimes a little overdone in Kane  often the hallmark of a young director  and the continual dollying in and out on headlines and ridiculously low angles can get a bit tiresome. Welles was to direct with more subtlety in his later features.<br/><br/>One area in which Citizen Kane does seem to be genuinely revolutionary, and perhaps the area in which it had the most influence, is in its creation of the modern biopic. Granted, it's perhaps not a true biopic because Kane is a fictional character (albeit one based on real figures), but the structure of revealing his story  beginning with the public image of the person at the end of their life, then telling their true story, warts and all, as a flashback, humanising them in the process  was the basis for Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi and virtually every other biopic of the last forty years. It's often stated that Welles was ahead of his time, and it was a long time before Citizen Kane's influence could be felt. One director/writer team however, were more on the ball  Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) bears many similarities to Kane, taking a distant, un-heroic figure and turning him into a real and sympathetic person.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is still in itself a unique and captivating picture, very clearly the product of someone who was never classically trained  as it were  in film-making but who had a natural feel for it all the same. It's not a perfect film, as some have claimed, but it's a satisfying, well crafted (not to forget brilliantly acted) piece of cinema, well deserving of praise and attention."

","This movie is considered by many to be the greatest film ever made. Maybe you've already heard that. It stands atop the AFI (American Film Institute) top 100 movies list, which is a list of American and English language films. More importantly, it stands atop Sight and Sound's list, which is sponsored by the BFI (British Film Institute) but includes critics and directors from all over the world and is all inclusive. So, with such credentials it is a little intimidating to watch for the first time. The best way, perhaps, is to forget that you're supposed to get something out of the experience and just sit back and enjoy watching one of the old classics.<br/><br/>Much, much has been written about this movie. Perhaps too much to the point where some people actually avoid it like the plague. But forget about any of the hype when watching it. If you're not fortunate enough to be close to a revival house, then do some of the things you do when watching any other movie. Pop some popcorn, get a box of jujube's or cracker jacks. Keep within your usual routine because this is just another movie. Enjoy Gregg Toland's startling cinematography without trying to analyze it. Many people have stated that the first time they saw Citizen Kane they were disappointed. That's a shame, because it really is entertaining, and much of the fun is the way Welles and Toland tell us the story.<br/><br/>This movie was one of the first movies I ever purchased for my brand new Betamax (age giveaway) which was also the first time I saw it. Luckily I wasn't burdened by a lot of film theory. I had heard that this film was good. I was amazed by it, and it is one of those experiences I credit for becoming a film junkie (some of the others being North by Northwest, Seven Samurai, The African Queen, The Wizard of Oz, Contempt, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Bringing Up Baby, etc.). So, to review: 1. Keep Ordinary Routines Intact; 2. Sit Back; 3. Relax; 4. Don't Be Troubled By It's Monumental Reputation and; 5. Most Importantly Remember That It's Only A Movie."
"joeydean61869","10","1","2","8 September 2007"," The great directors of today still steal from Welles' masterpiece
","**** out of **** stars<br/><br/>When I finally watched Kane for the very first time a few weeks back, it fiercely occurred to me how much has been honorably stolen from this enigmatic masterpiece. Take the flashback scene of little boy Kane in the snow, for instance; the overlapping dialouge and Gregg Toland's deep-focus cinematography reminded me of an ingredient Spielberg has used time and time again (Minority Report, Schindler's List). Welles' nod to the classic ""March of Time"" newsreels in the beginning of the film, brought to mind the pseudo-documentary stylings of Oliver Stone's JFK and Nixon. Scorcese is there too; the jagged scene shifting and pacing. Moments of stillness and silence prompted me to think of Coppolla's Godfather films. Citizen Kane remains the number one film of all time because of these homages. Newer films that are also bathed in genius will never dethrone this predecessor, because all the wonderful artistry they contain has already been consummated in Kane.<br/><br/>Welles, being only 25 at the time of this film's creation, is flooring. The little boy to salty-old-man passage of Charles Foster Kane's lifetime, along with his strange and extensive friendships and romances, are experiences that should seemingly be understood by a man much older than Orson was in 1941. Simply put, an artist ahead of his time made a movie ahead of it's time, and the aftershocks of Kane's greatness are still felt today.<br/><br/>I believe those of us that expected Rosebud to become something specific or tangible or touchable, missed the heartbeat of Citizen Kane. Rosebud is Kane's soul, his lost innocence, his antiquated beauty. Rosebud is in all of us, or once was. What Welles did was tell a story about the human condition; the dream of something blindingly pure that is in all of us. He used film-making as a megaphone to scream and whisper to our exceedingly similar human sensibilities. Sometimes it's hard to comprehend the megaphone, but that's what makes Kane so great. Orson Welles understood, at his very young age, that all of us can often feel very alone, and that we need something sacred to rely on."
"jzappa","10","1","2","25 July 2007"," A Hugely Boastful Celebration of Style
","Citizen Kane is a film that has a lot of unprecedented stylistic freedom in terms of the time in which it was made, and that would of course cause an impact upon release. Orson Welles worked in radio and theatre. He was not practiced in film. This was his first. But all the imagination and passion he had in creating images on radio and in his mind were depicted as ambitiously as they could be in Citizen Kane. It begins with a news reel, then with a scene with several men wherein we never see their faces, but their silhouettes. We see points of view from inside a snow dome and cranking in on us through solid objects like windows and screens and people. Kane has something a lot of movies, even great ones, don't have, and that's raw vision. Raw vision is great, because it's entirely personal.<br/><br/>The problem is that Welles made such an overwhelming effort to announce his presence both in front of the camera and behind it that the film's story is of secondary importance, subordinated by his main concern which is how differently it is told. I speak objectively, I believe, as I did not live during a generation that was so directly impacted by the film's revisioning of cinema. I am accustomed to films by directors who did and in turn managed to heavily influence mine. I find its widely hailed position as the #1 greatest movie of all time to be the most grandiose excess of praise of which I can readily think. There are many scores of movies from the 1940s that hold up much better over time. That is not to say that Kane is corny or archaic by today's standards but that the vulnerability of unused audiences to being blindsided by its style and ambition is much less perceptible. I must not be in such a small group who sees the tremendous self-importance and braggadocio exclusively exuded by Welles.<br/><br/>Are you not the biggest ham in the world if you make a film debut as a writer/director who casts himself in the role of extremely rich tycoon Charles Foster Kane who dies in his gaping mammoth mansion Xanadu, before which uttering his last word which reporters and producers obsess over trying to understand?<br/><br/>Welles is extraordinarily smug and narcissistic, but he does very much know himself, because Kane is really not so much written with William Randolph Hearst in mind as he is with Welles himself in mind, and his life came to eerily resemble Kane's."

This cryptic death launches an investigation by a young reporter into what ""rosebud"" is. As the reporter travels around and interviews significant people in Charlie's life, we find out more and more about the man through flashbacks of the interviewees. There's an air of mystery all throughout the film, being that we know no more than the reporter.<br/><br/>The performances in ""Kane"" are all stellar, especially Orson Welles's memorable turn as Kane himself.He rules the picture with his commanding and realistic performance.

Though the film is not done in color, the background and lighting provides more emotion and mystery than almost any color film to date.<br/><br/>So, is ""Citizen Kane"" the greatest film of all time?

","Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.<br/><br/>The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen on screen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of ""Rosebud"" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.<br/><br/>The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.<br/><br/>The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing."

","Citizen Kane<br/><br/>
The camera passes over a NO TRESPASSING sign into a dark landscape where it doesn't belong, full of ominous statues and iron bars.  Then, up rises before the camera a dark and looming castle, and only one light is lit, until it flickers and goes out.  The only life in this giant monument of man is a feeble old man holding an old snow globe.  He whispers with his last breath, `Rosebud', and then dies.  Out of his limp hand falls his snow globe to where it shatters on the marble floor.<br/><br/>
With these opening shots, these pieces of art, the whole movie of Citizen Kane was laid out before the audience without them even knowing it.  Orson Welles (Director, Producer, Charles Foster Kane) paints beautiful pictures with the camera that are so deep that you'll have to swim up for air.  The lighting, the photography, the writing, it all comes together in this masterpiece to create so much depth and meaning.  The genius of this film deserves much reflection to see a window into its full meaning.  At second a glance, all of its mystery is still not seen, just like Charles Foster Kane's life in the film.  Even if you fail to see most of  his visual metaphors, just the taste of Welles' wonder is rewarding enough.<br/><br/>
Each set of the movie, (the spiral stair that symbolizes Kane's destruction, the long table separating Kane and his first wife much like the growing distance in their relationship, the large rooms Kane and his second wife lived in that symbolized their boredom and hollowness inside) captures the mood that it set out to accomplish.  The lighting also expresses moods with shadows swallowing up Kane while he's going through a dark time, or making a large silhouette when he was on top of the world.  And Mr. Welles achieved all of this visual mastery while experimenting with new, revolutionary techniques in lighting and photography, making this film truly unique and beautiful.<br/><br/>
And what would a film be without the actors who play in it.  They were all very real in the parts that they played, but none of the acting was very show stopping.  The believability in the characters was all there when they delivered lines like, `Everything was [Kane's] idea, except for my leaving him.', or, `That's why [Kane] went into politics.  We weren't enough, he wanted all the voters to love him too.', but the movie didn't call for any one character to carry the movie.  It didn't need to.  All the aspects of the film, the lighting, photography, editing, sets, acting, they came together and worked as a team to create Orson's masterpiece.  This is a true testament to Orson Welles' great direction of `Citizen Kane'.<br/><br/>
`Citizen Kane' was original like all great creations are.  It played to its strengths in technique and Orson was able to blend all aspects of the film beautifully, like an artist mixing paint.  Each stroke of his brush was calculated and meaningful.  My IQ raised a few points just from watching the movie.  Concentration was needed to stay focused on the screen though, so I gave this film an A-, and recommend that it be hung in an art gallery rather then on a movie shelf."

","Looked at by a younger crowd, certain special effects shown in ""Citizen Kane"" are next to nothing.  If it is looked at by a somewhat different view, and acceptance of the time period, its classic aspect shows through. Beginning and ending at the final scene, the movie explores themes of: love, loneliness, greed, and an outspoken man from the perspectives of those around him.<br/><br/>
The intensity of the piece is displayed with a single word and shown in its significance at Xanadu, Kane's mansion, lonely and unfinished.  Married, yet still alone, Kane may be perceived as a man who just had a lot of money, with no real place to put it.  Truth being that Kane's wealth overlooks the longing for compassion.  By giving away bought material, and longing for actual feeling in return, Kane finds himself in near desperation.<br/><br/>The movie shows a boys with anticipating potential, turned suddenly and against his will into a man with little talents other than stealing coworkers and accepting a bad reputation.  After ridiculously spontaneous engagements, and empty friendships, Kane is even more reduced to an unfinished Xanadu and impartial servants. ""Citizen Kane"" is a man who claimed himself to be an American.  With all the profits and capitalism and uneducated spending, it's a perfect title.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" is a good motion picture that wouldn't be a waste of time to see.  On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) ""Citizen Kane"" rates an eight.  High in wealth and low in social standings, Charles Kane is viewed from many angels: by the camera, and by viewers."

","The negative reviews here are symptoms of the age: Value as measured by the capacity to entertain, or more broadly, value as measured by utility. But Citizen Kane is not about entertainment or utility; it's about art, a profound exploration of the human condition. The negative reviews say everything about the reviewers and nothing about Citizen Kane; namely, they're a testament to their poor taste and overall flawed aesthetic judgment. It's funny that they think that they're being somehow revolutionary with these reviews when in fact they merely reveal their own common, plebian tastes. Notice the movies one of the negative reviewers lists: The Godfather, Schindler's List, Memento, Psycho, It's a Wonderful Life - all classics save one - the common denominator being that they all contain either loud crashes, loud blasts, screaming, speed, physical assaults etc. etc. This is totally consistent with the modern pop-sensibility which has no taste for anything quiet, though it's precisely in the softest whispers of our lives where the deepest profundity is found. Such a person, of course, would have no use for such quiet, slow moving classics as Persona, Wild Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, or Elvira Madigan - but would certainly consider the nihilistic likes of Kill Bill to be an instant masterpiece. (Quentin Tarantino: The most overrated director around. Nothing but a cheap, pandering nihilist. A friend of mine recently asserted that Pulp Fiction is the most important film of the '90s.

This movie doesn't do any of that, in fact, even though it's 62 years old now, it still has an incredibly modern feel to it.<br/><br/>There is in fact only one flaw that i have noticed, and that is at the very begining where they are showing shots of the outside of his manor and it is quite apperent that there are backdrops, but, you must remember that this was on a super tight budget over 6 decads ago. Besides that, the film is flawless. It tells the story of a man who was able to haev an extrodinary life and still not be able to be happy with it. This film is the kind of movie that inspires people to become film makers, as it uplifts without being cheesy, shocks without swearing or bloog or gore and speaks volumes of a man's life without truly telling all there is to tell about him.

","Many times people just look at the plot of movies to determine if a movie is ""great"" or ""classic"".  I will admit, Citizen Kane was not the most exciting movie, nor was its plot fascinating to say the least, but there are other things that makes this movie one of the most influential in history of films.  Orson Wells is an innovative director.  He took ""Cinematography"" (the shots used to make a movie) to a whole different level.  Before Citizen Kane, movies had the generic still shots and other bland camera angles. Wells used close-ups, various camera angles, and he even cut a hole in a floor to get a shot of Kane that looked up at him (most likely to make him look bigger and more powerful).  So, maybe the next time you go see a movie, you can look at the Cinematography and how directors influence how you see things in a movie, and then you can appreciate what Wells did for Cinema."

The camera angles and black and white shades are the best I have ever seen. The last time I was impressed with the camerawork was ""The Matrix"". The narrative is very well done with the initial brief montage followed up by different perspectives of Kane as we go on. I did get briefly bored towards the middle of the movie when it looked like all we were going to be served up is a tycoon's story in detail. But the narrative really took off with Jed Leland's interview and manages to describe a man with as much accomplishment as one can expect in two hours. The remarkable thing is that one gets the feeling that one has known Kane for twenty years with just two hours of watching the movie. There is no tawdry sentimentalism either. It manages to comment on society and the press without getting too preachy either.<br/><br/>Altogether a very good movie. But is certainly not #1 on my list. I find ""American Beauty"" to be much better (not in cinematography). Dont know if I missed something remarkable about this movie.

Citizen Kane not only changed the face of Hollywood with a story that encapsulated a grand story into two hours, it also helped usher in a whole new perspective of looking at film, discovering different forms which never would have been conceived. Not only was the story engrossing, the technical aspects of the film proved to be a cut above the rest, still looking contemporary in this world of split second edits and explosions. No film has ever captured a self actualized person like Kane, a man who has everything and can do virtually anything he wanted. In a way, it is a telling tale of our current media ills, allowing one person or one organization to own too much, creating his own slant on the news for his own wishes. It's a shame Welles had to wait so long before receiving acclaim for this film."
"clampton","Null","1","2","7 June 2002"," A Great Film. Here Are the Ways in Which It's Great.
","Pauline Kael said that Citizen Kane ""is a masterpiece, but a shallow masterpiece.""  It's not hard to see her point.  The script by Herman Mankiewicz is extremely clever, packed with enough witty lines to fill a book of quotes and structured as an innovative set of (often out of sequence) flashbacks, but Kane himself is something of a cartoon, an idealistic young man who eventually reveals himself as an opportunist, a stock theatrical type.  As a story, Kane is heavy on the irony, light on the deeper emotions.<br/><br/>But Kane is great in two areas:  acting and technique.  The former is supplied by one of the greatest casts ever put together in a film:  Orson Welles (in his best big screen performance), Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Dorothy Comingore, and a uniformally terrific set of supporting players.  The latter is supplied by Director Welles and Cinematographer Greg Toland, who enjoy equal credits at the end of the film. This suggests that the technique is highly visual, which it is.  The film is an unsurpassed visual experience; few modern movies even come close. Welles and Toland invented film noir and few directors or cinematographers have done it as well.  (Bernardo Bertolucci and Ridley Scott have probably come closest.)<br/><br/>Even better, the technique informs the story.  The warring shots of Welles and Cotten, interspersed throughout the flashback sequences, tell far more about their relationship than words could convey.  The widely-praised sequence around the breakfast table, which encapsulates the progress of Kane's first marriage into about 2-3 minutes, is a spectacular example of technique relating story, but so are the chorus girl sequence, the Declaration of Principles sequence, and the deservedly famous sequence where Kane trashes Susan's room after she's left him.  (The last was done in single takes, since Welles essentially destroyed the set as it was being shot.)<br/><br/>Bottom line:  If you aren't fascinated by cinematic technique, you quite probably will enjoy Kane for the sheer cleverness of the story.  But if you're the kind of person who watches a film with an eye toward innovative ways of telling a story, this film may be a revelatory experience.  And be sure to watch the DVD version, with alternate soundtracks by both Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdonavich that explain the technique in great detail."

","Although Kane did not top my personal list (it lost a photo finish to Casablanca), it is easy for me to see how it tops so many others. Although its technical aspects have long since been surpassed, you must remember that, like any great piece of art, Kane cannot be removed from its place in time. It is not terribly difficult to create a fake Picasso, for example, but the original has value because of the vision of the artist, not the brush strokes themselves. Welles was certainly not lacking in vison for Kane. What further separates Kane from the pack is its strong acting and great tragedy; that of a man that achieved great wealth, power, and fame, was destroyed by it and on his deathbed yearns for the simple life of his youth that was later denied to him."

There are few films ever attacking greed, there has yet to be a movie attacking Michael Eisner or Ruppert Murdoch because they are larger then life figures that provide goodness such as Mickey Mouse and the Superbowl. What I mean to illustrate is that this film shows what emptiness exists when we place material possession above all else. The storyline is excellent and the technics used are great.

After just beginning my first film studies course and just finishing my first real reading analyzing film techniques I, scene after scene, minute after minute, saw all the effective techniques that were explained in the chapter as guidelines in order to make a film that will impact and have a subconscious long lasting impact on the viewers.  Thus I had to ask after leaving the film which came first the books on film techniques or Citizen Kane?"
"badmaash9911","7","1","2","31 January 2002"," A great film
","Citizen Kane isn't just some ordinary film.  Produced and directed in the 1940's, Citizen Kane can very well be considered one of the greatest films ever made. The film begins with the appearance of being a search for `rosebud', but ends up following one man's life through his triumphs and tribulations.  Each flashback and memoir adds another dimension to Kane's developing character.  At times, the audience cheers for the underdog, while at others, one can't help but wonder how a man could be so stubborn. Overall, this depressing but complex movie is amazingly directed.  The acting is excellent, and the plot moves along smoothly.  One must come without any expectations, in order to get the most out of this movie.  Who knows?  Citizen Kane may very well convince even the most skeptical audience of its brilliance."

","Citizen Kane is an excellent example of great hollywood cinema.  I had always wanted to see it, but actually had no idea what it was about before watching it.  It was very different than I had expected.  I guess the underlying meaning is that you can have all of the money and be surrounded by possessions and people, and still be the loneliest person around.  Kane owned newspapers, had wives, `friends' and a huge castle with all of the riches from Europe, but couldn't find happiness.  With all of his wealth, he became self absorbed, and believed he could buy love and people.   Because of this, he lost everything.   I thought that the story line about Rosebud was interesting, and was a great way to show this man's life in a way people could understand.  I think my favorite scene in the movie is when Kane and his wife are sitting at the table, first as newleweds, and then it shows how their relationship changes over time.  I thought it was sad, but a pretty real view of marriages, and the strain that a workaholic can put on relationships."

","As a classis American film, Orson Wells' Citizen Kane helped form the foundation of American cinema.  I thought it was brilliant.   I was intrigued from beginning to end.  The newsreel beginning and various flashbacks provided the audience with brief glimpses into the life of a complex character, Charles Foster Kane.  The retrospective angle of the movie adds to the mystery of Kane, who was misunderstood throughout his life, and after his death.  This movie was extremely well-crafted and amazing to watch.

","I have no idea why this film is disliked so much by the previous people, who have commented. OK the movie doesn't include the white house being blown to smitheriens or a light sabre battle but it does tell a story, and that story is told remarkably well. If you come to this film expecting it to be on a par with the no brain blockbusters of today then you will be dissapointed. This film tells a story about a man and how his life has affected everyone around him. He is a man that cannot give love but he has to be loved. It is just a great film that requires you to think and observe. Orson Welles was a genius who was so underused and underated in his lifetime that it is only correct that this should start to be rectified. Pity it wasn't done earlier, so he could have made more films. Another great film is Touch of Evil."

"sehguhc19","8","1","2","19 December 2000"," Brilliance from the master of cinema, Orson Welles
","Citizen Kane is said to be the greatest film ever made. I haven't seen all of the films ever made in the world; therefore I couldn't make a decision, but if the greatest film is out there, and even slightly resembles Kane, it is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The intense Orson Welles, the mastermind of the film, was a perfectionist; and it showed. He did not confine his film to the limits of the period it was made in and it helped to revolutionize the film industry with Kane. The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created. 	<br/><br/>The main factor that sets Citizen Kane apart from other films as being brilliant is the lighting. Welles manipulated the lighting so that it wasn't just another causality of a motion picture, but served as symbolism and emotion. Also, he used the type of lighting more often used in theater productions. For example, every reporter conveyed in the film was filmed in shadow, regardless of the natural lighting in the scene.  This showed that Welles pictured all reporters as one like being: they had no personality of their own and were only focused on unearthing the meaning of Kane's final word, 'Rosebud'. This view of Welles', actually, was very apropos, considering that Welles and the film were hounded by the media as a result of the Hearst scandal. Also, Kane's elaborate mansion, Xanadu, was also filmed in shadow. This symbolized that Xanadu was a product of Kane's dark obsession with greed and his quest for power and acceptance. The lighting in this film heightened effect of various characters and objects throughtout the film and made the message of the film more visual to the audience. 	<br/><br/>Another aspect that made this film revolutionary was the editing. Orson Welles was the first director/screenwriter to use the effect of flashbacks, so the film was not in chronological order, as the case with others of its period. For example, the film started with Kane uttering `Rosebud' and slumping over in death. Basically, the entire film was composed of a series of flashbacks. The reporters interviewed all of the integral people in Kane's life and each person reflected back on their most important experiences with him. The various people traced back from his happy and poor childhood to his cold and lonely death.  Another aspect of the editing used in the film was to show the passage of time between scenes and how it affected the principle characters in it. For example, when Kane and his first wife, Emily, were sitting at the breakfast table, they began with sitting very close to each other and acting very warmly towards each other. The scenes were formatted in a montage, in which Kane and Emily sat farther and farther apart (and acted estranged) as time progressed. Also, when Susan Alexander, Kane's second wife, was feeling alone in their loveless marriage, she began to do a jigsaw puzzle. Again, a montage was composed of her gradually doing the puzzle and a cut to the clock and so on, until the puzzle was completed. 	<br/><br/>Citizen Kane also expressed revolutionary cinematography. Orson Welles and the rest of the staff went beyond any other film with the techniques they used to create Kane. For example, Welles dug a hole in the floor in order to create a low angle in the shot. This gave the characters an order of power and also caused the studio to furnish the sets with ceilings. They had to do this because the low angles exposed the ceilings in the shots, and all of the sets built in the forties did not have ceilings. Also, it was filmed in deep focus photography. Films of that era usually focused upon the main object in a shot, and the background was out of focus. In Citizen Kane, Everything, including the background, was in focus, causing the scene to have greater depth and the audience to be able to see what the characters are doing in the background. 	<br/><br/>So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original, and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant. One main factor makes Citizen Kane regarded as the greatest film ever madeÂ… and that factor is Orson Welles. He was the mastermind behind a film that changed the face of cinema as we know it. Besides being remembered as the greatest film ever made, Kane is also remembered for the word `Rosebud'. What did Welles want that word to signify? Happiness cannot be bought. As you watch the movie, you will figure out what it means for yourself and also expand your mind for having watching such brilliance."

","CITIZEN KANE is the fascinating story of a man who becomes the most powerful man in the world.  He doesn't run a Government or an Army.  He is a media mogul.  And he truly runs the world.  The films opening is a close-up on a NO TRESPASSING sign, and that's the closing shot.  KANE opens with a mesmorizing sequence in which the title character dies, muttering only one word.  The rest of the story is told in quasi-flashback.  A man wants to find out what Kane meant by his dying words.  So he interviews various people close to Kane and more of the man is unveiled.  (Impossibly Samll Spoiler!)He started out as an idealist and was corrupted (Spoiler Ends.). Orson Welles plays the title character and plays him wonderfully.  Another actor who show up here are Joseph Cotton.  There are many others (Especially Kane's Mistress.) who are splendid, but unfortunately I can't recall their names.  The cinematography is marvelous.  There is not plot whatsoever. It's simply the sutdy of one man.  And a great film."
"Calysta","8","1","2","23 April 2000"," Do we all think it is the greatest motion picture?
","A brilliant cast, with Joseph Cotten serving brilliantly as the right hand man of Welles. In turn, Orson Welles in his most famous role, or perhaps one of the most famous characters in all of Hollywood's history. Screenplay of Academy Award calibre was penned by the leading man and the director.<br/><br/>
RKO studios, although doomed against the fatale of other Hollywood competition, was so confident about the picture that it was released with the promotional tagline ""Everyone's talking about it!"" And although RKO became defunct, not every studio goes down with nine Astaire-Rogers films, let alone ""Citizen Kane"".<br/><br/>Indeed people are still talking about the film with good reason. But ask the typical teenager about my age the most famous film ever made and they're more likely to come out with ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Gone With the Wind"". That is, if they don't come out with ""American Beauty"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" first. <br/><br/>In 1941, ""Citizen Kane"" received its accolades, but Orson Welles was an ignored and underrated Tinseltown figure, which justifies ""The Third Man"" never being nominated best picture. ""How Green Was My Valley"" may have been the winner of the coveted Best Picture that year, but it didn't take out the number one spot on the AFI's controversial list, and it wouldn't take the Oscar today if the Awards occurred again. <br/><br/>The underlying problem is that even ""Citizen Kane"" itself may have been blown too much out of proportion for its own good. <br/><br/>As a fourteen year old, I am more inclined to pick the AFI's number 98th listed film on the Top 100 ""Bringing Up Baby"" as my favourite film of the 1930s and 1940s.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane's"" theme is certainly a powerful, compelling and thought provoking one. The idea that death comes at a moment of dissatisfaction probably rings true for humans, the idea of never finding what is lost and never understanding fully exactly what was lost is all probably true as well. <br/><br/>And if ""Citizen Kane"" is that good, why is there such a problem with it being stated as the best film ever made?<br/><br/>The underlying answer is likely to be that mainstream audience, and the fewer who indulge in classic film, cannot take heavy, intense drama as easily screwball comedy. As I would classify myself as one of those people, I would never leave ""Citizen Kane"" off my personal greatest films list, but I could never speak of it as the best movie of all time.<br/><br/>Film professionals may state ""Kane"" is without a doubt the best movie ever made, but more people would be able to recognise the tune ""Over the Rainbow"" than understand the irony if someone dropped dead smashing a crystal ball uttering ""Rosebud"".<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","""Rosebud"" is the last word that is uttered by a rich but unhappy man. Then he dies and takes his secret into death: What is the meaning of ""Rosebud""? An investigating committee is quickly installed that illuminates and unwinds his life once again, like in a time-lapse film. The tragical existence of the powerful newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane becomes visible, his solitude. Although married twice, he always stayed alone, because of his incapacity of feeling love, of giving love - a love related to somebody else but himself. All women finally leave him behind on his enormous mountain palace Xanadu, on which he sits enthroned high above all human beings, so high that he finds it impossible to get anywhere near them. A distant God, resident on earth, a symbol for the inability of Man to communicate with God, for God's unrelenting distance? Maybe we can also find that. But Charles Foster Kane has got a human touch, too. His life ends in failure, despite all the accumulated power and wealth. And the key to this failure might be found in childhood, or rather the loss of childhood.<br/><br/>For only when being a child he felt safe, somewhere in the immensity of the American North, under the loving care of his mother - probably the only person in his entire life he was ever able to show feelings for. Then he becomes rich by accident, by some happy (or must we say unhappy?) constellation of parentage. He is hurled out his familiar surroundings, taken away from the protection of the snowy landscape - the kingdom of his childhood. However much he resists and clings to his modest wooden sledge, he irretrievably has to go out into the ""big world"", where he is raised, far away from his mother, and where he eventually builds up his empire. Of course, it is only a hollow construction and finally turns to dust. The wooden sledge, called ""Rosebud"", is taken away by the flames like all the other goods and possessions that he has accumulated in the course of time and which he has conserved in the wide chambers of his palace: souvenirs from his journeys, sculptures, vases or jewelry - things without a lasting value for posterity. Death sweeps it all away. And so, at the end of the film, you see nothing but an endless pillar of smoke, which is rising up into a darkly clouded sky, and in which everything definitely dissolves, our childhood, our memories, our entire life."

The lighting, editing and cinematography were all basically new to the world. Based on this, it shocked the film industry into being the greatest film ever created.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane played by Welles himself rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' because he ""thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper."" Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing ""yellow journalism"" which, though frowned upon by most critics, proved immensely profitable.<br/><br/>The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large ""NO TREPASSING"" sign on the gate of Kane's ""Xanadu"" dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the vastness of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, ""Rosebud."" With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. The remainder of the film is largely comprised of flashbacks.<br/><br/>Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane's close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane's would be mentor Mr. Bernstien. <br/><br/>There had never been a picture like ""Citizen Kane."" It openly satirized a wealthy and powerful living American, it deliberately antagonized Hollywood's ruling elite, and it bravely ignored conventional cinema technique Innovative, aggressive, and fascinating, ""Citizen Kane"" electrified a complacent industry Welles dominated Kane He had become, in a single stroke, the most admired, envied, praised and detested man in Hollywood Unhappily, the movie industry never learned to utilize Welles' quixotic genius, and his career never rescaled the heights it had reached in 1941.<br/><br/>Other than the acting and story part, what does it take to make a great movie, yup the cinematography and the editing. I consider the best filmmakers to be great cinematographers first. And yes Citizen Kane has it all great great photography and slick editing techniques used that too in those days. So is Citizen Kane the best film ever created? I am not the world's biggest film buff, but I do know that it is incomparable to anything that I have ever seen before. It is truly original and that is what makes it so incredibly brilliant."

","It was a good movie. For many years I avoided this movie because all my life it was touted by ""elite"" movie critics as the best movie ever made. I finally saw it in January 2006. In its original uncut form. It was a pretty darn good movie. However I thought that the screenplay and acting, especially by Orsen Welles, was rather stiff, formulaic, and contrived. I think that the only reason it received high acclaim was the fact that it was very controversial at the time, was not a hit at the box office, and was generally not liked by the general populace. Remember the context of the time in which it was filmed. World war II was in its infancy. People were just not in the mood to see this kind of autocratic genre, particularly the opulence of Xanadu. People just were not in the mood for this type of movie. There was one movie, however, that the people were looking for that was very relevant at the time, family oriented and emotional. To the credit of the Academy, this other movie (go ahead look it up) won the Oscar for best movie in 1941, beating Citizen Kane. It also won other Oscars. If Citizen had been produced in the 60s, I would have rated it higher than 4, but I believe it has been vastly overrated. Gold standard, not hardly."
"hiproductions","8","2","7","8 May 2005"," There is a reason this is a MUST SEE for all Cinephiles
","Orson Welles effectively employed writing, cinematography, mis en scene, directing, sound, editing, acting, and even ideology to bring us his masterpiece Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>This script was written to provide an immediate ""button"" by which we're engaged to continue watching. The button is an old man dying, dropping a glass ball, and uttering the word ""Rosebud"". This soon becomes, what Hitchcock called, ""The Mcguffin"", an object, in this case 'information', that is pursued throughout the picture. The audience, like the reporter on the screen, becomes curious to find out who or what ""rosebud"" is. Another element of writing that was used effectively was the exposition of the newspaper tycoon's back story via a newsreel and at other times the newspaper headline. A great use of subtext was displayed in the wife's constant building of jigsaw puzzles. It was a metaphor for the life of Kane and the jigsaw builder was the reporter. <br/><br/>Cinematography and mis en scene worked together to give the picture a timeless quality that allows for a film student to be taken back to the early 20th century and experience Kane's life in the first person. The smoke-filled rooms and silhouettes of the news guys make us feel like they are in the theater with us while conferring and asking their questions. Close ups and soft lighting allow us to feel comfortable with Kane as he falls in love with the ""singer"". The mis en scene of the Kane mansion was excellent (for that time). I had difficulty determining if the establishing shot of the large mansion was an actual house or just a painted set. The dramatic point of the movie when Kane was tearing apart Susan's (Dorothy Comingmore) bedroom was perfectly dressed and perfectly destroyed before our eyes. Other moments of mis en scene: Kane as a boy in the setting of pure white snow bespeaks his innocence. The crowded room of statues at the end had me looking closely to determine if any of the statues were genuine! Another noteworthy mention is Orson Welles makeup, however much he wore, was so realistic it was frightening. He looked as he did at his ACTUAL late age prior to his passing.<br/><br/>Sound and editing worked well together to bolster the drama of many scenes in this film. From the scary, sad music establishing the Kane mansion and Kane's death to the screech of a cockatiel marking his wife's departure, sound was a consistent element of dramatic support. The continual audio overlaps like Kane's clapping for Susan's private performance to the public applause of his nomination, laughter that steals in as Susan attempts to perform her operetta, a scream from a party outside the room as Kane slaps her, and the shrill shriek of the cockatiel as she leaves Kane, all made for great exposition. Also, the deep resonating echoes in the Kane mansion tell us how open, cold, and lonely the house must have been.<br/><br/>Editing was smart and, as the great editing genius Dmytrk taught, invisible. Economic use of quick cuts and swish pans during the Dinner table scene between Kane and Mary, transitions from Kane and Susan in her room, to Kane and his political friends at his nomination, and from this to his grand public acceptance speech allowed for much information and the passing of time to be delivered effectively and quietly.<br/><br/>William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon, whom this film is purported to portray, was so insulted by its similarities to his life, he banned its mention in any of his many newspapers (sounds like something Kane would do). According to Dr. Jack K. Ringler, historian and professor of history at CCSN, Mr. Hearst was widely known to use his newspapers to stir up agitation from the American public towards the Spanish government just prior to the Spanish-American war. This, Hearst believed, made for good stories and GREAT circulation. The fact that Kane is found to harp on his editors and writers declaring, ""We will go to war against Spain"" clearly demonstrates Welles' ideology through his character Kane, whose life, at the very least, parallels Mr. Hearst's. The ideology of twisted news reporting that is bent to flow the way of the personal views of the media 'owners' (i.e. Ted Turner) clearly comes across throughout the movie. Kane's declaration, ""I determine what the people need to hear"" exemplifies the media's ability (and sometimes willingness) to editorialize instead of report fact.<br/><br/>The directing of Citizen Kane was so tight that it is difficult to believe that it was accomplished by a 1st-time director, and by a director that acted the lead role at the same time! His choice to make an unorthodox choice of staging, acting, editing, and framing the dinner table scenes with his wife Mary (Agnes Moorhead), his movement and blocking of actors in the opera performance scenes, and his presentation of the Hearst/Kane dwelling were brave for 1941! His vision of the finished piece is the only explanation for the successful integration of so many film elements."

","I picked up Citizen Kane from the library with a preconceived critical attitude.  I had heard, from other young'ns (I'm currently 25), that Citizen Kane is an overrated film thats greatness depends entirely on the context within which it was originally made; it's a landmark in cinematography and film technique, but the plot is lousy and the movie is overall dull.  Its fanbase is mostly crusty old people or young people who want to appear cultured to the aforementioned crusty old people.  I wanted to see for myself: Does Citizen Kane stand the test of time?<br/><br/>Having finally watched it, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the plot. It was not exactly gripping, and certainly not original by today's standards.  But it was interesting to me and it does pose a number of questions for pondering.<br/><br/>What would you do if you had all the money in the world?  What exactly is it that you want in life?  What do you want to achieve in life, and more importantly, why?  Do you want the right things for the wrong reasons?  Is who you claim to love more a reflection of yourself than the ""loved"" person? Are you going through life with a chip on your shoulder, with something to prove, that affects everything you do and every decision you make?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, an okay plot and groundbreaking cinematography alone can't carry a movie.  In general I felt the acting was average, occasionally bad. Likewise, the script had its memorable lines, but then again at times was downright corny, even campy.  In general the characters feel distant and impersonal, like you're reading about them in the paper instead of watching them in a movie.<br/><br/>When I think of a great film, films that are on my top-20 list, I think primarily of films that I would enjoy seeing over and over.  I think of films that have scenes that I never tire of.  I think of movies that draw you in, connect with you, and leave an impact.  Frankly, Citizen Kane is not one of these films.  I'm glad I finally saw it, but I won't be rushing to buy the DVD for my collection.  It might, just maybe, make my top-50 list, but certainly not my top 20.<br/><br/>I think that movie organizations such as AFI ought to have two seperate rankings.  There are the ""Greatest Movies,"" and THEN there should also be the ""Most Significant Movies.""  Citizen Kane would be listed highly in this most-significant list.  It would also be in the ""Greatest"" list, but not nearly as high.

Citizen Kane is literally an encyclopedia of film technique, because every single shot in the film is completely packed with visual information that goes far beyond just pointing at the action to show what's happening. <br/><br/>However, it's not the fact that Orson Welles utilized these techniques or the idea that he created or invented them, because nearly all of these techniques can be seen in films that came before Citizen Kane. The amazing thing here is that there are dozens and dozens of those techniques that can be found in various earlier films, but EVERYTHING is here, and there is so much going on and it is presented so carefully and with such a calculated result that its style dwarfs anything seen before or since.<br/><br/>
Citizen Kane is not a movie that is likely to thrill or keep an audience on the edge of their seats, especially a modern audience. It is definitely a drama, and it does move fairly slowly at many points, but it is such an amazing thing to watch if you know what to look for. The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my skull. But as I read and learned more and more about it, I realized what things symbolize in the film and I learned about angles and distance and character position and frame composition, which has made me come to realize more and more why it is considered to be the greatest American film ever made. Watch it more than once, because no one can see all that there is to see in Citizen Kane after just one viewing."

","If there was a ever a film that became a trail-blazer for every other great film of its kind, it is ""Citizen Kane"".  Oh sure there were great films before ""Citizen Kane"" (""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""It Happened One Night"", ""Gone With the Wind""), but none of those films, as great as they were, struck a nerve within the viewer like ""Citizen Kane"" does.  Orson Welles (Oscar-nominated in acting and directing, Oscar-winning in writing) shows unmatched talent at the ripe old age of 26.  A young reporter tries to discover what was meant by ""Rosebud"", Kane's last word on his deathbed, by interviewing those that were closest to him during his life.  What follows are flashbacks into Kane's past.  Kane's ambition leads to success, money, and basically anything he wants.  He marries a beautiful young woman and they have a son almost immediately.  However, as time passes Kane's ambition destroys his marriage.  While Kane is making moves to get into high political offices, he is caught in a web of circumstance (being in a lady friend's apartment) and loses his wife and son.  Then they are killed in a automobile accident.  This knocks Kane down even further into an abyss of depression.  He marries the young friend and tries to turn her into a star, now realizing that he is basically ruined politically.  His newspaper still flourishes, but at what cost?  As he gains material possessions, he loses all those closest to him and becomes a recluse at his elderly age.  He rarely leaves his huge mansion, he ages terribly, and in the end not even Kane can escape the grips of death.  Through it all, everything is explained about Kane with his final word ""Rosebud"" in the end.  The film is dark, heartrending, and overall brilliant in every sense.  Orson Welles was the catalyst, he drove everyone to the limits.  Gregg Toland's cinematography is revolutionary, nothing like his camera-work had ever been done before.  So many great films benefitted from ""Citizen Kane"".  The list is almost endless.  ""Citizen Kane""'s timing was both a blessing and a curse for the film-makers.  World War II probably kept the film from being as highly-acclaimed as it should have been in 1941.  Oscar turned his eyes toward films like ""How Green Was My Valley"" and ""Sergeant York"" instead of the dark ""Citizen Kane"".  However, the film's greatness puts it into a realm that Oscar will likely never be able to comprehend.  It is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema and one of the greatest achievements of mankind.  ""Citizen Kane"" is one of those things in this world that makes life great and worth living.  5 stars out of 5."

","There are so many people out there who love Citizen Kane and who have written some great reviews about it, having studied the film in much more detail. If you're one of those types of people or you're looking for that type of review, then I would consider you stop reading now. This mini-review is just written from the perspective of someone who enjoys watching films.<br/><br/>Sadly, the average cinema viewer is not going to enjoy or appreciate this film. By today's standards, it is over-rated. This goes for my standards too. Yes, the film has been produced very well, and the photography is excellent. It is even a sad film; the ending is particularly sad, even when we do learn the source of Kane's dying word...with the knowledge that no one will probably ever know. Rightfully so, this film was considered a great film. It's still a good film, albeit over-rated in my eyes.<br/><br/>I would watch this film again, but I would not recommend this film to the average audience.

This movie singlehandedly invented the new way of doing cinema, by propelling this art at least 30 years forward, and it makes me cringe in pain that hollywood took the challenge to stop him so early. By looking at it today, we cannot catch all the subtle (and not) way that a movie of that era should not have had, by the industry standards, dogmae that Welles crushed with creative and promethean fury. It is no understatement (something i didn t say myself, but the biggest before us) saying that Citizen Kane is a beautiful compendium of what all of the modern cinema is."

","It's not a mystery to me why Citizen Kane is remembered: I felt like I was learning about film just watching it. However, due to the fact that the main character is never present, and doesn't seem to have any agency in the events of the film, I couldn't really connect to it at all. Secondly, there was almost no plot in that no new events lead on to others, only story: the events that lead up to plot.

","""Citizen Kane"" is perhaps the most well-regarded and highly celebrated film of all time and manages to captivate aspiring filmmakers to this day. It explores the life of a man named Charles Foster Kane (Orson Wells) and the intricate and mysterious aspects of his life. The film's approach to the question 'Who is Charles Foster Kane?' is much like the present motif in the film, the jigsaw puzzle, which assembles several pieces but never allows the viewer to fully put the picture together. <br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" broke new ground in 1941 with original technical abilities and ahead-of-its-time techniques that filmmakers still use to this day. It's a wonder how Orson Wells, who co-wrote and directed the picture, understand the avenues of camera movement and editing to create a stunning piece of art. Even to this day, the film features astounding cuts, transitions, and crisp sound mixing that rivals today's artists. <br/><br/>The story is somewhat ambiguous to the viewer watching it for the first time and is definitely different than most stories still. The script itself, is an intricate and complex puzzle of a man the audience doesn't truly get to learn all they can about. Yet, that's the purpose of the story: a character riddle. Audiences should be prepared for a film that is highly layered and narratively unusual, yet compelling. <br/><br/>One complaint I have with the picture is one particular transition that seems to puzzle me to this day (pun intended). Even with repeated viewings, I still wonder why that transition was done the way it was done and am consistently taken out of the gripping story because it feels bizarre. Perhaps this is a modern viewer bias but this small mistake is the only one found in this film. <br/><br/>Anyone interested in watching ""Citizen Kane"" should keep a few things in mind: One, this film should be viewed more than once. Every truly great film should be repeated in viewing but ""Citizen Kane"" is one that really can't be fully grasped in ambition and story until much more viewings. So the best thing to do is enjoy the ride and try and hang on. Two, it's slow at first but becomes gripping the more you watch it. And three, is not a casual movie watching experience. It requires full attention and focus. <br/><br/>If the viewer keeps an open mind and accepts the film, it will amaze and astound. It truly is no surprise why ""Citizen Kane"" is hailed as the greatest film of all time. It's timeless, beautifully shot, and narratively revolutionary."

Orson Welles's performance, as one might expect, was intense and expressive. The film's plot with its mystery structure and extensive flashbacks were well-done as well.<br/><br/>I don't know enough about film to critique Citizen Kane on that level, but I can say confidently that it is not just a great movie.

It had such innovative, creative and spectacular cinematography, where they had to create such an amazing idea that now it seems so normal to do, to just put the camera below ground level to create such a high-angled shot. The film has a great story, that is completely original all because it came right out of the director's mind. Him having complete control of making the film how he wanted it made it that much better than it could have ever been. The cast to the film was overall well with their acting, seeming as if they are not even trying to act but as if it is their actual lives we are watching the film in. I will always recommend this film to people who haven't seen it yet (as I am surprised many people haven't) and I will always say that this is easily one of the greatest films of all time, for story, for acting, for how it was created, and the ideas behind the scenes of the creation of the film as well.

","Going all the way back in to nineteen forty-one and reviewing after finally watching Citizen Kane is an interesting experience to say the least. Also this two hours film in a few years is going to be eighty years old, so watching it and now reviewing it is like time-traveling and been a Whovian to the core I can't but feel goosebumps.<br/><br/>So the film is centered to a group of journalist who try to find out what the final words of a publishing tycoon Kane meant. During their visiting we get by numerous a persons, friends, adversaries, once loved ones to him who was Kane. Everone is giving us a different take, others say that he was a annoying arrogant fraud, some a brilliant entrepreneur, others a bossy and authoritarian figure. During these interviews and read we see flashbacks of his life and how his people next to him perceive him. In other words we don't take the same portrait from two different people for Mr. Kane, this is also true in life, for one a man maybe funny and quit interesting, while someone else is going to find him a obnoxious A-hole, you can be liked to anyone I guess.<br/><br/>One thing which struck me about the film is that it begun with a about ten minute montage of Kane's life, in short Orson Welles spoils the events from the get go. But after-wards what we get is the point of view of these events from the people who were doing them , but never from Kane himself ,which is ironic having the title character not been the central character. In truth Kane is the key of the plot and the plot is...wait for it... who was he really? If you had to summarizes the whole movie it comes to that who was he, a hero, a scum, an over-ambitious man, it is in the end up to the viewer to decide who he could judge him. <br/><br/>This why I believe that this film has become one of the classics, it is a case study of the life of a man from his start to his final days and after-wards the people around him ,the pre-mentioned friends, adversaries, loved ones and added to them the press are going to give their point of view about him. In other words we are the protagonist of our own movie, which is our life (!), the audience and the critics the persons surrounding us who will give their own grade to that matter from 10/10 to 0/10.<br/><br/>All in all it was a great character study and if you are interested in psychology, sociology or public relationships you have to give it a watch."

","Citizen Kane, the genius masterpiece of Orson Welles, is a piece of film that, despite the limited technology, technique or industry available to filmmakers in the early 1940s, still stands today as some of the best cinematography and writing in the history of film. With a thoroughly engaging plot, fantastic technique and ridiculously advanced cinematography for the time, this is one of the rare black and white films of the 1930s and 40s that still engages and captivates audiences today. It is a truly stunning mystery film, with an interesting structure and a unique, original story-line that remains as relevant as ever, 76 years after the film's release. Indeed, in my opinion, there will never quite be another film like Citizen Kane.

","I don't like a lot of old movies. I love all of Alfred Hitchcock's classic suspense films and I had heard very mixed things about Citizen Kane when I borrowed it from the library. It seems like it must be a very polarizing movie because most of the comments and reviews here, plus all of the ""word of mouth"" I have gotten over the years, seems to put people either at one extreme or the other, saying that this is the greatest film of all time or that it's the most overrated piece of garbage movie that's ever been made in the history of film.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised when I watched it to find out that I am in the ""loved it!"" camp. The acting, writing, cinematography and direction are all absolutely top notch in my mind, especially when you consider this film was made in 1941.<br/><br/>Is it the greatest film ever? I don't think so. But it definitely was at the time, and look at it this way - ever since then every single great movie had to aspire to be better than this film. They've got more groundbreaking cinematography, etc, but a lot of that is built on what this film had done and therefore owes a lot to it. Also we have to remember there have been great advances in equipment, etc, so people after this era could do more and could do so easier. Even just camera movements would have been a lot more difficult back then. They hadn't even had audio in films for that long at the time! I think a lot of people who hate this movie really are just disliking the fact it is slow and old and in black and white, but if you watch it for what it is this is still a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time."

This is not that movie though. It's just great acting, amazingly ahead of its time cinematography, and some of the best writing ever.<br/><br/>Orson Welles is at his absolute best in this and it doesn't get much better than Citizen Kane. In fact I would say that it doesn't get any better at all than Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, whenever someone asks me what my favourite movie is and I tell them ""Citizen Kane"" and am met with an eye roll (which happens a lot), I lose respect for that person because I've found that 99% of the time they haven't even watched the movie themselves and just hate old/black and white movies, or they did watch it and hate it for reasons they can't really explain.<br/><br/>Best movie ever in my opinion!"

That isn't to say that all modern day films are bad, but some of them are just crap. Those who can't respect this film for what it is really need to take a second look. This may not look great by today's standards for most people, but for people like me and for those back then, this is the best you can get. It may not be action packed, and it may not be the most visually stunning movie ever, but it is a movie that moved me and film making in general. So, is it the best movie ever? That's debatable. Is it the most important movie ever? Yes! This is basically the Genisus for film in general! Star wars and Jaws improved it Tenfold, but this started it. So it holds a place in history.

"bgdenk","8","1","3","28 December 2016"," A Real Story
","Orson Welles ,although most famous for directing, writing, and acting, never had full control over a movie after the release of his 1941 film ""Citizen Kane"". The movie at first was heavily criticized due to the meaning behind the film. The film was made in the french style of ""Film Noir"". Although colored movies had been around for a little bit of time, Welles decided to film the whole movie in black and white in order to use the colors to show good and evil. ""Citizen Kane"" is known as one of the most influential films in history and is worth the watch. <br/><br/>The plot of the film centers around the character Charles Foster Kane, who is Welles's version of William Randolph Hearst ,one of the most wealthy men in the world at the time. Kane at a young age gets ""sold"" by his mother ,in order to get him away from his father, to a very wealthy man who represents a bank. Kane at the age of 21 gets total control over the money he was ""bought"" for. With the money Kane is given he buys a newspaper company ""The New York Chronicle"", at the age of 25. This is made to represent Hearst's newspaper ""The New York Journal"". The power Kane is given after buying this newspaper is being able to decide what the American public reads and believes. He uses this power to be the main reason for the start of the Spanish American War. In the same way Hearst was responsible for the start of the Spanish American in the real world. Jedidiah Leland plays Joseph Cotten in the film who is Kane's best friend who loses trust in him and no longer wants to work for Kane. He is made to represent that Kane does not have the ability to hold a friendship after he has acquired power and wealth. The film tells the story of Hearst's struggles with relationships, finances, and yearn for power. <br/><br/>Welles's film is one of the most industry changing films of all time. It showed insight into the world of corrupt businesses and wealthy scandals. It changed peoples views and how they saw those who controlled the world they lived in. It was not a popular movie at the time and the studio separated themselves from Welles. This film is worth watching because of how it has influenced the world today. It is a slow moving film at times but has a phenomenal meaning behind it."

Another facet to the film is its ability to smoothly transition through flashbacks and what would otherwise be confusing story-order. It is quite easy to follow. Lastly, the narrative is a fun piece on the unashamed, pig-headed determination so of humankind go through, only to topple off from what is often their own doing. it really needs to be watched two or three times, to appreciate the acting, photography and craft that went into making this epic."

I like how well they showed Mr. Kane's rise to fame and then how he lost it all, how when he was older he was a forgotten man. When Mr. Kane says, ""rosebud"" it doesn't make any sense, both the audience and the characters are trying to figure out what Mr. Kane's last word ""rosebud"" means. When you do find out what rosebud means you are a little shocked to find out that it was his sled from when he was a kid, maybe Mr. Kane just wanted to go back to when he was a little boy before he was taken away from him parents. Overall I thought this was a very good movie."
"fredschroeder-63011","8","1","3","7 December 2016"," Must See
","I loved the movie, the artfulness that Orson Welles crafts in his films is astounding in this film. The trick to his technique in Citizen Kane lies in mise-en-scene and the tools of film: lighting, framing, editing and angle. The most obvious and prevalent cinematic technique used in Citizen Kane is the lighting. The director meant for it to be a dark picture with very heavy contrasts, so he used single light source. The objective was to use simple lighting in order to give the scene a certain ambiance and in some cases, to further develop the characters with the use of shadows. An example of single source lighting is when Thompson is reading Mr. Thatcher's memoirs. This lone light source creates a sense of isolation which seems to accentuate Thompson's lonely quest. The way the light illuminates the room also says a great deal about Thatcher's personality, especially by how it illuminates the large portrait of him hanging on the wall. The movie is exemplary, Welles' was an artist, uniquely and precisely. It was a good movie solely because of this, the way he told this story, a simple plot, strewn with flashbacks, into an absorbing film is incredible."
"tomtom-00690","8","1","3","5 December 2016"," The review contains my view on ""Citizen Kane"" without effect from those around me that watched the movie and participated in the assignment along side of me.
","With the old cinematic feel of the 1941 film of ""Citizen Kane,"" it draws the attention of many and can be explained in a many of ways determining your standpoint. From the 118 minutes of flashbacks of the life of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), you will find different morals in love, wealth, and what they can do to you if they get into your head. This film is based approximately on the real-life of William Randolph Hearst, another newspaper publisher who built the the nation's largest newspaper chain.<br/><br/>As a reporter travels around the U.S., he is in search of the meaning to Kane's last words. In the midst of interviewing Kanes second wife, Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), lifelong friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), and businessman Mr. Bernstein (Everett Stoane) the reporter is given many pieces to put together and decipher the puzzle. <br/><br/>With the demanding tone and mind-set to deciding the lives of others, producer Orson Welles set to play the part of Kane and has astonishingly been successful. Welles' acting skills are shown as the film furthers more and more. Both Everett Stoane and Joseph Cotten play stern and joyous parts as Kane's personal business men and lifetime friends. <br/><br/>Along with the dramatic and mysterious genres making this movie even better, I enjoyed the layout and the structure made by taking flashbacks to tell the story while as well using the present scenes to show the characters in a more later age. During the interviews, the characters used their memories to complete the all-around bundle of jigsaw puzzle pieces for both the reporter and the audience to put together. This drew my attention more than any factor contributing to ""Citizen Kane.""<br/><br/>From my standpoint of watching this film, the moral I seen most was the creation of ""money is controlling when in the wrong hands."" I say this because as the movie furthers closer to the end you are able to see the scenes gradually becoming darker as Kane's life continues. It seems as though the older the main character becomes, the darker the movie. It is only when another character enters the screen that the scene brightens. This can be symbolized that as more money enters, the more depression and guilt is given.<br/><br/>Movies as this such can be an attention grabber from all with its PG rating, which brings attention to all crowds from young to old. Both telling a meaningful story as well as teaching a lesson. This movie is definitely one to treasure and I absolutely would recommend it to anyone with a hankering for an old cinematic drama/mystery."
"GusF","Null","1","3","9 May 2015"," In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree
","After ""Back to the Future"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", this is my third favourite film of all time. Only 25 years old at the time that it was made, Orson Welles made one of the greatest films of all time. There are not many actors or directors whom I would describe as artists but, in my view, Welles was one of his generation's two greatest artists in the filmmaking sphere, the other being Laurence Olivier. His skills as a director have been much praised over the course of the last 74 years but I want to focus on his skills as an actor first of all. As Charles Foster Kane, Welles is simply magnificent. Through the various flashbacks, we learn about the different sides of the man's character and he excels at playing all of them. Welles plays Kane over a period of more than 50 years and does so with a great deal more passion and gravitas than many actors of comparable age are capable of.<br/><br/>The newsreel footage in the first ten minutes is crucial to our understanding of Kane as it not only places his life in chronological order but it gives us insight into the manner in which he is viewed by the public. The former is significant given the film's format of flashbacks while the latter allows us to contrast the public man with the private man. As shown by his genuinely and deeply meant Declaration of Principles and his confrontation with Thatcher, Kane's motives are pure at the beginning of his journalistic career but he becomes more and more ruthless in his pursuit of power as the years and decades pass by. This is best seen in the recollections of Jed Leland, the closest thing that he had a friend. Leland tells the intrepid journalist Jerry Thompson that he did not think that Kane loved anyone except for himself and his mother. The obvious implication from that statement is that Kane married his first wife Emily Norton as she is the niece of the US President. He comes to neglect her but this pales in comparison to the emotional abuse which he inflicts on his second wife Susan Alexander, which eventually leads her to attempt suicide. In spite of Kane's myriad flaws, I felt pity for him as his actions meant that he was left with no one to care about him. He made a fortune but money cannot buy happiness, as is portrayed in the film in an almost Dickensian way. This is best illustrated by the fact that his dying thoughts are of his boyhood sleigh Rosebud. On his deathbed, he recalls the last time in his life that he was truly happy, playing in the snow outside his mother's boarding house. For Kane, the sleigh represents perfect happiness and his own conception of Elysium. Its simplicity serves as a wonderful contrast to the cold opulence of the 49,000 acre estate of Xanadu, which becomes something of a prison to him in his last years. The sleigh's destruction in the film's final scene represents the death of Kane's dream of achieving happiness.<br/><br/>Welles and his co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz gave all of the best bits to the actor-director himself but our understanding of Kane would be nothing without the supporting characters. The most important of these is perhaps Jed Leland, played very well by Welles' close friend Joseph Cotten. He is most effective as the elderly Leland in the framework scenes and the scene in which Leland, while very drunk, tells Kane exactly what he thinks of him after he loses the gubernatorial election. Leland remains constant throughout the film and this provides another fantastic contrast, this time to Kane himself. If you look carefully, you can also spot Cotten as one of the journalists shrouded in darkness after the newsreel has been played. Dorothy Comingore is excellent as Susan Alexander, a well meaning but not terribly bright or talented young woman whose life is gradually destroyed by Kane. He had something to prove in building the opera house for her and does not allow her to stop singing because it would be too embarrassing for him, not caring at all about the affect that the humiliation is having on her. The rest of the cast is very strong as well, particularly Everett Sloane as the ever loyal Mr Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Ruth Warrick as Emily Norton Kane, Ray Collins as Jim Gettys, William Alland as Jerry Thompson and Paul Stewart as Kane's callous butler Raymond. The most interesting of the minor characters is Kane's mother Mary, played wonderfully by Agnes Moorehead.<br/><br/>The manner in which the film was shot was absolutely innovative in its time and it still looks beautiful. Welles and the cinematographer Gregg Toland pioneered the technique of deep focus for the silver screen in which every part of the frame is in focus simultaneously. This is perhaps best illustrated by the scene in which Mary Kane makes Thatcher her son's legal guardian while the young Kane can be seen playing in the background. What makes it even more impressive is that most of this scene is shot in a single take, as are numerous other scenes in the film. Another very impressively shot scene is the party scene in which Kane celebrates coaxing the Daily Chronicle's best journalists to defect to the Inquirer after six years of trying. this scene involves Kane and numerous chorus girls singing and dancing in the background while Leland and Bernstein have a private conversation in the foreground. At several points, we see Kane reflected in the window on the other side of them. This must have been a logistical nightmare for Welles to shoot but he did it brilliantly."

","""Citizen Kane"" isn't a movie I revisit often, but it's equally engrossing on every viewing. I'm always more interested than emotionally invested. It's definitely a compelling story - sweeping, cynical, sad - and I do say that Charles Foster Kane is extremely memorable, as self-absorbed titans of industry go. But its appeal (for me) is on a technical level, which is consummate, to say the least. It's utterly fascinating from a cinematography standpoint (those shot compositions!), and there's always something on the screen drawing your eye. Most of the time, it's in many directions. Indeed, this movie's artistic craft is beyond question.<br/><br/>Whether or not this measures up to the impossible hype is relative to the viewer. But it is absolutely worth seeing.<br/><br/>8/10"

","(78%) A film that you've seen referenced more times than your're probably even aware. So ignoring most of the influence and admiration that surrounds this, how exactly does a film often regarded as one of the greatest ever actually stack up? Well it's certainly an ambitious film with hardly a single second wasted in expressing its tale of a super wealthy tycoon, which for me at least is a perfect message of the actual reality of riches and success; that truth be told the pursuit of wealth and influence is in a way a con. This is a film that's very much of its time, yet it still has this timeless feel to it, mainly because it tells its tale so well. The second half of the film is as near perfect conclusion as you'll ever likely get from any film, the direction was way ahead of its time, and there's a great sense of sadness that runs through almost everything that still holds up even today. This honestly is not one of my personal favourite films ever, not sure exactly why it just isn't, but as far as a classic films go this is indeed a must watch that should be tracked down by all true cinema fans."

","Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of a film for its artistic aspects as well as its story. The story in short, is about a group of reporters trying to find out what Charles Foster Kane's last word were. This film was directed by Orson Welles and was his first film. throughout the film Welles had a lot of power over the movie, he was given full artistic freedom over the film. Charles Foster the main character is said to have been a portrayal of an actual newspaper journalist William Randolf Hurst, which was another reason the film stirred a little controversy. The film is also said to be way ahead of its time when it comes cinematography, Welles utilized many low angle shots, extreme close ups and long uninterrupted shots."

","Lets face it: they had us at ""Rosebud."" Citizen Kane begins simply enough with an overview of the complicated life of Charles Foster Kane. As the movie progresses the viewers are join the shadow-faced reporter, Thompson and go more in depth into Kane's life through multiple interviews, trying to find the hidden meaning or message of Kane's last words, Rosebud. This great film brings together good acting and believable conversations. With an exciting story and many characters to follow as more and more things get complex in hi life. This film is wonderfully filmed. The high point to me is the character of Thompson. You, the viewer, rarely see his face fully, whether he has his back o the audience or because the light is barely shown on his face, leaving it covered in shadows."

","Okay, this movie is one of those that makes feel stupid for not being in the unison voice of liking it, and at the same time wondering how the heck can this movie land a top spot of great movie lists. The technicalities do support it's status as one of the greats, pioneering those never before seen shots or sequences like the first and last shots, the use of peculiar angles of the cameras, decent effort at age make up, and the use of non linear back and forth story flow styling. But I do agree with those voices that say that the story is entire empty, it does not offer you anything. For me, it's better even the one in The Wolf of Wall Street of even The Great Gatsby, for extreme comparisons. I now have a suspicion that this movie's story is the one to blame as a subliminal campaign that downgrade the moral of the American people due to focusing on the notion that it's okay to get divorced twice as long as you're rich or the sort."

","This film is a prime example of the difference between film critics and film watchers. Whilst there is no doubt that the script, acting, cinematography, direction etc are first rate, it's actually rather boring. It's worth watching once, to see what all the hype is about, but it just doesn't have that entertainment value. I'm probably alone in this view, but if it came out now it'd most likely bomb at the cinema because it's just not watchable enough, particularly for today's audiences who only really want to see modern stars they know or special effects and loud explosions ! Maybe my rating of 3 is a bit harsh, but I'm a great lover of 30s and 40s films, and if you hold this up against, say, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Gone with the Wind, or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it just doesn't have that X factor. I'd be the first to admit it's a landmark film, but too many critics still hold a candle up to this film as the ultimate movie experience, but I'm sorry... it's not !"

The use of graphic weight was well executed, from how much of the screen a character took up (showing who is in power (Tallest is usually in control of whatever situation)), to the eyelines of the characters drawing your attention to exactly where you need to look.

","This film is art! The combination of photography, metaphors, dialog, acting, and art bring together a great film. The movie emphasized power a lot. Power was emphasized when he trashed the room. And also the scene of the fireplace in his big mansion. The power that he had in the city, state, and the world was emphasized in that scene. The fact that he died saying the one word that meant so much to him, but meant nothing to the people around him (or who once thought they knew him) struck a sense of empowerment. The camera-work that was done in this film was very impressive. The dark shadows on the reporter, to have the audience know that even though the reporter was one of the main characters, he wasn't as important as Mr. Kane. That went for all the characters in that film. The production really emphasized the power that each character held. It was not meant to get mixed up nor confused."

","One of the most known movies of all time, Citizen Kane by Orson Welles is just a flawless piece of movie making. The cinematography is what makes this film the classic that it is. Orson Welles is known for his unorthodox camera work. Welles manipulates the space on screen in this movie in a beautiful and hypnotizing way. Low angle shots are prevalent in the film, providing a unique spatial effect. Orson Welles used the zoom a lot in Citizen Kane. <br/><br/>The story is a flashback of Charles Foster Kane, a millionaire businessman.

""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.<br/><br/>It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.<br/><br/>10 stars for ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for it's place in ""the big picture""......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was never ""pure and simple.""

","For over 70 years now Citizen Kane has been regarded a cinematic masterpiece. So would it shock you to learn that its immediate reception was largely negative. Of course it would. But not for reasons of legitimate value, since the films content is a mirror image of the media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was incensed by the film, it was attacked with pitchforks by newspapers all owned by Hearst. Thankfully years later the film is appreciated for what it is. The finest work of an avant garde filmmaking genius in Welles.<br/><br/>Lets start with the element of mise en scene (the techniques employed to combine visual elements e.g lighting, camera movement, setting and camera techniques such as montage to parallel the on screen narrative). Firstly to create the complex and materialistic Kane, Welles puts in a first class performance a seasoned actor would be proud of. Since this was Welles' first feature film, its even more astonishing that his input stemmed top to bottom and worked to such perfection. With all this in mind it's understandable a young up and coming filmmaker would want to be expressive in his work, but its unbelievable that all works to such accord. But as stated, its the cinematic techniques and the little things we ordinarily don't place emphasis or attention to that impress.The use of extreme camera angles is noteworthy in symbolising the sway of power in exchanges; Kane is occasionally framed from extreme angles- low visually making him overpowering and mirroring the on screen events. Aside from this the use of shadow and chiaroscuro lighting parallel the on screen narration, e.g the enigmatic Kane is often filmed in shadow symbolic of the private and emotionally detached Kanes dark persona and the enigma behind 'rosebud'.<br/><br/>Setting is another important tool in conveying a story and Citizen Kane not only showcases the perfect settings but its inventive camera-work perfectly complements the environments to maximise their effectiveness. A good example of this is in showing Kane standing at a window when his adoptive father speaks with him. The window appears overpowering next to the minute Kane in the distance, but with just a few steps forward Kane appears overpowering to the camera framing as he speaks of his own vision for building an empire. All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate.<br/><br/>A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly.<br/><br/>If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation.<br/><br/>Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth. I highly recommend giving this film a go, and cannot think of any reason to dislike the film. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, nobody can deny its creative flair, such was the innovation that it spawned a whole new genre in film noir."

I remember seeing a clip in class from citizen Kane when he's in the room and he tears everything down. I laugh about that part because what if they had to do a retake? Anyway, the news reporter was so fascinated in getting to understand Kane meaning of rosebud; his last words, which I just don't get at all. Throughout the movie the lighting was always on point to.

"sashank_kini-1","10","1","3","21 April 2012"," Charles Foster Kane was not entirely good or bad. This mystery surrounding him makes Citizen Kane a masterpiece.
","Having completed the core story mode of Team Bondi's LA Noire a night before watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, I realized the non-linear viewpoint narrative was common in both the game and the movie. There were crucial decisions to be made in LA Noire that could wrongfully prosecute an innocent or acquit a criminal, and the information we had about them was majorly through third party sources. In Citizen Kane, the first twenty minutes of so, with the exception of the mysterious opening shot, presents Charles Foster Kane as an wealthy, ostentatious and over-ambitious business tycoon whose life has seen major ups-and-downs and whose final years were spent predictably behind the walls of his palace like many other wealthy magnates. The media's perspective is not completely spurious, in fact Kane is wealthy, highly ambitious and grandiose, but that is not how his life should be defined or confined to. The 'Rosebud' puzzle leads to a week long investigation by a journalist Jerry Thompson in which he meets those close to Kane who are still alive.<br/><br/>Thompson accosts Kane's ex-second wife Susan who takes to drinks after the news, but is dismissed by the melancholic singer. After perusing through Kane's manuscript, all he gets is an insight of Kane's early days. The disgruntled reporter quips at the librarian whether she is Rosebud, after an unsuccessful search. After meeting Mr. Bernstein, a jolly friend of Kane's, Thompson gets to hear more of the tycoon's rise as at the Inquiry publication. On the other hand, a bitter Jedediah Leland, Kane's good friend who had parted ways with him over the years, presents Kane in a rather divisive light, highlighting the mogul's unreasonable nature. Jed is also more concerned about himself and his cigars than Kane and requests Thompson to sneak in a few. The third person to be interviewed is a now-calm Susan, who discusses about her failed marriage with Kane. The last person who discloses about Kane is the butler. What we get from all these events is not an entirely accurate description of Kane; there are inconsistencies regarding his character that may be due to the narrator's own prejudices. Take for example Kane's first marriage as told by Leland, where Kane and his wife are only seen chatting about Kane's busy schedule in the most ridiculous outfits; by satirizing the interaction instead of including dramatic encounters between husband and wife, Welles stresses the unreliability of the events. And this is precisely what makes Citizen Kane such a captivating watch.<br/><br/>The elusiveness of the story is elevated by the thrilling and brilliant cinematography that plays beautifully with dark and light. The opening Rosebud sequence is memorable because of the use of montage at various levels that give the scene a touch of disquietude and confusion. The five minutes boost the rest of the movie in a way rarely seen in film. Generally, a majority of the films believe in a placid opening that establishes all the characters before injecting some suspense. The extensive display of dissolve, montage and deep focus work magically, taking us through the many years of Kane's life. I haven't done film studies yet, but I can tell you that there is some intelligent camera work here, such as when Kane and Bernstein are discussing about the distinguished employees in their rival newspaper Chronicle and the camera closes in on the photo and dissolves to the nest frame where we see the same men working for Kane! Or the famous scene where a young Kane is playing with his little sledge in the snow outside while his parents are negotiating with Mr. Thatcher. Or the frequent shifting where Kane is reveling with the ladies towards the back while Leland expresses doubt to Bernstein in the front.<br/><br/>Orson Welles plays a proud, charismatic and larger-than-life Kane in his youth and a megalomaniacal distressed Kane in his final years. Apart from acting the lead role, he has co-written, directed and produced the film; there is nothing to complain here, he excels in all the departments, and I can forgive the stiffness that robotizes his body movements when he plays the older Kane. The supporting cast is fine, Joseph Cotten, Ruth Warrick, Moorehead in particular while Dorothy Comingore was inconsistent.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a film that treats us, invites us and invades us till we are keen to watch it another time, not to find more about rosebud, but to get a deeper understanding of Charles Foster Kane. We may never be able to fully appraise his life, but we keep hoping that we join all the jigsaw pieces one day and find out who Charles really was and what made him that man he became. This deliberate shroud that keeps us piqued all the time about the person is what was missing in 2011s Iron Lady, a recent movie about an important albeit non-fictional political figure Margaret Thatcher's life. Phyllida Lloyd never used the camera to give Thatcher this ambiguity that her character required and never gave importance to any other character in the film, and Abi Morgan, the scriptwriter could not give anything except one-liners and aphorisms. A 1941 film showed continuity and sequence better than a 2011 film, and that's something remarkable.<br/><br/>My Rating: 9.7 out of 10"
"StevePulaski","10","1","3","31 March 2012"," Some will immediately say; ""No action? Worst movie ever!""
","This might be perplexing to some, but I wouldn't want a film I made to be dubbed ""the greatest movie of all time."" I wouldn't want it to be dubbed ""despicable"" or even ""loathsome,"" but I wouldn't want it to be labeled as the greatest motion picture ever made. With title comes untold expectations, and the problem with a title of this magnitude is it provides people the ability to make assumptions and expectations that a film simply can not live up to. I'm sure some have written off Orson Welles' Citizen Kane as ""boring,"" ""overrated,"" and ""stupid,"" when really, if looked at from a technical standpoint and many other common film field, it truly is a masterpiece on film.<br/><br/>Again, the question people will inevitably ask me I will not answer. The question will be ""is it really the greatest film of all time?"" That question simply can not be answered. It's an objective question, and you'll never get an answer that isn't subjective. Poll everyone you know, it will still be subjective. I don't care if a million people label something ""the best,"" because it still doesn't represent fact. It makes it widespread opinion. Citizen Kane, I don't believe, is the greatest film I've ever seen (not that I could say what is), but it is one of the most intriguing and important films I have yet to see.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Charles Foster Kane (Welles), who is based off of the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst. The film opens with Kane laying in his bed, gripping a snow globe, as he utters the simple word ""Rosebud,"" and then the globe smashes seconds after he dies. Because of Kane's popularity, his death sparks mass attention, and reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland) is determined to decipher what his last word truly meant. The film winds up evolving into a nonlinear narrative, flashing back to when Kane was a boy, when he was growing up, and when he rose to fame.<br/><br/>I can't see Kane being labeled ""the greatest film of all time"" for its plot. For a film of that title, you'd expect a twisty plot that goes in every conceivable direction, leaving you breathless and somewhat confused. Not Citizen Kane. The story is pretty simple and the progression rather speedy. But there I go again with that ""impossible expectation"" business.<br/><br/>Where Kane really gets interesting is from a technical and intellectual standpoint. The film is the prime example of film noir, and the one cinephiles usually reference first. The use of light and shadow is very prominent in the film, and keep in mind, this was never done before. Some tracking shots are marvelous as they are complex and smooth. Everything seemed to be specifically planned out ahead of time, which is why the film doesn't feel rushed. Dialog was clearly perfected, shots were definitely practiced, and technique and stylistic intentions bleed through the storytelling. This makes Kane inevitably interesting and without a shadow of a doubt different. For the time at least.<br/><br/>It is in this regard where people become massively disappointed. We have seen these same sort of tracking shots before, as well as having our perspective tricked, and light be the main focus in a film. It's nothing new. But for the time period this was revolutionary and riveting. It still is, personally. It is wholly consuming, incredibly enjoyable, and just all around fascinatingly complex.<br/><br/>To add to the history lesson I'm reciting, the backstory on how this film came to be should award it some respect and recognition as well. Welles was big on the radio, airing the highly controversial War of the Worlds in 1933, and having major success in the field of theater. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939, where the studio gave him full control on a picture of his choice. He could write the script, choose the actors, and had privileges to edit the film to his own personal liking. This was such a rarity in a world dominated by studios. Newcomers were hardly given any room to maneuver, and when Welles had all of these privileges practically handed to him just because of minor past experiences, it really got people talking and what he delivered was beyond anyone's expectations. The film infuriated William Randolph Hearst so much that he threatened to have the film blacklisted and banned, which could partially be why the film received no Oscars other than Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is a wonderful film that must be experienced. The history is one you can't ignore, the acting is superb, the storytelling, if a bit simple, is nonetheless engaging, the dialog is crisp, the music is lively and intelligent, and the filming and editing is nothing shy of entrancing and, literally, revolutionary. The moral also rings truer today than it probably did in 1941. Instead of feeling like you should enjoy it out of obligation, feel you should see it because of obligation.<br/><br/>Starring: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, George Coulouris, Agnes Moorehead, Paul Stewart, Ruth Warrick, Erskine Sanford, and William Alland. Directed by: Orson Welles."
"nickmesafilms","10","1","3","5 December 2011"," Citizen Kane (1941) - Rosebud? What the Hell is a Rosebud? Is it a...Wait a Minute!
","""Citizen Kane"" is one of the most excellent masterpieces ever seen on cinema. It was produced, written, directed by, and starring Orson Welles, when he was just 26 years old. This movie is one of the first movies ever to accomplish such unique technical advantages, and it redefined the legacy of cinema. The movie begins as Orson Welles, playing Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon, who is introduced in the opening scene, on his deathbed, saying his final word, ""Rosebud"", before dropping a snow-globe to the floor. Then, it follows to the perspective of a reporter who is investigating the meaning of ""Rosebud"", and it leads to a series of flashbacks that shows glimpses of Kane's life. Okay, let's just say, I enjoy black-and-white movies a little bit, but the thought of seeing this was just plain enjoying. The story was found fascinating and interesting, but it's not really spectacular and remarkable. But it's Orson Welles that helped lead the way to show cinema the true meaning of filmmaking. I also enjoyed all the innovating camera techniques used to make the movie more unique, which includes so many uses of deep focus, long shots, soundtrack, film editing, transitions, shadows, and lighting. These techniques were too impossible to accomplish in the past, but it was Welles that made the impossible into possible. From an interesting script to a fine cast, it just proves that ""Citizen Kane"", after many years, is still a movie that impresses audiences everywhere, with a movie that beat the odds of cinema, and it's an incredible recommendation for true movie lovers. ""Citizen Kane"", in my review, ""a brilliant masterpiece, masterfully accomplished""."
"EyeDunno","10","1","3","1 August 2011"," An Influential Film for an Essential Movie Collection
","A great classic influences those following classics that result from ground-breaking collaboration of writing, acting, direction, and production. Anyone who studies cinema history understands that Citizen Kane should always be mentioned as an essential, influential work. You'll never, ever see it remade. No one would dare try to make it better, because they can't. Some call it dated, yet it was made in 1941. Even today, it will knock the pants off most films that are hammered out by the studios and independent companies, alike. <br/><br/>Citizen Kane is as influential and controversial today as it was even before its release. There was uproar when the owner of Hearst newspapers attempted to sabotage the production of Citizen Kane after discovering that Kane, the main character, was based on Hearst. Today, there is debate on whether the film should be considered a classic. A number of people call Citizen Kane ""overrated."" If you agree, that's fine, because I'm not about to dissuade you. But there are also people who don't like more current classics like ""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" They claim that these films (and a number of others on the IMDb Top 250) ""put you to sleep."" Or, they beg to ask, ""What's the point?"" The point is that so many more people feel it's classic, rather than crap.<br/><br/>The pacing of Citizen Kane is quite deliberate, in order to peel back the many clues needed to answer the mystery of the last words made by Charles Foster Kane, a recluse newspaper magnate in the mansion that sits among darkness and decay, similar to his very legacy. An investigative reporter is given the task to discover the meaning of ""Rosebud,"" exhaled in a whisper of Kane's final breath. I enjoyed how the mystery of Rosebud unfolded, especially with regard to the film's surprising climax. All of those characters left behind to (oft-times, begrudgingly) give their accounts of how Kane influenced their lives, as Kane's quest for fairness succumbed to his thirst for power. The style of storytelling was ground-breaking in its time, as Kane's persona emerged through the performance of Orson Welles and the Mercury Players, who helped put together a fitting, brilliant, and outstanding ending. Make sure to spot Nat King Cole's film debut, playing the piano at the night club."
"matiask-966-773928","10","1","3","2 February 2011"," The All Time Top Film
","Orson Welles first feature film -- which he directed, produced, and co-wrote, as well as playing the title role -- proved to be his most important and influential work, a ground- breaking drama loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst which is frequently cited as the finest American film ever made. Aging newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies in his sprawling Florida estate after uttering a single, enigmatic final word -- ""Rosebud"" -- and newsreel producer Rawlston (Phil Van Zandt) sends reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) out with the assignment of uncovering the meaning behind the great man's dying thought. As Thompson interviews Kane's friends, family, and associates, we learn the facts of Kane's eventful and ultimately tragic life: his abandonment by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a silver mine; his angry conflicts with his guardian, master financier Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impulsive decision that ""it would be fun to run a newspaper"" with the help of school chum Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane); his rise from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; Kane's ambitious bid for public office, which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's vain attempts to promote second wife Alexander as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive and never-completed pleasure palace called Xanadu. While Citizen Kane was a film full of distinguished debuts -- along with Welles, it was the first feature for Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane, Ray Collins, Agnes Moorehead, and Ruth Warrick -- the only Academy Award it received was for Best Original Screenplay, for which Welles shared credit with veteran screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz. Widely considered the greatest American movie ever made, Orson Welles's film debut reinvented Hollywood conventions of story-telling and visual structure, suggesting the essential mystery of a person's inner self and inspiring countless filmmakers with its technical accomplishments. Already famous for his work in radio and theater, 24-year-old Welles was given complete creative freedom when RKO Pictures signed him in 1939. Co-authored with Herman J. Mankiewicz, the Kane screenplay dispensed with linear biographical narrative in favor of flashbacks recounting Kane's life from several points of view, ostensibly to solve the puzzle of Kane's deathbed utterance. Collaborating with cinematographer Gregg Toland, Welles used specially constructed sets to compose the film through a number of long takes in deep focus and high-contrast black-and-white, creating meaning through the juxtaposition of multiple actions and characters in a single take rather than through numerous edits. While the imagery and the carefully choreographed soundtrack provide clues to Kane's nature as he ages from innocent boy to corrupt magnate, he ultimately remains an enigmatic figment of memory. Kane's real-life model, however, was no mystery; newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst tried to suppress what he considered an unflattering portrait of himself. While RKO rejected an offer to reimburse their costs in exchange for burning the negatives, Citizen Kane's release was hindered by Hearst's campaign against it. Though non-Hearst papers recognized it as a vanguard work, and it was nominated for nine Oscars (four for Welles himself), Kane was not a popular hit. Despite the film's artistic approbation and subsequent wide-ranging influence, from 1940s film noir to the French New Wave to American film school grads, Welles never again had creative control in Hollywood."

The camera angles are beautifully shot, the story is interesting, the acting is great, and the ending is genius. It did change filmmaking in many ways with the creativity it has. All I'm saying it just doesn't do that as much as many other movies that made it to ""AFI's 100 Greatest Movies"". What about ""Gone With the Wind"", and its game changing use of color filmmaking? What about the brilliant portrayal of crime life that ""The Godfather"" gave us? What about the amazing cinematography in ""Lawrence of Arabia""?

","It's funny reading the reviews by the mental midgets who just don't have the brains to understand this movie. I look at some of them and am baffled as to their concept of a good movie.

One guy gave it 1 star but he gave Ocean's Thirteen 10 stars, making it the best movie ever made in his eyes so you can see the mentality we are dealing with.<br/><br/>That said, the film is incredible. I could go on for an hour about the camera work, the acting, the angles, lighting and dialog but that has been done ad nauseum. Simply put, this movie achieves a level of quality and depth that few films have ever come close to. Welles is at the height of his genius and his acting is amazing. Today's crowds will find this very boring because they need an explosion every ten seconds to keep their attention, everyone else, enjoy the film forever."
"johnmschofield","7","1","3","9 August 2009"," This film just doesn't do it for me
","This film has had nearly seventy years of hype following when it was made and I suspect that the majority of it probably extols how good it is. Like most people I watch the film and make my own mind up. This film just doesn't do it for me. It has a running time of two hours and quite frankly I was relieved when it was finished. I am not a shallow person and by nature I try to look for the good in everybody I meet and that approach extends to works of art in whatever form they take. I have watched this film on more than one occasion and I would accept that the film tells a story well and it is also clear to me that a lot of care and attention went into its making. But when it comes to the bottom line I just didn't see the whole as being anything other than another fairly good film. Nothing particularly special about it but perhaps I am missing the point here maybe because I am just not bright enough to spot why it has so many admirers. I would suggest anybody see the film and no doubt you will come up with your own unique opinion which is what the above narrative is."

If you see one driving down the road, it is certainly worth a look. But if you honestly ask yourself where it ranks on cars you'd like to have, it is pretty far down the list.<br/><br/>Film buffs want their art to have timeless capacity to it. It would be comforting to folks in Hollywood to know that Citizen Kane is being appreciated and enjoyed 400 years from now along the lines that the Mona Lisa is appreciated and enjoyed.

","Well, what to say? 22 year old Orson Welles came into Hollywood in the late 30s on a hiding to nothing. He had already had a big influence on live theatre, and made headlines all over the US with his controversial ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast. He was given a three picture deal by RKO with final cut on all of them. Unprecedented at the time. Surely he couldn't live up to the hype? What Welles produced was a cinematic triumph without equal at the time, that 67 years on still defies description.<br/><br/>There is hardly an honest film maker in Hollywood that won't own up to being influenced, to at least some extent by this movie. Everything about this movie, from the premise, to the script, the score, the cinematography and the acting is exceptional.<br/><br/>Orson Welles not only does a superb job as director, he also puts in one of the greatest tour de force performances in the history of American cinema as Kane. Growing from an ambitious happy go lucky 20 something to a tyrannical monster, to a bitter, pathetic old shell of a man in less than two hours. Welles inspires rage, hatred and pity out of what could have been a one note character in less skilled hands.<br/><br/>The story is simple. A past his prime media tycoon dies muttering the word ""Rosebud"" and a journalist, looking for the real scoop on Kane's life, sets out to find exactly what Rosebud is. We hear the heartbreaking story of a young boy sold to the bank by his parents, raised to be a business man, finding success as a media owner and then being destroyed by his inability to love others. The journalist never finds out what Rosebud is, but we do, Kane's sleigh he used to ride when he was a child. It's been argued that the sleigh means nothing, it's been argued that the sleigh means everything. In the end it can mean just about anything you want it to.<br/><br/>Also of note here is the performance of Joseph Cotton, who puts in one of the great performances as Jedediah Lelan, who unwittingly becomes the conscience of the story, simply by being himself.<br/><br/>The story behind the film's release, brilliantly depicted in the late 90s TV film RKO 281 and the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" are almost as interesting as the film itself, and that really is saying something.<br/><br/>""It's Terrific"" the original 1941 promo posters for Kane rather naively stated. But looking back now, sums it up rather nicely."

","When the first list by AFI came out in 1998 i read it and saw what the top ten was. at that time when i was 14 years old i had only heard of two films on the top ten. I saw the title of citizen kane at number one. i eagerly searched for this film as well as the rest of the top ten. After seeing all of them i found citizen kane the hardest to watch and enjoy. My first viewing of citizen kane was uneventful mainly because i fell asleep through it. I had heard all the hype of this film. read all the top ten lists with this film being #1 on most of them. I have heard a lot of directors talk about the influence and the power of this film. I tried it again and laughably i passed out again. I didn't understand why this film made me so bored. Again i watched it with a group of friends and finished it finally. I admit i didn't like it and even hated it at one point but i still brought myself to watch it more and more to seek out all the technical spots that were said to be so revolutionary at the time. I would say impressive for the time but i still had a problem with the acting and the story that was Said to be controversial because of the similarities with William Randolf Hearsts life. I do wonder if this movie is ranked so high more for it being controversial and the technical aspects more than the film as a whole. I don't really judge a film by its impact but more by the film as a whole, the story, acting, music. After ten years i have grown an appreciation for this film but it is not #1 for me. #5 at best cause The Godfather to me is What movies are all about."

","As a teenager, I saw a copy of this movie in a video store and seeing as the jacket sleeve had some high praise for this movie, I watched it. It's hard to say how my perceptions of this movie may have been influenced by the blurb on the VHS cover.<br/><br/>The start of this old black and white movie is quite disorientating-a newsreel tells of the death of a powerful media tycoon in the US. You wonder if you have gotten the right movie, or the movie is something different to what you thought it would be.<br/><br/>Soon, you get a more conventional narrative movie-the story of the tycoon in question...the Kane of the title. One of the hooks of the movie is the whole ""what does 'Rosebud' mean?"" aspect of the story. It was Kane's last words before he died, and it nags away at you until it is resolved towards the end of the movie (pay attention to the movie for the resolution of this aspect of the myster!). Many years later I found out that the word ""rosebud"" has a whole OTHER connotation, to do with a REAL media tycoon whom this movie was loosely based on (there is a documentary concerning this real tycoon's attempts to shut down the making/screening of this movie).<br/><br/>If you've done Media Studies, you might have had to watch this movie and there you learn about all the technical achievements of this movie. That's all fine, but this movie has a narrative and performance charm all of its own.<br/><br/>A scene from this movie is one of my all time favourites from any movie-it's the scene where a hugely charismatic Kane (as played by the youngish Orson Welles) outlines how long his business can stay afloat for despite incurring losses. This is a brash, lovable, charismatic American character. Great scene-alongside say, one scene with Robert de Niro in the otherwise mediocre Mean Streets, or that of Noah Taylor in ""He died with a felafel in his hand"". All these have a great scene where their character reveals themselves, emotionally speaking.<br/><br/>Many other scenes from this movie will leave an impression with you.<br/><br/>A movie about power and love."

I've found that to be true in a lot of the older movies (Birds, N by NW). The main characters aren't realistic; they're more like caricatures, not like any persons I've ever known.

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","9 March 2008"," A cult film that has become a myth
","The natural question ,we have to wonder about when watching this film, in its new splendor after restoration, is whether Orson Welles did not try to make a movie about himself. He sure did. I would even say it is a posthumous autobiography in prospective expectation. It is an American film about America and the Americans. The grandiose grandeur of those who are dreaming America into being and the petty narrow-mindedness of those who are only defending their own interests. Which tribe is most important? No one can know. The dreamers get isolated and lonely, at times in the golden heart of wealth and money. The self-centered ones just cut the cake and are very careful to give a very thin slice to others and an enormous slice to themselves. Then they all die sooner or later and only the dreamers survive. The others disappear in the darkness of hell, the underworld of forgotten anti-history. But this film reveals, and at the time it was probably scandalous, the power of the press as for building public opinion and the absurdity of the Americans as for forbidding politicians to have a normal private life, I mean the right to have a private life of their own and only their own. The tragic dimension of this character is that he is trapped by the very first, the power of the press he had used tremendously and had even boosted up in incredible proportions, with his very private life. Then the rest is only vanity and vain pretence: he tried to prove what he did not have to prove and he used other people to do so, particularly his second wife, which led to the end of the dream that had turned into a nightmare with a brain stroke and death. One can only prove what is really real and not what is virtually eventually maybe possible. Then of course we have to admire the technique of this film and the marvelous black and white finish and gloss. We also have to point out the film is renewing the genre of the biography of a great man by creating some mystery around one word, ""rosebud"", which probably has no value at all and is there to make us look at the pictures and images with a more attentive eye, as if we were supposed to be private eyed sleuths. Some say this film is a masterpiece and they must be nearly right. They would be totally right if they said it is one of the few masterpieces of the war years, the years that needed some boosting of the Americans and America. Orson Welles did it with a big tongue in his vast cheek, but probably had more positive effect than all the propaganda films that were filmed by second grade ""directors"", if they can be at times called directors at all.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","A fictional biography of media magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) - a thinly veiled William Randolph Hearst that brought Welles and RKO all kinds of problems - that recreates a life in flashback, Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" was a startling cinematic debut by any standards, and from a 25-year-old made it nothing short of remarkable.<br/><br/>Beginning with Kane's lonely death at his crumbling and ornate Xanadu mansion, the film details the destruction of Kane's childhood when his mother unwittingly inherits a legacy and his resulting adolescent realisation that part of the legacy includes a newspaper, which Kane decides to run personally. From there, Kane builds a media empire, dabbles in politics and women, and eventually starts to alienate all those around him.<br/><br/>A potent metaphor for the betrayal of principles, the souring of the American Dream, and an intelligent mediation on the corrupting nature of power, the film's reputation is nothing short of gargantuan. Regularly cited as the greatest movie ever made, there's no doubting its pure brilliance and status as a contender for so lofty a claim.<br/><br/>What is beyond doubt is that Welles and his collaborative troupe of Herman J Mankiewicz (screenplay), Gregg Toland (photography), Robert Wise (editor), and the fantastic cast of leading players managed to invent a whole new cinematic vocabulary. The attention to detail (ceilinged sets, the meticulous creation of Xanadu) and technical brilliance (deep focus photography and hitherto unchartered camera angles) combined to influence the future of cinema. ""Citizen Kane"" is the margin by which all of Welles' later efforts came to be judged and also, in many ways, the benchmark of film production."

Thompson interviews Kane's past friends and family to find out his past life and what Rosebud meant. He discovers what happened in Kane's life, when he was forced to live with a banker for the rest of his life, when he runs his own newspaper, when he marries the President's niece, when he divorces here, when he runs for governor, but fails with a scandal, when he marries his second wife and forces her to be an opera singer, and when his attitude drove the people he loved out of his life. In the end when people burn Kane's possessions one of them is a sled. That sled is called Rosebud.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely one of the best movies of all time. It had great acting, a great story, groundbreaking cinematography, a unique way of directing, a great twist, and pretty much everything. Nothing about this film is bad. I am mind-boggled that this film did not win Best Picture at the Academy Awards back in the 1942 Academy Awards.

","When my husband and I decided to rent this movie we knew that it was a classic, but had no idea what it was about. The fact that I was able to get both a History and Communication degree and never be forced to see this movie in college is ridiculous. It was not only a great movie that would have fit in well with my Film, Culture, and Politics class, but it was extremely interesting and did an excellent job portraying Hearst's life. I would recommend that every college student watch this movie to learn about yellow journalism, sensationalism, responsibilities of journalism, and overall California History. The DVD also has about 2 hours of information on Hearst and the film itself. It was an educational film that never lost our interest. This film definitely deserves its classic status. I would put it up there with Casablanca on the movie front."
"theshadow908","10","1","3","4 October 2006"," The perfect film.
","Citizen Kane is the film that is widely considered to be the best film ever made. It tells the story of Charles Kane, a young man with barely any idea how to run a business, who decides that he wants to run a newspaper. We follow through his life from his childhood all the way up to his death, where he mutters one word: ""Rosebud"". The subplot of the film is a reporter who is interviewing everybody that ever knew or worked with Kane, in hopes of finding out what Kane's famous last word means. While I personally wouldn't call this the greatest movie ever made, it is indeed the perfect film. Anybody who wants to study fine acting and fine directing, need only watch Orson Welles at his absolute best.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is the study of an eccentric's life. He starts out as a young and cocky newspaper editor who eventually becomes an old and wise politician eccentric, building an insanely large mansion on a huge chunk of land just for his wife. The story of the film is very good, and the way it's put together makes the movie very interesting. It bounces back and forth between present day and flashbacks, weaving the story in and out as the reporter begins to get frustrated. Everyone spills their guts about Kane, but not one person can account for ""rosebud"". It seems no one will ever know, except the viewing audience when the classic twist ending is shown. Orson Welles' direction is very good, and you can tell that some present day director's have taken some tips. One of the best techniques is using ground shots to make Kane look larger than life.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is very good, especially from Orson Welles. His awesome voice coupled with his amazing on screen dynamic makes him really fun to watch. Most of the Citizen Kane stars come from the Mercury Theatre radio program that Welles was a part of, and they all do very well in their first time on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazing film, and though it's not my favourite personally, it is quite possibly the perfect film.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Jonny_Numb","7","1","3","18 April 2006"," The deterioration of idealism
","It is impossible to sit down and watch a movie--especially when that movie is ""Citizen Kane""--and not be lulled by the windstorm of praises surrounding it. The trick is to not let that influence your individual critical assessment (which is nearly impossible in ""Kane""'s case). Orson Welles' tale of Charles Foster Kane, who inherits a fortune as a young man, presides over a successful newspaper, uses his political clout to run for office, romances two women, and dies alone with a literal castle filled with priceless art, is a story that still has relevance today. <br/><br/>Welles' character study is fascinating in the way it captures the idealism of youth, and how that erodes into complacency and--in Kane's case--disenchantment; one of the characters makes a keen observation of the millionaire at middle age, making the claim that he can only accept love on his own terms, that he thought he could 'give' the public truth and freedom. Being a 25-year old male who was not too long ago a gung-ho liberal, ""Citizen Kane""'s presentation of this unacknowledged self-interest that snowballs into bitterness is striking. The stigma that follows Kane is his own inability to be satisfied by anyone or anything.<br/><br/>The pseudo-documentary style in which the film is presented seems very cutting-edge for its time, and translates well to our modern age of tabloid journalism. But what's more ingenious is the framing device: a reporter is interviewing Kane's coworkers and lovers in the wake of his death, investigating his dying words (""Rosebud""). Who or what Rosebud turns out to be is something that has been satirized on episodes of ""The Real Ghostbusters"" and ""Tiny Toon Adventures,"" among other places, but I will keep my lips sealed for those who are unaware. In another film, it might have produced unintentional laughs, but in ""Citizen Kane,"" the revelation it portends is shattering.<br/><br/>I really didn't have high expectations for ""Citizen Kane,"" in spite of the reputation it has earned through the years. I often think that younger generations (myself included) are going to become increasingly detached from the perceived 'classics' of cinema as time progresses (in a way similar to how the elder critics are detached from current cinema). I was skeptical at ""Kane""'s overly typical beginning, but became increasingly intrigued as it progressed, to the point where I was genuinely affected by this tragic character's decline. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it still remains a finely-crafted piece of work."
"ratherbblue","Null","1","3","17 April 2006"," Visual Elements in Citizen Kane
","Visual Elements in Citizen Kane<br/><br/>When a viewer watches a movie, the primary reason in most cases is probably for the overall entertainment experience of the film as a whole. Casual viewing does not always include a critical breakdown in one's head of all the various aspects that go into producing the finished product. Some might argue that if one notices too many of the ""parts"" that the overall value of the ""whole"" has lost some appeal. Nevertheless, filmmakers take great care in putting together their masterpieces; often micro managing down the finest detail that is hardly noticed. <br/><br/>Casting, plot and script are obvious elements that almost any viewer will have a good recollection of after having seen a movie. One can relate the story, repeat the memorable lines of dialogue and tell who starred in the film. But what about the sound, the lighting, shot selection, camera angles and editing? How much of that is remembered or lost? These are important parts of the director's work. There is hardly a detail that has no meaning, right down to the set dressing. Everything means something. One may not be able to discern the meaning of every minute detail the director feels is important. However, the observer can still perceive the visual clues that set the mood and tone of scenes and story lines even if they cannot interpret the filmmaker's deepest thoughts.<br/><br/>One film which uses some of these ""less obvious"" components as a key ingredient in the overall story is Citizen Kane (1941), a landmark cinematic achievement starring, and directed by Orson Welles. Specifically, the use of lighting to create shadows, and camera angles to convey the status of the characters are key elements which have an affect on viewers, whether consciously or subconsciously.<br/><br/>In Citizen Kane, shadows contribute to the feeling of mystery that hangs over the story from start to finish. In the newsreel scene, when the lights come up there are shadows all around the smoke-filled room. Voices seem to be coming right out of the dark at times as they discuss what Charles Foster Kane's life meant and what the last word he uttered, ""rosebud,"" may have meant. In the final scene, the main investigator admits that he ""didn't find out much"" and that still does not know what ""rosebud"" meant. His face is in shadow, as are all of the people to whom he is speaking. They are in the dark literally and figuratively because the mystery of Kane's final word is no closer to being solved. <br/><br/>Lighting and shadows are also used in other ways in this film. For instance one way is to differentiate the status of characters in particular scenes. An example of this is seen in the exchange between Kane and his wife Susan in a Chicago hotel room. After reading the bad notices from her operatic debut, fully lit, she screams to him that she is quitting singing. Kane approaches her, casts a shadow which totally engulfs her, and insists that she will continue her career. The lighting effect reinforces who has the upper hand in the scene. Shadows are also used to foreshadow future events. One instance in Citizen Kane stands out among many. When Kane reads his ""declaration of principles,"" which he has just written, detailing his promises to present the news honestly, accurately and fairly  he is totally in shadow, while men on either side of him are completely lit. This indicates that Kane will ultimately, not keep his lofty promises the people.<br/><br/>Camera angles also have a lot to do with how characters are perceived. During the political rally speech scene there is a low angle shot of Kane at the lectern, with a huge poster of himself as a backdrop. The shot begins at the back of the hall and gradually zooms in. As the shot gets tighter and tighter on Kane, he appears higher and higher in the frame, giving the sense of his rising power to the viewer. The shot angle also tells one which characters are more powerful compared to each other. In the previously mentioned scene where Kane's wife tries to quit singing, the camera angle on her is high making appear small and powerless. Kane is seen from a low angle which emphasizes his control over Susan at the time. <br/><br/>Lighting, the use of shadows, and camera shot selection are vital parts in the total picture of Citizen Kane. Imagine seeing this film lit up like the average sitcom on television today. It would not even resemble the classic movie that Welles envisioned and produced. Many elements of the story would be changed, or lost altogether. This movie was far ahead of its time, and by many accounts continues to be the standard by which all films are measured against."

","I agree that this movie was quite good when it was made because it changed the way movies were made. It is however, not a Shakespearian classic that can withstand the ravages of time. It is only even viewed anymore because it had great camera work (for it's time). Let's face it - the plot of this movie is so feeble and paper thin that I can't believe that there are still people defending it as a real work of art. I mean really - A rich guy who longs for his simple childhood on his deathbed - even the people who voted for his film don't watch it again. There are plenty of movies with far better plots than this. The only reason this movie would even be on this list is because it is well aged."
"johno-21","10","1","3","15 March 2006"," All great films are overrated. That's what makes them so great.
","This is a great film and was recognized for that immediately. The National Board of Review named it Best Picture for 1941, the New York Film Critics Circle named it Best Picture for 1941 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated it for nine Acadeny Awards for 1941 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Art Direction and Best Music Score. It won it's only Oscar for Best Screenplay for Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz. 26 year old Orson Welles in his feature film debut produces, writes, directs and stars in Citizen Kane, a story of a young boy whose family gives him up to be the son of a wealthy man who will guarantee a privileged life and education for the boy. He grows up to lead a newspaper empire and become the world's most wealthiest man and political pawnbroker. Welles had captivated the nation with his radio play adaptation of another Welles in H.G. Welles War of the worlds in 1938. He took his Mercury Theater Players and made the leap from radio to film and produced an epic film his first time out. He was fortunate to get some smart help to bring his vision to reality. First, with veteran screen writer Mankiewicz helped to write a story for film instead of radio. Second, with veteran Cinematographer Gregg Toland who had photographed such films as Queen Kelly, The Westerner, Kidnapped, Wuthering Heights, Intermeazzo and the Grapes of Wrath among his many films and after Kane would go on to do The Outlaw, The Best Years of Our Lives and The Bishops Wife before he died of a heart attack at the age of 44. Toland had worked with Directors Erich Von Stroheim, Mervyn Le Roy, Howard Hawks, King Vidor John Ford, and William Wyler and brought the skill to put Welles' imagination on the screen. Third, Orson Welles found a young film editor who had edited The Hunchback of Notre Dame and My Favorite Wife named Robert Wise who would go on to be an accomplished director himself with such films as The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The sound of Music, The Haunting, The sand Pebbles and The Andromeda Strain. Fourth, Welles was entrusted with and got the best out of RKO veterans Art Director Van Nest Polglase, Set Director Darrell Silvera and costume designer Edward Stevenson to work on what would be the most important film of their careers. Fifth, Welles was fortunate to have a young composer named Bernarad Herrmann score his film. Herrmann would go on to be a favorite of Alfred Hitchcock scoring his films Pycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo and would score films and television for directors all the way to Taxi Driver. Next, Orson Welles had fortune with RKO Sound Supervisor John Aalberg overseeing the sound for Citizen Kane and finally Welles was surrounded by a great cast in Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick and Everette Sloane among others. Vision, ambition, inspiration, skill, talent and a little luck came together for Welles who was teamed with a lot of talent that collectively wanted it to come together. It results in a 10 out of 10."

","Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.<br/><br/>I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, ""Well that was the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen."" This just reaffirmed that it was a great film. <br/><br/>I'm sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. That's their prerogative. I've often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled."

","""Rosebud..."" A single word that will echo throughout the history of the motion picture and beyond. No film deserves more credit to the craft of film-making than Kane. Its ideas and groundbreaking achievements were so revolutionary that much of its majesty wasn't fully realized for over a generation. <br/><br/>Time manipulation rip roars back and forth, up and down, diagonally and horizontally, like a thousand puzzle pieces scattered over the floor, until by the end of the film everything fits together to create a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Kane is a picture of insane genius. It was not potentially realized for its time and is eerily modern for today. This is a film that not only stands the test of time but grows with it.<br/><br/>Amateur to novice movie goers will not be able to fully appreciate the innovative film language it created. Many disregard it because they believe that a film from over a half century ago could not possibly relate to them or be entertaining or (just because the 'snobby' film scholars view it as one of the greatest) they don't want to like it to go against their view of the critical consensus of being out of touch with the general public. If someone told me to see this film because it was the greatest I would be inadvertently critical of it myself. <br/><br/>My advise for anyone seeing this film for the first time would be to keep an open mind before viewing. You have probably heard from various publications, scholars etc. that this is one of the greatest if not the greatest film of all time.

"cfelico","10","1","3","22 January 2006"," This IsThe Most Important Film Ever Made, And Here's Why
","Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26. Plot: Citizen Kane still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. And in the end when everyone suspects that ""Rosebud"" is something Kane wanted and never had, or something he had lost along with everything else, the irony is there, as they give up by saying that a man's life cannot be described in one word. Even though ""Rosebud"" is the very name of the sleigh he had as a boy when he lived with his mother as a boy, and is the only thing he took with him, ""Rosebud"" was always in his mind reminding of the event as he made moves through his life that would react to this deeply wounding event. And the scene of the men burning ""Rosebud"" in the fire is breathtraking, leading you to the conclusion that the answer they were looking for to Kane's life was right there but destroyed by choice as it was for Kane. THe movie is breathtaking and may not be or be the best movie in history, it's your choice, i personally think that it is at the top, if not, the top. But I personally love Vertigo, read my review for Vertigo also, it has so many ingredients to project what we call the best picture in cinematic history, while Citizen Kane falls short to me, somewhere, although I can't place my finger on it and what it's missing. I think it's just the genre and how Vertigo's thrilling aspects interest me, but this is undoubtedly the most important film in all of history, rent, or better yet, buy the two-disc set, featuring an amazing documentary on disc two, which was nominated in 1995, for best documentary, by the Academy. And then you will understand this review completely, thank you."

A strong performance by Orson Welles, a great story, and simply put- a masterpiece, make this the greatest film ever made. No wonder it is taught in film schools throughout the world.

"EddieK","10","1","3","3 January 2006"," Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut
","Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.<br/><br/>Despite ""Kane's"" continued status as ""greatest film ever,"" I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who haven't seen it, or worse yet, who watched it only once and thought it was just OK. Believe me: seeing it once is simply not enough! This is true of any great film, but more so for ""Kane,"" which contains countless layers, subtexts, and details that are simply impossible to absorb the first time. In many ways, ""Kane"" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it.<br/><br/>The greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though I believe that 1958's ""Touch of Evil"" is even better among Welles' own films. But ""Kane"" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. ""Citizen Kane"" has topped the ""Sight and Sound"" critics' and directors' polls since 1962, and its #1 status was reinforced yet again in 1998's American Film Institute Top 100 list.

We don't care why Kane turned out to be such a miserable jerk. While the notion of ""what/who is rosebud?"" drives the film to its conclusion, the payoff is predictable and contrite, and doesn't add much sympathy to the character. This film is far inferior to Welles' own ""Touch of Evil""."

They are upset that they did not find a fast-paced but mindless excursion into programmed entertainment.  Citizen Kane is not slow, it is not melodramatic, it is not pointless, and the expiration date has not passed.  Citizen Kane is quite simply a masterpiece of FILM making.<br/><br/>Every word and every gesture of the actors, every pan and zoom by the camera, every note of score, every prop in every scene, every visual focus in a frame, the timing of every edit, or to be quite exact, EVERYTHING in this film fits, has purpose and moves you to the goal of the film: telling a story with all the subtleties true to real life through celluloid.<br/><br/>The viewer of Citizen Kane has got to be ready to watch a film, ready to note subtleties as well as blatant story line pieces, ready to think and put together all the parts of this movie to achieve an understanding of its greatness.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone serious about film, as I would recommend Georgia O'Keeffe to someone who was serious about 20th century art.  If you seriously want to understand film and seriously want to understand life and the world, you need to have an open mind and a mind ready to place itself in the context of whatever you are viewing.<br/><br/>You might scoff at this film, but if you do, you show your narrow-mindedness and your intolerance of expression.

My eyes and ears belong to the movie. Even though I know every word nearly by heart, the film just DEMANDS my attention. I can't channel flip when this black-and-white masterpiece is showing. I feel like Francois Truffaut did -- the film is something Welles was never able to replicate again; the stars were aligned in film history for possibly the only time ever (though some, like Casablanca, come damned close!)<br/><br/>I doubt one word can describe a man's life -- a thousand can't describe one man's film."

","Citizen Kane is perhaps the most original movie ever made. This movie can be credited to only one man who stared in, produced, directed, and help write the screenplay for this movie. This mans name was Orson Wells who at the time was a nobody when it came to movies was only 25 when this movie came out his now famous and highly revered film (citizen Kane).<br/><br/>This movie was unique in many regards. One of the ways in which it was unique is in the angles in which it was filmed, wells used many different new angles to show emotion. Wells also employed numerous lighting techniques in his new film. Also (even though there was access to color film) Wells used black and white film. These decisions and the originality of the screen play lead to this movie huge success. <br/><br/>The reason the screenplay was so original is the way in which it used time and flashbacks. The movie is about the investigation of one mans life to try and find out what one word means ârosebudâ. The entire movie could be summed up in that one word. Though the characters in the story never find out what ârosebudâ is by the end the viewer is left with some understanding of what it means. The name of the man that the movie is focused on is Charles foster Kane. The story of his life is a some what idealistic one, a rags to riches story, but in return for his good fortune and wealth he looses every thing he ever loved even saying him self âif I hadnât been rich I may have been a great manâ when asked he thought he was he replied âI think I did alright under the circumstancesâ. These quotes speak wonders of Kane's personality it says that he doesnât think rightly of the person he has become. Kane also seems to lead a double life in part of this movie. One of these lives is as a multimillion heir the other is as the operator of a newspaper. This double life is shown when Kane directly says â as you may have noticed I am leading a double life one as the editor of this news paper and the other as the holder of the worlds six largest private fortune in the worldâ.  He seems to be a man who has lost every thing he has ever had and everyone that is talked to points out this fact.<br/><br/>This movie gave a lot to the film industry and is credited as being the best movie of all time many people. And though the plot may be hard to follow in the end the viewer learns a valuable lesson. This reviewer would rate this movie a 10 out 10 a perfect example of what a film should be."

","The oddest thing about Citizen Kane is how it doesn't seem ""old"" like other black and white movies with old slang, polite plot lines, and guy-gets-girl endings. Even the camera angles are surprisingly new-looking. The plot is that Citizen Kane is real rich and famous with his newspaper, praised and admired by all but has conflicts in his personal life. But the plot isnt at all important to the themes of the movie. Also, Citizen Kane doesnt strike me as a ""character in a movie"" in the sense that he's either A. A stereotype B.

"MattTK3","10","1","3","13 July 2003"," Just to mention a few things that haven't been said already about this Great Film!
","*****Major Spoilers Ahead*****   Seriously, don't read this unless you've seen the film!!!!!<br/><br/>
Citizen Kane is a film that I have seen maybe 20 times and I am always amazed at how many new things I see with each viewing.  As a film student, I studied this film for 4 different classes and each class showed me different ways of viewing it.  After my second viewing, my first professor told me that there were TWO meanings for Rosebud, not just the obvious one and our assignment was to figure it out using a semiotic approach.  I would never have guessed that the second meaning was Susan Alexander's clitoris!  Nope, I'm not kidding.  Watch it again and see how subtly it is implied.  This is actually a nickname that William Randolph Hearst (the man Kane is based on) had for his mistress' clitoris.  See ""RKO 281"" (1999) for more about this as well as ""The Cat's Meow"" (2001) for more about Hearst/Kane.<br/><br/>The shots are so carefully constructed and relate so well to the themes of the story, with each one telling you a lot about Kane's character.  For example, during the newsreel, Kane gets wet concrete on his jacket and the camera suddenly cuts without changing angles and the concrete disappears; this relates to how his character hides his weaknesses.  This is a subtle way for Kane to cover this up, yet this is left just apparent enough for the film audience to understand what Kane did to the newsreel.  Yes, this newsreel was constructed after Kane's death, yet it is footage captured while he was alive and since Kane would never allow that to be seen and has a monopoly on the media, he had it cut from the original footage.  You all may be thinking that I am reading way to far into this film, however these are all things that I learned in college.  There are some films for which you really need an education in fine arts to appreciate many aspects of them.  The story itself can get tiresome, but it is not the story that really makes this film one of the greatest; it is how well the Director conveys his ideas.  ""The less obviously a filmmaker reveals his intentions, the better the film.""   This applies for art films such as this, but not for junk like ""Half-Baked.""  This is a film that uses the language of images, not so much the plot, to convey its ideas.  Masterful direction, storytelling, and performances.  They just don't get better than this! *****/*****"
"marshall89","Null","1","3","13 January 2003"," An unforgettable classic
","Just a couple of nights ago I had the privilege of watching Citizen Kane, and although this may be a movie that isn't recommended for teens, I absolutely loved it. The classic masterpiece that launched Orson Welles into the film industry is easily one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane has an intriguing beginning. Welles easily captures you with the scenes of Kane's province, first showing a ""No Trespassing"" sign that instantly let me know I was watching a great movie. The camera moves up to Charles Kane on his death bed, where he mutters the unforgettable word ""Rosebud"" and then drops his snow globe. When the News On The March part began I was charmed, and it was very creative. I'll admit I was fooled a bit, thinking that the whole film was going to be a news show. But instead it develops into a plot that revolves around a journalist searching for what Kane meant by Rosebud. The film shows Kane's life from the day he was adopted by a rich man named Mr. Thatcher and continues on through the many interesting debacles and triumphs that surrounded him for the rest of his days. What can I say? The film is incredible. It has many great characters and plenty of interesting aspects that make you glad you're watching it. It moves you during every second. I was amazed by the many great scenes and moments, such as Kane's speech during his run for governor, Kane watching his wife sing at the opera in disbelief, and his tantrum when he threw objects across the room after the departure of his second wife and then discovered his snow globe, which made him realize that he longed for the simple days of his childhood. <br/><br/>Very few movies have been able to recapture the magic of Citizen Kane. I may not agree with most people on the statement that it's THE greatest movie of all time, but I love it anyway and it's one of my favorites.<br/><br/>
Overall rating: 4 out of 5."
"Chris_Docker","7","1","3","1 December 2002"," a masterpiece by the standards of its day
","Whilst Citizen Kane represented a masterpiece in innovative technique and the consummate skills of one person (Orson Welles), it stands up less well by today's standards. The story of a newspaper magnate who rides roughshod over everyone in an effort to prove that he helps the underclasses is riddled with sexism and class values that the film makes little or no attempt to dispel. There is hardly a lovable character in the whole film, the final revelation is too obscure to fathom unless you can re-wind the video, and the pacing is such that it can make tiring viewing.<br/><br/>On the other hand it contains superb acting, a brilliant script, and enough lighting and camera techniques to keep film students in homework for years. A critics' delight it may be, but for the filmgoer, whilst well above the average, it hardly ranks the ""best film of all-time"" appellation that has become its fashionable accolade."
"Superstition","7","1","3","15 November 2002"," Orson Welles and his dated monstrosity
","A boy is separated from his family and is abducted into a life of luxury and money. However at the end of his life he realizes that money can't buy love nor can it replace the affection of a family.<br/><br/>So what? who cares? who didn't already know this? I mean, can this movie be any more insipid? Can this movie be any more cold, clinical or lackluster?<br/><br/>Much has been said about Citizen Kane's technical greatness, about it's innovations, and that's the reason why most people consider it the greatest film ever done. So what are you telling me? That just because Orson Welles put his camera here and used some shadows there it makes this film superior to all the other true works of art like La Strada? Are you telling me that technical values are more important than artistic values? Because that's pretty much what Citizen Kane is: a gutless exercise in style. If technical innovations were any important why isn't The Jazz Singer the greatest film ever done. It was the first film to incorporate sound to movies and that's much more important than any of the tricks Welles pulls out of his ass throughout this movie. But The Jazz Singer gets no respect (and rightfully so since it's such a mediocre movie), so why on earth does Citizen Kane gets so much praise? It's not like it was the first film to use any of those techniques. Deep focus, low camera angles, use of shadows, they had all been used before and they have all been used after, and many times they have given much better individual results. Citizen Kane is only historically significant for being the first film to use them all in one film (since then on Orson Welles has been given the credit for something he didn't come up with). Innovations are just innovations, new things, and more than half a century later it's stupid to think they still mean anything.<br/><br/>On top of it, Citizen Kane is pretty average in every other aspect. There's not one single memorable performance in the film. Joseph Cotton is fine but he had the bad luck of having to share the screen with Welles (belting out one of the most distastefully over-the-top performances of his career). The performances do come alive at times and that's entirely due to the great script co-written by Welles himself and Herman Mankiewicz. To tell you the truth if Herman was anything like his brother, all the witty and memorable phrases in the film are his doing. They're fast, intelligent and they provide Kane with its most relaxed moments. The rest of the script (which I suppose was Welles's work) is too melodramatic and pretentious.<br/><br/>But more than that, Citizen Kane fails to accomplish one of the primary goals of any movie: connect with the audience. I don't know what Welles was thinking when he thought anybody was going to identify with this megalomaniac who makes life impossible for everyone around him and stills expects them to love him, understand him, and keep an open mind about him at all times. I normally wouldn't have a problem with characters that are emotionally unavailable, they make for some interesting character studies, but this is ridiculous. Normally director's have the good judgement to show both sides of the character, his bad side and his good side, but Charles Foster Kane's personality is so big and strong he comes off as a plain simple bastard. I can't imagine anyone saying: ""Gee, I watched Citizen Kane and I really felt it spoke to me"", maybe Louis B. Meyer did, maybe Welles himself did, maybe Bill Gates does, but all of us this side of the socio-economical spectrum can't help but just don't care. Really, I don't care about Charles Foster Kane's life, I don't care about his feelings and I don't care about a single frame of this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe when the movie was released it was actually significant, with all its innovations but after so many years those innovations don't matter anymore, and that's when a movie really dates. Go ahead and watch it, but if you've seen films like Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Persona, 8 1/2, Battleship Potemkin, Andrei Rublev, Rashomon, etc, then be prepared to be disappointed by a movie that doesn't live up to its reputation."

This film lands you in a world that is both glorious and disturbing, the character of Charles Foster Kane is one that is so well drawn out and so brilliantly played (by, who else, but Orson Welles himself) that we are able to make a connection to this guy and become totally enthralled in his world and his doings no matter how corrupt the things he did were. It is never boring, it is, from the very first frame to the very last frame, one of the most intriguing films ever made and, possibly most importantly, it hasn't aged! It feels as if it were just made today but with a black and white camera instead of a color camera.

","I am usually wary of hyped-up films, but I usually regard old films exempt. Given the technical difficulties they had to overcome, I strive to not take modern cinematography for granted.  Yet, I dare call ""Citizen Kane"" overrated.<br/><br/>A movie, to be a movie, needs to be a movie.  This is not as simple as it sounds.  ""Citizen Kane"" has a solid plot, realistic characters, deep themes, thoughtful dialogue, and good cinematic effects (for what they had to work with).  To one who hasn't seen it, that sounds like a darn good film. Unfortunately, on the last part, it goes overboard.  I.e., the story falls secondary to cinematic sequences so overt (even cheesy) they spawned countless parodies.  If one accepts my definition of a movie as a system of plots, themes and characters enhanced by its portrayal on a movie screen, Wells has this system of movies and special effects completely backwards!<br/><br/>Maybe it's personal opinion, but I believe cinematic effects should subtly enhance the story, not drown it.  Yet some of the sequences in ""Citizen Kane"", such as the mirrors images and jigsaw puzzle sequences, scream at my eyes.  I may not catch everything, but what I do catch sure insults my intelligence.  If technology indeed forced Wells to be this blatant, he may just as well have given up and omitted the scenes instead.<br/><br/>This is not the best movie ever made.  To earn that title, a movie has to be more movie than effect.  It's an impressive piece of work, but it also shows how old-timers are just as vulnerable to movie hype as today's youngsters."

The lighting, sound, angles, and use of film stock is unparalleled. I love how Welles used lighting to make our eyes focus on the character that he wanted us to pay attention to.  Throughout the movie we never really see the reporter following the rosebud case very well and rightly so because he is not the focus of the movie, Kane's life is. The movie started at the end, began in the middle and ended at the end of Kane's life, which sounds like every Quentin Tarentino movie I've seen.

"Neal Wruck","10","1","3","4 April 2002"," The Greatest, for a reason
","In June 1998, on a much-publicized list, the American Film Institute named `Citizen Kane' America's Greatest Movie, sparking a controversy that rages to this day. Since then, when people watch `Citizen Kane', they've been analyzing it and dissecting to see why it made the list. They completely have forgotten what made it so great (Minor spoilers). <br/><br/>
I, for one, am one of those who think any greatest movie list is ridiculous. I believe a person should have several favorite movies and if they are asked what is their favorite, they can name one of those. But they need to know why. `Citizen Kane' is one of these I would name because it's so creative. Every scene is a delight to watch in terms of cinematography, lighting, sound, writing, music or acting. Almost everyone was in their film debuts: Orson Welles, Joe Cotton, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Erskine Sanford, William Alland, Paul Stewart and George Coulouris are all excellent in their debuts and most would have long careers. It's difficult to name who is the best, but I think that Cotton, Sloane and Moorehead were the best in all their scenes. Welles and Coulouris would be the runners up.  <br/><br/> There are other elements that make the film work: The script of Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (Strangely, the film's only Oscar winner), the music score of Bernard Herrmann, the photography of Gregg Toland (The only major team member with previous film experience), the film editing of Robert Wise (Who would have a great career as a director), and the sound created by Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart. Blend all these elements together, allow to bake and you got a great movie. <br/><br/> Film Critic Pauline Kael once called Rosebud a gimmick. Indeed, this is correct. At first, it seems to explain everything, but it also explains nothing. The movie has such a great story because it gives us the inside on the life of a rich and famous celebrity, the kind we are always interested in. Rosebud is the key of newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland), as well as ours, to unlocking the life of Charles Kane. We really never sympathize with Kane since he is a jerk. He uses people to his own advantage and he kicks anyone around who gets in his way. Nevertheless, the life is fascinating. The screenplay was also one of the first to take liberties in the plot. It doesn't have a linear narrative, but rather jumps from interview to interview, from event to event. Event after 60+ years of age, the movie is still as fresh and entertaining as though it were made yesterday, just as it will be 60 years from now. <br/><br/>If you decide to watch the movie for the first time, do not expect it to be the greatest movie you have ever seen. Rather, don't expect anything. Expect just another movie and you will get your money's worth. On the cinema mountain range, there are few on the same height as `Citizen Kane' (Dr. Strangelove is the only movie I would place on Kane's level, for its brilliance, its acting and its creativity). Unfortunately, many of today's future directors aren't getting raised on films like this. In fact, when I told someone about it recently, they said `Citizen Kane? Is that a movie?' That's a shame, for the filmmakers of tomorrow need better inspiration than the disposable movies of today."
"keiljd","6","1","3","8 March 2002"," Good, but not THAT good
","Incredibly overrated, but still very good. That's how huge a chasm has been created between fantasy and reality since the Brussels World's Fair Jury voted KANE the #1 movie of all time back in 1958. No movie can live up to such unending praise.<br/><br/>Those 14,000 voters who rank Kane a ten have been brainwashed, as surely as the 900 or so who rank it a One are slightly clueless. The truth lies somewhere in between, around a 7. But I must admit to a kind of admiration for the Outcast 900; they're closer to right than they might think. <br/><br/>Audacious, only slightly derivative, landmark, indelible, smarmy biopic of Hearst in a fictional guise, utilizing the justly lauded Newsreel opening and flashback storyboard, in one reporter's search for the Meaning of Kane's last word. If you've read Hollywood Babylon, you know that Word has a double meaning, in Life and in Art. Makes the movie more fun. But, since Kane is alone when he dies, it's a puzzle how everyone seems to know his last word.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is Everett Sloane's Girl on the Ferry Boat speech. Beautiful and nostalgic old man reminiscence, played to perfection. I'm sorta old now myself, and my Ferry Boat Girl is Lynn Mahoney, 1951. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, leave us not lose sight of the fact that Citizen Kane wasn't even the best movie of 1941. That'd be The Maltese Falcon. However, both are infinitely better than the Academy's choice, How Green Was My Valley."

After hearing all the hype and kudos that have been deposited upon this Orson Welles' classic, I decided I should watch it for its astounding accolades if for nothing else.  Truly, a magnificent movie, but the best of all time?  That's a stretch.<br/><br/>
Made in 1941, I can see where it puts everything of its time or before to shame, but I can't see it beating everything made since.  Definitely a good movie, but it really consists of not much more than an intricate and albeit wonderful character sketch.  I thought Welles' acting was impressive, but others were not quite so entertaining, and its not the most entertaining movie, either.  My friend fell asleep watching it, which gives me evidence on this front.<br/><br/>
A film needs to do two things if it intends to be memorable or considered a form of literature.  First, it must entertain.  This means keeping people riveted, in order to not miss anything.  Second, it should make its statement.  If the first is not achieved, it is found that much of the purpose is lost.  I can see where many experts and movie pros can keep themselves entertained watching this film, as the meticulousness of Welles is astounding.  However, to the average viewer (and my friend), the film is not so entertaining.  All in all, a fantastic movie for those who like to watch and expound upon the extreme care taken in its production, but not the best of all time."
"mkql","Null","1","3","31 January 2002"," Great or Greatest
","Citizen Kane is a great movie.  Some say it is the greatest.  I have discovered that such distinction is unfair and impossible to objectively support.  Granted the artistic presentation is superb and was revolutionary in its time, but in the realm of greatness the way an artist presents his work can only augment the important ideas presented.   We go to see Mars Attacks for the all-star cast and perhaps a few laughs, but nothing of real value is ever presented or implied in those two horrifying hours.<br/><br/>
However, in addition to its artistic power Citizen Kane does contain universal themes, which can still apply to our lives today.  Orson Welles' movie shows the tragic consequences of a spiritually or emotionally selfish life.  Its themes combined with the artistic presentation make this movie great.  But besides this distinction I see no evidence to place it above other movies that also present universal themes in emotional and artistic ways (movies such as Braveheart or Cast Away).  Distinctions of `the greatest' can only be made according to one's particular tastes.  We all identify with characters and the themes and challenges they encounter for different reasons and to differing degrees.  Therefore, we should merely leave objective analysis of movies to the distinction of greatness rather than risk human favoritism in choosing the greatest."

I still can't decide whether or not I liked this movie, but many of the themes and underlying implications had a lasting effect on me. The interesting camera angles and mind provoking shots make up for a plot that drags at some points, but ultimately I believe that this film's reputation has endured based on the timeless themes that left me questioning my own beliefs.  Welles presents his audience with a character who is so consumed with gaining power and buying love that he misses making true connections with the people in his life.  Charles Foster Kane suffers a lonely death in his mansion, leaving behind the cluttered piles of objects he used in his quest to buy friendship and respect.  What he didn't understand was that life is measured more by the people and lives that you truly touch, not by your money or possessions.  Welles constantly reminds the audience that riches are wonderful, but when you obtain them at the expense of everything else, you are missing out on living.  Ultimately, these ideas give Citizen Kane its staying power because they raise questions about life and love that haven't changed in the past sixty years."
"Oblomov_81","10","1","3","22 January 2002"," A testament to the power of cinema, and the power of art
","`Citizen Kane' is a film that begins with the death of a man's body and ends with the cremation of his soul. It is a story that is told through the memories of several people who each know only bits and pieces of Charles Foster Kane; none of them can honestly say they know him as a complete human being. The only thing they are all sure of is that Kane is a man who wanted something he could never give: love. The moment he left his mother's boarding house, his whole life became preoccupied with money, scandal, and politics. There was never room for anything else.<br/><br/>`It's probably a very simple thing,' says a newspaper editor in response to Kane's final spoken word: `Rosebud.' We have just seen a newsreel that chronicles, on a very superficial level, the life of one of the world richest and most powerful men. The images of his huge mansion being built, complete with swimming pools, tennis courts, gardens, and zoos, sharply contrast with the dark, gloomy, empty atmosphere that was presented at the beginning of the film and will be seen again at the end. Xanadu is now a ruin, a broken home for a broken man. The testimonies of Kane's friends and family strip away the gloss provided by the newsreel, documenting the emotional spiral downward for one of America's most influential people.<br/><br/>Kane mistakenly believes that the best way to win love from another person is through controlling them. This is best seen in the scenes where he tries, like Professor Higgins from Shaw's `Pygmalion,' to make his second wife an opera star. Of course, he could also be doing this to make her more `respectable,' so she can be placed on a pedestal like his first wife, who was the President's niece. But by this point in the film, it is clear that Kane is a very lonely man at heart, and desperately needs the honest affection of another person. He has become aware of the emptiness of his possessions.<br/><br/>Kane's anger towards his loneliness grows into an impassioned fury, and he tears apart his room in a scene that ends by partially repeating what we have seen in the opening: he finds a glass globe with the image of a shack in it, holds it for a second, and says `Rosebud.' Then he walks away, the last we will see of him in the film. Baffled, the reporters leave his Xanadu as its contents are being either sold off or burned. One of them refers to their unsuccessful search as `playing with a jigsaw;' they have found every piece but one. The camera pans past the statues, jewelry, antiques, and valuables to see the `scrap' items that have no monetary value being burned away. Among them is Rosebud itself, the sled Kane loved playing with as a child; earlier in the film, when he was visiting Susan Alexander for the first time, he mentioned having just traveled back from his mother's funeral with a few of his childhood possessions. Rosebud was one of those toys, the last thing Kane was holding on to before being dragged away into a life of gold and silver. Love, after all, is something that cannot be bought or sold.<br/><br/>Perhaps, then, Kane really had the ability to love the entire time. He just couldn't use it because it was buried beneath everything he had bought with his earnings. When Kane cries out for his sled in his dying breath, he is pleading for a return to the innocence of his childhood, before his life became a whirl of buying and spending. For all his financial and social power, Kane only wanted what every human being needs.<br/><br/>`Citizen Kane' is frequently ranked by critics and audiences as the greatest film of all time, or at least somewhere in the top five. It received the `no. 1' crown by the American Film Institute when they named their 100 favorites, which impressed me since I thought they would go the sentimental route and put `Gone With the Wind' or `Star Wars' at the top (although I was still a bit upset that none of Welles' other films, including `The Magnificent Ambersons' and `Touch of Evil,' made the list). Personally, I'm not sure what my `all-time' favorite movie is; I have seen many great films in my twenty years, and sorting them out in some kind of precise order is already too difficult. But there is no doubt in my mind that Welles' masterpiece is one of the truly mesmerizing achievements of cinema, right up there with Kurosawa's `Seven Samurai,' Renoir's `Grand Illusion,' Tarkovsky's `Andrei Rublev,' Bergman's `Wild Strawberries,'  Disney's `Fantasia,' Truffaut's `Jules and Jim,' and my childhood favorite, the Technicolor classic `The Thief of Bagdad.' It is one of those few films that always has something new up its sleeve every time you watch it, a different present for each member of the audience."
"planetbob","Null","1","3","25 November 2001"," Technically great, poor story
","Now that I've watched Citizen Kane, I realize that it is ""technically"" excellent - meaning, it is very well-acted and -filmed.  Doubtless you will get a big charge out of the film if you are the type of person who is interested in the way a film is crafted.  Now that I've seen the movie, I understand that many of the glowing comments on IMDB about this film are made by this type of person.<br/><br/>If you are the type of person who likes a very good story, one that draws you in and keeps you focused on the story until the end of the movie, you'll probably be let down.<br/><br/>I thought Citizen Kane was beautiful to look at, but I found the story and storytelling to be of lower quality than the rest of the film.  It takes around 15 minutes for the movie to actually get started, and then the rest of the two hours are filled with the search for ""Rosebud"", while the (story-oriented) viewer is still wondering why he or she should care. As far as I'm concerned, the story isn't good enough to get the viewer interested. When ""Rosebud"" is finally revealed, the symbolism and the point of the movie are obvious, but so is the lack of a good story."
"mgmax","Null","1","3","13 November 2001"," So why do people say Kane is the greatest movie ever made?
","It's hard to see Kane plainly for the voices you hear on either side of you now-- the one telling you it's the greatest movie ever made, and the other one (represented by so many people here) asking, what's the big deal? Here's an attempt at an historical answer for why Kane has been regarded as supremely great-- and whether there is any justice in the claim.<br/><br/>Throughout the 1930s there was a certain critical faction, especially in New York, that felt that the art of the cinema died with the arrival of talkies-- that movies got visually dull and politically timid in dealing with the important issues of the time (remember that the whole debate about whether Hollywood should make social problem/message movies like The Grapes of Wrath would have just happened when Kane was made).  That Hollywood had sold out for the buck, turned its back on geniuses like Griffith and Stroheim and the kind of cinematic art represented by German Expressionist classics like The Last Laugh and Sunrise.  <br/><br/>The capper on the whole decade would have been the enormous hype for Gone With the Wind, a masterpiece of middlebrow sentiment that even the New York critics were cowed into tiptoeing around.  (Read the NY Times review, in which future Searchers screenwriter Frank Nugent feels compelled to argue, a bit nervously, why it might NOT be automatically the greatest movie ever made.)  Once in a while these critics had managed to make a certain smaller noise about a movie they felt met their criteria, such as John Ford's The Informer, which was about as good an imitation of a German Expressionist silent picture as Hollywood ever made.<br/><br/>Along comes a New York theater figure, Welles, who makes a movie which looks like The Informer (even using a cinematographer who had worked with Ford and apprenticed under the cinematographer of The Last Laugh), but unlike the somewhat ponderously arty Informer has a much livelier American-feeling pace that links it to the tradition of American newspaper comedy-dramas.  Where cameras had been mostly parked at a two-shot distance for ten years, Welles uses his like a silent filmmaker, diving through skylights and burrowing in for mammoth closeups.  He plays with the medium by starting his movie with another movie, a newsreel, which he mocks brilliantly (and there were plenty of people in New York then who delighted in the mocking of the Time-Life empire).  And he dares to poke its nose into the personal life of a still-feared and influential figure, Hearst, at a time when, say, Hollywood could make a movie about the Dreyfus case 40 years before and still be too timid to say the word ""Jew.""  <br/><br/>So not surprisingly, the critics, thinking that most of humanity thinks Gone With the Wind is the best movie ever made, jump all over a movie that seems to have been made just for them and say, no, HERE'S the greatest movie ever made.  As it happened, few agreed with them at first, but starting some time in the 50s, when the film started to be seen again at 16mm film societies, its reputation spread and as a result, where it wasn't even mentioned on the first Sight & Sound International Critics Poll in 1952, it has placed #1 every ten years since (though perhaps in 2002 it will finally give way, probably to Godfather I & II).<br/><br/>But you look at it today... and you say, so what's so great about it.<br/><br/>Well, in one regard it's suffered the fate of so many innovative films-- it has been influential to death.  (How many more Abysses and Mission to Marses can 2001: A Space Odyssey take before it suffers the same fate?)<br/><br/>Within a very short time the German Expressionist-influenced look of Kane became the shadowy look of film noir.  The flashback-narration structure, which seemed very innovative at the time (although the critics would have all just seen it in the French film Le Jour se Leve-- but that may have been a bonus for Welles rather than a detriment), was also picked up by dozens of thrillers in no time.  (Go rent The Mask of Dimitrios if you want to see Kane practically remade as a crime thriller.)  And, of course, the idea of telling the inside story of a famous person's life is no longer the province of daring art, but of glossy trash like The Greek Tycoon and The Carpetbaggers.<br/><br/>It took somewhat longer for Welles' camera style to be absorbed. For decades only a few maverick stylists like Stanley Kubrick used the camera like a pen the way Welles did.  But since the era of the music video and the Steadicam, suddenly everyone does.  Welles' style seems rather staid after you've watched the camera glide through the bar in Goodfellas, chase dogs through a grocery store in Raising Arizona, and stick up a pharmacy in Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>So what does Kane still have to offer?  Well, for one, a deep sense of mortality and moral decline and failure, an almost Shakespearean psychology, that's extraordinary in a 26-year-old filmmaker.  Second, a density and richness of visual imagery that deserves to be seen on the big screen, where Welles' and Toland's black and white chiaroscuro can be at its most seductive.  But before you go to it, rent a couple of ordinary movies of the late 30s-- best of all a couple of biographies or historical films, perfectly enjoyable in themselves, like The Life of Emile Zola or In Old Chicago-- and then, with their visual style in your head, try to recapture a bit of how Welles seemed to set the camera-- and the director-- free."
"cutter-12","10","1","3","30 October 2001"," The Xanadu of motion picture classics
","Though not top on my personal favorites list, it's still pretty much the greatest film ever made for a wide and varied number of fascinating reasons. The genius behind it is undeniable, and it is THE film for seeing things in the more times you see it. Welles was aiming for a high level of technical ingenuity, a goal he accomplished with brilliant aplomb as the style of the filmmaking overturns every Hollywood convention before 1941, and set the standard thereafter. The only filmmaker of stature who had dabbled in expressionistic and innovative camera angles in the 1930's was John Ford. Welles credited Ford as being his visual influence, then he took innovation to a new height, creating so many new devices and techniques to tell his story both visually and orally that every director who was an artist at heart couldn't not have admired it. There was an understandable hatred for Welles when he blew into Hollywood, the 24 year old upstart boy wonder, full of ego, charisma and a with cheerful and swaggering disregard for the Hollywood establishment. He was dangerous and a threat, and people<br/><br/>                              would have known he didn't come from New York to direct a musical in the vein of The Wizard of Oz. Welles was going to do something to shock, to stir opinions and passions, and to show the world he WAS the only director in town. A tall order. After a couple of initial projects fizzled the winds of fate carried Citizen Kane to his feet.<br/><br/>                              A vitriolic and condemning character study based on the tyrannical William Randolph Hearst was not ever going to be popular entertainment but it fit Welles' needs precisely. Along with writer Mankiewicz, and cinematographer Greg Toland (who had worked with Ford), he conspired to create a film so gargantuan in its aspirations, so self promoting, so wickedly sharp in its observations, and so gleefully clever you couldn't help but take notice of it, especially in it's unveiling of the meaning(s) behind the word Rosebud. Once you think of how a child usually rides a sled it strikes you as obvious. Kane as a boy is first seen riding the sled on his belly, and it's symbolic of the sexual position he would have assumed with Susan Alexander, who was based on Hearst's Mistress Marion Davies, whom it was rumoured Hearst had nicknamed an obvious part of her anatomy ""Rosebud"". Roger Ebert says at the end of his audio commentary on the DVD that the sled Rosebud really explains nothing but I beg to differ. It explains, like a great piece of art, any number of things. A symbol of boyhood innocence, that place he wishes he was never torn from, his regrets etc etc. Along, of course, with the more intended sexual connotation.<br/><br/>                              Citizen Kane truly is a haunting, emotionally cold, and ultimately depressive piece of work. And for that reason alone it won't top everyone's personal favorites list. It is at times very hard to watch and work out. But it is the most profound and intelligent film of it's day and it pays off many rewards the more times you visit it. Fluff it was not. It destroyed Welles' directorial career in Hollywood, and no doubt shortened the life of William Randolph Hearst in his determination to blacklist Welles. It's a story that speaks the truth about corruption, power, and materialism, and how one man, however forceful, can become dwarfed by and be enslaved by them. It is a work of pure brilliance in writing, showmanship, technical illusion,                               and improvisation. A film for the ages. A testament to the  other worldly genius of Orson Welles. And a definite must see for everyone."
"NateW","10","1","3","8 October 2001"," An influential and important cinematic landmark
","Anyone who considers themself a film buff has undoubtedly viewed Citizen Kane at least once or certainly heard of it. It is simply one of the most lauded and recognizable films ever made in any language. It tops many alltime greatest films lists, including that by the American Film Institute. It is a required piece of viewing in any beginning film school. It's filming techniques and cinematography redefined the way films are made. It contains one of the most famous characters in cinema history, and the character isn't even human! These and many other points help to distinguish Citizen Kane as a true classic, but the real value of it comes from who made it.<br/><br/>Orson Welles, at the age of 26, wrote, directed, and starred in this monumental film. Showing extrordinary talent in each regard, he solidifed his place in the annals of filmlore. He was a magician with a movie camera, and using it he created many images that were considered impossible to film at the time this was made. Although impressive, the camerawork never overshadows the story, which centers around the life of powerful media mogul Charles Foster Kane, a not so subtle takeoff of William Randolph Hearst. The supporting cast is great in telling the life story of Kane, but Welles and his camera are the real stars.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane can be viewed as THE art film, but it has entertainment value as well. Each viewing presents something new and and innovative, and it is certainly watchable more than once. That is what makes Citizen Kane the great film it is."

","So....Citizen Kane was voted the number one film of all time by the American Film Institute but that doesn't mean we have to like it. As a film buff in long standing I still can't figure out what makes the film so great. After a few viewings throughout the years I become bored after about 40 minutes and when its over I'm sitting there wondering what all the fuss is about. I'll go as far as to agree its a fairly good account of a publishers rise to power but not a great one although the black and white cinematography and the score by Bernard Herrmann are assets to the film. Of the players Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloane and Paul Stewart steal the acting honors. It also bemuses me that the film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and only won one for the screenplay. Could it be that the Academy didn't feel it was so great in 1941? I wonder why? I submise that through the years some critics and film historians decided to boost the film to classic status which ultimately force fed film fans and some critics into actually believing the film is great and not to look naive we went along for the ride. Today we realize that Citizen Kane was not a factual account and as far as I'm concerned it all boils down to artistic claptrap. By the way the film that took the Oscar in 1941 was How Green Was My Valley directed by John Ford. Now thats a classic!"

","Listed as one of the best movies ever made and #1 on the American Film Institute's list of greatest movies, this is a remarkable movie for a number of reasons. Wells made this movie when he was only in his mid twenties! RKO studio's gave him full run of the studio's facilities, yet he'd never made a movie in his life. Most of the cast were friends of his from his radio days in New York. The obvious real-life Kane, William Randolph Hearst,  did everything in his (considerable) power to stop the movie. He nearly succeeded. Refusing to show the movie at any of his theaters, it was could only be seen at a few RKO movie houses. Had the movie played on more screens at its release, it would have been much more successful. Wells won an Oscar for the screenplay (his only one) but credit must be shared with Herman Mankiewicz."

Most of us come to this decision ourselves, because the film is THAT GOOD.  I'm a little too savvy... as most ""Citizen Kane"" supporters are ... to follow anybody's opinion. Pauline Kael was wildly inconsistent with how I (and many people) feel, totally off the mark perhaps half the time.  I'm happy that her ""Citizen Kane"" review was so positive.

The film is so amazing because at the age of 25, Welles managed to co-write the screenplay, get the film produced, direct and starred in it! The film is also a miracle it is around today for it was loosely based on the real life newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried to not only stop the film from getting released but who also tried to destroy the negative! The film is narratively, aesthetically, theoretically and technically well rounded from a director who had never even spent a day on set before Citizen Kane was made.

From where else do we learn the concept of tilt, as far as the cinematographer knows it?  The man actually had his crew TEAR OUT a section of the floor of a beautiful mansion just to set a scene where he felt the leading man (Charles Kane) needed to have a commanding view of the supporting actress.

You tell me ""The Godfather"" is your favourite movie, I'll ask; 'Have you seen ""Citizen Kane""?' You tell me ""The Blob"" is your favourite movie and...well, I probably won't bother asking because you obviously have no taste, but you get the idea!<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is everything I had hoped for in a movie. It is not my favourite(It's number 4 on my list), but, seriously, how could movies get much better? It's one of those ""before-their-time"" films, it's a technological breakthrough, it's intelligent, emotional, entertaining, imaginative, the kind of film that you like to talk about. One thing it is not: It does not draw you into its centre as a kind of ""out-of-body"" movie experience. But, of all non ""out-of-body"" movie experiences, it is the best. In fact, if I had never had an ""out-of-body"" movie experience, this would probably be my all-time favourite film. But it's not. ""The Wizard of Oz"" is.

"HSauer","10","1","3","16 October 1999"," Obviously a great film
","Citizen Kane will never be popular with the general public because it asks too much of the viewer:  namely, that he sit still and pay attention, and periodically use his brain to process the information.  There are no wasted scenes in this film, consequently no boring scenes.  Years of potentially interesting material are covered in minutes, sometimes seconds, so that we see only what the writer & director deem most relevant to their story.  The audience is not told what to think about Kane; opinions expressed by the characters are not necessarily those of the film makers.  A man's life is too complex to be neatly packaged and turned into a formula.  Kane evidently wanted love, not money, but he equated love with money and material possessions - or maybe he didn't, but didn't know how else to love and be loved - and [POSSIBLE SPOILER] as it turns out, he had the long-lost ""Rosebud"" in a crate, in a warehouse, without being aware of that fact. Would Kane have been a different man if he'd found Rosebud in middle-age, say?  Was the missing sled his real ailment in life?  Certainly not, if material possessions aren't bearers of love.  Be wary of the ""easy answers"" - Citizen Kane is a wonderful work of art, much deeper than any of its parts."

","When I first saw Citizen Kane, I did not know what the hype was all about. Since I heard about it on Happy Days, I wanted to see it. After the first few times, it was nothing spectacular. But there is something perfect about this film. I also fell to sympathize Citizen Kane in my last viewing. It is also a purely addictive film. The writing, the casting, the directing, and film-making was absolutely perfect. Nobody in their right mind would change an aspect. Citizen Kane remains today perhaps the most important film of all time to film-makers. They look to see what they can do. Until Citizen Kane, every previous film looked the same. When Citizen Kane came, it changed the film world forever. Not even Titanic would appear as an inferior and insufficient comparison. Titanic is nowhere in the realms of Orson Welles. Kane will forever be challenged. It is truly the best film ever made. One word is simply perfect! Perfect, Mr. Welles."

","Citizen Kane is one of those films you hear about all the time, see them in various polls, TV shows, other films, in one word you know it exist but you never saw it for yourself but do not let that disappoint you. Citizen Kane is terrifying film with its revolutionary filming techniques, new method of acting, visual style, phenomenal make up and behind all of that is just simple yet powerful story of love (or lack of it to be precise). Orson Welles was just 25 when he made this film, but that was enough to cement him in cinemas history as one of its strongest titans. Although film was reviewed positive by the critics, it was commercial failure, but like all Welles films, its just like a bottle of wine. As time pass, it will be only better and better. It took years later for people and film critics to appreciate this masterpiece as without a doubt, most revolutionary film ever made. As I mentioned earlier this film is all about love and innocence, as the final world of media mogul Charles foster Kane ushered a search for their significance which led to mystery on ones life. Kane was man that had everything but in the end he had nothing only for his memories. That led us from his last word Rosebud to the end of the film where we realized that Kane become catatonic and lost after he remembered time when he had all, no materialistic, but inner riches:family and love.

","Citizen Kane (1941), is the film the made Cinema History. Orson Welles is a Great Actor, but he is also a Very, Very, Very Unique Director. Orson has a very clever eye for detail and framing within his shots. While we as the audience are intrigued by his character, Charles Foster Kane, we are still mind blown by just how well both the Cinematography, Editing, as well as the Art Direction works for us. These elements are hugely important in telling the whole story. <br/><br/>The film was not well received back in 1941. It has been attacked by one of the Greatest (if not dangerous) Tycoons of the Media business, William Randolph Hearst. Hearst Accused Welles for copying his life, but this is what Welles wanted for Kane, he did have the Keys to make any film he wanted without studio interference. That all changed when the Film Industry made it harder for Welles to get his films off the ground. Fortunately, Welles was forgiven by the public in the mid 70's. <br/><br/>Out of many films that I have seen in the past, Citizen Kane is the film that made me love Black & White Movies. It is a wonder why people never took the film for what it was. One of my top 5 Favorite films!"
"inemjaso","10","1","4","14 March 2017"," A Triumph of American Cinema
","Honestly where does anyone begin to talk about this movie. I suppose you could start with the masterful writing by Director, writer, and lead actor Orson Welles. The craft of nonlinear time in film is a delicate one. Only a handful of today's filmmakers, notably my favorite Quentin Tarantino, consistently pull this off. Welles pioneered this very craft with the way he tells Citizen Kane. We look at Kane's life as a reflection, knowing he is dead and seeing that journalists are now struggling to honor him appropriately as Kane himself was a media tycoon unmatched in his day. Next we can go to Toland's cinematography. Simply put, it is absurd. The things he is able to do with a camera in 1941 are astounding. Most significantly, Kane's ego requires Toland follow his movements with the camera at all times, even when he is off screen. Additionally, Toland pioneers some impressive low key lighting techniques and impressive parallel shots, such as the one of Sarah Alexander being focused in upon from the window above in both daylight and night. The last extraordinarily significant thing about this film is it was the first for many of the movie's actors, including Welles himself. As a Broadway star of the day, Welles attracted a lot of theater talent that helped make this movie all the more memorable and staggering in scope. A must watch for anyone that claims to like movies in America."
"oOoBarracuda","10","1","4","9 March 2017"," Citizen Kane
","At some point in their journey through film, every lover of cinema will attempt to critically evaluate Citizen Kane. The pantheon of film, Citizen Kane has, maybe the most prominent place in film history consistently topping lists as the best film of all-time. Starring Orson Welles in the titular role, alongside Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead, Citizen Kane follows the journey of a team of newspaper reporters desperate to find out the meaning of a powerful man's dying word. A technical wonder for the time it was made, and beyond, Citizen Kane has stood the test of time due to its gorgeous cinematography and boldly innovative camera work, blocking, and lighting. Admired and appreciated as a blueprint for an innumerable amount of films that came after it, Citizen Kane is not only a technical marvel but an ambitious project for the untested director, Welles, who was only 25 at the time of the film's production. What amounted to Welles' magnum opus, Citizen Kane is a film that's hard to top in technical achievement.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top after his family struck it rich in mining resulting in Kane being sent away by his parents to a boarding school in care of the bank until he was old enough to be awarded his share. His mother thought it best that the bank raise him and position him for a life better than their country sensibilities would be able to provide. Once he turned 25, Kane gained access to his fortune and immediately bought a newspaper. Kane sought to not only seize the means by which people learned their news, but to seize the news itself. Kane wanted to control everything around him and shape events so they fit his world view. Despite his wealth and power, Kane lived an internally solitary life. The more papers he bought and the power he amassed, the more alone he became. Despite two marriages, Kane never fills the void he needed to fill with the people around him. Never quite realizing that his void also couldn't be filled with money, Kane meanders through life with his only goal seeming to be gaining influence. When the death of Charles Foster Kane stuns the world, it is his dying word ""Rosebud"" that captures attention. A team of reporters begins a journey to discover what rosebud meant to Kane by interviewing the people who took part in his life. By attempting to uncover the meaning of a powerful man's dying word, the reporters are granted intimate access to the life of Charles Foster Kane, a life that was as much of an enigma once more was revealed as it was when it was kept a secret.<br/><br/>It's been said many times before that Citizen Kane was a technological feat for the ages, and that statement rings true. It's self-evident that Orson Welles took bold chances and used lighting, blocking, and camera techniques scarcely used before his creation of Citizen Kane. As incredible as nearly every shot in the film is, I'll avoid redundancy by only highlighting the shots that really knocked me over, figuratively. There is a heavy reliance upon glass throughout the film which I found extraordinary. Mirrors and windows play a huge role in the film, with Welles himself usually being framed by a window or looking through one. The most notable shot in the film and one of the most remembered shots in cinema history takes place with Charles Foster Kane, as a child, playing outside in the snow while his parents talk with a bank representative about where Kane is going to be sent. There is an exceptionally wonderful use of foreground, middle ground, and background as the audience sees Kane, framed by a window, with his mother banker and father comprising the rest of the shot. Everyone knows the shot, it's gorgeous, and a technical feat for anyone, especially the fledgling director Welles was. Another fantastic window shot shows Kane talking to his friend and confidant Jedediah Leland about his hopes to buy more and more papers and increase circulation at each one of the papers he owns. Kane looks through the window with a childlike excitement written on his face energized by the idea of being someone important and influencing the very members of the community he sees from his window. This scene is powerful in illustrating Kane's desire to wield influence and shows the power of the window he is looking out from as both a way to see those around him and Kane himself. Another powerful scene involving windows shows Kane framed in a window while going over more plans with his associates to increase his paper's circulations. Kane is again seen with emboldened confidence, yet he has the naivety of a child, wanting respect and praise, and seeming eager to please those around him. Once again at the office, just after Kane has bought another paper, we see his reflection in the window dancing along with a party he has thrown in celebration of his monetary investments. Jedediah is seen in the frame discussing whether or not Kane is making positive investments and if he will be able to keep up his current pace. This scene is powerful because we see such jubilation from Kane's reflection that appears ominous due to the camera angle with which the audience sees it. because the camera is positioned chest level with Jedediah, Kane's reflection is behind him, leaving the audience to wonder how long Kane's happiness will last. The power of the window in this scene leaves the audience wondering if happiness is something that is only in the past tense of Kane's life."

","Although I'm not entirely convinced if I would personally label it the greatest film in cinematic history (there are just so many to choose from), ""Citizen Kane"" remains an indisputable landmark that still seemingly gets better with every repeated viewing – which is quite astounding after so many viewings already – and it will presumably forever qualify as the most influential artistic achievement ever. Orson Welles' brilliant long-feature debut is, prior to and above everything else, a progressive movie that was far ahead of its time in terms of narrative structure, camera work and imagery, source material and pulverizing the sacred American Dream! Welles masterfully depicts self-made tycoon Charles Foster Kane from the birth of his newspaper empire, over the Great Depression and throughout two failed marriages, until his lonely passing in his private sanctuary named Xanadu. Kane is rather blatantly inspired by the real-life newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and he certainly didn't consider this to be great honor. He even tried boycotting Welles' film, and partially succeeded as his career never fully recovered from Hearst hatred campaign. Understandable, perhaps, since Kane is illustrated as a forceful but megalomaniac and incredibly stubborn tyrant. Everything about ""Citizen Kane"" is just overwhelming and demonstrates sheer macho power: the dialogs, the scenery and the bombastic soundtrack. Everything, except  Rosebud."

No. ""Rosebud"" was actually, in reality, Hearst's pet-name for his mistress's (Marion Davies) clitoris. (It's true. Look it up)<br/><br/>And, of course, the biggest problem with Citizen Kane was that its whole story was literally based on this one, single word ""Rosebud"".<br/><br/>With most people (back in 1941, and even now) not knowing the real meaning behind this word (it was a Hollywood in-joke), the viewer is forced to have to endure hearing it being spoken umpteen times throughout the course of this 2-hour picture.<br/><br/>Since I am hip (and, so now, you are, too) that ""Rosebud"" really meant Davies' clitoris, I can't begin to tell you how tired I got of hearing that word being spoken by actors who were obviously doing a very good job of concealing their smirks whenever they were required to repeat it.<br/><br/>Knowing the truth about the meaning behind ""Rosebud"", I think that this truly renders Citizen Kane as being one of the nastiest, most vile ""revenge-movies"" ever made against 2 very real people (who were both still living at the time) that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I can't think of another movie out there that goes so out of its way to make such a sneering mockery of 2 people (in this case Hearst and Davies). Its 2 screenwriters (Welles and Mankiewicz) and its director (Welles again) clearly showed how much deep-rooted contempt that they held for these 2 people, whom they only slightly knew.<br/><br/>And what really surprises me about Citizen Kane is that so many people have fallen all over themselves, claiming it to be one of the very best movies ever made.<br/><br/>I know that this is one of those movies that one's not allowed to dislike. But, hey, there's nothing wrong with someone just because they say that they don't like it.<br/><br/>I'll honestly tell you that, aside from some interesting camera shots, and some massive sets, and its big-budget production values, I found Citizen Kane to be really something of a bore and, nope, it actually doesn't hold up very well, 72 years later.<br/><br/>*A brief note about screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz* - For most of his adult life he was a miserable drunk (of the mouthy, belligerent kind). During his years in Hollywood (beginning in 1926) he managed to make a lot of enemies and alienate scores of celebrities with his drunken antagonism, including the likes of William Hearst and Marion Davies.<br/><br/>Mankiewicz died in 1953 at the age of 55 from cirrhosis of the liver (a disease caused by alcoholism)."

While there may perhaps be about 5 films that are ""better"" than Citizen Kane, there must be at least 50 that are ""better"" than Vertigo, that farrago of zilch. One fairly interesting suggestion has been made that Kane is about Truth, where Vertigo is about Fantasy. For me, Truth is a million more times more interesting and much stranger than Fiction. Kane is a great, great film: creative, courageous, original, deep and gripping, mentally stimulating, superbly shot, written, acted. It tells you things about the world and yourself. It is youthful, vigorous and vital. Vertigo meanders along like superannuated sludge, baffling from beginning to end, telling you nothing. Incipient mental decay. Stewart is not too bad an actor; Bel Geddes is very good; and Novak is abysmal. All the actors in Kane are beyond excellent. But Charlie Kane is hard to take: the Truth hurts. Vertigo is merely soporific: a puzzle not worth solving.<br/><br/>Kane is about America, and the American Nightmare. Barbarity to Decadence, via Hypocrisy, without Civilization. Vertigo is about San Francisco, and the Flimsiness of Tinseltown. Sidling into Eventide. However, it is arguable that the theme of both films is an attempt to recover or re-discover the past. Blade Runner is more brilliant than either of them. The memories of the replicants are simply faked.<br/><br/>Here are a dozen films no better than Citizen Kane, but far, far ""better"" than Vertigo: Chinatown, The Seventh Seal, The Pianist, Un Flic, Breathless, Badlands, Once upon a Time in the West, in America, True Romance, The Hit, Hard Times, Sweet Smell of Success.

You hear a lot of people's opinions (his second wife, his personal business manager, his guardian during his childhood...) but never his own. The brilliant twist ending is one of the best I have ever seen. What really imprints itself on the brain is the cinematography. The acting, makeup, direction and screenplay are all fantastic, but the photography (by the great Gregg Toland) is truly the best camera work you are ever likely to see.

","I don't know exactly what's left to say about ""Citizen Kane"", about it's technical dazzle or the maturity of its plot, but it's interesting to note that its prominence gained height only gradually. At first, if not disregarded, it was mostly unnoticed, probably because William Randolph Hearst and his newspaper chain (pre-TV and pre-blog) avoided any mention of it. Only in the last 20 years or so has it been recognized for the masterpiece that it is.<br/><br/>Of course everyone's heard of it by now, and though most of us admire it, some despise it. I suspect that if some of us dislike it, it's not because of the film itself, but because the majority adore it. This is known as ""contrarianism"" and I blame the Frogs for it.<br/><br/>The French -- I can carry on with these Olympian generalizations, can't it? I mean, I'm protected by the First Amendment, right? The French have this tendency to turn common values upside down. That's what gave the world Jerry Lewis.<br/><br/>Not that I intend to put France and its couture down entirely. The single best sandwich I ever ate was in the Gare du Nord. But, really, take the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss as an example. Greek mythology? Pfui. Let's look more closely at Tlingit myths. The Tlingit are not proto-scientists or philosophers. They're a bunch of clam diggers in the Northwest. I should know, having lived with them.<br/><br/>Where was I? Oh, yes. That sandwich. Wow.<br/><br/>Getting back to ""Citizen Kane,"" I watch it now and again -- not too often because I have it memorized. But here's an example of why I think it's a masterpiece. Okay. Charles Foster Kane has forced his wife, who has a mediocre voice, to push herself into becoming an opera star with the help of his vast financial resources. She fails and tries to poison herself.<br/><br/>Here's how that scene plays out on screen. The camera is shooting poor half-dead Dorothy Comingore in fuzzy close up, looking anything but glamorous, breathing heavily, covered with sweat, unconscious, her face away from the door on which Kane and his minions are banging. Behind her figure is a table on which we see the suicide apparatus -- bottles and glasses. It's a rear projection, meaning that Comingore was being filmed while a screen behind her (previously shot) is being shown behind her. And -- within THAT back projection -- there is a third projection screen of the door, which finally swings open and admits Kane. Back projections were in common use in 1941 -- but a projection within a projection? (Welles used the same technique later, in ""Lady From Shanghai."") <br/><br/>Okay. As someone said, Welles was a kid with a new toy -- the camera. But he turned it into a model that did barrel rolls and crazy eights. Few have done it better since then -- and Welles' technique was tacked onto an adult story with no bad guys and no good guys, yet gripping. A young man loses his illusions as he ages. (Don't we all?) Welles' output went downhill from there, his apologists notwithstanding, not because of a monstrous ego. That's too easy. He couldn't bring himself to finish the editing because it was never again to meet his demanding expectations.<br/><br/>Don't let revisionists beguile you. It's one of the best movies ever made, and you can measure its quality along any number of dimensions, from Greg Toland's revolutionary photograph to Benny Hermann's subtle but apt score.<br/><br/>It's pretty good."
"autmngrl","10","1","4","16 March 2008"," Rebuttal to The Great Cinema Swindle
","When I was about 12 years old, my father a political science professor and amateur film buff called me into the den. He said to me, ""I want you to watch this film. It's one of the greatest movies ever made."" So, I did. I watched the film with my father, and I was in tears by the end -- genuine, sobbing tears. This was usually an indication, at that age, that I had liked a movie. But my father asked me anyway if I liked it. I was only able to nod my head yes. He asked me why, and my response was, ""I don't know. It was just so sad."" How can a 12 year old express the great depth of the message and themes of a film like Citizen Kane? Especially when that greatest message of the film is so simple and universal.<br/><br/>From the time this film was first released, it has been immortalized by the critics and panned by the people. It did not do well at the box office overall, despite the erudite, ""ground-breaking"" praise heaped upon it, and the praise overall has been about the film-making itself - the cinematography, the lighting, the performances, the unique narrative structure. As a professor of film, I teach it in all my classes. There is no way around it. As an example of film-making technique, there are few films that can compare to it on every level, but this has been talked into the ground.<br/><br/>Film theorists, historians and movie buffs from all generations have turned Citizen Kane into the holy grail of film-making. By analyzing the complexities of the film, I believe the most simple and most powerful aspect of this film is often overshadowed, as it is very symbolically within the film  the quest for true love. Not that love is ever simple. This is a film about a man who almost knew love but had it taken away from him before he could really hold on to it, and the rest of his life is spent trying to get it back. It is a tragic story of love lost (and truth be told, the greatest films are almost always about love lost or found). That has always been it's true strength to me.<br/><br/>If you go into this film with the expectation of ""the greatest film ever made,"" then you need to understand the context of that comment. It's not just about story but about the techniques of storytelling and film-making. It means that you will be watching it, for the most part, from a distance. You will be watching it for Toland's cinematography, or Mankiewicz and Welles's parallel narrative structure, or Welles's performance par excellence. And as long as you are watching it from this perspective, you may never be able to connect to the humanity of the film. And that's okay.<br/><br/>Or you can watch it through the eyes of a 12 year old in 1981before MTV and the internet. Simply allow all the separate techniques of film-making to come together as one, and just watch the movie. Let go of expectations...<br/><br/>I have loved this film since I was 12 and unable to articulate why I loved it. I loved this film before I cared about cinematography and lighting, art direction and editing. I loved this film because the story of a man searching for love spoke to me, even at 12.<br/><br/>God, I love this film!"

","One of the movies in my America in film class that we have recently watched was Citizen Kane. For homework I had to get background information for the movie. I read a lot of articles that told me that Citizen Kane was and is the greatest movie in American history. On the day that my class was to watch the movie I was interested to see if those comments were true. Nope. I'm not saying the movie was awful because it wasn't but I expected a lot more for the greatest movie ever. I think the whole thing with Rosebud was very clever and the camera shots in the movie were exceptional for the time. However the movie was not able to keep my interest. I'm not a big fan of black and white movies to begin with and Citizen kane did not really change my mind. As far as the acting in the movie I was very impressed with Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane. Jedediah Leland and the reporter for the inquirer were good characters as well. Pretty much every other character in the movie did not hold interest. All and all not a bad movie just not the greatest movie in American film."
"cameron-burn","10","1","4","15 July 2007"," Greatest film of all time
","Even people who have never seen Citizen Kane know its the greatest film of all time. Orson Welle's debut has become an undisputed cultural benchmark - the celluloid equivalent of War and Peace, the Mona Lisa, Hamlet, Moonlight sonata, or seargent pepper's lonely hearts club band(the Beatles album, not the beegees movie). But how did it achieve and maintain this exalted position as a cinematic sacred cow? From the start, the critics were on Orsons side. The Hearst press refused to carry ads or reviews for the film, thus fatally damaging it's box office potential(Kane losing $150 000), but elsewhere the notices seemed to recognise an instant classic. 2the most surprising and cinematically exciting motion picture seen in many a month... it comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood,"" gushed the New York times. Other journalists placed Welles in the revered company of legendary figures Charlie Chaplin and D W Griffith, saying,""this one film establishes him as the most exciting director now working."" <br/><br/>However, such hoopla, coupled with a relative lack of Oscars, made little difference to Welles in the years immediately following Citizen Kane. Attendant ticket sales and industry cachet would have justified the free hand Welles was given to make his debut, and placed him in a far stronger bargaining position in subsequent battles with the studios. But, with neither box office dollars nor gold plated statuettes for protection, Welles was vulnerable:follow up picture The magnificent Ambersons was taken away from the director and given an upbeat ending , and his bold ideas for future projects were treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt. A critical canon was established with Kane firmly placed in top spot of best ever films in sigth and sounds 1962 poll and has remained at the top of greatest films ever since. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is because although it was made in 1941, it still feels remarkably modern. Indeed, that it centres on the power of the media moguldom generations before Murdoch;takes on numerous genre meldings(detective story, biopic, backstage musical, film noir and a stunning newsreel parody) and rejects linear storytelling (yet still remains both clear and gripping make it more 90s than 40s. Yet, what separates it from modern multiplex fodder is its old school magic showmanship, intelligence and risk taking crafted into perfectly realised, stunning cinema. <br/><br/>Devoid of the pretencion that usually permeates critic's choices, Kane unravels with intelligence, biting wit and a real sense of playful ambiguity. The big themes-the perversion of idealism, the corrupting nature of success, the impenetrability of human beings- are carried off with the lightest touch as Kane descends from vibrant newspaper man to manipulative Svengali to bloated, distant husband. While all the cast turn in great work- Cotten i breathtaking as Kanes cohort Leland-it is Welles' own performance(often overlooked in lieu of his other talents) that really grounds the directorial razzle-dazzle with substance. To revisit Citizen Kane is to experience the infinite possibilities of movies being realised right before your own eyes. The sheer audacity and delight Welles takes in flouting conventions and inventing new ones is what keeps it fresh. Itt is that unique movie, chocker with great bits-the breakfast table marriage montage. Lelands ""girl on a Ferry"" reminiscence, that camera ascent to the theatre rafters that solidifies into a totally satisfying whole. <br/><br/>Considering all it appended academic apparatus(be sure to work ""deep focus cinematography"" revolutionary use of ceilings and he was only 25!"" into the pub conversation), it remains a gloriously entertaining classic."
"ctrout","10","1","4","18 July 2006"," Rosebud, Even!
","Citizen Kane is the story of Charles Foster Kane, a man very similar to that of William Randolph Hearst. Kane has it all, a multi-million dollar business, a mansion named Xanadu, and a celebrity that rivals the President of the United States. Even with all of this success, he dies alone and old uttering the mysterious word: ""Rosebud."" What does the word ""Rosebud"" mean, you ask? Well, that's where the movies begins. In flashbacks, we hear all about the life and times of this very rich man called Kane. It's up to the reporters and you to figure out what it all means.<br/><br/>A very interesting plot, but that's not the best part. You see, a movie like Citizen Kane has to have a lot more to be called the greatest movie of all time. Believe me, it has everything. I was lucky enough to see this film in the theater at a classic movie screening. The great thing is that it was my first viewing of this masterpiece. I'd heard a lot about it and over the years it got its massive reputation, but I didn't think it could be this good.<br/><br/>One cannot describe in words how a movie could be so great. A film directed by a 25-year-old doesn't sound like a classic, but Orson Welles was able to change all that. His script is one of the greatest of all time. He had so much creativity that it all oozed out of him and onto the film. His portrayal of Kane is so realistic that you forget you're only watching a 25-year-old. The make-up artists can also take credit for this. <br/><br/>All of the technical achievements are a marvel. This is the first movie to actually use a ceiling, so you know it has to be good. Another unforgettable use of scenery involves a dining room table. Kane and his wife have been growing farther and farther apart. To show this, Welles has a montage of dinners with the table getting longer and making Kane and his wife physically get farther and farther apart. That's just one example of the genius that this film is.<br/><br/>It's too bad that 1941 audiences weren't able to really see this movie. The character of Kane was so close to Hearst that the famous newspaperman caused the film to fail at the box office. Hearst didn't want this movie to be seen. Luckily for us, we now have this film forever and can view it when ever we want. I highly recommend this milestone in film-making history."

"ginxys_got_mail","10","1","4","11 July 2006"," A 20 year old film student on ""Citizen Kane""
","In terms of the narrative as well as the plot arrangement, the genre of this film could be well considered as ""mystery"". This is in reference to the ""hunt"" provided by the utterance of the word ""Rosebud"" by the lead character Charles Foster Kane that gushed forth the investigation of a group of journalists regarding the mystery behind this last word of his. This film is very rich in symbolisms. Some of which are the following: 1)The sled which had the word ""Rosebud"" on it was the symbol of the great fortune that entered his life which he, on the other hand, greatly despised in the end. It also stood for the naivety he lost as a child and the joy that only his real family could've brought him. 2)The crystal ball that had a winter scene inside it which he dropped upon losing his very last breath, on the other hand, was the symbol of the poor yet happy life he was born into. 3)In the scene where he was told that he had lost his position, he was seen descending the spiral staircase. It was a great shot from the top of the stairs that symbolized his life or rather, his career spiraling downward. 4)In the scene where he was finally turning over his empire, he stood by a very tall window. It was shot from a distance accentuating how small Kane is compared to the grand height of the window. I thought it symbolized 2 things: The tall window was his empire getting bigger than ever and him shrinking into this very small individual losing grip of the things he once had. 5)The film opened with a very dark and gloomy Xanadu which after seeing the whole film made me realize that it must have been a symbol of Kane's life at that point- nearing its end and extracted of the beautiful things it once had. 6)Lastly, one of the last few scenes of the film was a gliding shot from the top of his things (mostly in boxes) lined outside Xanadu ready for disposal. At first glance, I thought it was a view of NYC from the top. When I realized it was actually a shot of Kane's things ready for disposal, I thought that maybe it was another symbolism offered by this great film. Perhaps of the great city he thrived and succeeded in now already distant from his reach if not LOST from him already. Orson Welles being the producer, lead actor and director of this film proved to many that such great efforts are duly given great responses. This film, as what many of us might know already, is considered as one of the greatest if not THE greatest film ever made by seasoned movie critics and ordinary moviegoers alike. I, however, have not yet seen that many movies yet for me to make the same conclusion although I did witness for myself the greatness that this film is. The film enthusiast that I am, I am waiting to see more great films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Out of Africa"", ""A Streetcar named Desire"" and many more of these ""great films"" tagged as such by movie critics all over the globe. Only after seeing these other films could I believe it right to finally make the conclusion regarding which is the best and perhaps, which also is the worst (that is, if there actually is one). As of the moment, I could only speak well of ""Citizen Kane"" which I was thankful to have finally seen. Aside from the great mystery and many symbolisms it offers, I second the motion that this film did break new grounds for storytelling in film as it started with the ending, told the story through a series of flashbacks and ended with where it started focusing, in particular, on the ""NO TRESPASSING"" sign on Xanadu's tall gate. I would say that this film requires deep thinking on and perhaps, appreciation of the subtexts and rich symbolisms it has for its viewers. Another merit that should be rightly given to this film are for its achievements in special visual effects- the ""mirror scene"" after Susan Alexander left Kane where the latter stood parallel to a life-sized mirror showcasing a fantastic shot of ""several Kanes"", the ridiculously huge fireplace in the similarly ridiculously huge mansion and the many other eye-pleasuring scenes showcased through exceptional camera shots and angles. All in all, ""Citizen Kane"" is a truly astounding achievement in film-making and a thought-provoking masterpiece in the field of storytelling. It's no wonder why it is considered as one of the best films ever made, if not THE best, in the history of worldwide cinema."
"tomosterbind","10","1","4","1 July 2006"," An in-depth look at Citizen Kane
","Based on the newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, Citizen Kane takes us along a news reporter's quest to discover the mysterious meaning of ""Rosebud,"" Charles Foster Kane's last words, by piecing together important chapters of his life in a series of interviews with the people who ""knew"" the man best. It may not be considered the most universally entertaining film, however Orson Welles's Citizen Kane is among the most interesting and revolutionary works of art of the film genre.<br/><br/>Orson Welles learned the taste of success very early in his career as an actor, writer, and director. Some of his first major successes include modern renditions of Shakespeare's Macbeth and Julius Caesar with the Mercury Theatre. Soon after such box office hits along with the famous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that gained him national notoriety, Welles landed a deal with Hollywood. They were so confident in him that he was offered Carte Blanche to do what ever he wanted with no limitations. Welles seized this opportunity not to make a move for his career but to make a move for the art of film. The end result was Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>One of the central themes of the film is the difficulty of interpreting a life. After viewing a film biography containing bulleted achievements of Charles Foster Kane's life, its producer asks his reporters, ""Who, really, was Charles Foster Kane?"" implying that a man is more than the sum of his achievements, material wealth or even actions. Thus reporter Jerry Thompson, played by actor William Alland, takes on the mission to find meaning in Kane's last words. However, his daunting task leads to another obstacle and central theme to the film: the unreliability of memory. In interviewing those who had been closest to Kane, Thompson finds that he can dig no deeper than biased/blurred perceptions of Kane's actions: one storyteller, Susan Alexander Kane, played by Dorothy Comingore recounts her life with Kane, her late husband, in an alcoholic rant. Another, Jetidiah Leland, a former friend of Kane played by Joseph Cotten, doesn't complete the puzzle either in his senile recollection of his relationship with Kane. Because of this, the image of Kane's life can never quite come into focus and Thompson ultimately fails in his mission.<br/><br/>One of the most notorious devices of Citizen Kane is the innovative cinematographic technique. The use of new camera angles, deep focus, and strategic contrast has a subtle but profound effect on the mood, thematic direction, and overall story. The combination of camera angles in the floor and ceiling along with deep focus allowed Welles to morph size and perspective making the audience very aware or unaware of the characters' size in relationship to others and their surroundings. The fact that they had to build ceilings into sets also added an element of realism. The contrast of light and dark is used to give further emphasis of importance or meaning on specific elements of a scene. One example is the blinding white snow against the dark, sullen young Kane right before he is taken away from his home. Another is the frequent radiance of Kane emphasizing his grandeur next to the inferior reporters who are cast into shadows.<br/><br/>Welles had been at first reluctant to enter the film-making business because of the little respect it received from the art community. But after Citizen Kane, he had single-handedly transformed the industry and revealed the true artistic potential of film. This coupled with its multidimensional layers of innovations in technology, acting, and story structure constitutes Citizen Kane's place at the top of almost all movie critics' list of film masterpieces."
"LordBlacklist","10","1","4","31 May 2006"," That which is required
","Power, control, conspiracy, manipulation, method acting, madness, malevolence, domination, dictators, and directors. We all at one point crave power, and some are lucky enough to get it. Inevitably that power will be abused as history teaches obsessed men no lessons, but on occasion great things can come from the obsessed mind. Orson Welles is such a character. His drive and determination to conquer every medium from radio to theater to film yielded one of the most superbly crafted films in history in Citizen Kane. The opening scene with the abundance of fences telling the audience that they are about to tread where few have gone before. Showing a man who has seemingly all the power in the universe only to be left in the end wishing for the simple life that could never be. Welles used every trick visually and narratively to get his points across and it shows to a somewhat heavy-handed ""I'm going to beat you over the head with my brilliance"" extent, but none the less gets the job done. Charles Foster Kane cannot simply be a larger than life character, he must really be larger than life as nearly every scene featuring him is shot in low angles and he always appears to be towering over everyone else. One must wonder if he was standing on a soapbox half the time. Citizen Kane is a film that tries to be many things at once; a serious drama, a hilarious comedy, a vicious satire, and it succeeds brilliantly. Just like Welles knew that war of the worlds would cause a panic he knew that Citizen Kane would cause controversy.....bravo. William Randolf Hearst was the most powerful man at the time, and what better way to get your foot in the door of the entertainment empire than to attack him. Hearst made a living out of destroying lives and for all intents and purposes he deserved to be ruined. Though Kane is loosely based on Hearst he seems to have more in common with Welles in the years of isolation and loneliness that awaited him in his latter days. Kane is a man who has this abundance of power and is obsessed with acquisition, but for what? In the end Kane has all this material wealth but he really has nothing; no friends, no family, living in exile without the warmth of human comfort. Citizen Kane is a portrait of self inflicted sorrow, and as shown in The Battle Over Citizen Kane, its director is as well."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","1","4","20 May 2006"," Orson Welles masterpiece; a cinematic gem
","The title alone speaks for itself. Almost every movie fan will have heard of Citizen Kane as being the greatest movie made. When one movie is best of its genre, it's sometimes referred to as 'the Citizen Kane of musicals or horror' or whatever you like. I saw this finally after waiting for so long. I wasn't let down.<br/><br/>The story is about Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), who when he dies, utters a single word ""Rosebud."" Soon after, a bunch of reporters interview Kane's closest friends and work colleagues to try and find out what the word means. Kane's life unfolds in a series of flashback's as we draw closer to what ""Rosebud"" really is.<br/><br/>There probably isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said hundreds of times. This is a GREAT movie. Not my favourite of all time, but it is I'm my Top 10. I can see why this is hailed as best picture, it is truly an achievement, all the more that it was made in 1941 and it Welles' was only in his early 20's.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' performance is absolutely flawless, his portrayal of Kane is perfect. The supporting cast is also fine, considering their careers were just starting. The use of lighting is done perfectly and the musical score, done by Bernard Herrmann, is perfectly suited. Even though the plot runs through a set of flashbacks, not once is the story too confusing or complex.<br/><br/>The movie runs for quite a while and may seem to drag in one or two places, but that shouldn't be a deterrent because ultimately, the movie pays off. This is a highly recommended movie for fans of cinema.<br/><br/>5/5."

I don't want to get political in a review but the people who own the show and make the movies (Including the Directors) reap huge benefits from a dumb-downed population. This is a movie which defied this fascism, but it still doesn't reach a standard I would want to expect cinema to aspire to.<br/><br/>However, it was an influence on other films, it has several excellent scenes that impress you and Orson Wells is an excellent actor. I was touched in several scenes and no doubt Orson Wells can be an exceedingly brilliant movie-maker.

","When watching a film, the average viewer comes to expect a few things. They expect a beginning, a middle, and an end. They expect building drama and a climax. In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.<br/><br/>Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema. In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them. Most of the critics and the general audience ""didn't get it"", so to speak. That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the ""outrageous"" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.<br/><br/>Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't. Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now. Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.<br/><br/>Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect. The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with ""No Trespassing"". One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end. It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal. Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters... and then what is the audience supposed to do with it? Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach. This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated.

","The greatest film ever, I think Citizen Kane should rank in #1 in the IMDb 250 top films ,it's very sad that people nowadays don't understand the way this film changed the world of movie making in all issues. The photography is wonderful and superior to any movie made, going ahead over 40 or 50 years ahead of it's time, by the way,in mostly all the movie,every element displayed in screen is in deep focus. According to Orson Welles,this gives the possibility and freedom to the viewer to see what he wants and not what the director dictates. The special effects are perfect,of course we're not going to see big explosions or computer made effects because in 1940 this wasn't possible, so every special effect was made by photography techniques, editing or hand made. Citizen Kane is also a display of master acting performances,and a controversial script based on the life of newspaper authority and millionaire William Randolph Hearst, reason which almost shot down the film for the audiences forever."
"jaymibh","10","1","4","1 July 2005"," The Best Movie Ever...
","A movie that shows all the greed, vanity, pain and suffering required to attain the American dream. Kane wanted power and money so bad, that he was willing to end up a lonely bitter man because of it (reality may have dictated fiction in the case of Wells and his later dealings). The drama is amazing. The story is original. He used effects never seen before, like the boardroom scene, and the Eicher-like snow globe scene in the beginning. Not only is it a hallmark of a film, Orsen Wells wrote it when he was only 25 years old. Can you remember what you were doing at 25? Anyone who rates this movie less that a ""10"" should not be rating this movie."
"JoeysGirl4Ever","Null","1","4","17 November 2003"," pretty good but not great
","`Typical rich guy'. that's what comes to mind when watching this movie. The plot line is simple and predictable that acting is good but not spectacular.  (But then again what makes an actor spectacular?)  These are things that this reviewer thinks made the movie not such a hit at its first release.  However, the artistic value along with some of the `scandal' involved in Citizen Kane is what made it a classic years later. Citizen Kane is a story of a man's life from childhood to death.  His story is told through the flashbacks and memories of the people who knew him. The movie starts with showing him on his deathbed when he utters the word `Rosebud' and then the announcements of his death hit the newspapers. When a group of men are reviewing a newsreel that they want to put into action they realize they want some meat to the story and that's when the search begins to find out what `Rosebud' means.  The men obviously can't ask Kane so they travel around doing interviews and trying to put the puzzle pieces together.  This plot idea is a great way to put the story together but can sometimes become confusing with the many different characters that come in and out during different flashbacks.  All in all this story is very interesting when you want to devote the time to try to fully understand the character of Kane through the flashbacks of others. As before stated: the acting is not spectacular, there are moments of stiffness and unrealistic acting like when Kane is trashing one of the rooms in his mansion because his wife left him.  However kudos must be given to Orson Welles who not only starred in, but also produced and directed this movie, then on top of that is was such an artistic film as well. Citizen Kane was the first movie of its kind.  Many innovative camera angles were used, such as placing the camera on the floor, and also lighting and placement of people were big parts of the artistic and value of this film.  At times the lighting tricks are less effective because an actor will be talking and all the viewer can see is their outline and the actor's face is completely in darkness.  This can have a distracting effect on the viewer since it's not very often that people talk to each other in complete darkness. Citizen Kane was speculated by some as to have been tracing the life of real life yellow journalist, William Randolph Hearst; who also coincidently experienced some of the many things that Kane did.  Years later this has attracted the attention of many people when the stories of how Hearst was willing to buy all copies of the movie that were made in order to prevent them from being released. Citizen Kane is a great artistic film and certainly the greatest black-and-white film this reviewer has seen.  Worthy of being #9 on IMDB's top 250?  I'm still not sure."
"eyeluvhotboyz","8","1","4","17 November 2003"," Fantastic
","`Citizen Kane' is ranked one of the best movies of all time, and with good reason.  Between the lighting effects, the great talent, and the symbolism, every person could be happy watching this movie.<br/><br/>The symbolism that is shown in this movie is truly remarkable.  In the beginning scene, there are at least three examples of symbolism.  First, there is a `No Trespassing' sign.  This shows that Kane did not like people entering his private life.  Next, there is an iron `K' on the gate. This, along with the fact that his house is built on a man-made mountain, shows that he wants to be more powerful and `set above' everyone else.<br/><br/>The talent selected for this movie only added to its greatness.  Orson Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a politician, and owner of the newspaper The Inquirer.  Throughout the movie, Orson Welles shows the emotion of every situation.  One example of this is when it shows Kane as a child.  When he finds out that he is being taken away he pushes the man over with his sled.<br/><br/>The lighting in this movie is absolutely fantastic.  Because `Citizen Kane' is in black and white, the lighting plays a very important role.  One scene that was particularly effective was when Charles and Mrs. Kane go to talk to Mr. Gettys.  When they are having the meeting, you cannot see Gettys' face, only his body.  This is effective because it puts a `revenge' feel to the conversation.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is suitable for most viewers.  It includes every aspect that makes up a good movie.  Good talent, great special effects, and fantastic symbolism, just to name a few."

I was very impressed by the mystery and trying to guess what Rosebud was. It was very good, but I didn't understand why his last words would be Rosebud...(SPOILER AHEAD)<br/><br/>which was his sled. But it was very good and it should've won Best Picture. ***1/2 out of 4"
"smarlin","Null","1","4","30 May 2003"," great, but not the greatest
","As great as this film is, it has one glaring plot hole: why would Kane squander his political fortune and public standing on someone like Susan Alexander? After all, this is no Clinton-Monica relationship; once it's discovered, Kane doesn't deny it or try to hush it up. Instead, he openly brandishes it against his enemies, both real and perceived. The film attributes this to his megalomania, but doesn't explain why a man so craving of public affection would throw it all away on a mistress.<br/><br/>I rank ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" as the greatest film in history. And for what it's worth, I feel that the greatest portrayal of a character was Alastair Sims' Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol."""
"Steve-267","Null","1","4","10 April 2003"," A great film, but not the greatest.
","SPOILER I finally got to watch this film and found it quite interesting. To sum it up, a famous, extremely rich Charles Foster Kane dies in his castle home; his last spoken word `Rosebud' - a snow-shaker glass ball falls from his now lifeless hand, shattering on the floor.<br/><br/>A news media company producing a 1941 newsreel on his life wants to find out what `Rosebud' refers to, so it assigns a reporter to find out by interviewing significant people in the man's life. Flashbacks in the man's life show a happy young boy (in a humble 1871 setting) playing in the snow who gets basically sold off by his mother for an enormous amount of money (for mineral rights to a gold mine) to an aristocratic guardian, is raised by that guardian, gets access to the money, buys a some-what stagnant newspaper against the guardians wishes, becomes overbearing to others in his pursuit of personal indulgences and pursuits, supposedly starts a war (not shown in the film), cheats on his wife for a floozy with a toothache, runs for Governor, makes enemies with a local city boss, the city boss blackmails him regarding the affair with the floozy costing him the Governor's election, gets divorced and marries the floozy, makes the floozy sing opera and builds her an opera house (even though it's obvious she can't and doesn't want to sing), makes more enemies, builds an exorbitant castle for the floozy, the floozy can't take it anymore and divorces him (significantly, she states that this is the only thing in his adult life that he didn't make the decision on), trashes the floozy's room after she leaves - picks up the snow-shaker glass ball and says `Rosebud', becomes a recluse, then dies a lonely old man longing for ""Rosebud"". The reporter never finds out what `Rosebud' means. The final scene shows workers burning most of the things that Citizen Kane saved in his lifetime. A snow sled is thrown into the fire as waste, symbolizing what this man did with his life and available resources. As it turns out, `Rosebud' is the brand name of the sled he played on as a boy, and his reference to it is the only happy time in his life, which was simplistic and fun.<br/><br/>A good film, rather dark, but worth seeing. A great performance by Orson Wells. He was quite young at the time and performed the movements and mannerisms of a middle aged and elderly man to perfection. Another good note is that this picture is the first time radio performers of the likes of Joseph Cotton and Agnes Morehead were first seen by the American movie audience. 8 out of 10."
"AaronBilawchuk","8","1","4","13 March 2003"," Well done, but not #1
","About six years ago, I came across a list put out by the American Film Institute.  It was the top 100 movies of all time, and I made it my personal goal over my lifetime to watch every movie on that list.  Every now and again I watch one of the movies on the list, and check it off my yellowed piece of newsprint.<br/><br/>I got to see quite a number of those movies, and the list was beginning to fill with red checkmarks.  But there was one odd point.  I had never seen movie number 1.  The top rated movie of all time by the AFI.  I had never seen Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Now I finally have a red checkmark next to number one.  What's my take? It's an enjoyable movie, well done and well presented.  As a movie by today's standards, it's simply a good film.  The best movie of all time? Not even close.  Revolutionary, influential, and important - yes.  The aura that surrounds this movie, the scandal and the social commentary give this film its credibility.  The style of the filmmaking is ahead of its time, and its presentation influenced countless productions after it.  Even though I had never seen the movie, I knew what 'Rosebud' was by the time I was seven years old.<br/><br/>It's not the story that puts this movie in the number one spot; it's the aura and influence that surround this movie.  And I have to give credit where credit is due - Citizen Kane may not be the best film ever, but so far I believe it may be the most important."

The whole film sets itself up and scrounges on for about two hours only to lead up to one shot.

That's what is genius in this movie and makes it a true work of art. However, as good as ""Citizen Kane"" may be, I believe it is one of the movies that is too unknown to people but is too over-rated by those who do know it.  Don't get me wrong, it's really great.  But to be as good as ""The godfather"".  No way.  I don't think it should get all that credit for having been the first AFI movie.  It shouldn't have been.  But the screenplay and the performances are so great that it does deserve its spot way up there. Maybe not first but easily in the top 10."
"Kuntos_the_Destroyer","8","1","4","1 April 2002"," Greatest Movie Ever?
","Most of the IMDb-comments singularly focus on whether or not this film is the Greatest Movie Ever Made. To me, the question is completely irrelevant. I feel you can't appreciate movies without somehow connecting them to your own system of experiences and resulting convictions. Since everyone has different experiences (that goes for the movie viewing experiences as well) we all connect differently to different films. I believe it's impossible to look at a film from an objective perspective external to yourself. Even if you could scale the variables there's no objective way of saying this film has the Best Script, the Best Acting or Directing or whatever. What such judgements frequently represent is some form of idea that objectiveness is attainable. What they really mean is hard to determine. Does this film with its story of a man having every physical possession anyone could ever want, but not that which he truly desires, (still) strike a chord with that many people? Or is it a self-fulfilling prophecy in that when people watch the film known as The Greatest Ever, they will see exactly that?<br/><br/>Maybe it's a little bit of both, but a definite and undeniable important factor is how it revolutionized moviemaking. We can in the least and objectively say Orson Welles' debut did that. Everything from its non-linear story structure to its visual ambitions were extremely novel at the time (especially in American cinema), far more so than what we're used to hailing as 'revolutionay' moviemaking nowadays. Cameras that seem more mobile than ever before, extraordinary use of Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography, brilliant make-up and innovative editing (the shot fading into a newspaper picture) are some examples of the film's technical inventiveness.<br/><br/>The inventiveness employed in writing Citizen Kane is slightly less impressive if you look at the film retrospectively, as it did not revolutionize moviemaking as much as the film's techniques did. However, the script still stands tall above most others. It paints the life of Charles Foster Kane post-mortem, as a collection of visually-represented memories of him related to an investigating reporter by the people who 'knew' Kane best. In this manner, the movie builds brick upon brick of an idea of who Charles Foster Kane was, but only in our heads. The film continually shows him not from his own perspective but from that of others. This does not necessarily lead to contemplating in how far there still is an 'real' Kane, and in how far he is just the product of the people's subjective memories. But it does lead to starkly contrasting perspectives of the man. A foolish arrogant businessman, a ruthless megalomaniacal man uncapable of love or a enthusiastic young man brought down by his own success? The character of Kane is all and neither and only in our minds do the differing views of him coalesce to an idea of the complete man. Important for forming this idea is the grounding of the story in the newsreel which starts the film. It serves as a media perspective on the man, a perspective created by media he himself helped to create. It's completely over the top with its narration and totally believable as an actual newsreel, and here it serves as a skeleton.<br/><br/>Central to the story is its plot of a faceless reporter trying to find the meaning behind Kane's final spoken word 'Rosebud'. When we find out what it means we don't. We find out what if refers too, but are we ever told why is it exactly this word he chose to use as his last one? No, because we're meant to fill it in ourselves. In my mind it refers to the only time in his life where he had but did not consciously acknowledge the one thing he really wanted, namely love. The rest of his life he pursues it but finds he himself has none to give. What he has to give is money, charisma, talent and more money, but as a man he's as emotionally bankrupt as he could be. Therefore he never receives any and dies a bitter man. The most important question this always raises to me is why did Kane have no love to give? For me, the answer lies, at least in part, in the ridiculous ammount of assets entrusted to the man. Kane is a man who, from a certain (early) point in his life was trained to be of of the leading men in the world's economy. But also a man who was given the resources to indulge in anything he might want to do. A product of and for the industrial age if there ever was one. 'Regular' people growing up in 'regular' environments have to develop a capacity for loving other ones, independent of whether or not the are known to them. Kane never has to develop this capacity. To put it in his words:""If I wouldn't have had so much money, I would've been a great man. Under the circumstances I think I did pretty well.""<br/><br/>A term like Greatest Film Ever may sound like nonsense to me, but that doesn't mean I have no opinion. There's no doubting Citizen Kane's importance in the history of cinema and there's no doubting how intricate this film is in presenting a picture of a man (who, of course, was to great extent William Randolph Hurst - Orson Welles even uses dialogue that quotes the man!). I enjoyed it tremendously, also not in the least due to the expert performances by Joseph Cotton and Welles himself. And I feel it's techniques are dynamic enough to stand up to most of today's efforts. It did never connect to me in a way that made me think it's the undisputed masterpiece people say it is. Indeed, it found it emotionally too distant at times. For me, not The Greatest Film, not My Favourite Film (something I do believe in), just a really good one.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"
"MovieAlien","Null","1","4","26 March 2002"," The dark side of the American dream
","Citizen Kane is truly an excellent film. Before you mistake this review for another empty ""This is a classic, see it, best movie ever made"" rundown I advise anyone who hasn't seen ""Citizen Kane"" yet to read on, because I'll be very informative about what makes this a fantastic movie.<br/><br/> You see, people who write vague reviews are only supplementing their true opinion with what they are egged on to believe by other people. ""The Godfather"" is a prime example of that, as every positive IMDb user review with the exception of two or three comprehends what they really thought of the film. The rest is simply rambling from twits who were either enamored with the hype or simply excited by those Italian accents and sadistic violence. (As you will see, I do not recommend ""The Godfather."" see my review. Although I feel exactly the opposite about ""Citizen Kane"", I'm sure it has (and will continue to have) the same amount of vague comments.)<br/><br/> I saw ""Citizen Kane"" on the impetus of its tagline as a landmark film and that Orson Welles' directed it. I did not know it was on the IMDb Top 10 or how many awards it won.<br/><br/> Citizen Kane is an early examination of the American goal of industry. Charles Foster Kane starts out as a not so successful child, nurtured by connections and networking into one the richest publishers ever to walk the face of the earth. Loosely based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, who faced a similar not so glamourous remainder of his life, but unlike Kane he was a Nazi and an anti-Communist. As an actor Orson Welles is a chameleon and extremely unforgettable in the role of one man who had everything but one thing money can't buy.<br/><br/> I advise you to watch Citizen Kane if you have not seen it already and to keep in mind that it was made in a totally different time period in America. Every decade (and century), a one of a kind movie will be released, and while I can't say Citizen Kane is the best movie ever made, it deserves Top 5 recognition as one of the best films of the 20th century."

","Apparently (since I have not read any..) texts on film universally proclaim this as a masterpiece of technique, an exceptionally daring indictment of Hearst whose suppression of the film has undoubtedly added to its strange mystique. However, what was innovative quickly becomes routine and dated. What was once (overly) clever caricature eventually becomes as unintelligible and irrelevant as Shakespeare's puns. The glaring weakness in Citizen Kane that sets it apart from the handful of films that claim to be great is that it lacks a strong timeless theme. People can still relate to the eternal triangle in Casablanca, or the dutiful nobility of the seven samurai or even the pluckiness of Scarlett O'Hara. In contrast, Kane is neither a great nor likable character. His problems are too distant and portrayed too distantly, to be of much care to the common man. Hence, now that the gaudy trappings have faded, there is no heart and soul to resonate with modern audiences. <br/><br/>To me the film is like the Mona Lisa. Crowds throng around it and gaze admiringly, listening to the commentary on their porta-guides which explain the wondrous techniques employed. Not that it isn't good, but I somehow think that those crowds wouldn't be there, were it not for its reputation and if they were to answer honestly, most would admit that they couldn't see what all the fuss was about..."

To add to that, I found that the acting really wasn't as outstanding as I had heard it would be. Many great things have been said about this film, and most of them are right.

","Citizen Kane is based around the meaning of a single word ""rosebud"".Ther is a debate to this day about the consequence of that word.Charles Foster Kane utters the word rosebud on his deathbed.He is a newspaper tycoon who's life story is one of rags to riches and back to rags again.He builds a palace by the name Xanadu .He acquires great wealth and power and then loses it . Kane's carefree childhood is interrupted when a lawyer takes him away from his parents to his new adopted family with a lot of money.From their he begins his journey with a small time newspaper and becomes a rich and powerful man.<br/><br/>After Charles Foster Kane's death a group of journalists decide to find out the meaning of his last word Rosebud.They are shown to be unsuccessful in their quest.<br/><br/>Rosebud is written at the back of Kane's childhood sled.This could imply that Rosebud was Kane himself as usually people write their own name behind their childhood possessions.Rosebud has a deeper implication as Kane was taken away from his parents and thus his childhood was nipped in the bud.As once a rosebud is uprooted it can never grow into a rose.One journalist says that you can tell a lot about a person by his last words.Maybe Rosebud was an expression of the fact that Kane felt like despite achieving a lot he still was a rosebud and could not become an individual."

""Citizen Kane"" is not a bad film, but it is not a great film; it lacks an inspiring story and, for the most part, is quite monotonous. I have no intention of viewing it again. As far as Welles and Film Noir is concerned, ""Touch of Evil"" was a much better film. I give ""Citizen Kane"" 6 out of 10."
"AJ-33","9","1","5","17 January 1999"," I don't see what's so special
","The first time I saw Citizen Kane must have been a little more than a year ago.  I, a devoted film lover, took it upon myself to see the ""Greatest Film of All Time"" just so I could really consider myself an expert.  Of course, I didn't agree with the gazillions of critics and film buffs on the quality of the film after my first viewing.  But, I was positive that I had missed something, and that I would have to see it again to appreciate its excellence.  So first, I took a few months to catch up to classic film history.  (I must have seen a third of the films on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films List since the program aired last spring.)  And, I honestly appreciated most of the old films that I saw, e.g It's a Wonderful Life, Psycho, High Noon, and the modern masterpieces that are already some of my favorites, e.g. Pulp Fiction, Fargo, Forrest Gump, Schindler's List.<br/><br/>So, after I felt I had learned something about classic cinema, I had a second viewing of Citizen Kane---and I had the same feeling about the film. Good writing, good camerawork, good expression of moods, but, the film has no juice.  It takes us on this journey with Charles Kane. It manipulates us so we know some things about him, and then we don't, and we hate him, and then we like him, but the biggest problem is we don't understand him.  We don't feel with him. How can a film's protaganist be someone who is not understood by the viewer? It just doesn't work.  The protaganist in a movie should be someone who we feel with, laugh with, and cry with-as in Rocky. In the end, Citizen Kane tries to move us with the story of a boy who gets estranged from his family, a man whose dreams were crushed by fate, and in the much talked-about ending, a man whose childhood ended abruptly with his sled.  Citizen Kane, although great in its own right, is not a masterpiece, and Orson Welles would have done a better job if he had portrayed Charles Foster Kane the way that Francis Ford Coppola portrayed Michael Corleone-a truly tragic figure."

","I had heard so much about the movie, all the praises and hymns, and was so bored when I actually saw it. I think there has been a hype about this movie which lacked any reasonable ground.(Not new in Hollywood! Think of ""Shakespeare in Love""...). Orson Welles did a good job directing, but the story is not appalling at all! The character of Kane is not heroic, not tragic enough, heÂ´s not villain enough either. I think his life was not even really interesting. And some of the actors were horrible, e.g. his second wife. When the movie ended, I thought: ""What now is the point of that movie?!?"""

","I normally enjoy older movies, especially those from the 1940s, but after finishing Citizen Kane, I couldn't remotely understand why it is praised so much. It has to be without a doubt the most overrated movie I have ever seen. It seemed to me that it was well-filmed, maybe even exceptionally filmed for its time, but the story itself is just a drag. There's none of the drama, suspense, wit, mystery, or humor in Citizen Kane that made so many superior movies the classics that they are. It's just incredibly lacking in so many ways. The payoff is skillfully done, but it doesn't excuse the rest of the movie because there was never any reason to care about the protagonist. Kane is supposed to be some kind of tragic character but he's unsympathetic, he's neurotic, he's depressing,and worst of all he's dead. It's baffling that this is considered a great movie."
"jboothmillard","8","1","6","11 December 2009"," Citizen Kane
","This is acclaimed by critics and film-makers everywhere as the greatest film ever made, topping many polls and lists, so naturally I had to see this essential classic from Oscar nominated director Orson Welles. Basically one of the richest and most powerful in America, if not the world, Charles Foster Kane (Oscar nominated Orson Welles) has died in his mansion Xanadu, uttering his last word ""Rosebud"" (number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes). Reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is trying to find out what Kane was referring to when he said this last word, so he goes to all the people who knew the multimillionaire newspaper tycoon. Through many flashbacks we see Kane marry the niece of the Presidential candidate, buy many big city newspapers and grow to assume power in many other business fields, to the point where he loses soul. In the end Thompson never finds out what Rosebud was and the reason Kane said before dying, but we see what it was when all his stuff is being burned, it turns out to be his prized childhood sled. Also starring The Third Man's Joseph Cotten as Jedediah Leland, Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander Kane, Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother Mary, Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane, Ray Collins as James W. Gettys, Erskine Sanford as Herbert Carter, Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Paul Stewart as Head Butler Raymond, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, Fortunio Bonanova as Signor Matiste, Gus Schilling as Head Waiter John, Philip Van Zandt as Mr. Rawlston, Georgia Backus as Bertha Anderson and Harry Shannon as Kane's Father. I was impressed with Welles' acting and directing skills, the then experimental camera angles and movements that have become staples, and it is a story with some great moments to keep you hooked. So while I can't see fully why it is excellent and most recommended film, it is certainly one I would recommend, and it deserves to be in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Bernard Herrmann, Best Sound and Best Picture. Orson Welles was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 45 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Movies (twice). Very good!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","6","2 December 2008"," Better Than Its Reputation
","Citizen Kane (1941) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The rise and fall of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is told through the eyes of his second wife (Dorothy Comingore) and a friend (Joseph Cotten) as a reporter tries to find the meaning of his final word ""rosebud"". I think it's impossible for anyone to walk into this movie without knowing its reputation as being the greatest film ever made. Do I think it's the greatest? That's hard to say as it probably wouldn't get my vote but at the same time I wouldn't argue with anyone who called it the greatest. In fact, as I watched the film again I noticed that every single shot in the film is so grand and beautiful that I too might in fact call it the greatest. If not the greatest then perhaps the grandest film ever made as everything from the acting to the direction just stands out as something truly incredible. Everyone reading this will already know all the historic achievements this film reached in 1941 so there's no point in going over them. The visual style Welles brought to the film certainly makes it the greatest looking of any classic film. The editing from future director Robert Wise also stands out in its excellence From the visual viewpoint there are so many great moments but I'd have to say my favorite is the political rally, which just amazes my eyes no matter how many times I see it. Another great thing about this film, and one I don't think gets talked about enough, is the opening newsreel and how this was such a brilliant idea to get the viewer interested in what was to come. The newsreel was so well done that the viewer immediately gets drawn into the film and then we get to see that story filled in with the feature itself. The screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles is also one of the greatest ever written due to how it actually tells the story at hand. The amount of time the film covers is also a rather nice achievement by the duo screenwriters. Some people think that new viewers might be hurt by walking into this film knowing its large reputation but I'd somewhat disagree as I think the movie is so beautiful that it would be hard for people not to see its importance."

","I remember when I was a kid and I really started to get interested in movies. Fifteen years ago I wanted to see as much film as I possibly could, and I still watch 1-4 movies a day. To watch a movie is for me to disconnect everything that's on your mind and walk into another world.<br/><br/>My favorite film was The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. (It still is top 5 for me.) Since I was so young, I had problems watching Black&White movies. I didn't like dramas, thought they were boring. I asked my dad; ""Which movie is the greatest ever?"" He responded; ""Citizen Kane is considered to be the best."" We watched it the same evening. I think i fell asleep for a while. It was Black&White, it was boring. It didn't seem to go anywhere. I never got the point of it. OK so it was a sled, big deal? Now fifteen years later I have grown a bit. I love Black&White movies and have no problems watching dramas. Yet when I try to watch Citizen Kane I realize that it doesn't matter how much I have grown. I simply can not understand why people like it.<br/><br/>I can not describe my feelings for this film, but I can try... I would rather watch paint drying on a wall than watch this movie. It makes me nauseous.<br/><br/>My recommendation to you is to pass on this movie, unless you want to go to sleep or need to vomit. Watch ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""One Flew over The Cuckoo's Nest"" instead. You will thank me."

","I agree mostly on what you are saying, the story in Citizen Kane was very weak, but the Cinematography was about 30 years ahead of its time. That is an amazing jump for anything. Orson Welles directed this movie wonderfully, but lacked in the writing area. Even though Citizen Kane was based on an actual person who's name escapes me, it still could have been much more interesting. Even being one of the most revolutionary movies in Cinematography ever made, I don't see what the big hype over it is. It had the most boring storyline I've ever seen.

","I watched this movie before reading any reviews for it, as I do with any movie I absolutely plan to see. To be honest I didn't see any way it could possibly live up to its extremely lofty billing as the greatest movie of all time. But with such widespread sentiment saying otherwise, I figured at the very least it wouldn't be awful. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Yes, I do have some appreciation for the films technical merits for its time and what have you, but those alone never carry a movie. Anyone who claims that the acting is superb must themselves work for the New York Inquirer. I mean the performances are so devoid of any real humanity, it's as if some human emotions were entirely taboo. I was never led to feel for any of the characters, as we never learn much about they're motivations or convictions. At times I was bored to tears. This is a prehistoric relic that does little to entertain, and while it certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, I'd have a hard time recommending it to anybody but the most hardcore of movie watchers. My only advice for those who claim that this is even one of the greatest movies ever is quite simple, SEE MORE MOVIES!!!"

","Citizen Kane was way beyond its time. Watching it you get the sense that you are really viewing a film made in today's time but in black and white. In it's time, it was viewed as an outrageous film and even ignored by critics. Orsin Welles himself probably never imagined the film would become such a huge influence on today's cinematography.the way movies are made period. Even in the process of making it, he didn't think it would succeed at all.<br/><br/>The stars out with a sign reading, `no trespassing' on a large iron gate outside of a castle looking estate, as the camera draws closer and closer to the castle a light is seen in a window. It burns out and a hand seen dropping a snow globe while a man utters `rosebud.' It turns out the gloomy scene was set inside the snow globe. Charles Foster Kane's who is played by Orsin Welles is narrated in a short film made by a couple of newspaper reporters. As funny as it seems, the movie starts out at the end and goes back in time, breaking out of the traditional film storyline. The newspaper reporters set out on a mission to out the hidden meaning of Rosebud, and in the process of researching this by interviewing key people in Kane's life. The story is told in many different perspectives of his life giving the viewer's brain a little work in the process. The film follows Kane's life from his start at the New York Inquirer to Kane running for governor to the building of Xanadu, which eventually leads to his own demise brought upon himself.<br/><br/>Overall the film was absolutely amazing for its time. The excellent camera angles, lighting and special effects were way beyond its time. Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the most important movies in U.S history, basically setting the stage for Hollywood, as we know it today.<br/><br/>Orsin Welles (Charles Foster Kane) gives a wonderful performance accompanied by Ruth Warrick as Emily Monroe Norton Kane, George Coulouris as Walter Thatcher, and Everett Sloane as Mr. Berstein. The acting was fantastic; the chemistry was good and their performances all complimented each other.<br/><br/> I give the movie 7.5 stars out of 10 because it is not the best movie I have ever seen but it impressed me. It blew me away at the time and work and overall creativity put into this movie. Orsin Welles is a genius in my eyes for making this movie. He had no major influences, nothing to look off of or copy to make the movie the way he did. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who truly enjoys and appreciates great cinematography, directing, and just a good film."

I had to watch it as a mockumentary in order to justify my time.  I can see where some film makers have gotten ideas from over the decades.  Watch dear viewer for these little nuances. Kane reminds me of Dr. Frasier Crane's character in Frasier.<br/><br/>Some interesting effects achieved, especially the scene when Susan Alexander Kane progressively rises to fame.  The only thing that I would change is that all copies of the film should lose that stupid white bird that appears for a split-second as it adds confusion.<br/><br/>The story itself is enlightening in that it is before modern day Solomons. People who are globalising and conquering via private enterprise.  Kane is a bit like an American Hitler.  When you control the media, you control people's minds; you control the world, frightening, when I think of it. Another symbol is what happens to Susan Alexander Kane as a man-made star of that time. These themes are all typical of the things we are facing in our world today.<br/><br/>The overall lesson that I took from the film is to recognise the detachments of your youth and not live your life from the consequences of those detachments."

","I saw Citizen Kane at the Arts' Cinema here at Cambridge the other day, and I cannot see why people rave about it. Quite honestly, I don't even think it is a particularly great film, let alone ""The Greatest Film of All Time"". There are a few redeeming features of course (as you'd expect from Orson Welles) such as Welles' acting in some (not all) of the scenes, some excellent shots from the ground when Kane has just lost his campaign and his friend is drunk and they're talking for the last time in a long while. These few redeeming features hardly make up for the fact that it is poorly conceived and poorly executed. Most of the acting is fair to middle whilst some of it is downright bad, the plot could have been quite interesting; the downfall of Kane from idealistic youth to power crazy old man. However it is stretched well beyond its limits, each scene being told as many as 3 times. Some might retort that telling the scene 3 times is good (I've heard people mention the fragmented story, but just look at Pulp Fiction which does a considerably better job of this), but really it is nothing special and has been done much better by other films such as ""Rashomon"" by Akira Kurosawa where the story is retold by each of the participants each time significantly differently. And to top it all, the whole business of ""Rosebud"" is disappointing. Having an interesting twist at the end of a film is a good thing in general, but in Citizen Kane it is rather a pathetic twist. So the reporter says ""I don't think one word could ever explain a man's life"" and the word does in fact explain his life. Great. ONE good feature of this film, possibly enough for a short film, but not more. Okay, in a historical context, maybe that was something new and amazing at the time, but now it is old hat. Films like ""The Usual Suspects"" put it to shame, and if Citizen Kane is supposed to be the ""Best Film of All Time"", it can't by definition be taken in a historical context. A Touch of Evil is an infinitely superior film on every account and also by Orson Welles, and in my opinion a far better contender for the title of ""Best Film of All Time"" than Citizen Kane. If anyone can come up with some genuine reasons why this film is the best of all time, or even very good by modern standards, then please mail me, I'd love to know them, but if it is only good from a historical context, then fine, very interesting, and it's time to move on now."

Having read a rather decent, thick bio on the man this past winter, I can tell ya, there was much more to him than just a cold distant mother, being spoiled, and buying up half of the European artworks available. He was a combo of Murdoch, Trump and Willie Wonka, if you think about it. Plus Marion Davies was Not a singer, but an actress who actually had a fairly decent star run in the 20's on screen. She did wind up a drunk etc but c'mon.....<br/><br/>This film is done w/ tons of conviction, style, very impressive to look at. I'm not so impressed w/ the overall effect though--I didn't care that much about Kane, I didn't quite see what made him into such a 'Monster', as compared to, say, Harry Cohn, for example, nor am I sure that all of really adds up to much.<br/><br/>I put this up there w/ other movies like Annie Hall, the Gold Rush and Vertigo. It's a very well made movie, it is more than worthy of having in your DVD collection and reading about; but it's also frankly guilty of being a Sacred Cow for critics and writers too.

","Starting with perhaps the greatest opening images of all time, it doesn't take long, less that thirty minutes to plunge into some always flashy and really dull stuff for over an hour. But that was Welles for you: ayycee deeceeing his way from moment to moment through some of the most brilliant and boring stuff a great film maker could conjure up, his soon to be likewise guy Fellini another. But I guess they couldn't help themselves. Only near the end, say the last thirty, thirty five minutes does the film start to revive itself, and become truly great again.<br/><br/>One thing that the other reviewers have left out here: turn the sound off and you lose half the brilliance of this film. Kane has one of the great opening and closing themes by Bernard Herrman. Without that score it would lose much of its seductive power. <br/><br/>So an absolute ten for the first thirty, thirty five minutes: four or five at best until the final thirty minutes, then back to ten again.

","Oscar winning Writer/Director/Actor/Producer Orson Wells gives one of the best American films ever made (AFI thought it was number one, but I'm not quite sure on that) as the title giving enough meaning as it is.  Wells tells the story of fictional (yet based from) newspaper owner and politician Charles Foster Kane (also played by Wells) who is remembered in life as in death.  Quite a complicated film (or maybe just too dark) for many people, but for me it is just right for the drama presented.  Brilliant, but (unfortunately) over-hyped to be the greatest film ever while being a great achievement despite.  Only Oscar went to original screenplay (out of 9) for Wells and co-writer Herman J.

"krational66","5","0","2","22 April 2020"," Break through
","The whole story began with ""rosebud,"" Kane's last words before he died. Reporter Thompson uncovers Kane's life by interviewing people who can explain ""rosebud."" At the end of citizen Kane, when the sled with the words ""rosebud"" burns up, the audience seems to understand the meaning of rosebud vaguely, a kind of lost happiness? A simple regret? Or a lonely ending? And it seems that the audience can't understand the true meaning of ""rosebud"" after all? ...
However, it is the unknown meaning of ""rosebud"" that leads to the meaning of citizen Kane itself.<br/><br/>From form to structure, citizen Kane boldly breaks through the original Hollywood classic narrative mode.
At the beginning of the film, there is Kane's mansion and gate, with the words ""no admittance"", accompanied by the big and scary music, like leading the audience into a mystery or detective film; In the following scene, the character Kane is introduced like a news documentary; When journalists talk about ""rosebud"" and Thompson begins to investigate Kane's life, it's like a biopic; In those montage scenes where Susan sings the opera, the audience seems to see the way the musical is done... It can be seen from this that we can't frame this movie with the classic Hollywood genre at all. It USES the elements of many types of Hollywood movies and completely blurs the Hollywood model from the genre at first.
Hollywood's classic narrative emphasizes the objectification of the story and presents a basically objective story. The film shows Kane's life in five large flashbacks. In investigation and Thompson Kane lives two lines of puncture, Thompson respectively from Bernstein cut the son, and his manager and his good friend, and his second wife, Susan and the servant Raymond know there for Kane's childhood and his career, his private life (marriage) for the first time, he of the middle-aged and old age, and so on. Kane's life is connected in the narration of each different narrator, which is highly subjective. In many scenes, the director also violates the time order to arrange the plot. This film breaks the previous linear narrative mode of film order, and adopts multiple narrative structure, flexibly USES flashbacks and flashbacks, and breaks through the single point of view of the narrative, instead, it presents Kane from multiple perspectives.
The classic Hollywood model stresses a closed ending, that is, the story begins with conflict and ends with problem solving, which is a dramatic story structure. In this film, the audience cannot see the ending at all, or rather, the ending that the audience sees is only an open ending. That is to say, there are conflicts but not resolved, put forward questions but not resolved. In the enigma of ""rosebud,"" the audience gets a lot of thinking and imagination. Thompson ends by saying that ""there is no word that can explain Kane's life,"" leaving the film's ending ambiguous and ambiguous, a complete break from the clear Hollywood ending. With the open approach, the audience does not have to forcibly accept the director's intention, but has their own space to feel. In this, perhaps, is the biggest rebellion against the classic Hollywood model.
In the classic model of Hollywood, the focus is on creating the stereotyped, flat characters. In the film, Kane's character also seems unclear. Of course, because of the film's multiple perspectives, in addition to being able to face the scene before Kane's death, at other times, Kane is either in the newsreel or in other people's memories. The five narrators, setcher, Bernstein, ryland, Susan, and Raymond, each present a side of Kane that is complex and multifaceted. The character image of Kane has become more three-dimensional and vivid in the words of different characters, and also has a speculative color. Bernstein recalls Kane in a sympathetic and emotional way, and ryland talks about his relationship with Kane in a cynical way... All of this brings with it the subjectivity of the perspective, and the argument from these perspectives does not fully account for Kane's true character. The film just shows a complex character and the social relationship of the character, etc., but it does not break the theme and character like the previous classic mode, making the film more imaginative and exploratory. In classic Hollywood, often shaped are some spiritual love with material wealth and have the perfect figure, and the film just describes how Kane from a idealistic, young ignorant young man into a no friendship without love recluse such a process, a kind of life, has clearly run counter to the Hollywood shape character pattern.
In addition to the story structure and the theme of the characters, the film has made a bold breakthrough in the Hollywood model, as well as a new attempt in the film shooting technique.
For example, the film created and used a large number of depth of field shots, making the picture in the depth of more changes and scheduling, greatly enhance the spatial tension of the film. These interesting depth-of-field shots make the audience's vision more realistic and require the audience to think more actively and even participate in the scene scheduling. Such as in the show Kane's mother and tucked the long Chelsea has signed the contract, the original looks like a small Kane's panoramic camera, but the camera back, out of a window, and then the Kane's mother, continue to pull back, Kane's mother and son sat in the outlook of cutting table to sign the contract, Kane's father stood in the left of the picture, () in the depths of the scene outside the window the little Cain is play with snow in the snow. This long shot is enough to show the director's unique way of bringing the complexity of the plot into the picture at the same time. In a classic Hollywood narrative, the passage would have been handled with a straight up, down, continuous montage. This is the use of deep space scene scheduling to complete the picture expression. This kind of long shot fully reflects the characteristics of the film, reproduces the unified film space and time, more expressive than the general editing program.
The film also used a large number of low Angle shooting lens, so that the picture has a very unique meaning. The biggest Angle of this film is shot in the most unsuccessful time of kaine's life, that is, he lost the election for governor. The camera is low to the ground, and the ceiling is visible, greatly highlighting this space. In such a scene, not only reproduce the reality of the scene, more importantly, create a very depressed atmosphere, but also hint at the failure of the giant, hint of Kane from a successful to a lonely transition.
In the editing of some special scenes, the film is also unique. In the case of Kane and Emily's marriage, for example, the film's extremely brief and clever montage shows. The passage USES several short snippets to trace briefly the failure of Kane's first marriage. Just a few montage of breakfast scenes, from the characters' lines, expressions, makeup, etc., show their progress from intimacy to hostility.<br/><br/>The stylized narrative, dramatic structural principles, stereotyped character sets, single objective viewpoints, and smooth, continuous editing of previous Hollywood classics have been completely broken in citizen Kane. The narrative discourse of film has a new expression and breakthrough in citizen Kane, which has a great influence on more modern and diversified films in the future.
The ""rosebud"" puzzle is now open to everyone's opinion, but it's safe to say that ""rosebud"" opens a new era of modern cinema, which rejects the aesthetic principles of previous films"

","Based on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, ""Citizen Kane"" is Orson Welles' debut splash in Hollywood and the one that had the most impact in his career. Acting, writing and directing, Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, the publishing tycoon who builds an empire and creates a fortune only to lose everything that matters to him in the end. Chronicling Kane's personal life from his humble beginnings to his rise as one of the world's most powerful and influential men, Welles depicts his subject's highs and lows in matters private and public. Among the most innovative films in cinema history, Welles highlights space, odd camera angles and an immediate, crude style to the acting which makes the film more modern and realistic than most films of the time. Unfortunately the film is not interesting enough to sustain its strengths and Kane's story spirals into tedium and banality. A landmark in cinema history and one of the most overrated films ever made, ""Citizen Kane"" is one flick where watching it once is more than enough."

","Citizen Kane is not, as is claimed, the best movie ever produced. But, of course, it's a must-have presence in the best collections of all time. In addition, Gregg Toland's cinematography may qualify the film as one of the best black-and-white works ever made.<br/><br/>The unforgettable opening is a mixture of horror and film noir and shows a castle on a hill: it is Xanadu, the refuge of the millionaire Charles Foster Kane, inspired by the poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The opening speech is the last word uttered by the newspaper-tycoon before he died: Rosebud!<br/><br/>The meaning of this puzzling word opens a question for its main newspaper, the New York Inquirer, that will leave to the reporter Jerry Thompson the mission of revealing the secret, that will be known of the public only in the final scene. The revelation of the real meaning of that name is considered one of the most fantastic paradoxes in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>In search of what could be ""Rosebud,"" the reporter reveals various aspects of Kane's life through flashbacks, not always ordered and sometimes disconnected. They interviewed the secretary of the millionaire, Bernstein; his best friend Leland; the second wife Susan Alexander, the pivot of the scandal that removed Kane from politics; as well as the unpublished personal diary of Thatcher, Charles's estate administrator and tutor until his 25th birthday.<br/><br/>Separated from the Colorado family when he was a boy to have a training in New York that would enable him to manage the fortune acquired almost by chance by his mother, Kane reaches the age of 25 and, to the despair of Thatcher, is not interested in no kind of investment except the little Inquirer who becomes the starting point for his journalistic empire.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Thompson's research is unsuccessful, except for his brilliant conclusion that while Rosebud is one of the few things Charles has never owned or lost, ""no word can explain a man's life."""

"Hey_Sweden","10","0","2","13 May 2019"," An incredible debut for an undeniable young talent.
","Orson Welles made his extremely well regarded filmmaking debut with this interesting and compelling example of cinema. It's the fascinating, highly atmospheric yarn of Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles himself), a young man who comes into a lot of money and decides that his main goal in life will be to run a newspaper (the Inquirer). Over time, he becomes a major publishing magnate, and even throws his hat into the political ring. But there are some things that he will never quite be able to overcome, such as his hubris, and his inability to admit when he might have been wrong.<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is noteworthy for the way that it moves forward and backward in time, as a reporter named Thompson (William Alland) is among those who research Kanes' life story. As the film opens, Kane has just died, and journalists are determined to unravel the mystery of his final uttered word: ""Rosebud"". Yet, the film is never hard to follow. You always do have the proper sense of time and place. Welles' storytelling abilities are in full bloom, and he keeps his viewers utterly engrossed, as he is assisted by a rich gallery of characters and actors to bring them to life. The high-strung Bernstein (Everett Sloane) was a particular favourite of this viewer.<br/><br/>But the entire cast, with principals comprised of members of the Mercury Theatre, has their moment to shine: Joseph Cotten as the drama critic, Ruth Warrick as Kanes' first wife, Dorothy Comingore as his second wife, Agnes Moorehead as his mom, Ray Collins as the slimy politico Gettys, etc. And Welles is fantastic as the enigmatic character at the centre: a complex, flawed, but compelling individual whose influence stretched far and wide. He wasn't a one-dimensional picture of integrity - he starts out with morals and ideals, and they slowly melt away - and a viewer can see how a person like this might one day have it all and then lose it all the next day.<br/><br/>This begins on a wonderfully ominous note, and features striking cinematography by Gregg Toland and excellent music by Bernard Herrmann. Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz wrote the utterly absorbing story, which won the sole Oscar among the nine nominations. And a young Robert Wise was the editor; his contribution cannot be overstated.<br/><br/>A film like ""Citizen Kane"" might not be everybody's cup of tea, but serious cinema buffs are advised to check it out. They won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Now I understand this film is a ground breaking technical first in cinema history. The incredible cinematography and angling is now something you see constantly today. There is no doubting this movie is a 10/10 for that, however I wanted to review this based on the story and the entertainment value because that's why we watch films in the first place. Citizen Kane still holds up and that should be a testament as to why many people say it's the greatest film ever made and even though I don't agree with that statement, I understand people's stance on it. The story structure is incredibly implied; at first the jumping around had me worried this was going to be a confusing film, but it changes. We're able to get caught up quickly on who Kane is and what point in the story we're currently living in. The way we go back to his previous relationships and the stories narrative begins to become linear again and makes the story more impactful in my opinion when knowing its being told by someone in his life. There is a point where his second wife's story ends and then the Butler follows up what happened after when she wasn't around; it is masterful! Citizen Kane walks through many narratives, you can't help but be drawn into each one whether you know it or not. The most obvious one being a man who just wants everyone to like him and struggles to make everyone in his life happy because it'll conflict with one another. The point of lost childhood, pride, the struggle of having a relationship with a significant age gap and always being unsatisfied with success that you need to keep going. At one point it says Kane was always the bridesmaid, never the bride but he would never be the bride because he is an insatiable man. This movie also made me a bit emotional, I felt for Kane because he represents a little piece in all of us. It reminded me how short life really is. The way Orson Wells was able to make you sympathize with his character so quickly is an incredible feat for even the movies of today and that can credited to the acting, writing and direction, all in which Wells played a hand in. Not to mention the aging makeup was incredibly done for 1941. This isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but for me I was captivated throughout and wouldn't be surprised if I put it on again someday to revisit Citizen Kane as I grow older."

So I finally did around 10 years ago but after watching I couldn't really digest what I had seen.Now in 2019 ive seen it again for about the 10th time. I feel I can really say how much this film changed cinema and is still being inspired by filmmakers today. I won't get into the plot too much because everyone has talked about all that before. What I want to talk about is how thrilling the experience has been for me watching it over and over again. The techniques Orson was working with, the lighting the dark shadows, the score, the high ceilings. The famous deep focus lens, the dissolve of the camera shot that comes down to the bar where his second wife is telling her story. The screenplay told in flashbacks and snappy dialogue and story told in such a way that grabs you as a viewer from the opening shot. You have to remember that this was Orson's first time directing a major picture. He was only 25 years old and had come from theatre. He had already made history with The War Of The Worlds broadcast. He was given the keys to the castle. The acting by Welles aging from twenty five to eighty five years old often gets overlooked. He played the role incredibly well. This is still a masterpiece. My advice for young people that feel daunted to see this film is don't be. Its fun engergetic and and so interesting watch the rise and fall of man's life. This is one of the greatest film ever made. I won't say the greatest because thats subjective and everyone has their own opinion.

Had Mr. Thompson found what ""rosebud"" meant, the movie would have been an absolute waste and the story line would have been pointless; as he could have gone to the Xanadu first! Yet, I had goosebumps when he didn't find the meaning and used the jigsaw puzzle metaphor.

So, it could have been the gift he could give Suzanne to prove his love for her was more than just a possessive narcissistic one.<br/><br/>I loved the theatrical acting in this movie, set decoration, makeup, music, the way the story jumped back and forth yet easily traceable.

And for a film from 1941 it was greatly directed by Orson Welles with the scenes and story being interesting. As it's pretty simple the movie is of the life and times of news paper tycoon and very rich man Charles Kane. Most of the movie is done thru flashback after the death of Charles(AKA ""Rosebud"") and it involves the investigative work of reporters trying to find out about Charles's life from political experiences to scandal like that of an affair with a singer and how all of this caused him to have a fall off.

","It's Orson Welles. The pseudo-intellectuals, especially nowadays with the immense classic status this film has cropped over the decades, will put this sort of film in the highest order of things simply because it's Orson Welles, the great American iconoclast cinematic intellectual of the time with this highly critical piece of film.<br/><br/>Now, for the film itself, it's fairly good, but lacks in various places. Sure there's criticism of the society of the time, there's criticism about politics and more largely criticism of the individual ego, the vanity of men; the ending is authentic and the whole movie works in one direction and has coherence to its lore; and all of that is fine; but ultimately one could find it content-wise the film isn't the most entertaining, a common fault of Welles', that it seems it is the *narrative* of the film that takes the place of ...the film itself. It's like the film has to go through a painful bulk at the center, tediously going through a logical development of the situation and plot, before it can finally give the ending away. Some parts are too long for their own good, for their own point to be made (the whole opera singing thing), and overall one gets an impression of non-interactive coldness, blandness; as a lot of the early events just aren't very interesting (the newspaper days..). There isn't enough surprise, tension, dynamic content; Citizen Kane takes its sweet time to get to the not unpredictable or particularly subtle places it chooses to go; the film just lets its story casually played out and the conclusions are quite obvious (though rather good) even for the time. I understand cinematographically this is a strong and important film, but as a film in itself or even for the point it's making, it's not top notch."

"eabakkum","7","0","2","14 November 2015"," The climax happens at the beginning
","Citizen Kane can be called a film with an outstanding reputation, and in addition fifteen years older than me. So I feel somewhat embarrassed that I did not watch the film before last month. This is even more so, since the political genre is my favorite. Now, after having done my duty, there is the mission to write an original critique. Hopefully at least my loyal followers will pardon this stale addition to the plethora of reviews. Actually the climax of Citizen Kane happens right at the beginning. A boy lives with his simple parents. Although the couple is not really degenerate, there is a hint that the father is a somewhat violent educator. Anyway, the mother is glad when a benevolent Maecenas offers to adopt the boy. Thus Kane is separated from his elderly home, which causes a mild shock. Nevertheless, he succeeds in making an excellent career for himself as a newspaper tycoon. His stories are dynamite (take a flea out to dinner; do you still enjoy my review?). The pen is mightier than the sword, and considerably easier to write with. But the love that he receives from other people can not fill the emptiness due to his lost childhood. He lives in a conspicuous wealth, but this fails to bring meaning to his life. He becomes adamant (the very first insect). But why continue to dilate (= live long)? In the end the bitterness has grown upon him, and he dies in total isolation. Thus the film is quite melodramatic. Maybe in those days the film producers still had a knack for theatrical techniques. Or perhaps some years after the great Depression, that is so thrillingly portrayed in The grapes of wrath, there really was a class society with appalling differences. True capitalism is survival of the fattest. And of course Orson Welles is a giant, the man who said: ""There is one thing worse than celibacy: marriage"". Don't forget to leave comments. I love it."

","I would have to say I wasn't particularly impressed with the story told through this film, even if it is based on a real one, but much more was I impressed by the manner in which it was told. The film was rather unique for it's time in how it sets up the plot at the end of the main character's life and then continues to tell the story of it through a series of flashbacks. Not just how the story was told, but also how it was filmed. The cinematography in this movie is probably one of its best features. The lighting, camera angles, special effects, fades, and pans are all very well done, present throughout the entire film, and all add to the complexity of it. While the story fell a little short for me (not saying it was bad just not my taste), I thought the meanings presented in it (wealth doesn't = happiness, powerful man can't keep/control everything, etc.), and the examination of a man through the people he knew throughout his life were all pretty cool things."

","From the very start, this film is interesting. The dying words ""rosebud"" from wealthy Charles Kane start a massive search for what that means.

As a general plot, it tells about the rise and fall of Charles Kane through flashbacks. Not that common for the time, it was actually pretty cool. At some points I did find it hard to keep my full attention on the screen, it was not always interesting.

Fortunately, the energy and inventiveness on screen are (just about) enough to sustain our interest in the face of the intrinsic yawn-fest that is the basic plot. The trouble is, it's a riches to riches tale, so, honestly, who really cares? As it happens, the wife's story has potential for a really strong narrative, but is not explored. The fact that Citizen Kane takes a fairly savage swipe at an individual still alive at the time also makes it a rather cynical effort. I daresay the intellectual establishment of the forties would have lapped up all the in- jokes and satire but that makes it a film for its time, not for all time.

Therein lies much of the debate regarding what is considered the ""best"" films. On a technical level Citizen Kane sure does impress. The camera work progresses the story, the music is engaging and the editing is top notch. They all do an amazing job of elevating the story. The problem is that it felt like work watching the movie. Good movies should never have me looking at my watch wondering how much longer it has to go. I can appreciate the innovate nature that this film provided, but I don't sit in awe of a wooden wheel just because it was the first of its kind. That might be simplifying it a tad, but on my first viewing of Kane, it just didn't speak to me in the way other modern technical marvels do.<br/><br/>Context is crucial when reviewing films of this nature and I just don't have enough of it to fully appreciate the necessary details. Most of the dialog was engaging, but overall I just wasn't that interested in the of Kane. The flashbacks were creative and engaged me enough that I felt invested, but most of the time I was just waiting for it to all end.<br/><br/>I can't say that I disliked Kane, but like most films, my expectations were set so much higher than they really should have been for a film of this nature.

The story itself is interesting as we get a glimpse of Foster Kane's life piece by piece as he runs a newspaper that reaches people all over the country, Foster Kane was a man who seemingly had everything but eventually lost it all due mistakes and the envy held by his enemies. I enjoyed many other aspects of the film as well including the scene in which the newspaper men are seen in a photograph and then filmed in the same exact position, then stand up and walk away: I thought it was a neat effect. I also enjoyed the scene from Kane's childhood showing his home and the snowfall which has an impact later in the film.

Disappointing on its first release, booed at the Oscars, and silenced out of existence... it later rose to be considered by many as the greatest film in cinema history.

","Citizen Kane is a classic movie that many consider to be one of the if not the best film of all time, but I can't help but disagree. Now I will say this is very good and the film is firmly that as well, it doesn't have the same effect I think it had back then that it does now and has been eclipsed by more modern dramas. Here below I will review the film and tell you why I did though think it was very good.<br/><br/>The story is an epic tale of intertwined periods of Charles Foster Kane's life that do go together so well and done so well that even if you get slightly confused, the story telling takes you away from that. It has it's slower moments but most of them lead up to big dramatic scenes with powerful exchanges between characters and parts where you can't help feel for the character, whether it is good, or even at times bad.<br/><br/>Orson Welles is brilliant at acting in this movie, he by far is the best actor used here and that old thing of people saying the supporting actor is the star of the show is cast away with his superb leading performance. Joseph Cotton does well too here and really when the mood is more anger or even sadness, he manages to be the one seeming most depressed and down on his luck. Dorothy Comingore I felt although very loud and screechy, does a good performance and adds to the wealth of great actors performing in this picture.<br/><br/>Welles Directs and writes this as if it was easy, simple little scenes with very little going on get wrapped in the key dialogue and great choices of wording to make it actually entertaining. With it also being in black an white you may think the brightness never really shows but the script really makes up for any mistakes the film may have as it is so delicately done that you feel Welles may just be one of the best writers of all time.<br/><br/>My review seems very positive yes but the film is not all sublime as It looks, I disliked the middle of the end shall we say with it's confusing back and forth story line and in a sense predictable ending. I wanted more on the rosebud theories, I wanted to delve even more into his life but we only see him at his highest success and lowest endeavours so it would have been nice to have seen more of his life.<br/><br/>Who to recommend this too?, well the critics love it and so should anyone who REALLY get's into classic cinema and enjoys it picking away at it's subtle story lines. I can't say some modern audiences would enjoy(and not just because of the black and white used) ,it is just very slow and a long movie to say it is all talking pretty much, great drama yes but to some, it could just be a bore-fest. <br/><br/>Overall it is Firmly a Very Good movie and quite possibly moving near to being Great. With this you have to not watch it as if you have heard the critics applaud it to it's highest level, but watching it not knowing a thing will actually do better, you might not enjoy it as much as people say but I still think it is an important step in the history of cinema and for that very reason alone, It is essential viewing for any budding critic or cinema lover out there."

","Citizen Kane is the fictionalized story of William Randolph Hearst, right down to the inherited mine. It is a fascinating yet overly-long film that, just like GWTW, bogs down during it's last half. Too much time is spent on his 2nd wife, a singer of very limited talent, who ultimately leads to the destruction of Kane's life and happiness. Except for the fact that she is a beautiful woman, she is shallow and boring, and I care very little for her life story, which dominates far too much time in this movie. Although Kane wins the governorship, it is curious that very little time is shown with him doing anything while in office. A sterling cast, with Agnes Moorehead playing his first wife, and Joseph Cotten as the chief narrator. Orson himself is a wonderful actor. His aging makeup, while clumsy at times, is remarkably accurate. The movie is at its best when telling the story of Kane's rise to newspaper power as the king of ""yellow journalism"". The photography is outstanding, and it makes full use of what was then-called ""deep focus"" with the entire frame from front to back, sharp as a tack. The simulated newsreel footage is outstanding, as is the musical score by Bernard Hermann. Wonderful sets and masterful miniatures and mattes. However, tedious to watch, as I found myself unable to enjoy it in one sitting, almost falling asleep! It's too much like a good murder mystery.

","I've seen this now 3 times, once in a full-size cinema, and while really wanting to admire it I think it's only possible to do that if you can judge it in 1940s context.<br/><br/>The camera-work is - I'm informed, I have no expertise - ground-breaking but almost all of the plot is mundane (esp the parts on his electoral hopes and second marriage) and overall it drags. The official nub may be intended to be, what did Kane mean by Rosebud, but overriding that is the Emperor's Clothes question: why on earth should we care? And the answer is no we shouldn't! <br/><br/>Kane is another ambitious tragic soul and with respect to Orson Welles (who must surely have known this) that subject has been more covered in art than almost everything else. Yes, the fictional Charles Kane is very likely modelled on Randolph Hearst, which may be the real point of making the movie, but if so, its interest lies in it being a personal onslaught, not a great production.<br/><br/>Most of the 6/10 rating is for the visual ingenuity... in the end here is just another old man who sacrificed too much of his humanity on the path to material fortune. Citizen Kane is I'd imagine best viewed if you don't expect anything special - although the final 15 minutes, showing the ageing beast in his sad finery, are probably worth a look."

","Citizen Kane is regarded by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. As for its significance it bring a lot to the table as far as cinematic structure and meaning are concerned. With regard to the structure the film consists of almost entirely flashbacks and the revisiting of a dead mans best associates and acquaintances, including an ex-wife. This film style exhibits how using flashbacks as a films core story telling method can truly capture an audience. It forces viewers to ,like the reporters in the movie, piece together Charles Kane's life and story based on what we learn about his past. Flashbacks had never been quite been used in this style or to this extent. unlike most previous film when the flashback started and continued throughout the entire plot duration and most of the screen duration Citizen Kane continuously goes back in fourth from reality to flashbacks as reporters try and uncover the meaning Charles Kane's last words, ""Rosebud"". Considering meaning the films has a powerful and significant message. Come to find out Rosebud was the name stenciled onto Kane's sled that he is seen playing with as a child before his parents give him away to wealthy business owner in hopes he will live a better life and become successful. Kane becomes one of the richest men in America but is seemingly ungrateful to the man who assisted him in getting there. An old friend of Kane reveals throughout his life he seems to go to great lengths to try and please those he loved and was always doing things that would make him feel loved. At the end of the movie its revealed the Rosebud sled is in the home where Kane died. This implies that being given away by his parents made Kane strive to achieve a feeling of love and embrace that is unmatched by the love and embrace a child feels from his parents. The message here is that attaining all the fortune and success the world has to offer does not make up for the love we receive from being apart of a family, something Kane was robbed and the only thing money could never buy him."

","This was a very interesting film. The story looks into past life of a wealthy newspaper publisher Charles Kane, and reveals the story of his success and downfall. While the film does seem to drag on occasionally, I never found myself separated from the overall experience of the film. However, this effects was somewhat intended by the director Orson Welles, who purposely filmed many long and uneventful takes. In my opinion, the choice to include long takes makes the film more believable and highlights the actor's skill. In this case, the lead role of Kane is played by Welles himself, which goes to show off the talent of the filmmaker. This film may not be for everyone, but for those who can enjoy the slow pace will be delighted by Welle's effective film making."

With the other characters, they really do a nice job of communicating with each other. At the end, I can't believe that the departing staff at Kane's estate burned down Rosebud, which was mentioned earlier. I love how the audience sees Rosebud as a sled in the end.

The story isn't very interesting and I couldn't find myself emphasizing with anyone, not even Charles Foster Kane. While I admit the dialogue was clever and the use of light give the movie an interesting, eerie atmosphere, the story is boring at many points, and its message has been heard a thousand times over. It may have been revolutionary for its time, but it feels rather outdated now. It's considered a classic movie but it didn't do much for me (and I do like classic movies).

The fact that it was based off of William Randolph Hearst and that Hearst tried very persistently to stop it from coming out made the movie much more fascinating. The striking cinematography was the most enjoyable part of the movie. The camera tricks and lighting techniques were new and unprecedented for that era. Orson Welles' style truly shined in this film.

","Whether this movie is overrated or not, Citizen Kane tops the list of many reviewers.<br/><br/>This 1941 drama film, was directed, written and starred Orson Welles. Who was at that time making his directorial debut. Citizen Kane is a movie that i may not boldly say go watch, but if you like the art of film making then this is one classic you should see.<br/><br/>The high points in the movie will have to be the story telling, based primarily on flashbacks. The movie is about a man named Charles Foster Kane a newspaper magnate, played by Orson Welles, whose story is loosely based on the lives of four men, American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick and some aspects of Welles's own life.<br/><br/>Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story of Charles Foster Kane is revealed through the research of a newsreel reporter, who was seeking to uncover the mystery of the newspaper magnate (Charles Foster Kane) dying word: ""Rosebud"".<br/><br/>The thrill in this movie is how it moves from flashback to real time in such powerful continuity that makes you respect the art. If you are to compare this movie to such like Inception and co, you may view it as an overrated classic, the cinematography is one for the books and the story is masterful.<br/><br/>Viewing the film with an objective look that it was made in 1941 in black and white, where no CGI is available at all but we have makeup artist doing their absolute best to make sure that you are carried along in the growth of Kane himself.<br/><br/>Then the question comes to play in your heart, the portrayal of the character, Orson did so well at various stages in the life of Kane that he convinces you that he either most have known Kane before in a previous life.<br/><br/>The directing style of Orson too is something to talk about, making the story based only on the life of Kane and making the newspaper reporter kind of anonymous.<br/><br/>The story of the movie depicts a man who had everything but lacked empathy, this makes you the audience either judge his actions or commend them as brave.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards but took home one for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. It has topped many reviewers 'greatest film ever made' lists such as that of Sight & Sound's decennial poll, the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list and its 10th Anniversary Update.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic true and true.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","While considered by some film critics as the ""greatest movie of all time"" not only because of it's quality but also because of it's high level of innovation, both in terms of further exploring the possibilities of film, special effects and also in technical terms. This is an excellent film. It is perhaps one of the oldest films that I have ever watched, perhaps only some Disney and Chaplin films (such as Snow White and Modern Times) are actually older.<br/><br/>So, how this holds up compared to modern movies? Quite well actually. The technical quality of the movie is far superior to 7 Samurai, for instance, the camera work is very well done and the effects work quite well. The main problem of the movie is that as it is very old it requires more patience from the audience as films those days were not as tingly edited and composed, instead this less refined version of the art still has a loot of rough edges. Scenes take took long, dialogue is a bit overlong and complex, which increase the costs of watching the film with attention.<br/><br/>Still, despite it's technical limitations if compared to modern movies, Citizen Kane still holds quite well if one is willing to sit through it's entire duration. It's a very powerful film and I would consider it the best movie that I ever saw made before the 1960â€²s.<br/><br/>I would recommend There Will be Blood, for someone who has liked this film."

For nearly the first half of the movie, the Kane/Hearst character is portrayed as flamboyant, but in a positive way. Then, in a brilliant ""marriage sequence"", you begin to see the dark side of Kane/Hearst.<br/><br/>While I would not class this as the greatest American film, it is remarkable that Orson Welles produced this fine a film his first time around.<br/><br/>As an actor, Welles was extremely good here. But for balance, the performance by Joseph Cotten was equally fine, and Cotten is undoubtedly one of American's most underrated actors.<br/><br/>All the other supporting actors, with the exception of Ray Collins, are relatively unknown to film audiences, but they do their jobs well in this production. Collins, a very recognizable face, has a very short role here, but does it nicely.<br/><br/>One criticism I have with this film is the makeup as the characters age. I know a lot of old people, and I'm getting there myself, and trust me, as you age your skin doesn't get smoother and smoother.<br/><br/>Certainly well worth watching, but I think the sensation of ""Rosebud"" and the controversy behind the film has made this a more famous film than it deserves to be."

The lighting and photography deserve all the accolades they have been given over the decades, the makeup is fantastic and the acting is on par with the quality of the movie as a whole. Yes, some scenes are less than stellar (the pterodactyls in the swamp picnic for example), but this only emphasizes how good the remainder is (such as the scene where Mrs. Kane is signing away young Charles Foster Kane to the banker).<br/><br/>The complexity of the time shifting plot is also impressive and well orchestrated to make it seem logical and seamless.

","Given that ""Citizen Kane"" has owned the best-film-of-all-time lists since the mid-1950s and that it was called the same by the ultimate film critic Robert Ebert, I'll have a limited amount to say about it other than to agree that Orson Welles' masterpiece is the film you need to see a few times in order to have a technical yardstick to judge others by. Like many of 2010's Oscar Best Picture noms (""Avatar"", ""The Hurt Locker"", ""Up"" and ""District 9""), the basic plot is not quite up to the technical prowess of the film. Welles uses deep focus, framing of characters in the background, and other special effects techniques that would give today's $200million USD extravaganzas a serious run for their massive piles of money. His aging of Charles Foster Kane from age 25 to old age is as realistic as anything you'll see in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" or any modern blockbuster. His use of cutaway titles (such as the neon sign above the night club) which the camera magically flies through presages the interactive titles in ""Zombieland"" or TV's ""Fringe"". In short, much of technical aspects of film-making in any post 1941 film will seem derivative to the Welles masterwork. The story itself is compelling but not overly so; however, it does lay the basic arc from super-stardom to has-been to crazed collector living alone in a crumbling palace for several biographies of actual people (e.g., Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley). In short the answer to the central trope of who is the ""Rosebud"" of Kane's dying words doesn't turn out to be that interesting but the trip to find out is well worth your time."

Welles character, Charles Foster Kane, exudes charisma and confidence. Welles as an actor created one of the deepest, most complex, and memorable characters in movie history. He is impossible to take your eyes off of throughout the film. Welles was surrounded by a strong supporting cast, and benefited from an engrossing story. The only thing that surpassed Welles as an actor was his superb directing of this film. Welles use of lighting was wonderful. From back lighting to spot lights to beautiful natural outdoor lighting, Welles used every tool at his disposal. The camera work was even better. Every scene was crisp, clean and expertly shot. Welles work behind the camera and in front was so noticeably professional, above grade, and frankly perfect that even a novice to film can't help but notice and appreciate it.

Charles Foster Kane is necessarily a character that the audience cannot connect with as his enigmatic and distant nature is the whole point of the film but I found it difficult to connect to any of the characters on any level, they all left me feeling cold. I think that perhaps with more repeat viewings I'll be able to penetrate the extreme density of the film further and may in time come to truly appreciate it but for the moment I'll have to remain incredibly impressed but not quite entertained."

","I've seen Citizen Kane a few times now and it seems to get better every time. I always notice a few new things. The plot is very interesting and I find that the way it is told with flashbacks makes his life story easy to comprehend. It was cool to see how all of the different people throughout the story remembered him. Welles' use of lighting in Citizen Kane is unmatched by any movie I have seen. The lighting along with the use of creative and dramatic angles puts this movie in a category of it's own. I liked the story in the sense that Kane was able to go from a poor family to running a news paper it gives you the feeling that anything is possible. This movie is worth watching multiple times because each time you appreciate the cleverness of Welles' directing even more."

","I had never seen a Orson Welles movies before I had seen ""Citizen Kane."" I had heard so much about the movie, I had very high hopes for it, as everyone I talked to said it was a magnificent movie. ""Citizen Kane"" tells the story of Charle Foster Kane and his life through flashbacks, as the title character died in the very beginning of the film. The entire movie is an investigative journey through Kane's life trying to figure out what ""Rosebud"" means, the last word the man uttered. Welles charted into unknown territory with ""Citizen Kane."" He told the story through flashbacks, something that has never been done before, on account of not wanting to confuse the audience and therefore loose ticket sales. This was a very risky move that Welles made in 1941, however it proved to profitable since many movies since have used the flashback sequence to tell their stories."

"batskitbomb27","Null","0","1","31 March 2011"," Review of the movie, ""Citizen Kane""
","""Citizen Kane"" as one of the strong break-out films of the early 1940s. The film opens up with the death of our hero. Prior to this, there haven't been too many films that showed the demise of their main characters (especially a death at the beginning of a film). This was one of the many ways that this film attempted to break away, and be different from the films representing the Classic Hollywood Style. <br/><br/>The film doesn't play out in any chronological order. It jumps back and forth from present day to the life of Orson Welles' character. In the usual films of the time, rarely did the main character struggle with the female characters. In ""Citizen Kane"", Charles Foster Kane is originally married, but he then destroys his first marriage for another love interest. In many ways, this was a more realistic film than other films of its time. It dealt with the true troubles of many men and women. <br/><br/>The film showed a complete downfall of the main character. Charles Foster Kane was a man who had everything, but couldn't handle it. In the end, the only thing he longed for, that was probably robbed of him, was his childhood. Sadly, Orson Welles' character dies an old man in a broken down palace. This was a great experimental project that remains, to this day, to be one of the greatest motion pictures of all time."

","Incredible. Citizen Kane is a true visual treat. Orson Wells is one of the greatest film directors of all time, you can see his intelligence just from watching Citizen Kane. And I have to say, the man is one hell of an actor as well! This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made. One outstanding feature to Citizen Kane is the astonishing cinematography. Gergg Toland the DP of this movie is truly the best. Not only does he bring outstanding lighting to the film but the shot composition is remarkable. The composition brings excellent stability along with depth and illusion. The Rule Of Thirds is used so incredibly. You'll see how they have shots where they line an actor on the left in the fore ground, another actor on the right of the screen in the middle ground and another actor all the way in the background. This easily conveys depth to the movie. Orson Wells has always been considered a very stylistic director both in film and theatrical plays. Many think Wells is all about style and not story, think what you want. In Citizen Kane, I don't think any other director could have done it other than Orson Wells. He not only brings his own style of filmmaking but tells an incredibly compelling story."

The plot does - but not the composite culminating end product. It is a product - a perfectly chiseled statue of David. But it has no meaning with the story of David. The B&W is superb, the complexity of the shots and edit are saying 'look at me!' So I'm changing my vote - from 10 to 8. I even like Joe vs. the Volcano better than this.

","Citizen Kane is arguably one of the most groundbreaking movies ever made. its hard to believe that this movie was considered to be a huge flop the time it was released and people booed it for even getting nominated for the academy awards, i guess it received its glory long after it was released. Orson Welles did an outstanding job directing the movie given the time it was created, he pushed all boundaries of movie making. That is the true reason why Citizen Kane is called the greatest movie of all time by so many people, not for its depth of emotion or performance but for what a breakthrough it really was. All of the Cast did their job well. They were very much in their character, Whether it was important character like Joseph Cotten as Jedidiah or Small character like Ray Collins as Getty's. Orson Welles did and Excellent job as Kane. The movie Shows the Rise and Fall of the Great Charles Foster Kane, It shows how his life really was , how he never wanted money for himself, how he was Both Bad and good at the same time. The Movie has amazing amount of depth in it, But still the movie is not without it's flaws, The Biggest Flaw of the movie is how it is shown and at the same time that same thing is its biggest Strength. The Movie is Somehow Dark and Dirty, Where Many like my self will love the movie, many will find it to be boring and out of pace. I think its safe to say no matter how great the movie is, its not Timeless. It never really touched the Level People Expected, Over expectation killed the movie. This movie is a Masterpiece but a masterpiece that is not for everyone."

","I'm still only a little over half way into reviewing AFI's list of Top 100 Films, and that list from 1997 is already pretty old. I've seen ""Citizen Kane"" before of course, but have never felt quite prepared to give it the treatment I thought it should deserve. So rather than worrying about it this time, I'm just going to jump right in. It's not like I'm going to have anything new or inspiring to say about the picture anyway. It has it's reputation, it has it's fans, and it has it's detractors.<br/><br/>For me, the picture doesn't grab me the way I think a 'Best' picture should. It's story is OK, but there are others that are better and that have entertained me more. Maybe by mentioning some of my favorites, I can provide some perspective. ""Casablanca"" is my all time favorite and has been for years. Then, in order, there's ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" to round out the Top Five.<br/><br/>There are some elements of course that lend to the film's reputation. I'll second the camera work and lighting, and something that no one has mentioned (at least I haven't read it anywhere), is the unique kind of juxtaposition we see with Charles Foster Kane in a balcony scene alongside Adolph Hitler. I also thought the aging sequence involving Kane (Orson Welles) and Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) was remarkably well done over it's span of six different time frames. But it's not enough. Not enough to merit Best Picture of all Time.<br/><br/>I certainly don't think it's a dog either. For Orson Welles to direct and act in this picture at the age of twenty five might merit him a standing even greater than the film. It was an outstanding achievement by any comparison, and he deserves the accolades. It's hard for me to imagine that kind of talent in someone so young, so handing out that accolade seems well deserved and the right thing to do.<br/><br/>I'm not of the opinion that I'll never watch the film again either. I've seen it three times now, and it does seem to have it's effect with age, not the picture's age, but my age. As long as it keeps getting better with time, I'll continue to give it a look every now and then."

","Citizen Kane a 1941 film noted for its cinematography, and music. This film almost seemed as a mystery because throughout the movie there are many unanswered questions and the only way to get the answers is to ask more questions. The cinematography in this film used a lot of deep focus. Deep focus is a shot that the foreground, middle, and background are all in focus so you are able to see the entire shot clearly. The cinematographer Gregg Toland also used many different camera angles such as ones from the floor facing upwards towards the actors. During one of the scenes Toland dug a trench in order to shoot a scene where the ceiling was in the shot. Orson Welles' acting in this film was very powerful. As a viewer I felt as though he had truly embraced his character and took on the role fully. The writing and script of the film was not particularly the best part of the film, it at times was for characterized and a shallow plot line. Throughout this film I saw a common theme of self-regret. I saw man not willing to appreciate what he has and always wanting more. This is a common theme in today's society of many people always wanting more than what they have."

","If Orson Welles' debut feature isn't the best American film ever made it certainly remains one of the most impressive, combining narrative and technical dexterity in a stunning display of talent unmatched before or since. Every scene is a minor masterpiece of style and invention, and the elliptical story of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane, who squandered a wealth he never earned on a woman he couldn't love, is as much a catalogue of camera techniques as it is a compelling drama. It's hard to believe the film flopped at the Box Office when first released in 1941, but perhaps it was simply too sophisticated for widespread audience appeal. Today of course it remains a model of creative entertainment, and a sad reminder of Hollywood's disdain for rogue talent. Welles never equaled the achievement, but even if the film itself could never be repeated the joy of watching it certainly can, and after half a century the rise and fall of Charles Foster Kane is as fresh and compelling as ever. In all likelihood the only viewer left unimpressed by the film was its inspiration, William Randolph Hearst, but what angered him more: Welles' reckless re-creation of San Simeon (Kane's Xanadu), or the true identity of 'Rosebud'?"

The lighting in certain scenes were so beautiful and helped with the emotions that wanted to be felt. Both sympathy and compassion seemed to flood at certain parts.

Gregg Toland was an excellent cinematography and couldn't have made it more lovely. He found the shot that fit the story and they were edited in perfectly. I kept on finding something that was beautiful in each scene. The story was slow in a few parts and it seemed to drag, but I think that this story was more about the life and what it eventually leads to. Not to sound morbid, but life can be slow and boring at time and I think that is what the message is. The screenplay is rather direct and too the point most of the time. Witty one liners are sporadic, but they also stop and make you think. My favorite line is, ""You can't blame me. They've been making statues for some two thousand years, and I've only been collecting for five."" -Kane The actors were also stunning and didn't overact. I could relate to this quote, through my book collect and this helped me understand Kane more. I have never seen a movie like CITIZEN KANE, and I don't think I ever will.

","Citizen Kane was written and directed remarkably well. The films consists of outstanding scenes and performances, cinematic and narrative techniques and experimental innovations, including sound and photography. The film was quite controversial at the time, having unflattering parallels to a real-life publisher. The film consists of a number of long takes, which create more meaning behind the actions and characters. These long takes draw the viewer in, because it's obvious that shots aren't edited together. The soundtrack is another important part of the film; it provides clues to Kane's behavior as he ages. One of the most notable scenes is when Kane walks (almost zombie-like) down a corridor lined with mirrors, where his reflection is multiplied. In this scene you realize that we all project a certain personality to people, and we often leave impressions behind. Here you get a sense that Kane is reflecting on who he has become. This also shows how well Orson Welles was able to perform, in addition to writing and directing the film, totally proving in today's world why he was so famous."

With the support of a strong plot that literally holds us in suspense until the final images and a construction of history based on a short documentary and flashbacks, the film's structure is very well done and very innovative. And although those can be a bit bogged down in the relations of Mr. Kane as for example the relation with his singer wife, but this brings us finally to Mr. Kane's character, his world he has built, symbolized by his unfinished palace Xanadu, his isolation and finally his descent.<br/><br/>The distribution is deserving and original. The actors are novice in front of a camera and they are remarkably and comfortable for all the tricks and different points of view of the plot.<br/><br/>In addition, the film is very good, intelligent and technically controlled, supported by shadows effect and symbolic and evocative details of the history.<br/><br/>So we have a plot of the most captivating, beautiful and skillful narration, effective distribution and flawless execution. On those points there is only one conclusion: if you had not watched yet, Get Citizen Kane! This film is a must-see.

","I have always been told that Citizen Kane is one of the best films ever made, now I see why. This movie portrays a man who is taken away from his parents and put into a world of wealth, which lets him do basically whatever he wants. This wealth seems to make him lose everything that is important to him. His friends, his wives, and his passion for his newspaper. I believe this is why on his deathbed he said the famous word of ""Rosebud"". In the end, we all see that Rosebud is his sled he had when he was a kid. For Kane to remember this when he loses everything must mean that this was what he loved most. A time before wealth and power came to existence for him. This teaches us the theme of the movie. That being too wealthy will ruin a person and that simple moments in life, like sleigh riding, is what makes life worth it.<br/><br/>Besides the theme, the overall movie was amazing. The audience could recognize when it was dark and when it was light due to lights in a room and shadows that appeared. Also, the camera showed many scenes at different angles. For example, when Kane was running for governor the camera was above him, so the audience was looking down at him. Also, when Kane was talking to Jed after Kane lost the election the camera looked like it was on the floor following these two men around the room.

I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>But then I watched it again with the Peter Bogdonovich commentary, then immediately after that with the Roger Ebert commentary, and wow, I had a revelation. There is so much to this movie, I couldn't begin to tell you. No, it's not the greatest plot nor the greatest subject, nor does it even have the greatest acting (though the acting is quite great). The brilliance of this film lies in tiny, insignificant details which you'd probably miss on the 1st viewing. Seemingly trivial things like the placement of certain objects, people and lights combine to tell a visual story within the story. The sum of these tiny details equals a masterpiece.<br/><br/>So I recommend you view it exactly as I did. See it once to get a feel for it. Then watch it again with the DVD commentaries. Watching it with a date whose pants you're trying to get into is optional and, frankly, not recommended. But other than that, there's a lot to see in this film.

Kane is an individual that is willing to give up relationships to gain wealth, yet also seems caring and wanting to do what is right for people.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene, I thought lighting, use of shadows, camera angles and cinematography played a huge role in the movie. The dramatic building of the opening where the cameras pan slowly up the chain link fence, to the next fence area, to the wrought iron fencing, to see a glimpse of Xanadu, Kane's castle, to his lips speaking ""Rosebud"", the tumbling and smashing of the snow globe, was an interesting sequence. I thought the ending shots were symbolic of the Thompson's (the reporter) statement, ""Rosebud is like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle."" The camera panned an aerial view from what almost looked like a cityscape, it slowly brings the audience down to an item which is thrown into the incinerator.

","Citizen Kane is a curious study in American film. It's lauded as one of the greatest works of film, ever. Sometimes in the same breath, it's lambasted as a hackneyed story and a waste of a film reel. So what is the real Citizen Kane? Well, in a simple breath, this movie is meant more to be studied than it is to be enjoyed. The film itself is somewhat of a biography of William Randolph Hearst, but takes liberties to make a more interesting story. The story, however, takes a backseat to everything else going on in the film.<br/><br/>From the first scene on, it's apparent that this movie is simply different than any other movie of its time. For instance, in the first scene with the boy playing outside, the camera pans back, revealing that it is actually inside of a house. Two characters come into the foreground and are having a conversation while sitting at a dinner table, but the camera still keeps focused on the window outside. The viewer gets to capture everything happening at once, from the parents deep conversation indoors to the child's lighthearted play with his sled Rosebud. All with the choice of the viewer's eye.<br/><br/>This is what makes Kane special. That and the revolutionary way to tell a story through flashbacks, which is normal now, but in that day, was, as they would say, ""the bee's knees."" Still, boring plot does knock this film down a peg or two. Still amazing in its own right though."

Every set and background was filmed with a sort of mathematical precision. Another great aspect of the film was the story. The story reveals so much about the life of Kane yet leaves the audience baffled about his true feelings about his life. This leaves the audience to discuss with each other and for the people to use their own imagination. This film also explores the the theme that money does not but happiness. Throughout his whole life Kane had unlimited power and resources and became consumed by them. If we can't share our successes with other people then what's the point?"

In the same way that Van Gosh was not considered an artist till after he died, I would imagine it took a few years for the academy to even consider the possibility that giving the gold to How Green was My Valley (over Kane) was a mistake. Today there is no question. Some would argue that there is also no question that it is the best movie ever, I don't fully agree. I do like it a lot though.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of newspaper king William Hearst. And chronicles his life from boyhood to the grave. The film moves at a leisurely pace, never to slow or too quick and while it is not the most cathartic of movies Citizen Kane has much to say. To me, the film is driven primarily by Welles' performance. If you want something done well, you gotta do it yourself, and Welles knew that. <br/><br/>The reason for the studio's dislike of Welles was because of his control freak attitude, but it results in some interesting decisions. One of which is the total absence of stars or names in the cast, definitely a positive. It keeps us focused on the story and not the stage or cinematic presence of popularity. What's more, Citizen Kane is the first feature for most of the cast. <br/><br/>There are actually a number of moments which I can point to and say, 'this is not featured in any other movie of the time'. Citizen Kane has several tracking shots in which the camera literally goes through pieces of furniture and other solid matter. Now, I'm a smart guy, and I'm studying film production, but it wasn't until I heard Roger Ebert's commentary that I realized how these shots were achieved. I never would have guessed Even the title sequence is great, because it is subtle. When we see sixty or seventy year old movies, we are used to seeing title card credits, with loud blaring fanfare. That doesn't happen here. Citizen Kane absorbs us with its ambiance from moment #1, in addition to word #1, ROSEBUD.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Kane ages pretty well, which shows skill on the part of the make-up job, the movie however has aged even better. Soem reasons are obvious, but others may not be. Perhaps this is what makes Citizen Kane so special from a 21st century perspective. This controversially is more epic than any other movie.<br/><br/>Watch it and decide for yourselves,"

","Orson Welles. What more do you want? Even though he was 25 when he made this film, his direction is legendary. every shot is just pleasure to look at, particularly the famous deep focus shots, where both the foreground and background are in sharp focus. Even if you don't like the plot, just looking at this film is worth the 2 hours it runs for. Not that the plot is bad of course. Charles Foster Kane is a dying newspaper tycoon, who's last words cause a spur in the media and the rest of the film follows one man (who's face we never see) interviewing people who knew Kane, and flashbacks of Kane's life. The ending, even though a lot of people know the twist, is brilliant. The writing's great, the acting's great, the editing's great and of course the direction is amazing. This film really is great. It has a reputation of being the greatest movie of all time. DON'T WATCH THIS FILM WITH THAT IN MIND! It will be a let down. It isn't THAT good, but it's still good. Definitely watch it if you get the chance."

","Will Rabagliati Citizen Kane is truly one of the greatest films ever made. <br/><br/>Yes the story isn't that original. Yes some of the acting leaves something to be desired. There are points in the film when you wish it would hurry up and get to the point, some of the scenes can be overly long winded. I also found some of the dialogue slightly lacking,<br/><br/>Negatives aside though, Kane is possibly the best example of cinematography in existence. The brilliance and talent of Welles as a director is apparent in every shot of the film. One particular scene which stands out for me is the Breakfast scene which shows the progressing and the disentergration of Kane's first marriage. The shooting of that particular scene is brilliant, provoking and incredibly effective, it says a lot for the film that such a simple trick is so well used.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is also great, in a way it shows a human side to the monster that was Kane, it's Orson Welles's way of adding both a clever and a thought provoking end to the film."

","Unfortunately Citizen Kane didn't make me jump out my seat. I don't think personally that the subject matter appealed to me, but I did appreciate the way things were presented. The dark and gloomy beginning was great to represent death and the movie of Kane's successes was nice to put in the beginning because it threw off the audience and also gave a motive to go back and research his life more thoroughly. It was sort of evident to me in the beginning that they weren't going to find what this rose bud was. <br/><br/>Orson Wells played the character beautifully. He made Kane seem invincible like he was ""the man"". Charles Kane was funny, determined, and charismatic. Although it may have been just how he was remembered or seemed to be it made the flashback worth remembering. Probably the thing that most stood out for me when watching was how Orson Wells lined out the position of things and created things to look at everywhere. He would have Charles mother in the foreground, his father in the middle ground and Charles playing outside all the way in the background. Or in the opera house scene how people were passing by the camera as to get to there seats in the foreground, yet you could see all the preparations going on in the background. The also most clever thing I saw was how they had time pass when Charles would have meals with his first wife. I loved the scene because it showed how time passes , but if effort is not put forth in making things better things will just remain the same and get worse. Lastly, something occurred to me when I watched the flashbacks I wondered if it would have been better in color because it could have showed more of the person's perspective of the time and show how the time periods were different from one another."

","Citizen Kane is a great movie to watch. This movie has great cinematography throughout the whole movie. Especially when the camera moves from outside and then comes in through the window of the house. This movie also has flashbacks of Kane's life showing everything from his childhood up until he died. The movie starts out with Kane death and he says one word Rosebud. A detective tries to figure out what it means. So this movie makes you wonder throughout the whole movie what it is. But in the end the audience finds out what it means not the people in the movie. It reflects on something from his his childhood and maybe it was what he wanted not to be rich and just have a normal life. But in the end the meaning of the word dies with him since it was burned."

I love how Kane built up from a childhood in poverty to become very successful. <br/><br/>The film is known for its cinematography and is said to be Orson Welles breakthrough film. It is one of stories that helped changed film making and there are some beautiful scenes such as the scenes when he is taken from his parents. I didn't expect Rosebud to be the name of his childhood sled that was strange. <br/><br/>I am glad I watched this movie and its a must see for any film buff especially since it is ranked as the number 1 film by many critics.

Thats what I was excepting and I felt It caused me to judge the movie to hard. The film is great, the fast-past plot that jumps from past from present almost every other scene. Normally that would be sort of confusing to the viewers but this director did it. How he did that may be the reason this movie is considered so great but there's more. The cinematography in this movie is done just as well as the film jumps from past to present. In fact the wonderful cinematography is one of the main reason it jumps from past to present so well. The cinematography really makes you feel like your looking in on this actual mans real life. The story its self also makes this a great film. Who wouldn't be interested in a story about an extremely wealthy man who ends up with nothing. The acting is also top notch in this film. From Orson Welles character to the butler who was with him at the end all deliver powerful performances. All these things I picked up on and enjoyed yet Citizen Kane(1941) still didn't live up to my expectations. I wish no one would have ever told me about this film before I saw it, but overall i defiantly enjoyed this movie and will be watching it again."

The use of lighting the many scenes was amazing. What I really like about this film was the narrative structure of the film. I found it to be different than the usually straight forward narrative used by most films. The film begins with the death of old man Kane. Before he passes on he mumbles the words Rosebud. The film becomes center upon the meaning of this word for Kane. I like how viewers are giving incite to Kane's life though a series of flashbacks of his life. I like how the story of his life is told after his death. It leaves little confusion to the viewers. When the films finish then we begin to understand the real Kane.

The movie was extremely well done in the fact that it was revolutionary for it's time. Kane start's as just a simple man who believes that running a paper would be fun for him and help mend his new life.

Not only that, but he also introduced different ways of focusing on people or objects, which i thought was quite clever.

","As a man of modest knowledge on film criticism I feel somewhat apprehensive about commenting on a film regarded as the epitome of cinematic masterpiece. However that is my task and moreover that is exactly what Citizen Kane is. So I follow the advice given to so many confused writers: ""write what you know"". Firstly the credit owed to Orson Welles for this film's greatness can be compared to the credit Michael Jordan would receive for the Chicago Bulls winning championships in the 1990s. Of course there were supporting players in the making of the film, a great script and score, phenomenal set development, and a more than sufficient budget were undenyable factors contributing to the film's greatness. But the memorable aspects of this film arise from it's brilliant screen time structure, excellent camera work, and technological innovation that must have been spellbinding for a 1940's audience to behold. Amidst the logistical greatness, the story itself can almost become forgotten, but there-in lies a classic commentary on life and what moves us. The fact that a man of un-imaginable power such as Kane reverts back to a childhood toy in his dying breath, is a comforting aside that says truly simple things can be the most important."
"cordaro9418","9","0","1","1 June 2009"," Rosebud... who'd have guessed?
","Originally I was accepting of the nickname of the sled, but finding out what 'Rosebud' actually was code for in the world of William Randolph Hearst... Welles was probably lucky he wasn't killed, literally. Listed as No. 1 on the AFI top 100 films of all time I think it falls just a tad short. I'd have been more than happy to see it in the No. 2 or even 3 hole behind ""Casablanca"" and ""The Godfather"" respectively. The film still is an awesome piece of American film-making and in my opinion represents one of the first great 'indie' films as everyone aside from R.K.O. turned away the young upstart and his blasphemous script (with credit to his writing partner Herman J. Mankiewicz). The film is thorough in bringing along for the journey, even if it does hit a hump at the midpoint it follows quickly enough to keep us interested. Obviously it has survived the ultimate test, which is time, to prove itself since it was basically left for dead upon original release. It also didn't help that 'Kane' is one of those films you really do need to take in more than once to fully appreciate the film-scape. (In tribute, just see their reference in an episode of 'Family Guy' as ""Two long boob-less hours!"") Given that Orson Welles was a filmmaker well ahead of his time, it leaves one to wonder what his legacy may have been if 'Kane' had been more widely accepted by the film industry and the populace. Unfortunately we are left to realize his greatness too close to his death and well after it. How things may have been different in Hollywood as a whole if he had been anointed the master director and ringleader of the Mercury Theater he was instead of relegated to studio actor under the 'Dream Factory' thumb. Luckily, we'll always have his 'one hit wonder' (to those who simply ignore his body of work) to remind us of 'wasted potential' (due in NO part to Welles' own effort) in epic film. Enjoy the movie, pay attention and no bathroom breaks. Oh, and pay homage to Rosebud."

","Everyone that writes on these things use words like ""films"" Well I just want to say that Citizen Kane was a great MOVIE. If you like watching MOVIES several times over, then this is the one for you. I like it even more every time I watch it. And apparently I need 10 lines of text so here it goes. It seems to me that this is not the type of MOVIE that you can watch only once and think that you have an idea about what it really means. It is impossible to digest all of it at once. I don't want to come off like a snob and start analyzing every aspect of the MOVIE, and I don't want to give anything away. Citizen Kane is a MOVIE about how you can spend your entire life searching to regain you childhood, it explains aspects of human nature in our desire to be loved.

","When released Citizen Kane was a box office disaster. Yet over the years it has become a misunderstood masterpiece. It's hard to believe that Orson Welles was only 25 when he made this gem. I have to admit I am not a fan of old movies yet Citizen Kane kept me engrossed throughout the duration of the movie. The story(as if I even need to say)involves Citizen Kane, a recluse who utters the word Rosebud before he dies. What follows is a mystery to find out the meaning of his last words. We see his life from the perspective of the people who knew him(his ex wife,his best friend and many more people). We go back to his childhood, when his parents give him up so he can have a better upbringing. Then he sets up a newspaper company through which Kane exposes scandals of politicians. We see his first marriage fall apart, coincidentally if I am not mistaken his first wife was played by Agnes Moorehead who also starred as Endora as Betwitched. We even see him trying to become politician but rumours of Kane being involved with a woman is circulated by his rivals. That results in him having to hand over his business to his partner. Then he distances himself from society until his death. Even at the end the people didn't manage to find out the meaning of the word Rosebud but we as the viewers do(don't worry I am not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it). I see Kane as a remarkable character He is stubborn yet principled, a very good example is in the scene where his friend gives Kane's wife, who is a actress a bad review and how he reacts. Citizen Kane has opened my eyes to old movies and I will definitely try to watch Orson Welle's other work. Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever made and the fact that the audience couldn't accept it at the time is most certainly their loss."

Shadows are used in similar ways throughout the entire film - it was really quite extraordinary in that department.<br/><br/>The story was definitely intriguing and the ending delivers a remarkably successful payoff. Indeed it is a truly intriguing and remarkably truthful (as far as being truthful to human nature goes) character study. At times the story drags a bit and I blame that on the fact that despite the story being presented incredibly well it is not that good a story.<br/><br/>The dialogue is pretty good. Sometimes the humour put a smile on my face which is all it was meant to do - to keep your attention and keep your eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is certainly a successful film and I have a huge amount of respect for it (it was hugely influential) but there is something missing.

I don't know what impresses me so much about this film, whether it's the excellent writing, the mystery that surrounds the film from the beginning, or following the reporters' path from Kane's last word to the revelation at the end. Whatever the reason, it's just a great film. Somewhat loosely based on the life of reporter William Randolph Hearst, ""Citzen Kane"" can be described as a drama crossed with sort of a mystery. The techniques used in this film, including original ideas for camera angles (such as zooming in through windows) was basically created by this film. Orson Welles proved himself to be an ingenious filmmaker, though ""Citzen Kane"" was largely underrated for its time, winning only a single Oscar for its screenplay rather than all nine it deserved.

","Pauline Kael in her famous essay on this film tried (wo)manfully to give all the credit to Herman Mankiewicz's script and Gregg Toland's camera work. It persuaded few at the time and is hugely unlikely when you look at the work both did outside of this film. Kael as a critic was always a doubtful proposition, her chumminess with the makers of many of the films she reviewed was on an ethical level with those internet reviewers who take cash to rave about Hollywood's latest mindless blast ie ""The Dark Knight"" - an adolescent film for adolescents. The credit for this film is almost entirely due to Orson Welles, less a man than a legend even then. That said though, Welles has to take the blame for the film's shortcomings as well. The story is little more than the usual homily about money not buying happiness, wealthy Hollywood dished up this message gleefully to an audience that had no chance to test it's truth. The script contains some great lines but lacks depth. The psychology second rate Freud. The acting is variable, only Welles himself really managing to put any gusto into the film. Despite this the film is close to the masterpiece many have proclaimed, a fitting testament to old Hollywood's ability to turn trash into great cinema on a par with ""Casablanca"". How it manages this is hard to pin down (if it was easy to describe other filmmakers could achieve the same results with equal ease). At root it comes down to the sheer cinematic nature of the film, none before or since has used the medium's possibilities with such abandon or genius (this is one of those rare films that is unimaginable in any other medium). In the right mood you can surrender to this film and become convinced it is a work of art. Of course it does not stand up to serious textual analysis - few films can - but this is an American film that does not insult it's audiences' intelligence -a rarity then and even more so now."

","For myself, I term Citizen Kane the definitive classic as it invokes thought from the audience at every scene. It is a portrait of a life which explores not only the events but the causation behind the events. To simply view the film without exploring the nuances does not truly appreciate the experience of the life of Charles Foster Kane as expressed by Mr. Welles. The film explores the reasons behind the actions of the main character via brilliant ""interviews"" with his fictional life's characters providing an opinionated commentary upon his actions yet leave ample space for the audience to form their private opinions and critique of both the character and the film. The single word used as a theme is brilliant and sums the purpose and intellect of this work as a discussion topic for everyone over the years. Seldom, do any artist's works elicit such a lasting and thought evoking response. I can well understand why Mr. Welles was proud of this work yet as the man himself would probably reply, Pride, but what is pride but a manifestation of one's ego bordering upon madness???

","Arguably the greatest of American films, Orson Welles's 1941 masterpiece, made when he was only 26, still unfurls like a dream and carries the viewer along the mysterious currents of time and memory to reach a mature (if ambiguous) conclusion: people are the sum of their contradictions, and can't be known easily. Welles plays newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, taken from his mother as a boy and made the ward of a rich industrialist. The result is that every well-meaning or tyrannical or self-destructive move he makes for the rest of his life appears in some way to be a reaction to that deeply wounding event. Written by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, and photographed by Gregg Toland, the film is the sum of Welles's awesome ambitions as an artist in Hollywood. He pushes the limits of then-available technology to create a true magic show, a visual and aural feast that almost seems to be rising up from a viewer's subconsciousness. As Kane, Welles even ushers in the influence of Bertolt Brecht on film acting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind work, and in many ways is still the most modern of modern films from the 20th century."

This movie is, in acting, camera and storyline, sublime beyond comparison. Even though it's a little long at some points (hence the 9 i gave it), some parts of the movie moved me. For example: When Susan-Alexander left him, en he was yelling ""I'm Charles Foster Kane!!"", I really knew how he must've felt. Orson Welles wrote down his own name in history by simply playing this role. Would he have lived today, me thinks people would have honoured him like they would Elvis. Or if he would have been a young actor, I think he would be able to play multiple roles, multiple genres, etc... I admit, 'Citizen Kane' is the only movie i've ever seen featuring Orson Welles, but nevertheless, i can state that he was one of the world's greatest actors.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes was when he was walking through his mansion, 'Xanadu'. Suddenly, he walks into a hallway with mirrors on both sides. result: you see Kane endless times over. By the gods, i thought my eyes were about to pop out.... Me thinks the normal person would not know what was meant with this scene, but if you think it through, you come to realize it resembles his loneliness, the fact that he truly cares for no-one but himself, and that he's alone in his own little world. Honestly, this scene held more hidden emotion than i've ever seen, even more than 'Gladiator' (when Maximus sees his family dead. If that doesn't stir emotion within oneself, then oneself can be called heartless)<br/><br/>The story, overall, was intriguing. But, as I mentioned before, it was a bit long at some aspects. It started out a bit slow. Don't hate me for saying this, it's what i think -_-"".<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is legendary, even more so than Lord of the Rings, or Star-wars even... OK, it's not polite to compare 'Citizen Kane' to movies like them. Hell, I wouldn't even dare remake 'Citizen Kane' for the fact that the public now wishes movies with action, sex, and special effects.

It also is early post-modern: It is made for the viewer, not the glory of the author. The viewer has complete understanding of what is going on, and the characters in the story are lost in a fog wondering what is Rosebud? Each character is stuck in their fixation of their relationship with Charles Foster Kane. Kane is the stage manager of this story. I first saw this film on a late night LA television station in 1966 when I was ten years old. I was alone. I knew I was watching something unique and special like no other film before, old or modern of that time. Later on in college in a film class I was re-introduced to it as a classic masterpiece, the choice viewing of the class. What has to be accepted is its uniqueness. The style can really only work for this film. You have to give Orson Wells great credit of theater to film vision. Another great example is his ""MacBeth"" done on a shoestring budget. I am not sure if it is important that this is the best film of all time. It is the only film that does what it does for its time. Theater vision burst through the camera lens, and if you watch it you never forget it. I think it is better to say that it is a classic best of classic cinema."

","Citizen Kane is the best photographed film in the history of the art! Its dramatic uses of angle and lighting to create moods forever changed the industry, and has been the foundation for the best-filmed movies from its time forward. This alone should make it number one on the list of every movie- lovers ""movies to see"". However, the acting also makes it worthy of a number one rating. Orson Welles is brilliant in his role as a media mogul who rises from less than modest beginnings but never finds satisfaction in achieving the ""American Dream"". His poignant portrayal of the saddest conflict in literature ""man vs. himself"" is truly acting at its best."

","There's not a whole lot to be said about the film that constantly gets cited as the most influential film of all time- it's stylistic and thematic shadows have loomed over American cinema for more then half a century: of it's innovations, praise cannot be oversold. Frame after frame, scene after scene, we witness a stunning freedom from being outside the creatively parasitic bubble that was old Hollywood, afforded by Citizen Kane's masterful star and creator Orsen Welles in a way anyone entrenched into the business of making movies at the time it seemed had no perception about.<br/><br/>With all the controversy concerning the studio and artistic control giving way to Citizen Kane resting high above the AFI's greatest lists most years, you would think the moneymakers would grasp the concept that great things can happen when great chances are taken. Though far from being perfection in motion all the time, Kane is worthy of the lazily used word classic more then just about any movie before or since in this country, if only for it's film vernacular innovation and articulation."

","Citizen Kane (1941)<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1941<br/><br/>Number 1 - 1940s <br/><br/>Top 30 - All Time <br/><br/>'It's Terrific!'<br/><br/>When facing the task of writing a review about 'Citizen Kane', you are burdened with the question: <br/><br/>'Is This The Greatest Film Of All Time?'<br/><br/>Many will say yes before you finish asking the question, but In my opinion I do not think it is the number one film of all time, although it is comfortably cemented in the top 30.<br/><br/>'Citizen Kane' is far ahead of its time. In a period where sentimentalism, over the top acting and romantic extravaganzas dominated Hollywood, here comes a 25 year old, first time filmmaker with a bold and admirable courage to be different.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' first film was so good it could have been destructive. Ironically, 'Kane' was Welles' career peak and there was only one route to follow - downhill; and in fact Orson Welles' never reached the magnificence of 'Citizen Kane' again, rather like Charles Foster Kane in the film, his life spiralled towards destruction in a way like Welles' real life.<br/><br/>Tackling corruption, the derivatives of power and the flaws of a democratic nation, 'Citizen Kane' had some resemblances with the life and career of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. This caused controversies in 1941. Hearst used his media power to crash Welles' project, he went as far as calling Welles a communist. Some cheered others booed the masterpiece. Thankfully the film survived and managed to launch its status among critics and fans around the world as one of the greatest films ever made if not number 1.<br/><br/>The story of a young boy who is adopted by a rich banker and grows up becoming an obsessive newspaper tycoon, wanting to give honest news to the average person and nearly becoming President if it wasn't for an extramarital affair that governed all newspapers the next day.<br/><br/>The opening shots of the film are magnificent, as the camera examines an old palace, the Xanadu, the residence of ageing and frail Charles Kane Foster. We see Kane lying there, hunching over and uttering his last word 'Rosebud'...<br/><br/>The film is told in a series of flashbacks as a newspaper editor seeks to find the meaning of Kane's last utterance. Was it a woman he loved? An artefact he didn't buy? A meaningless word from an old fool? No, none of this; the origin of the word, which is only revealed in the last seconds of this triumphant film is that Rosebud was the name of Kane's sled when he was playing in the snow as a young boy, showing that was his only truly happy time, when he was poor and normal. As we see Kane's fortune being claimed and destroyed at the end and a man throws the sled in the fire, the camera closes-up to the sled and the word 'Rosebud' on it and then do we realise, grinning at the astonishing closure of this film.<br/><br/>Orson Welles' achievement and contribution to 'Citizen Kane' is immeasurable. Not only did he play Kane from his fresh twenties to his dying hours, but he directed the film, produced it and co-wrote its screenplay. Another thing that deserved praise is the cinematography of the film - one of the greatest works ever on film.<br/><br/>One of the greatest works ever in the world of cinema, if not the greatest and one of the most authentic, revitalising, bold attempts in the art of entertainment and storytelling.<br/><br/>10/10"

","It's kind of hard to call myself a lover of movies, or critic when I haven't seen what has heralded as one of the greatest film accomplishments of all-time. ""Citizen Kane"" was one of those movies that have slipped through my fingers as a kid and before you know it, you've never seen it but have only heard about it. In fact, usually you hear so much about some films, you have no motivation to see it. There are people out there (and we meet them all the time) that haven't seen the ""The Godfather"" yet, so situations like this do exist. So, after finally getting my hand on a copy of ""Kane"", I gave the film it's due attention.<br/><br/>A little overrated. Although this film belongs in IMDb's Top 250 and agree ""Kane"" should be considered a benchmark for movie directors, I had a tough time watching this movie. I can see how this movie was groundbreaking in 1941, as the characters (especially Kane himself), writing, acting, storyline and even the cinematography were ahead of its time. But, seeing this movie 60+ years later after its release was like taking a Model-T Ford out for Sunday drive. I literally had to force myself to watch this film, waiting and waiting for me to grasp it and I just couldn't do it.<br/><br/>I really don't think the problem is with the film itself, I think the problem is major generation gap and the fact that we have seen characters like Kane in other films and in real life. Older films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone with the Wind"" are extremely tough to watch when you get older, as your taste for movies is used to today's masterpieces. As mentioned before, Kane's persona was controversial at that time, maybe making him very intriguing and influential. It's hard to embrace this character when he have moguls like Donald Trump in our lives everyday or other films like ""The Aviator"" out there.<br/><br/>For me, for a film to be heralded ""One of the Greatest American Films of All Time"", is needs to stand the test of time. There needs to be a good balance of entertainment that's captivating at the same time. We shouldn't have to pay attention or scrutinize a film to get it. Films like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Godfather"" are these type of masterpieces. Who knows, after our generation, maybe know one will get the ""The Matrix"" or ""Return of the King."" Time will tell."

","Citizen Kane is a 1941 mystery/drama film released by RKO Pictures and directed by Orson Welles, his first feature film. The story traces the life and career of Charles Foster Kane, a man whose career in the publishing world was born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolved into a ruthless pursuit of power and ego at any cost. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is revealed through the research of a newspaper reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word, ""Rosebud."" Citizen Kane is often cited as being one of the most innovative works in the history of film. In 1998 and again in 2007 the American Film Institute placed it at number one in its list of the 100 greatest U.S. movies of all time. In a recent poll of film directors conducted by the British Film Institute, Citizen Kane was ranked number one best film of all time.<br/><br/>The film's main character, Charles Foster Kane, was inspired by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.

","This review is part serious and at times frivolous in the enjoyment of the film, but it is my account, and I am deeply moved by this film after having seen it now in it's entirety.<br/><br/>Rating 10/10 There is so much history behind this film.<br/><br/>The light that goes out perhaps indicating we may not enter so hastily, but as the light slowly returns alight, perhaps we may gain entry slowly, through the passage of this film? One must be reminded of Coleridge's famous poem, Xanadu which is not only quoted here but recreated in flesh, like an edifice of archetypal power and myth.<br/><br/>What's unfortunate about the film is the huge empty space between Charlie as a child and after he takes over the family empire.<br/><br/>What makes Charlie the way he is? What drives him? What are his ideals and where did he learn them? Why does he demand his wife to sing? Why was Emily so quick to believe Gettys and not stand by her own husband? And would there not be some liability after the fact and hearing concerning the libelous blackmail by Getty? It all seemed too easy, too simple and unrealistic. Why do they hole up in Xanadu when they can do anything they want.<br/><br/>Then it hit me, Susan is one of the unicorns from Candy Mountain... and I have the proof! First, Candy Mountain Charlie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5im0Ssyyus Note that every time the unicorn says Charlie! it sounds exactly like Susan. Also note when Susan says Goodbye Charlie it's just like when the unicorn says goodbye to Charlie at the end of the video.<br/><br/>That aside, the review continues.<br/><br/>Why is it the single thing Charles Foster Kane recalls in his demise is rosebud? It is the word of a man who has never truly loved another, or found a deeper truth in their life and that is truly sad. For what is a man that he gain the entire world but lose his own soul? The missing piece that of Rosebud is perhaps the innocence of youth, that folly of being a child when ignorance is bliss, and we still believe in the illusions set before us and our vision is of magical things and high ideals.<br/><br/>Perhaps we all have our Rosebuds, and in the end our memories are either upheld, values restored daily in our endeavors, or they are lost the smoke and dust of our forgotten and meaningless lives.<br/><br/>Now even though there is much left unstated, I have to admit this is a brilliant and important movie, one which tells a story of not just one man, but of all mankind."

","Number One film of all time? Easy to see why. Brilliantly photographed (Gregg Toland), staged (Orson Welles) and performed, with a then radical out-of-tense script (Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles) that flashed backward then forward in time (edited by Robert Wise), one is virtually overwhelmed with its brilliance, on every level.<br/><br/>One's blinded to a couple of chinks in the armor which, in turn, lead to other chinks. They, in turn, lead to the emotionally hollow yet technically impressive response ""Citizen Kane"" ultimately evokes, decades later.<br/><br/>Charles Foster Kane dies alone. He utters the word, ""Rosebud."" A nurse comes in, covers his head with the sheet. Fade to silhouette and then to black.<br/><br/>Fine. Wonderfully effective, visually.<br/><br/>Except the premise for the film rests on reporters somehow ""knowing"" his last word was, ""Rosebud."" Uh, how would they know since nobody was around to hear it? It's a false dramatic premise we're expected to ignore in light of all the ""brilliance"" that follows.<br/><br/>Confronted by one reviewer, after ""Citizen Kane's"" release, by this fact, Welles paused and said, ""Don't tell anybody."" Sloppy plotting and screen writing? Arrogant attitude that, ""Nobody will notice because we're going to blow them away with our technique?"" Easily correctable in post-production. Simply have the nurse, or somebody, overhear ""Rosebud."" But no.<br/><br/>The excitement of displaying their talents must have overtaken everybody, so eager were they to display their creativity, that the Director, Screenwriter(s), Producer and everybody else failed to realize the premise of ""Citizen Kane"" is based on a clumsy plot-point flub: NOBODY HEARD ""ROSEBUD."" That's a gigantic mistake. Understandable, one guesses. Except that professionals in Hollywood in those days rarely let something this egregious make it into their theatres. Minor flub details? Sure. A film's entire premise? Not so much.<br/><br/>Equally problematic? The ending. A direct steal from Alfred Hitchcock's concluding image in ""Rebecca"" a year earlier. Flames engulf Kane's childhood ""Rosebud"" sled just as flames envelop Mrs. Danvers' lovingly handmade nightgown case with ""R"" embroidered on it in ""Rebecca's"" final shot.<br/><br/>Difference? One shot is organic. The other is phony and plagiarized.<br/><br/>""What?"" we ask incredulously. ""The big revelation is that 'Rosebud' was the name of Charles Foster Kane's sled? We've been through all this brilliant movie-making to arrive at  what? Who, at life's end, remembers the name stenciled on their childhood sled? And what's that supposed to mean?"" Compare that stolen final image with Hitchcock's previous image in ""Rebecca,"" where the flames devouring Mrs. Danver's coverlet ""R"" not only recall and evoke every theme in the film  the hovering ghost of Rebecca  but finally consume her last remnant and free our protagonists (the DeWinters) to live and love.<br/><br/>Organic and full of meaning. Certainly not stolen from another director's film.<br/><br/>One watches ""Citizen Kane"" with appreciation for the talents involved, and the wonderfully realized scenes. All ""work."" Yet it doesn't add up. It signifies nothing, gives unrelated insights into several characters and finally devolves into a pseudo-sentimental false childhood image to evoke some ""emotion."" Maybe ""Citizen Kane"" was the best film ever made up to its time. But it's brilliantly talented people showing off technical chops absent any real cinematic heart. Individual scenes are evocative and moving. Add 'em up.<br/><br/>A sled named Rosebud. Huh? Keyword: ""Showing off."" ""Citizen Kane"" if you go along with the story that ""Rosebud"" was actually William Randolph Hearst's nickname for an intimate part of his mistress', Marion Davies', anatomy, sort of works. But then, the burning sled image is meaningless. (Hearst and Davies were supposedly the models for Kane and Susan.) Maybe ""Citizen Kane"" functions best as a demo-reel of the finest young talents in Hollywood at the time.<br/><br/>Not as ""the best film of all time."" That would be ""La Dolce Vita."" A film as full of life and truth and revelation about individuals and society as ""Citizen Kane"" pretends to be.<br/><br/>Where ""Kane"" trumpets style over substance, the hallmark of Orson Welles over his career's wincing downward trajectory . . .<br/><br/>. . . ""La Dolce Vita"" eschews fancy pretension to strip away artifice and reveal character. Watch it again and again. The directorial and cinematographic technique is there in spades. The composition of shots equals anything Gregg Toland achieved in ""Kane."" The shots just don't call attention to themselves (i.e., detract from the characters' revelations of themselves). The seemingly minimalist and improvised script is anything but. Fellini was famous for post-dubbing lines. There is not one word, one syllable, in ""La Dolce Vita"" that doesn't relate to and develop its themes.<br/><br/>Nobody is barnstorming in ""La Dolce Vita,"" cinematically. Yes, the actors as their characters do. But this is not a film that begs, ""Look at how brilliant I am!"" It studiously avoids calling attention to its cinematic brilliance, focusing instead on character arcs.<br/><br/>Result? ""La Dolce Vita's"" final, non-derivative, closeup is perhaps more devastating (summing up the previous three hours) than anything since Gloria Swanson's final closeup equally overwhelmed audiences in ""Sunset Boulevard"" in 1950.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Kane"" and ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" are essential to any collector.<br/><br/>Enjoy and study them for what they truly are.<br/><br/>Of the three, only two still have the power to disturb and upset (i.e, are still emotionally relevant). <br/><br/>""Sunset Boulevard"" reveals lives you and I will never lead.<br/><br/>""La Dolce Vita"" reveals lives, 50 years later, ALL of us now lead, small or large, clinging to the celebrity media circus that has replaced individual integrity and substance.<br/><br/>All three represent peaks of cinema achievement.<br/><br/>One of them stinks from the head (and ending), becoming an artifact of artifice and plagiarism in the name of celebrity ego (Orson Welles').<br/><br/>The other two are self-effacing (they sacrifice technique for character and story).<br/><br/>""Citizen Kane"" is a blow hard impostor to ""best film."" But what a demo-reel!"

","Although only ""one-of-one"" reviewers thought ""Elle S.A.'s"" comments were noteworthy, please read that comment to understand all the technical innovations ""Citizen Kane"" pioneered. I appreciate Welles' genius, but liked him in ""The Stranger"" much better than this movie. All through his career, he started many ""masterpieces"", but never completed them. THAT, as much as Hearst's campaign to prohibit ""Citizen Kane"" from being distributed to theaters (he even tried to buy the original print from RKO, but it was owned outright by Welles), no doubt hampered his being able to get funding for future work.<br/><br/>I am amazed that people consider 1941 as having been in the dark-ages of film-making......wouldn't 1921 be a more appropriate era ? There were many wonderful movies made before 1941....""Gone with the Wind"" ?? ""Kane's"" re-release in 1950 - after ten years of rampant curiosity over the controversy about it - had as much to do with its popularity as Welles' brilliance, simply because black-and-white movies were old-hat by then. I'm sure I saw its original release, but I don't recall being smitten with anything near ""best picture I've ever seen"". I guess I also saw it on TV; same comment. It wasn't until 2006 that I bought the VHS from eBay.........I've watched it twice since then (once last night) - and while I certainly agree it's a great movie - I truly can't say I'm flabbergasted by it. Maybe the DVD will give me a greater appreciation for it. I saw the floral ""Rosebud"" on the kid's sled and recognized all through the movie Kane was looking for the happpiness he could never buy with all his money. He was ruthlessly narcissistic.<br/><br/>Am I mistaken that Kane's ""mother"" (Agnes Moorehead) gave him up to ""Thatcher"" (George Coulouris) after the property they owned became worth a lot of money - like gold ??? - 75 million would have made him a billionaire, today. I DID like the opera-scenes, and suffered right along with ""Susan Kane"" (Dorothy Comingore), off-pitch and all. I'm impressed that this movie was Joseph Cotten's (Jed Leland) American debut as I am with Welles. Ruth Warwick (Emily Kane) impressed me not, but was good for the role. Ray Collins' (Boss Gettys) acting was right-on, as was Everett Sloane as ""Mr. Bernstine"" (?). The cinematography was great, but some camera-angles had been used in other movies.<br/><br/>As for Welles' aging make-up, does anyone remember the fantastic make-up jobs done by Lon Chaney in his horror-films - ""Phantom of the Opera""? I have to constantly remind myself that people who are younger than the film usually are more easily astounded than we older folk are, who have seen it all develop. I'm sure I'd have to argue with ""Citizen Kane"" being proclaimed as NUMBER ONE on any list - my enjoyment is mine, others' are respected, but it has no influence on me. The movie did not make me cry, I wasn't shocked, I wasn't frightened, I wasn't impressed with everything looking so huge and forbidding; in other words, I've enjoyed other movies more. I only mourn that artists get so wrapped-up in themselves - as Welles was - they are their own worst enemies.<br/><br/>Declaring movies (and movie-making) as being ""perfect"" and ""the best film ever"" are different for every individual. It's my opinion a lot of that is because Welles had total control of the film - he must have done an amazing acting-job to get that privilege. It doesn't mean that he didn't have many techs working with him. Bravo! to all, but most of that ""greatest"" obsession is uncalled for, in my opinion."

","I think that this is a really great movie. It is one of those good classics. at first i thought that it was going to be a really boring movie because in my time, around people of my age classic films are no so popular, but i have to say that Orson Wells did a great job writing the screenplay and directing and also acting Thur role of Charles foster Kane. He plays such a controversial character with so much talent. I also like the movie because it gives you a sense of the values that people had in those times and why Kane was so criticized. For example, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room. that was so scandalous because it was thought of as wrong for a married man to be alone with another woman.<br/><br/>I really like the plot of the movie and i think it is a true Hollywood classic."

","This movie is more than a masterpiece. This is flawless. This film stands out above every other one that I've ever seen. It's not my favorite film, but I'm sure that this is the best ever, and will remain that way, no matter what film could come along. When you combine Orson Welles, Herman Mancawiez, and Joseph Cotten, there's not much thought in your mind that it's bad. The almost two hours revolve around a fascinating mystery that takes one man all around the country trying to figure out the last words of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon who had died not long before. Oh, and, of course, the surprise ending-but, if you haven't seen it, it will ruin your experience. But make sure you're bored yet happy when you watch it. A rainy day is the perfect time. It's worth a 10/10, and, although it may not be a 10.0, it falls just short. It's much closer to a ten in my mind that a nine.

","Most filmmakers take on simple subjects. Most finished works have defined edges, they fit within a comprehensible space. The finished picture is usually just a beginning/middle/happy ending formula. To present it, the whole is jigged into 'parts', usually just those 3 pieces which effortlessly snap together in the mind. From my previous comments you can probably glean what filmmakers are on that end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>The young Welles was special, a revolutionary. He's on the opposite end of that spectrum with Kubrick, Kurosawa, Ridley Scott, most of Woody Allen's work, among others. The 'Kane' puzzle seemingly is a simple end product -- but it's jigsawed into at least 1000 pieces. The final 'piece' (Rosebud) eludes us, driving us mad.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is like the box of pieces strewn on the table -- what are we seeing? The most common way to solve a puzzle is to first find the edges; Welles defines those edges in a 'newsreel', with movie footage interspersed among historical newsreels and fictional 'newsreels'. This gives us the parameters within which to figure out the middle. Try to imagine ""JFK"", for example, without this influence.<br/><br/>Along the way, Welles plays with story narrative; who can complete the story? the diary? the second wife? the major-domo? the estranged friend? Kane's office lieutenant? We seem to go in circles, and yet we keep pushing forward, because we're convinced the piece is there, somewhere. Our surrogate in the story has to put this all together for us. We see what the investigator sees, just slightly more because of our perspective; over his shoulder, or while he lurks undefined in the shadows.<br/><br/>But far more important is the visual narrative. The compositions of light, camera stance, motion of the eye, previously unheard of perspectives...it all literally draws us into a different world -- the mind of not just a story teller, the mind of a filmmaker. There's so much detail, so much to appreciate and just languish in. This, by God, is a movie.<br/><br/>There are many reasons Kane ranks at or near the top of every list of greats. Think of all of the movies that have borrowed from this...it's staggering. That says it all..."

Evidence of this is through the camera angles as they pan around, then up and into buildings. It is directed brilliantly by Orson Welles, who's presence really oozes out of the screen (and he plays the eldest Kane so well, that you cannot think of anything that would improve it).

"victor7754","10","0","1","26 March 2006"," The Art of Classical Film-making
","Director and Star Orson Wells takes the art and technique of film-making to outstanding levels in this fictional biography of a Newspaper Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. The film is said to be a veil on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper magnate in the 1920's and 30's who was popular in politics and once interviewed Hitler but was also cited as creating loosely based stories with phony characters and deceiving the reader. Citizen Kane plays on the The True Greek Tragedy that Aristotle set in stone. A true tragedy is the fall of someone great in stature, especially if that someone was self made as is Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>The Film takes us on the journey of a successful mans life, from the age of 8 to his death. Director Wells uses every film technique to capture this journey captivating the story and propelling a mans 70 year life into a 145 minute time frame. The angles and shadows crisscrossing the rooms and characters, the elapsing of time through dissolves and transitions, optical printing of lay overs in the reel, and the use of space all laid out in beautiful black and white photography. Every scene is well executed and the aging of Mr. Kane transfers off the screen in a magical way. A riddle is laid upon the viewer and it's answer is heart breaking and questionable as to what we become from who we were because we have to succeed. Beware the power of ownership. Citizen Kane is a well crafted and flawless piece of art. It is spellbinding at times and magical in its storytelling. Orson Wells had an enlightened sense to a film technique that is worth studying for filming future stories. Powerful."

","Alright...I'll be quick and short about this. Citizen Kane is simply one of the best films ever made. Mr. Wells did an excellent job of putting together Citizen Kane with his brilliant acting, directing and writing. The film is a very good example of a 'bildungsorman' (that is a literary term from the German meaning a tale of discovery). Wells pieced together the sad story of a rags-to-riches man in the early 20th century with amazing detail. The story being told in bits and pieces gives the viewer time to put the shards together and form their own opinion about Kane as the movie plays on. Wells used many varying stiles and angles in the shooting of the film and his use of lighting gives the movie the perfect feel. It is best to watch this movie knowing little about the actual story because that makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Although Orson Wells himself preferred 'The Trial' and 'Chimes at Midnight' more 'rewarding', I personally find Citizen Kane one of the most amazing and influential films of the twentieth century."

","The greatest film of all time. Who ever knew that the greatest American film could be so... European? Rumor has it that Orson Welles saw Le Jour Se Leve, and the fotogenie of that film influenced him to adopt some of the camera techniques that were used for this landmark of cinema. It is infused with minimal comedy (seeing the young Kane starting a newspaper is perhaps the most lighthearted moment in the film), epic drama, detail, detail, detail, a powerful storyline and message (money doesn't buy happiness), brilliant writing, dialogue, camera work, and acting, especially on welles' part. the greatest thing about citizen kane? welles has given us the key to figuring out the enigma that is the title character through the revelation of rosebud. i had a huge grin on my face when this was pointed out to me in my film study class. However, we can sit here and praise Kane for all we want, but the point is that works of art such as this are being ignored by many people who are my age (19). many will opt for stoner flicks, cheap horror movies, and mind numbingly dull action movies. too many people are stuck in the star wars state of mind, and i've moved on beyond that. years ago. if people are serious about cinema, they'll take exactly two hours of their time to view citizen kane. you may not catch on at first, but with subsequent viewings, it flows much more easier. but this is merely a pipe dream of mine, but i'll give you my testament. i just decided to see citizen kane one day, because i felt it shouldn't be voted as the greatest film of all time. i was wrong - dead wrong."

I can not give too much more detail without spoiling the movie, but I must say that this movie did not do much more then tell a story about a journalist who is trying to figure out what Kane's(the prominent figure I spoke of earlier) dying words meant. The movie makes no effort to give the viewer a feeling of connection with any of the characters. This was a film where I was unable to connect to any of the characters. There is very little character development, and very little plot advancement. If you want to watch a classic, go with Gone With the Wind or Casablanca. If you want to watch a movie where Orson Welles does a wonderful job of acting, you may want to skip over this one and go with The Third Man.

","This movie had powerful characters. Mr.Kane started out wanting to be honest and having what seemed to be good motives, but how does it go- absolute power corrupts absolutely?! Anyway, life is full of choices and along the way he made some wrong choices which led to more and more wrong choices. As in real life if we make wrong choices but recognize that we have and repent of them and learn from them then we are not doomed to repeat the same failures. Kane became so absorbed with controlling those around him. I think this might have come from not being able to have control of his childhood. He lost the guidance and love of his parents at an early age and that he was traded in for the money was very hurtful. This definitely left a hole in his life and a feeling of a lack of affirmation. So as life started becoming more complicated he began to try to fill that hole and gain that affirmation in a very unhealthy manner. The ""rosebud"" phrase was very intriguing and mystifying. I wondered about that myself and read some IMDb comments. When you think about it his life went from the innocence of the ""rosebud sled childhood"" to a life of making it on his own and being his own man at a very early age. How much trauma is experienced from so many all over the world who lose their parents through whatever circumstance. All the things in the world can not replace the love of 2 parents that unconditionally love a child. This world would certainly be in better shape if everyone experienced that kind of love!"

The script is also slightly overdone in the typical old-fashioned way, although it's still good, but the thing that really has stood the test of time is the directing, it's an extremely well photographed movie.<br/><br/>There's some great scenes in Citizen Kane, but there's also some forgettable ones. The film loses some momentum in the second half although it still manages to hold your attention.

Given that I just turned my 21 I knew perfectly well it wouldn't be a flawless experience for me to to see the movie.Yeah to be honest at some points(in the beginning)I felt bored but seriously I said to myself: Come on this movie must be at the top of IMDb list for a reason right?"" Then I displayed the required patience and I am pretty glad that I have seen this movie at last.Like Jorge Luis Borges said this movie is a ""metaphysical detective story"". Its subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined. All we need to do is to combine and reconstruct the fragments of this man's life portrayed perfectly by Orson Welles.With that in my mind I loved the movie and I do know that I gotta evaluate a movie according to the time it is produced. Think about it its production date is 1941 and some techniques used in the movie --series of jump cuts shot on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following the cut would look as if it took place at a time long after the previous cut. --Unprecedented use of deep focus. In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. If you are very young and not patient enough you may not appreciate the movie but if you can be patient enough you will understand why so many people give high points to that movie but it is the time-honored fact that ""Citizen Cane"" is a very old movie and it is still associated with Hearst-Welles struggle."

","There's no denying that 'Citizen Kane' is Orson Welles's greatest achievement as a filmmaker. Made when he was only 25 (it was released the same month he turned 26), he wrote, directed, and starred in it as newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, seemingly a man with everything one could ask for. Maybe everything but true happiness? Very early we see that Kane dies, and his last words were only a whisper, ""Rosebud."" But who, or what, was Rosebud? No one close to Kane had any idea. And, as the movie ends, only the viewing audience has a clue.<br/><br/>It always amazes me when a person, or a group, puts any effort into the argument of ""which film is the greatest of all time."" The way I see it, there's nothing riding on it. There are no generally-accepted criteria. The ""experts"" will never agree. It is a battle which has no conclusion. So I don't worry if 'Citizen Kane' is the number one. Most significantly, it was a pioneer of a number of different movie-making approaches, and has influenced countless films which came after it. It is perhaps ironic that Welles was 25 when he made 'Citizen Kane' and, while he had roles in over 100 movies, directed 38, and wrote or produced a large number, he will forever be remembered for this one.<br/><br/>I didn't have the opportunity to see 'Citizen Kane' in the theater, but I have seen it recently on DVD.

"Manthorpe","8","0","8","15 November 2004"," Generously, 8/10
","For the record, I despise writing reviews for classic films, particularly the old ones. For one, it is impossible for me to write this in perspective to the the time it was released as my parents weren't even born yet, much less myself. Two, it's impossible to enjoy it to it's fullest because of the inherent aging of the techniques and effects used. With that taken into consideration, ""Citizen Kane"" being a film sixty-three years old, I was immensely impressed with the environmental and makeup effects. It's simple amazing that they were able to do what they did in that time period. I have seen recent low budget movies that don't even hold up to this, and that's sad. <br/><br/>CK set a massive number of precedents when it was released; not only technical precedents, but precedents in the amount of control given directors in that time. Welles basically had full and complete control which was simply unheard of and it seems to have worked to his benefit. However, given the many precedents it set, the film didn't totally and completely impress me, and I have no doubt in my mind that it's a result of my growing up when I did and seeing the films I have seen. Many, many films have used the same techniques since, many that are more entertaining. While I found most of the story and screenplay extremely interesting, it drags it's feet in several places which was distracting. And although the acting performances were fairly impressive, I had serious problems with Dorothy Comingore's performance as Thomas' wife. She didn't convince me. Her performance was forced at times, and simply satisfactory at others. Welles was easily the standout in the acting department, I'll say.<br/><br/>I will also be willing to admit that maybe my expectations were a tad higher than they should have been; me expecting to be blown away. I liked it, I really did, and I have nothing but respect for the precedents it set....especially in comparison to other films made in the same era. It just had problems with entertaining me at times. However, despite my problems with it, I feel ""Citizen Kane"" is a truly great film, just not one of my favorites. I think most of it's fame comes from it's technical brilliance as opposed to it's entertainment value. With that said, I'll give it 8/10, generously."

","I saw this film last night for the first time. I can certainly appreciate the life story of a man who becomes increasingly closed, controlling, and frustrated in his search for love and adoration, maybe for himself.<br/><br/>The one flaw I felt the movie had was that it focused too much on Kane's personal life and not much on his public life. And what is shown of his public life is equivocal. <br/><br/>His ""principles"" published in an early issue of his paper were hardly convincing given his previous desire to harass some average Joe for good copy. Maybe this is the point, that he was a fellow that never had principles, but then one wonders why his friend was so easily taken in by this melodramatic gesture (publishing the principles) when it is really just a ploy. As an old man, this friend says Kane never had any principles. But that seems fairly clear from the beginning. So, though the friend perceives a change and at one point openly voices worries about a change in the man, there is really no change. It is all a bit undramatic from the point of view of Kane's public life. This makes the film more realistic, of course. He doesn't really change just becomes more of what he always was in the negative ways. But it makes the movie less dramatic. There was also too much time spent on the second marriage. This part dragged.<br/><br/>Certainly the film portrays sterility in leadership from a class ""born to rule"". In a deep way Kane did not want to rule and did not want to play the role set out for him. There was the lack of passion coming from a road not freely chosen. Much of his early journalistic efforts are made to thumb his nose at his benefactor and all he stands for. One even if he half intentionally sabotaged his political career. He wants what we all want it turns out, acceptance of himself for himself. And the character is interesting. But I think they could have done more with the public career of the man to give the film more impact.<br/><br/>As for Rosebud, I think it represents the path not taken--not what he lost or some search for love, but simply the man he would have been if had stayed with his parents and chosen his life more freely rather than having fortune thrust upon him."

I did like the ""twist"" ending though. Since then I have seen it maybe a dozen times and it just keeps getting better and better. To me this is the sign of a classic film. Is it ""the greatest film ever made""? Of course not, there is no such thing, you cant compare a drama to a comedy to a musical to a documentary, etc. But I can say one thing, this is a great film. As a photography enthusiast, I find the beautiful black and white cinematography absolutely stunning. The lighting is incredible and if you haven't seen the recent 2 DISC DVD set you are in for a real treat. The film transfer is incredible, the film looks like new. I like the film just as it is, not too long as many are complaining, just right. I would say to all the nay sayers here, SEE IT A FEW TIMES before you declare this to be ""garbage""! You couldn't be more wrong. This is one for the ages and belongs on any list of great films."

","It occurs to me that most of you, with all due respect, should get their priorities straight. Namely: there's the movie of Citizen Kane itself, which is rich enough to provide for lots of interesting questions, and there's the question wether it should be rated best movie ever made. However uninteresting the last question, it seems the one most of you are trying to answer. If you want to know wether it really is the best film ever made, or the worst or second worst or third best, i suggest you do that somewhere else. Let's talk about film, if you please.<br/><br/>How can one say that rosebud is not interesting? Can anyone explain that to me? Why should i forget about it, when it seems to play such an important role in the story? Maybe i need not know what it meens, or maybe it's wrong to try to find out the truth behind it, but it sure asks to be thought about.<br/><br/>And how about the collectioning-fetish of Kane? Why statues? I think, maybe, because you can count on statues not to leave you, always to be there.<br/><br/>Another interesting view on the piece as a whole is the question: say that you have all the power you want, not only moneywise, but you seem to be able to persuade people into doing almost anything. In other words: you have total control over your life, and it seems you can mold it into anything you want. Does that guarantee happiness? No, because Kane got everything he planned for, but not the thing he really wanted: love (and giving it). So then: the thought that we have that control over our lives is an illusion.<br/><br/>Next: the mystery of man is as old as man himself. As long as we have been on earth, we've also been trying to find an answer to the question: who the hell are we? The reporter trying to find the truth about rosebud (which, in turn would be the truth about Kane), is a symbol for man trying to understand man. In the end he says something like: 'the truth about a human being is not to be found in a word'. Therewith saying that man (Kane) will remain a mystery.<br/><br/>Anyone thinks this makes sense or not? SHould i be thinking about Citizen Kane in these terms or not? Please react, i could be wrong about everyting."

","I recently got a chance to see Citizen Kane again in my film class.  I watched it for the first many years before but didn't really appreciate it so I was looking forward to see what became of it now. <br/><br/>
The opening scene sticks in my mind first off because it's very dark and gives you an uneasy feeling in the same way Hitchcock did with Psycho. Orson Welles was the kind of person who would break the rules when it came to filmmaking as he made films different to others, but keep in mind he was a theatre director so he knew how to trick audiences and I suppose he does the same with Citizen Kane which leaves you wondering what the word `Rosebud' meant.  Welles did create a whole new genre I think but there are a few negative points about Citizen Kane which I feel I must share with you. I didn't think it was long enough to get a real feeling for Charles Foster Kane because there was hardly much to see about him growing up.  It shot through different generations of his life to fast to even care about what he was about.  But that doesn't make it a bad film, just not a great one.  It may have been something huge and inventive in it's day but I wouldn't go as far as saying it was the greatest film of all time as the critics say.  I could honestly name 20 other films which are just as good, Citizen Kane sticks in everyone's mind because it was fresh but when you look at it now it offers nothing new.   <br/><br/>Nevertheless the camera work in this was just fantastic when his father and mother are talking to Thatcher in their house but through the window you could see Charles Foster Kane as a small boy sledging through the snow and then it cut to a scene where his mother was looking outside at him and then kept with her and the other two characters till they got outside which must have been very hard to do back then and the lighting in Citizen Kane is probably the best I have ever seen."

I wasn't born in the USA and I'm only 28 years old, so I think it's hard for me to feel so impressed by this film that is about someone I had never heard about. I'm sure my opinion would be different if I had lived the days the movies deals about or if I was American and had always heard about Mr. Kane.<br/><br/>Anyway, analysing ""Citizen Kane"" as a film... I may say I liked it. It's black and white and the images are bad, but it just brings some kind of beauty to this documentary / drama movie picture. Orson Welles is great again. His performance is just unforgettable."

","What else can one say about a movie that everything has been said, and better?  Although not my favorite movie, ""Citizen Kane"" represents a force of will never expressed quite so well by an American filmmaker. ""Citizen Kane"" educates not only filmmakers but teaches discerning viewers how to watch a movie of personal expression. The first hour is so good that I keep watching when the plot drags after his affair with Susan Alexander is exposed and costs him a governorship (""Candidate caught in love nest with 'singer,'"" is a wonderfully inspired headline; note the single quotes around ""singer,"" implying that Alexander is not to be confused with Maria Callas). The news-reel sequence remains fresh and exciting upon repeated viewings, using techniques that Woody Allen employed to dulling effect in ""Zelig."" The movie is watching simply for the dialogue, for which Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles received the film's only Oscar; note Mr. Bernstein's speech about a girl in a white parasol; Welles reciting his ""declaration of principles"" with Joseph Cotten's reminder, ""That's the second sentence you've begun with I;"" Welles, as Kane, completing a drunken Jed Leland's negative review of Alexander's Chicago operatic debut because, says Leland (Cotten), ""he wanted to prove he was an honest man; an aging Welles telling his financial adviser from youth that he still should be addressed as Mr. Thatcher ""because you're too old to be called anything else;"" but most of all Cotten with Welles on election night and proposing a toast to ""love on my terms, because those are the only ones you'll ever get."" And we haven't mentioned ""Rosebud,"" Gregg Toland's cinematography or Bernard Herrmann's score. All the more reason to watch this American original.

","As we are now three years into the new millenium, the movie industry has become all nostaglic about films, and wanted to put polls of the greatest movies ever made. Due to this, the Orson Welles movie ""Citzen Kane"" has been rated highly in these charts. However does it really deserve the actual ratings it has been awarded?<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple, and I must warn you that there is some spoilers involved in this review. The story of this movie is like so; A rich and influential man named Charles Foster Kane, is on his deathbed. He mutters his final words ""Rosebud"" before kicking the bucket. Since this man was extremely rich, powerful and famous, his last quote has perplexed and bamboolzed the public and journalists alike. Was Rosebud a girl he knew, an associate he worked with? What does it actually mean?Due to this, an investigative journalist wanted to find out the meaning behind the word. The associates and the girlfriends that have been interviewed give a vivid story of the rags to riches of Mr Kane. From the humble beginnings of Charles as an orphan, who was looked after and raised up by a couple of merchant bankers. His fame and influence grew further and further as he began to become a news editor of the Inquirer, with promises of providing honesty and truth in ever print. However, as his influence grew, so did his ruthlessness. By the time he became a media bigwig and delving his hands into poltics, he began to lose his friends and associates. His love life did not suceed much either, with two divorces in his lifetime.<br/><br/>I will choose to stop here, so that you can know what the ending of the movie is like. The acting is quite good, especially the main star, Orson Welles. His portyal of Charles Foster Kane was a gem to watch, even when the character grows older and older. Also the camerawork was groundbreaking at the time, which seems to be commonplace in movies nowadays.<br/><br/>
However I did find some flaws about it. One flaw I found was this movie was a bit melodramatic. It seems that the actors were overacting and it did seem a bit annoying. Also I found that the movie was a bit too long and could have been edited a bit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a good movie, however I personally do not think it should have a big rating in the polls of the greatest films ever. To be honest, the only reason it is seen one of the greatest movies is due to the American influence, that this is one of the greatest movies, since it was American. If so, why is the Italian Job nor The Seventh Samurai are not voted as one the greatest movies ever."
"perfectbond","7","0","2","9 December 2003"," Groundbreaking classic
","I found Citizen Kane to be a technically innovative and fairly engaging film. It is a great parable about what is really important in life: a childhood filled with love (ie. Rosebud). I wouldn't say that it is necessarily in my top one hundred films of all time but I can appreciate the arguments of those who say it is. What is undeniable is that it is a classic cinematic masterpiece whose pioneering techniques of visual storytelling influence filmmakers to this day.

","In the beginning scene of this movie we see a multimillionaire tycoon by the name of Charles Foster Kane die alone in his extravagant mansion Xanadu. When Kane passes, we see him drop what appears to be a snow globe, and one word is spoken: Rosebud. Attempting to figure out what this Rosebud means that is spoken of, many reporters tack down family and friends of Kane. The close ones tell their stories and memories to the reporters in a flashback; however, nothing of this Rosebud is ever mentioned. Never is the riddle of his dying breath reveled. The story of Charles Kane in the middle of his castle estate is a man dying while examining a scene in the center of a snowball. As he drops it, the globe smashes and just one word is spoke: Rosebud. What follows is pieces of newspaper footage showing us how Kane revealed his future, and there is a huge, unexpected ending. One that will surely prove your theory of this Rosebud to be wrong."

","When many films from the 1960s now seem ridiculously dated, it's amazing how modern 'Citizen Kane' still feels after over 60 years.  The scene composition, the lighting, the credits, the discontinuous narrative, the moral ambivalence of its 'hero', all seem to belong to a much more recent era.  Even the themes - the power of the press, celebrity, ambition, etc. still all seem pertinent - and what is Xanadu if not Disneyland?  Of course, some of the dialogue inevitably seems clumsy, and the final conclusion is slightly weak, but few if any films can have so expanded the cinematographic vocabulary of their time.  Still much more than the greatest ever film about a man in love with a sledge!"

","One major question comes to mind when watching Citizen Kane. How can a 25 year old newcomer write, direct and produce one of the greatest American films of all time? It's amazing, it boggles the mind. It may be unbelievable, but Orson Welles did this very thing. And, all the way back in 1941. Very few filmmakers have accomplished such a feat. Although directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson have tried, they can't top the original. Citizen Kane is a technical masterpiece and for very good reasons. The cinematography is brilliant. The style is revolutionary and very engaging. Unique camera angles are sprinkled throughout the film, such as the very low floor shot angles and other great techniques. Also the special effects in the film are superb. All the effects that we take for granted today were created and used here. The lighting design is some of the best ever, playing with light and shadow to create a variety of moods. The shadows are used to great effect to convey emotion with the black and white film style. But the one thing that makes Citizen Kane a great movie even to this day, is all the symbolism. A conversation could last hours discussing all the hidden meanings in the film. What do all the aspects represent? What do the metaphors mean? Is it a semi-biography of W.R. Hearst? You know it's a great film when you can watch it multiple times and find different meanings with each viewing. Is it the best film of all time? Maybe. That's debatable. But it's definitely good. You'll have to find that out for yourself. But movie fans and newcomers alike will enjoy this fantastic piece of cinema for all the things is has to offer. A definite must see to all the aspiring film makers out there. See the original and then criticize the imitators. You don't know good film until you've seen Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Overall grade for Citizen Kane:  A+"

","Spoiler Alert Citizen Kane, started in a new way that most movies back in the late 30's to early 40's never really started. It began with the death of citizen Kane in his home by himself uttering the last word of rosebud. Then throughout the film a reporter was trying to figure out what Kane's last word meant. He interviews his old wives, friends, employees, he starts to figure out how Kane really was a man with out feelings, just power hungry and wealthy. While I watched the movie I went through many feelings, such as disappointment, anger and sadness. I was disappointed that Kane never came to realize why all of his wives left him, and why his friends slowly departed. He worked to hard and always wanted to better himself and not anyone else. Anger because he treated his friends and wives like their feelings did not have any meaning. But sadness because he never came to be happy he started his life unhappy and through the film he tried to buy his happiness but never succeeding but of course how did this man die, by him self. With no one, to even say goodbye to, that man must of had a very dark life. This mans life was dark, and the film portrayed that, not just by his actions but also by the lighting and music when he was alone or even the time when he was in his large home with the singer with he sat way away from her in the dark and she was by the fire doing a puzzle. The films last scene was Kane's ex-employees and reporters packing everything up that way they could get rid of it and sell it. They never figure out what rosebud meant but we did as the last shot was a sled with the name rosebud burning in the fireplace. I enjoyed the film it takes you through the life of someone you never knew, and it had pretty good detail and accuracy. Not only that but shows how different the films were back in the early forty's."
"Shortee16","8","0","2","17 November 2003"," Overflowing with symbolism
","Citizen Kane , though not the most entertaining film, it is a remarkable landmark in the film industry. All for its first time usage of more advanced camera angles and many other filming techniques. Though Citizen Kane lacked what is now by audiences perceived as entertainment, it actually overflowed with metaphors and symbolic meanings in every scene. On example is in the way the first scene begins, which is at the end of Kane's life (Orson Welles) the entire movie plot is centered on his last word `Rosebud' Thus commencing the search for the meaning of this word. Rosebud has an incredible meaning to Kane's life. The Audience later on discovers it is the name of his childhood sled. By making that word his last it set an enormous symbolic meaning of what his wished his life would not have become. Also during the same death scene Kane is holding a globe in his hand which drops and brakes as he dies, symbolizing the messy and scattered life style that was ending then. As far as film techniques go, Citizen Kane is also full of meaning behind the technique used for different and specific scenes. During some scenes in order to create a mindset on the audience Kane is placed by camera angles above the rest of the actors, immediately making him the scenes dominant subject. This is only one example of the very well thought out techniques used in this film. It is believed that Citizen Kane is a representation of William R. Hearst's life. For Kane (Hearst) buys a major newspaper and his life very well portrays Hearst's life. Kane is a person seen and described very differently by those around him. His ex-wife and his closest `friends' were interviewed to discover the meaning of his last word and about his rich and happy life. Even though that is what his life was thought out to be full of Kane was a poor and miserable man, who failed at two marriages and didn't own anything that brought full satisfaction to him. Citizen Kane possesses so many hidden things throughout the entire film that it is necessary to watch many times just to catch small and detailed symbolic events , and even objects. This film is sure to make one think and become an observer of what is very easily overlooked. A downward spiral of a miserable man's life is how Citizen Kane can be best described as."
"Blondeatheart56","7","0","4","16 November 2003"," A good film, but not a great film
","""Citizen Kane"" has been a famous movie for a long time now. This reviewer had no clue as to why before watching the film, and even now after having seen it with her own eyes this reviewer still does not know why it is so famous.  Like every movie it has its impressive areas and it's ""I just don't want to pay attention to this"" areas.  ""Citizen Kane"" is a film with little entertainment value.  Entertainment is an important factor in holding an audience's attention.  It did have some rather, dare I say it, boring parts. But there were a few scenes that made up for the lack of entertainment value throughout the film.<br/><br/>""I think it would be fun to run a newspaper.""  That quote was the best line in the whole film.  It, itself, provided a great deal of laughter and entertainment for the watching audience.  If there was one thing about ""Citizen Kane"" that should never be forgotten, it is definitely that line. In this film, there is a scene that takes place at the Inquirer.  It is very busy and noisy.  Kane (Orson Welles), Leland (Joseph Cotten), and the Inquirer's Editor-in-Chief (Erskine Sanford) are all trying to talk at the same exact time and it gets rather confusing.  It is really very interesting.  A viewer could go from a sleepy pose to a wide awake pose just from watching this scene.  It certainly grabbed this reviewer's attention.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Citizen Kane"" was actually very believable and realistic. It didn't seem like the actors/actresses had a movie camera stuck in their faces and were talking on cue.  It seemed like you could be looking in through a window and just see everyday life being carried out.  This reviewer was very impressed by the acting jobs.  The actors/actresses were not half-bad, except for one.  Susan Alexander Kane, Kane's second wife, was being pressured by her husband to be an opera singer.  Well, she got bad reviews on her singing and I'm afraid that Dorothy Comingore, the actress who played her, would have to get bad reviews on her acting from this reviewer.  She was overly-dramatic and just plain annoying.  She was constantly screaming at her husband and this reviewer just wished the noise would stop!  If Comingore's character was meant to come across as loud and obnoxious then she did a wonderful job portraying that! But if the character was meant to be anything else then maybe the casting director should have found another actress to play the part.<br/><br/>Special Effects!  When people these days think of special effects they think of things blowing up constantly or even things that you see in ""The Matrix"" trilogy, like time just stopping or people flying through the air.  That is what special effects are in the year 2003.  But back in the 1940's that wasn't.  ""Citizen Kane"" was probably full of special effects, but since they aren't anything really noticeable or unusual for our time period, most of them probably wouldn't be noticed.  This reviewer caught two types of special effects used in the movie, and actually one of them was probably over-used.   Fading from scene to scene or from picture to picture was a brand new thing back then.  These days it's used all the time and it's hardly even noticed, but when ""Citizen Kane"" was made fading was huge! That's probably why it was used so much throughout the film.  It's like when you get something brand new and you use it over and over again until it's worn out.  That's what this film did with fading.  It used it so much it started to become over-used.   Although, this reviewer will admit, it is pretty nifty, and ""Citizen Kane"" used it well.  Another special effect this film used was pretty awesome.  In some scenes when one character was meant to be the focus of the scene that character would be lit up so you could see them perfectly, and the other characters would be in the shadows, so the viewer wouldn't want to pay attention to them.  This reviewer thought that was pretty cool.<br/><br/>The costumes in this film were fitting to the time period.  The men mostly wore suits and hats and the ladies mostly wore modest dresses.  Unless, of course, they were a dancer, then they were wearing short dresses that drew lots of attention to the women wearing them.<br/><br/>There was a great deal of music in this film.  There was music in the background, music that you could hear playing on a radio in the scene, music being played by a band, and music being played on the piano.  There was opera singing and just regular singing too.  This reviewer loves music and seeing that much of it in one film is great!<br/><br/>Overall, ""Citizen Kane"" is a good film.  Not great, but good.  This reviewer wouldn't say it was the number one all time best film ever, but then again, this reviewer's understanding of the film doesn't reach as far as others. If a viewer of my age was given the chance to buy this film, they most likely wouldn't jump at the opportunity.  If a viewer of an older age who fully appreciates these types of films were offered that same chance they probably would.  ""Citizen Kane"" was a film not to be easily forgotten."

Well, how about The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi, The Seventh Seal, or even the overlooked masterpiece Ordinary People?

I always laugh at the scene where the staff is going to present Kane with the trophy, but then he goes outside- does Leland really have to say ""Let's go to the window!""

","A famous entrepreneur of the 1940s by the name of Billy Rose once told Welles ""Orsan quit! you'll never top it"". Who would have thought that he was on the dote with what he meant? No film I can think of has a more flawless ensemble, a more driving and intriguing story told in a more elegant and beautiful way. After finishing a film like Citizen Kane, you never forget it.<br/><br/>Its innovative structure, its flawless cinematography, its flawless editing, and its near flawless performances. Profound statements on memory and historical rememberance. Almost flawless on every imaginable stratum I could possibly think of. It may seem that I have abstracted the term ""flawless"", but I am only giving credit to where its due. Welles has crafted a masterpiece for all times, and its my favourite Orsan Welles film after Chimes at Midnight -- another masterful work of art by Orsan Welles. Even after 62 years of its premier in New York, Citizen Kane still stands out as the only film conceptualized and consummated too perfectly."

","Finally I get to see the most 'groundbreaking' film of all time, and I'm not sure if I'm so impressed. It may well have changed how films were made, and I can see a couple innovations that were intriguing. One was the much-discussed shot of the camera going past the hotel's sign, though the roof windows, to the table. Another is the really innovative camera angles. It seemed that the lower moments in Kane's life were captured in a low angle, which contradicts the feeling of the viewer being inferior when lower than the character. I must admit that my knowledge of what 'rosebud' was ruined the mystery somewhat, and I had that knowledge because of spoofs, of all things. If I had not known, I would have been more captivated by the character's quest to find out the significance of 'rosebud'."

","The fact that most Hollywood films of today live for 'profits' and 'success' before sacrificing for great direction and narration doesn't surprise me that we have films in this era that will never (NEVER) reside on the same plane as 'Citizen Kane'. Films are getting worse from where they started.  I'm not saying that all films are bad coming out now, I'm simply saying for every one good film coming out in 2003 80 weak films (The Twin Towers happily falls into this category) only worth the advertising money that was spent on them to get all of us flocking like sheep to go see them are making me want to think twice the next time I attempt to relinquish my cherished time to set foot into today's movie theatre. What gets me is how so many films worth their weight in gold aren't being showcased at all (Good films don't need to be showcased as much as bad films ((history proves that)), word of mouth still precedes over the most flamboyant advertising campaign out there).  I simply hold that if these great films like 'Citizen Kane' were showcased like the films of today they wouldn't be any worse to look at than how they were when you had to go out of your way to dig them up and watch them at a library.  I believe the genius would still last in them and make us a more learned,skeptical society when it came to cheesy films coming to theatres every week asking for our viewing (more so our money). We don't know the equation (if there ever could be one) on how to make a film=masterpiece.  I know for sure after seeing 'Citizen Kane' that Orson Welles' came pretty close to this equation.  Many foreign film makers before Well's time (and even today...France,Italy,Germany,Mexico,Iran:Color of Paradise (1999)) have also succeeded in approaching this 'perfect equation' as happily and unknowingly as most of will be able sit through a 'great' movie at awe and soak in all of its genius practically for granted.<br/><br/>I already expect that from foreign film-German film literally brought Hollywood to level that it reigns at today.  Shockingly enough Orson Welles was an American director and made a 'great film'...very hard to do in 1941 if you were an American film maker who usually had to stick with creating the stereotyped 'box office hits' of that time. Say what you like about how 'overrated' and 'over estimated' 'Citizen Kane' seemed to be.  Then again you can focus on watching 'Friends' every Thurdsay night for some sense of trying to diminish the fact that you contain the personality of a brick when it comes to comprising your social life.  My main grudge with the youth of today is they aren't watching these 'great films', they don't know how far movies have come let alone where they originated from.  Hollywood is using this ignorant youth as the main entity who go and pay to see such films that are supposedly 'geared' for them.<br/><br/>The next time you hear about films (especially worthless ones i.e. teenieBop, feminazi,teeniehorrorBop,epic thriller, etc.) that were made for a specific audience/generation in that specific 'time/era/period' think about the time when you didn't study for a test and decided to cheat in order to pass it.  You may have passed it and gotten away single handedly with cheating but in the end all you have to speak for of that class you cheated on is the piece of paper that shows your passing grade.  You'll stop caring why you took the class in the first place let alone why your going to school: (in a politically correct world) to learn and gain more knowledge. Therefore you either look down upon that certain subject until your able to go back and maybe ascertain it or give that certain subject total lack of respect whether it be Math, Economics etc. As long as films like 'Citizen Kane' are being showcased as 'washed up' and 'great in its time' we mine as well cheat for everything in life. Focus on the 'cool' and care less about the movies that make you contemplate and consider, expand your thoughts like school is supposed to do.  Hollywood may obtain a foothold on the film industry as of now but if they continue on the path their headed they may just end up crying 'RoseBud' in the end."

Then the fading came into effect, there was so much that it became boring right off the bat. It would have been fine if they maybe had them fade faster or not so many of them. The cinematographer did a great job putting together a seen. Kane (Orsen Wells) was dancing with the dancers then the shot goes to a group of men talking about Kane (Wells) in the back ground there is a window in the window you can see Kane (Wells) still dancing away. The acting was a little dramatic. When ever the men were speaking they projected their voices so much and so loud that it was hard to hear what they were saying.

","Citizen Kane...I was really anxious in watching this film, as it is considered one of the best, if not the best, movie ever. These considerations are not made upon nothing, and I do agree Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I have seen.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>We have the idea, especially in America, that even a poor kid can become the president of the country. That anyone can work his way up to fame and fortune. But what happens when you have all the money you might need? People degenerate. Kane is the kind of character who degenerated. It is always about himself. He is the one who rules, he is the one who commands. He wanted a newspaper, so everyone could hear him...but no one could really know him. After the dies, the press asks itself what his last word might have meant. Rosebud. A reporter, named Thompson, is assigned to find out its significance...as if they could understand him after finding out that the sense of that one word.<br/><br/>I believe it really does mean something he has lost. All his life, Kane suffered...without really knowing. All the ones around him, really were there to love him, because he needed someone to be able to go on. Like in Casablanca... His false idea was that he could get anyone with money and presents. He had to be in the center of all things. For him, he was all that really mattered.<br/><br/>Kane was a disputed figure, someone who never quite knew what was right. Someone who thought that because he was rich, he could do anything he wanted with the ones around him. He kept his respect though for the whole American population, and he wished that they found out the truth about what was happening around them. You might say, he did accomplish his goal...but his methods, and his whole life, were messed up. His second way, poor miss Alexander, was forced to live a life she could not. A life without love, a life without real essence. She had the role to love Kane, without being loved. No friends, no nothing...all she liked were some jigsaw puzzles, and that was all she had to live with. Kane's friend, Jed, is just another person in his company...his friendship with Kane, is not of real essence, so it ends at a given point. Was it because the article? Or was it because he was drunk? I am not sure...maybe both. Maybe only the first. One more thing would be, that Kane always needs to do something with a reason...all he does, he does with a reason. How many people act so now? Can you act in such a way? Only with reason? Might be. But to always need to prove something, that is a thing that few people do. It shows how strong a man's will actually is. <br/><br/>Kane is a figure which gets lost in this world. His needs are to high to be fulfilled. ""Citizen Kane"" tries to make himself loved, through his abilities, through his humor, or through his way of thinking. Yet, he never gets to know the people around him...and thinks merely of himself. How can you write to people you do not really know? The thing that Kane never had, was a happy childhood and that's where man sets his limits. In this case, it all revolved around money."

","How anyone could call this the best film of all time... just ludicrous. There can be no ""best"", but Citizen Kane is a fine film.  Before I experienced it, I had heard all the praise and saw the 100 best films of all time.  Then one night my film school showed us a brand new 35 mm print.  I wasn't blown away... in fact I thought it was just ok, and wondered what all the fuss was about.  But Citizen Kane is a film that grows on you... much like Kubrick's work.  I find that the best films are ones that grow on you over time... they're almost like living organisms that demand your attention.  I rented it again on DVD a couple years later and I slowly began to realize (with the help of maturity) what all the fuss was about.  Not only does Citizen Kane use many film techniques that were FAR ahead of it's time, but it also managed to grow a beating heart under all the celluloid. It's a sad film, especially towards the end.  The scene where Kane goes berserk and destroys the room is very unsettling... I can't imagine what it was like the to see it for the first time back when it came out. Incredibly, this film also manages to hide the fact that the story is sprung from a GIGANTIC plot hole... probably the biggest in cinema history. Kane's dying words, ""Rosebud"", are what set the wheels in motion, right?  But Kane was the only person in the room, so how could anyone have known his last word?  Sure, there may have been someone else there, but Welles never shows them... and in movies, if the camera or soundtrack doesn't reveal it... it don't exist.  The characters are very 3 dimentional, almost TOO real... and it takes a few viewings to ""get"" all the subtleties this film has to offer. This film is loaded with subtlety and it's one of the best staged movies I've ever seen.  Every camera angle, movement... the staging of the actors... it's all flawless.  The acting is amazing.

","Let's get one thing straight.  There is NO unquestioned greatest film. Opinions on the greatest films diverge widely.  The people here that are offering negative reviews seem to be under the impression that Kane is the cinema's Shakespeare   What you have to realize is that, while Kane invariably shows up at the top of greatest film lists, these lists are always composites, based on hundreds of different lists by different critics and reviewers.  <br/><br/>Check out the web site of Sight and Sound, where they have the top ten lists for the past 50 years.  Kane is on the top this year, just as it was in 92, 82, 72, and 62.  But if you look at the individual lists, you'll find a lot of variety in people's individual choices, and you'd be surprised how many Citizen Kane doesn't even appear on.  Or, when it does, how rarely it is at the top.  In fact, outside of dim bulb TV talking heads reading off of a teleprompter, I don't think I have ever heard anyone say that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made.  It just happens to show up in the most critic's lists.<br/><br/>And in any case, this sort of thing is cyclical.  Kane didn't have this kind of respect until the 60s, and it's already starting to falter a bit.  A recent poll made up of critics and afficionados in their 20s ranked Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo at the top.  <br/><br/>In any case, Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie.  It's not even my favorite Orson Welles movie (that would be Touch of Evil). When I took part in one of these polls, it didn't even make my top ten. But I can easily understand why it's so well respected, and it would probably make my top 20 or 25.  All the tools of cinema are used to sublime effects here, from the expressive camera angles to the stunning interplay of shadow and light.  The acting, especially be Welles, is simply stunning.  And the plot is constructed artfully, non linear but always quite engaging.  We get a deep sense of the characters in all of their subtleties, quite a difficult task that most filmmakers fail to accomplish even today.<br/><br/>I have to laugh when people complain about how Kane doesn't live up to 'today's standards.'  Of course, this is just a matter of personal taste, as I enjoy the dreamlike grace of the classic films so much better than anything post '77 (ironically, the year that I was born.)  And if you think that Forrest Gump or The Green Mile are the pinnacle of filmmaking, then you probably won't 'get' what's so great about Citizen Kane.

It is groundbreaking, both in terms of the narrative (films like Pulp Fiction and Memento owe a great debt to Orson Welles, simply for proving that a non-linear story can work), and especially for technical aspects.  Boring details aside, the difference between movies and theatre lies in what the director captures with his images; so even if you have any complaints about plot and acting (the latter is overly histrionic and dated, to be certain), they are essentially insignificant in the scope of things.<br/><br/> Another user has asked if this version of the American Dream story is the reason as to why the film is considered ""The Greatest.""  The story, in my opinion, is uniquely American, and defenitely an important part of the film, but I still prefer to think that filmmakers (read: people who MAKE FILMS) look more toward Citizen Kane for what the can accomplish with a camera lense, rather than with a good story."

","I don't know what to say or write about Citizen Kane at this point. Frankly I don't know that I'm qualified to write about a movie of such grandeur. Two points I can make though, one about AFI and one about user comments.<br/><br/>Firstly, regarding AFI and this being their number 1 film of all time, I assume that this is to be taken in the context of AFI as the greatest American film of all time.  If so, I can begin to relate to how it's portrayal of the American dream is very signifigant.  Otherwise, don't get me wrong, by no means do I not realize the legacy of Citizen Kane, but I feel by the discrimnating AFI holding such a title to this film, they should definetly write a comprehensive paper to accompany this.<br/><br/>Additionally after reading the user comments, it seems like most people are just blindly throwing praise at this film for no reason, jumping on that bandwagon, with no true opinion or ability to appreciate art within themselves, and by doing so, only regurgitating AFI's opinions and those of a generation before them.  By this I do not mean one's ability to enjoy a film, I believe that most are true to their own feelings on what films they enjoy and which they do not, but what I mean is all the pretensious comments saying things like 'This is the greatest film ever' without a firm thesis. Have you no opinion of your own?<br/><br/>I don't think that many people who have made their comments on Kane are qualified to make their comments, because I believe they have most likely only viewed the film once or twice and have done no research in any attempt to further appreciate or understand the times or the film."
"moviemarcus","Null","0","3","22 August 2002"," Not the greatest film I have ever seen
","What the. are you telling me that this is the best film ever made? Go ahead and call me dumb, but I think if you transmit `Citizen Kane' to outer space and declare this is the best film ever made in human history, there will be an alien invasion very soon.<br/><br/> I do not intend to dismiss this film, for it deserves to be called a classic. It was made in 1941, and the fact that it hasn't aged much since proves its power. But is a film that revolutionized the way people make movies necessarily the greatest movie ever made? Yes, you may say. I am not going to argue with you, but my answer is a firm negative.<br/><br/> `Citizen Kane' assembled almost all the advanced filmmaking techniques of its era and added a few more of its own. There is the shot where we see the objects through their reflections on a glass globe. Later, the camera travels through a signboard, pans down on a building's glass ceiling and then the people below. Transitions are also handled cleverly with the use of diffusions, which replace part of the current frame with part of the next. If you are not impressed by all these, that's just because there are fancier stuff in the cinema today, and you don't appreciate the fact that many of them actually originate from what we see here.<br/><br/> The story is told in retrospective by the friends of our protagonist after his death. He is Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), a rich guy who has all the money he can spend but whose self-indulgence finally makes him lose all his fortunes, friends and wives (yes, it's plural). Does this sound familiar to you? Forgive me for my ignorance if `Citizen Kane' turns out to be the film that spawned this kind of crap in the first place, but I would have expected something more intelligent and less stereotypical in what has been hailed as the best of the best. Mean rich guys do not die alone in their villas, more often than not, they get all they want and have hot jungle sex with models every night.<br/><br/> Fashionable techniques aside, I find little interest in this film, and I feel sorry for all those other great movies that frequent places #2-10 on critics' top ten list, for `Citizen Kane' looks pretty sad when compared with them.<br/><br/> My Rating: ***/*****"

","Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie of all time, but it is the perfect film to show to someone who wants to understand the medium of film more than they currently do.  The story of Citizen Kane is filled with fun, music, wealth, happiness, sadness, tragedy, anger, fear, hatred, but most of all, mystery.  Orson Welles portrays a truly mysterious man, and only at the end do we really have a full picture of Charles Foster Kane, a fictious newspaper mogul who some say was modeled after William Randolph Hearst.  I enthusiastically recommend this picture, because even though it's over 60 years old, it is still as fresh as any new film today (probably fresher), and the picture quality has been restored to near perfection on the new DVD release.

","I like Citizen Kane. There are many comments made in this section by people who ""just don't get it"". Well I sympathize and even understand where they are coming from but ... consider: This was the FIRST attempt of a 25 year old man who up til this time was famous for radio (""War of the Worlds"", Mercury Theater, Campbell Playhouse and The Shadow) and also for NY stage productions. He came to Hollywood and he was given absolute control over a picture (unheard of since the end the silent movie era). He brought with him from New York a group of radio and NY stage actors with NO prior film experience. He also brought to Hollywood the innovations of broadcast radio. He allowed experienced but stifled Hollywood camera experts (Toland) to be creative. He did the same with lighting (but he had some of his on thoughts from the stage as to this).<br/><br/>If you buy the DVD version you may hear the very insightful comments of Roger Ebert as to this movie. In my opinion, Mr. Ebert's commentary will help those of you that ""just don't get it"" and will still be very insightful to the rest of us as well. Peter Bogdanovich (besides being a director in his own right, wrote a biography on Orson Wells: ""This is Orson Welles"" - available at Amazon.com) also does a commentary, but it is not as insightful as Ebert's. Listen to Ebert's commentary but read Bogdanovich's book. This is NOT the best movie ever made, BUT it is the best first attempt at film making ever and by far the most innovative film ever. Wells was a genius who tragically peaked too early in life. After seeing this movie watch The Third Man, an even better film."

","I put off seeing this film for the longest time and after re-reviewing it through comments here, I just had to add my own.  I did see it finally a couple of months ago and my thoughts are as fresh as when I did...I think this movie was great and innovative for its time, and it's still a good movie, hey I even rated it a ""ten,"" but I would have to go against the tide, which gives it a ""greatest movie of all time"" rating.  I just don't buy it. <br/><br/>Sure Welles brashly bucked the establishment and gave everyone a lot to think about at the time, but it is dated and the message (I think) is not as clear as that brought forth in some works of today.  The filmmaking itself may have been new at the time, but when compared with today, the technique is old hat.  The story was interesting and from a historical point of view, we might regard the innovations Welles brought with Citizen Kane, but are the accolades lauded on this work here, really warranted in comparison to what has come since? Again, don't get me wrong, on all fronts I thought this was a solid work, but in comparison to other solid works here in the top 250, I thought the film wanted for comparison.  In other words, I wasn't sucked in. So...in sum, I will give the work its due for what it represents both artistically and technically, and if it were still the 1940s, I too would most likely rate in the tops ever made, but I refuse to apologize for what has been done in cinema since 1941... It's hard to take away from that which is innovative since."

","Citizen Kane is often regarded as the best motion picture ever. But if you show it to someone who is not into movies he won't understand the power of this movie. The plot is not that outrageous to make this movie great it's more the kind of expression Welles uses. In the 40's it was a scandal to make a movie that didn't fit into the stereotypical view of the Découpage Classique`. New techniques to tell a story ( for instance the main parts of the story are brought to the viewer by flashbacks), the new camera-system (to sharpen characters and the background at the same time) and the use of special effects (like matte-paintings). Furthermore the actors are playing sensational. It's real fun watching Welles developing from the young dynamic newspaper owner to an old unbearable bastard. He is realistic and overbearing at the same time which makes the character lovable. Not to forget the trouble with Hearst who almost managed to withdraw the picture from all cinemas and to destroy it. God thank he failed!"

It defines the art of film in two hours. As brilliant for the use of sound as for its visuals, this was also the most extensive use of visual effects in a non-genre film up to this time. Kubrick was probably the only disciple to equal Welles's visual mastery, but even at his best he seemed to lack the sheer exhuberence evident in every shot of a Welles film. Everything about the craft seemed to excite and inspire him. If ""Kane"" had been on the shelf, unseen for these past 61 years and released now, it would be hailed as fresh and ahead of its time.

","Ask yourself the question: who makes a film like this as their first effort? The answer: only a genius, perhaps a flawed one. Beginning with The Cradle Will Rock and the Mercury Radio Theater, Welles simply overwhelms the careers of his peers. Never underestimate the contribution of Greg Tolin, his deep focus work and dutch angles add a feeling of scale and panorama. Movies are made of moments. Say the word ""Rosebud"" and what else can you think of but Kane? Is it the greatest? That's like trying to figure out who was the greatest baseball player or football figure. Greatness is like a butterfly, hard to pin down. Well, compared to another epic of its era, ""Gone With the Wind"", it makes that well thought of film look like a Soap Opera.  Kane is a film that delivers something new everytime you see it. Like a Russian Doll, there are layers and layers.  Okay, maybe you don't want to intellectualize entertainment, but this film transcends entertainment.  Like the best of Shakespeare it gets into the human soul. The result is that it is truth and truth is never dated, nor is it bounded on the east by Eastport. This film should be preserved forever. As a filmmaker, I would be overjoyed to write, produce or direct anything half as good. Frankly, I don't think you can compare Kane to any other film.  By the way, the Soundtrack by Bernie Hermann was recast into a Classical Suite, ""Welles Raises Kane"". Everybody gave 110% to this picture. I wonder if Orson Welles life would have turned out differently, if he hadn't peaked on his first film."

Indeed I would not be hard pressed to name a couple of hundred titles I prefer.  And while I am about it here is another piece of heresy; I don't find ""Casablanca"" particularly entertaining.  And allow me just one more. . . I find the plot of ""The Maltese Falcon"" terribly confusing but have never bothered to work it out as it just seems to be about several nasty people doing nasty things to each other in claustrophobic Los Angeles apartments.  There, that's me done for!  I doubt that anyone will take my cinema writings seriously again.  But back to ""Citizen Kane"".  It really is a very good film indeed, brilliantly inventive, its monochrome visuals as breathtakingly exciting as any I know.  It is so clever that one cannot but admire it; the wonderful ""March of Time"" parody, the haunting use of deep focus photography in the childhood sequence, the disintegration of a marriage charted in a sequence of breakfast vignettes.  I wrote the other day of how the great Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi  achieved a wonderful marriage of the head and the heart.  What ultimately prevents ""Citizen Kane"" from being a a great film to my mind is that it is all head and very little heart.  In 1941 the Oscars for best picture and director were awarded to John Ford's ""How Green was my Valley"", a film that not only displays marvellous Hollywood craftsmanship but possesses such an abundance of heart that it just had to be the winner.  Take a look at Ford's earlier ""The Hurricane"" (1937) and you will even see those sets with ceilings that ""Citizen Kane"" is purported to have pioneered."

This is actually a very depressing movie, especially the Rosebud thing at the end. Another thing that makes this movie so true (well, besides the fact it was based on the life of a true human being, William Randolph Hurst) was that Charlie Kane was such a human character. He was someone who was very nice, intelligent, and caring, yet on the other hand, he was also selfish, rude, and a spoiled brat. The way that Welles is able to use the camera and lighting in this movie is excellent. Although this is a very good film, I just don't think that it's worthy of the title ""The greatest American film of all time.""

One theme that I identified throughout the film was LOVE. In the beginning of the film, Charles Foster Kane was a passionate newspaperman out to change the world. He showed a love of justice and honesty by promising his readers that his paper would report the news fully and responsibly. As the plot developed, this love became distorted and ugly. This distortion was also present in Kane's relationships with women. After divorcing his first wife, Kane married his second wife, Susan Alexander, but their love, too, was doomed. As their relationship digressed, Susan confronted Kane about his love of possessions and power over his love of people, as well as the fact that he wanted to be loved and possess other's love but was too selfish to give love to others.

It can only be because there are revelations each time you see it. There is always something fresh, something worth catching. It is true that this movie was filmed for a '40s film audience, but the best movies seem to lock themselves into a time and we have no problem realizing that. ""Maltese Falcon"" was a '40s detective drama and we know detectives today would use a different approach. But we enjoy that film for the very reason it gives us a definite view of the '40s detective and his work. And the story is compelling. The same is true for ""Citizen Kane."" We see the life story of a contemporary man of the '30s and '40s, and from that story we can realize that what he finally values, upon his death, is not much different that what we grow to value in our late years. We can relate to his memories of youth. Welles, though a young man when he made 'Kane,' found the essence of life and magnified it on the screen. The acting is efficient, the setting is bigger than life, the use of the camera is innovative and still imitated, the story telling is timeless. Even ""Pulp Fiction,"" which I consider to be the best film of the '90s, owes some debt to the story telling of ""Citizen Kane."" There have been many great films made since this one, but it was ground-breaking, and it remains fresh even though the plot is stuck in time.<br/><br/>Does it deserve to be call ""the greatest film ever""? Why not? It deserves the honor as much as any film made before or since. Watch it again and see if you do not agree."

","There's plenty of backlash against what's usually called ""the best film ever made"".  Some critics have suggested that it's a cold film, merely expressive of Orson Welles' ego; others (an admitted minority) have basically asked what's so great about it, beyond its technical wonders.  Perhaps two personal comments will show you where I stand, and why:<br/><br/>1.  The first time I ever saw Citizen Kane, I was 13 or 14 and knew nothing about it, except that it was ""about newspapers"" (and I was interested in journalism) and had in its cast Endora from Bewitched.  I watched it on TV, and when it was over, I turned to my mother, who'd been puttering about, and said ""that must be the best movie I've ever seen.""<br/><br/>2.  I have probably lived my life by the maxim expressed at one point in the film: ""There's no trick to making a lot of money...if all you want to do is make a lot of money.""  (I may have gotten a word or two wrong.)  Well, that's not at all what I wanted to do with my life...and I certainly haven't made a lot of money!<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is more than Orson Welles' ego.  I agree that it is the best film ever made...and it is certainly one of my very favorites.  I hope it's one of yours, too."

","According to the American Film Industry, ""Citizen Kane"" is the greatest movie of all time.  After seeing this film, I found that a bit hard to believe.  ""Citizen Kane"" has been patted on the back so many times, that its name alone has become a juggernaut.   But is it deserving of so much praise? Let me first give you a quick rundown of the movie.  Charles Foster Kane is dead.  He was the richest man in American.  Now that he's gone, everyone wants the scoop on his troubled life.  One group of reporters decides to take a different angle.  The last word Kane uttered before death was ""Rosebud"".  No one knows what that means, and so these men set out to find the big secret behind this puzzling word.  They proceed to interview all of the people who supposedly knew him best, yet they never uncover this secret. At the denouement, however, the audience is able to see what ""Rosebud"" is before it is destroyed.  <br/><br/>I must admit that I already knew what ""Rosebud"" was before I saw the movie, and most people do.  But, in the event that someone out there has no clue, I won't spoil it for you.  There are some greats aspects to this film.  Orsen Welles did a good job as both lead actor and director.  Joseph Cotton (Shadow of a Doubt) was wonderful as Jedeiah Leland, Kane's oldest friend. There were quite a few scenes which I enjoyed.  Perhaps I would have enjoyed it even better had I not already known what ""Rosebud"" was.   In addition, its reputation as the greatest movie of all time made me expect much more of it, which might also explain my disappointment.  I personally look for movies that draw me in completely, strike my emotions so that I either laugh or cry or, even better, laugh and cry.  I like to identify with the characters, and I love great dialogue and symbolism.  I would give ""Citizen Kane"" 3 out of 4 stars because I was aware of the presence of some of these elements to a certain point.  This was definitely a good film.  But the greatest film ever?

Packed with great pitch perfect performances note Agnes Moorhead in the role of the mother: less than 5 minutes on screen and completely believeable.)The dialogue (whoever wrote it) uses stutterings, speaking at the same time and different volumes in a way that is a credit to the training that Welles had in radio.

","I will probably shock many when I state that this is not the greatest American film.  It is a very interesting one.  The acting is excellent, the deep focus cinematography by Greg Toland unique and the narrative structure ground-breaking.  The deep focus style was different than standard studio photography of the era which featured soft backgrounds in close-ups to model the lead actors and actresses and make them attractive.  Toland's photography makes everyone razor sharp and has an infinate depth of field but the actors do not look attractive with these custom lenses which suits the grim story.  The editing by Robert Wise and transitions are also innovative.<br/><br/>After having said all this, what do I find lacking in the film? Character empathy.  In my favorite films, you have tremendous simpathy with the lead characters and become emotionally involved in the picture. Titles like ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Casablanca"" and ""The African Queen"" come to mind.  You experience what the characters on screen feel.  In ""Citizen Kane"", the lead character is so self-centered and enigmatic, you don't care about his fate.  You watch ""Citizen Kane"" objectively not subjectively. While you can marvel at the technical skill that went into it, you don't care about anyone.<br/><br/>As to the ""Rosebud"" ending, it was memorable but not plausible.  It's meaning is muddled and not clear from the narrative. It should've been. If you study the film carefully, you also realize that many of the interviews contain information about Kane that the person couldn't know because they weren't there during the incident.<br/><br/>Welles was a good actor but undisciplined director. This remains his best picture in part because he actually got his act together long enough to finish it. The rest of his career encompassed half finished projects or muddled completed ones. He needed a strong producer to focus him but insisted on shooting movies in his own chaotic manner. He was lucky he had RKO behind him on ""Ciziten Kane"".<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this film to study technique but don't expect to come away emotionally drained or exhilerated.<br/><br/>Richard W.

","The film,""Citizen Kane""(1941)is considered the greatest movie ever made on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 films of the twentieth century. I think this is a bit of an overstatement,but ""Citizen Kane"" is a fine,worth while drama that tells an interesting story. The film is based on the life of journalist,William Randolph Hearst. The beginning of the film starts out with news reels talking about the death of a 70 year-old,newspaper tycoon,Charles Foster Kane. Many reporters are wondering what ""Rosebud"",Kane's last word meant. One such reporter,Jerry Thompson,decides to find out what this means by interviewing people who knew him best and looking in records about his life. Thompson's interviewees include,Kane's second wife,singer Susan Alexander,his good friend,Jedidiah Leland,and Mr. Bernstein,a man who worked with him on his paper,the ""Inquirer"". Thompson also looks in the diaries of Walter Parks Thatcher,the man who adopted him from his parents to give him a better life in society. Thompson starts to realize that Kane,who seemed like he got everything he wanted in life,was not completely happy. We,as the audience,see Kane's life in a series of flashbacks. Except for the beginning,which drags,the film runs quite smoothly. All the actors fit their parts perfectly. Orson Welles does a fine job of directing the film and playing the part of Kane. He's a character you can love and hate. I do prefer Welles' performances in ""The Stranger""(1946)as an escaped Nazi,who poses as a teacher and as the conniving Harry Lime in ""The Third Man""(1949). He gives a more believable performance in these two roles. In my opinion,the supporting players give the film its' spark. Joseph Cotten does great justice to his role as Jedidah Leland,a man who probably knew Kane best. Agnes Moorehaed gives a small,but memorable performance as Kane's mother. Dorothy Comingore draws your attention every time she's in a scene and adds a little comic relief as Susan Alexander. The film in no way is a classic,but worth a look once in a while.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I've watched this movie a couple of times, and every time the ending still grips me the way it did the first time I saw it. The story (which some have the audacity to call ""boring"") is about a man who had everything...except what he really wanted, love. Why didn't he have love? Because he spent all his time trying to accumulate more power, more wealth, more fame.<br/><br/>
WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD<br/><br/>Contrary to what many have said on this site, Rosebud not only symbolizes Kane's childhood and other superficial things like that, it also symbolizes the life he missed, the life he could have had, the joy he could have had, the love he could have had, if only money and power hadn't have gotten in the way. We all have rosebuds in our lives, and unlike Kane we are still alive to try to find them."

Maybe the modern or not so modern materialist would feel a euphoric epiphany and call this movie a great, but not I.<br/><br/>
Besides that, there were other aspects of this movie to make it atleast worthwhile, or even good. Though it did move rather slowly, the characters were usually entertaining and the dialogue interesting. Moreso, the camera work was extraordinary and revolutionary, for its time. So you're constantly saying, ""This isn't great, but for its time...""  <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I'm glad I saw this. Seems to be I only saw it so that I could say I saw it.

"nateg33","10","0","2","13 May 2001"," Why people don't like the greatest movie ever made.
","True, Citizen Kane isn't the most gripping story ever told.  However, a movie isn't defined by the story it tells.  I bet most of the people that trash this movie absolutely love Pulp Fiction, another phenomenal movie. However, in neither movie is the plot particularly relevant to the point of the movie.  The difference is that young people constitute the majority of movie goers and whereas Pulp Fiction is really ""cool"" and quite hilarious, Citizen Kane is slow and very arsty.<br/><br/>When judging movies, there are two key considerations: entertainment and cinematic merit.  They aren't well defined and often overlap, a film such as American Beauty comes to mind.  However, it films are like novels.  We live in a time where John Grisham and Tom Clancy are premier authors and Oprah Winfrey decides what's good and what's not.  However, while certainly entertaining, John Grisham and Tom Clancy write mostly trash compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald et al.  The point is that movies are oftentimes the same way.<br/><br/>Tommy Boy is one of my favorite movies, yet it ranks nowhere near what I consider to be a great movie.  It's a bunch a mindless, yet hilarious, junk barfed up onto a film reel.  Citizen Kane is the polar opposite.  While certainly not hilarious, it represents everything a great movie should be: it has perfect acting, directing, camera work, lighting, editing etc.  Not to mention the story.  The story is perfectly told.  It has a message to get across and it does it extremely well, even if it is somewhat slow.  So what if it doesn't put you at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that you should like this movie.  What I am saying is that it is the greatest movie ever made and I personally believe that opinions to the contrary are misguided, naive, and 100% wrong."

It is truly a dynamic movie.<br/><br/>At the same time, I can't run out and say ""You have to see this movie!"" I found it dark, sinister, and downright depressing. While black and white is classic film making, it can often create light and shades that are emotionally difficult to watch. Perhaps that's what makes Citizen Kane so great to so many.

","I saw this film for a class entitled ""The Art of the Cinema"" at Penn State University. Within thirty minutes of the opening credits, only a handful of students in a class of around 800 were awake.<br/><br/>What I think this demonstrates is the very criteria on which I base my own opinion of ""great"" movies: the ability to transcend time and culture, and to have a perpetual impact on audiences. Unfortunately, Citizen Kane does not have this, as evidenced by these sleeping students, as well as the thousands of other film students who fall asleep during this film. It isn't that they're being ""disrespectful"" to a classic, but it's just this: the younger generations don't take classics for more than they're worth (there is no reverence for ""the name itself""). I think that this is worth looking into, because other such ""classics"" such as Singing in the Rain, Some Like It Hot, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance still do captivate even the youngest audiences. Maybe this is because there is something in these films that young Americans feel that they can relate to. Citizen Kane, despite what the critics and many ""film buffs"" say, lacks this.<br/><br/>If you don't believe me, look at the empirical evidence. Go to a showing of Citizen Kane in a film class at a university near you. You might be the only one still awake at the end of the movie. You may think that Citizen Kane deserves to be #1 on AFI and IMDB, but remember; this is far from the majority opinion among Americans today.

I did my best to understand this classic, but still I found the story quite superficial, calculated and cold - too academic in one word.

No wonder this film is in every film class. Now I understand why some people do not like this film.  These people do what I like to call ""passive viewing"".  You can't just watch a film and give it the thumbs up or thumbs down.  You must PAY ATTENTION to the details that make the movie. What makes this film so great is that Welles tells his story of the newspaper tycoon not only with words but with the camera.  Every shot and person is framed accordingly for a specific reason.  For example, in the famous scene where Kane's mother signs him away to Thatcher the banker Welles uses what is called a deep focus.  The frame is set up so that from left to right it goes father, Kane, Thatcher, and Kane's mother.  The brilliance is that Kane can be seen through the window of the shot in the foreground.  The shot symbolises the struggle between kane's father and Kane's mother and Thatcher.  Kane is in the middle of this outside not knowing that his future is being decided for him while his father fights for him to stay.  Perfect deep focus shot showing the relationships and struggle over young Kane.  This is just one example that you can say but you could analyse EVERY shot in the entire film and point out why it is so brilliant. I also enjoyed the beginning of the movie where it shows the trespassing sign and then the camera works its way up the fence dissolving from fence to fence.  Then when you see the house a careful viewer would notice that as the house shots dissolve into closer shots of the house you would notice that the light on in the room never moves.  The entire shot changes except that one window with the light on never moves.  Not easy to do.  The brilliance of the shots of the fence are that they really capture how empty and closed in he was.  An active viewer would notice that these shots symbolises the ""jail"" that he built from himself.  Look around the shot next time you watch.  You will see so many things and if you think about you will understand the meaning. I think people don't enjoy this film because it requries something that most people don't like doing.  This activity is THINKING!!  People prefer movies that tell them how to feel and think.  Film is art and can be entertainment. Citizen Kane is a masterpiece of artisic cinema.  If you don't like Citizen Kane you just don't understand it and should go watch that new stupid movie with the cheerleaders.

","Orson Welles' classic film, Citizen Kane, still stands to be one of the finest in film history.  It's influence has surpassed the influences of Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, All Quiet On the Western Front, and possibly moreso than A Birth of a Nation.  From Scorsese to Spielberg to Kubrick to Kurosawa to Coppola, it has influenced more filmmakers from across the world (or Hollywood at least) to not only make movies, but to make life... or at least have the ceilling be viewed in the shot. What I love about the screenplay is it never reveals what Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"", in dialogue.  Now, I'm not going to say what ""Rosebud"" is, because I don't want to be chased by an angry mob of people just to be backed into a dark corner in a black alley and beaten senseless with baseball bats just because I gave away the big surprise ending.  Hermann did a fantastic job in presenting the story on paper but Welles really worked the dialogue in the film.  He shortened extended paragraphs into simple, catchy sentences.  ""People will think...""  ""What I tell them to think!"" could have originally been something far more elaborate. Ah, but the direction is the true essence of the film's genius.  It was presented like a painting by Leonardo da Vinci; it seemed so mathematical and so direct.  Especially in my favorite scene in the film, when a drunk Leland (played with superbness by Joseph Cotten in what is possibly the film's best performance) and a sore loser Kane (coughAlGorecough) are talking in the newspaper building/campaigne HQ.  The camera moves with them like it's doing a slow tango with the actors. This is the most unique film that I might ever see and the greatest that will ever be.

He is the source of humble wisdom as the manager of the New York Inquirer -- it is he who first suggests the most correct interpretation of 'Rosebud'.<br/><br/>Then there is the camera work, the innovations that appear only in this one-film wonder. It doesn't take a trained eye to hold in awe the beginning of the film. Fades, montage, and actions reflected in a glass ball.<br/><br/>
Incredible stuff!"

","Can there be any doubt that CITIZEN KANE is it? There have been critics who have called it the greatest ""American sound"" film of all time. Let me clear that up. As far as silent films go, there are a lot of great ones. The General, Nosferatu, The Iron Horse, Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame come to mind. But all of them pale before Kane. When you turn to Foreign films, I'm sorry but none of them measure up either. Too many of them are culturally obscure, boringingly artistic or simply bad. There are great films made over seas, but again they fall far short of the pinnacle that is Kane. 2 centuries from now, Kane will be mentioned in the same breath as the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's Fifth. It is the very definition of the term ""Classic."" No other film has ever put together all of the bits and pieces that are needed to build a film in such perfect order as Kane. From Herrmann's score to the Welles/Mankiewicz script to Greg Toland's cinematography, this is an encyclopedia of film-making in one neat package. The number of people influenced by Kane since its release is incalculable, but evident in many films that have come opened after it. This film became Orson's curse. He never was able to duplicate it, and he was reviled/loved for not being able to do so. He is nonetheless one of the true geniuses of film history, ranking with Buster Keaton, Kubrick, Hitchcock and Kurosawa. It is to Hollywood's great shame that they never allowed Orson to get that close again. Their jealousy robbed us of who knows how many more films like Kane. THE TEN Greatest Films of all time: (In no particular order except #1)<br/><br/>1] CITIZEN KANE 2] NORTH BY NORTHWEST 3] SEVEN SAMURAI 4] THE GENERAL- 1927 5] KING KONG 6] 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY 7] GONE WITH THE WIND 8] VERTIGO 9] SINGIN' IN THE RAIN 10] CASABLANCA<br/><br/>Anyone who believes that Godfather I & II or Raging Bull are anywhere near the top ten needs to see more movies."

","Citizen Kane is the film forever trotted out by America cineastes who want to prove that American films can hold their own against any other. Rubbish. Citizen Kane, in fact, elaborates the entire problem of American film - it's refusal to admit that it can ever really capture the whole of a man's life, even the meaning of that life.  European films, Japanese films, and films from as far away as Argentina and India have been illuminating the depths of human souls for as long as films have been made.  Hollywood would rather create special effects.  They're a bit more expensive, but they don't require a whole lot of creativity and insight.  As a superficial examination of the impossibility of illuminating the true character of a man, Citizen Kane is a masterpiece.

","Like visiting the dentist Citizen Kane is one of those movies that should be seen at least once every year. And preferably on a big screen. It demands (and deserves) a level of concentration that television viewing seldom allows, and the rich photography of Greg Toland is best seen in a darkened cinema. I agree somewhat with those who claim that Citizen Kane has been ruined by the many accolades that have been poured over it, forcing us to take a stand on whether we agree that this is the best film ever made or not, rather than enjoying the experience of the movie itself. It has been subject to so much study, and is held forth as an example of so many different things in film-making that one approaches it almost with caution -again a bit like the dentist. But only if we can put aside all our knowledge of the film's history, its reception and controversies, and forget for a while how much it influenced American film-making, can we get to the underlying core of the film; and the myth of both Kane and Welles. For one cannot help but seeing Kane as at least a facet of Welles himself -he put not only his heart, his wit and his intelligence into the making of the film, but fed many of his subconscious fears and delights into the portrayal of Kane, and thus into the enigmatic aspects of the film. Much attention has been given to ""Rosebud"". Too much I think, for though the search for Rosebud is the initial and driving motive of the narrative, the film never properly focuses on why this is so important. In one sense the search for Rosebud is the ""MacGuffin"" of Citizen Kane -it serves only to bring the story forward. Kane's last word is ""Rosebud"", and the last image we see on screen is the peeling word ""Rosebud"" on the burning wood. Go back to the beginning of the film and the first word we hear is ""Rosebud. So Rosebud is a starting point and ending both for Kane AND for the movie, but has little significance in the broader story of his life.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane is not a film that engages the viewer emotionally, and is as such a very cold film. We have little sense of identification with any of the characters, and though we are treated to insights in certain facets of their characters, we are never given enough to really CARE about them. We see the characters rather as a scientist views his lab animals -interested but detached. None of the characters really reveal much about themselves, only their thoughts about Kane, and as such this is the main weakness of the film. Though seen in another light of course this could be regarded as one of its strengths. Welles glibly focused his attention on technical and narrative innovations rather than emotional studies which I suspect he was incapable of presenting truthfully at this time in his life. It is the showman Welles behind Citizen Kane, not the poet. But the show is so good that it becomes a poetry of its own, and though there is little passion in the way he presents his characters, there is true love in the shooting style of almost every frame. Kane and Welles the director share therefore the traits of being gifted, original and highly successful personalities yet aware of something unattainable on a human level. This is part of the true myth of Citizen Kane , and of the enigma of Orson Welles.<br/><br/>The film is intriguing in style, mood, composition and structure and is in my opinion one of the very best made films of all time, but I cannot say with honesty that it is one of the best films ever made due to its emotional detachment. But perhaps when I see it again next year, I will think otherwise"

","Citizen Kane has received many honors in the past, including the AFI's #1 American film award, which is a great honor.  The camera shots in the movie are unique, and were brand-new techniques at the time of its filming.  The cinematograhpy is beautiful and powerful and the camerawork is fantastic. For example, when Kane (Welles) becomes the rich and powerful mogul that he is in his later life, the camera shoots from under him, to make Kane look taller.  When Kane was having an argument with his second wife, the camera shot from over her, to make her look smaller in his presence, giving Kane an aura of superiority.

In my opinion, there are lots of film which are better than this one. I believe Citizen Kane is selected as the greatest American film not because of the quality of the film itself but because of its meaning for the history of American cinema. Orson Wells was the first director to be given the almost full contorl of the film production, and it means alot in the American film history, as well as the new technics he used in this film(eg,pan focus) I watched Citizen Kane and Howard Hawks' Bringing up Baby on the same day and honestly, I was more impressed by the later film. I'm not criticizing that Citizen Kane is such a bad film, but I doubt if this is the greatest American film ever made.

The film's opening seems to suggest that this investigative intrusion into his personal past is not a place that should be trespassed upon. The cast is brilliant, especially Welles as the unfulfilled newspaper mogul. The story, scripted by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, owes as much to the life of Welles himself as it does to yellow journalist William Randolph Hearst, its most obvious model.

Citizen Kane is considered by many to be the greatest film ever made, and I must agree completely. The technical work that went into the film was ground-breaking. At one point in production, Wells couldn't get a low enough angle for the shot he wanted so he cut out the floor of the studio a 4:30 in the morning.

","Citizen Kane   **Â½ / 4<br/><br/>This film is regarded by some as the greatest motion picture of all time. Most of these cite their one and only reason as its innovative and influential cinematography. This raises the question: is it just to use the latter as the sole criterion for stamping a film with the ""all time best"" label? A further question that may be raised: does a movie that is technically brilliant qualify as great without due regard given to its ability to entertain?<br/><br/>Although the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and judging motion pictures is as subjective as it is objective and an art as much as an analysis, I'd like to identify several elements, which are universally considered to make a movie great: the enjoyment one is given by its plot, dialogue / script, musical score, depth of character, solid acting and directing, and cinematography.<br/><br/>In my view, an all time best film must be outstanding in all of these; Citizen Kane was not. Its plot was overtly dull and unsophisticated: reporters review the boring life of an uninteresting man who rose to prosperity. Citizen Kane had no memorable dialogue whatsoever (compare it with ""Casablanca"" in this department); its script was nothing special. Its musical score was a far cry from the creative genius of someone like Ennio Morricone, Leonard Bernstein, or even John Williams. There was absolutely no depth of character in the film-none that appeared had any heart or appeal. Its acting was only satisfactory. Mind you, the actors did not have very difficult roles to play. Because of this, one could not direct praises towards the director who had an obviously unchallenging job. This leaves cinematography. Influential? Yes. Innovative? Yes. The greatest of all time? No. Even ""Touch of Evil"", another Orson Welles' classic (and much, much better than Citizen Kane), had far superior black and white photography and use of shadows.<br/><br/>Does all of this mean that Citizen Kane was a bad film? No. Citizen Kane is an average film and, though overall boring, generally deserves a marginal ""thumbs up""."

","This film's greatness is everything that Hollywood has seemed to have forgotten these days.  First of all, a great script.  Very little can save a poor script, and great ones these days, with the exception of Good Will Hunting, are fairly rare these days.  The script provides a framework from which a director and actors flesh things out, and Mankiewicz and Welles have provided just that.  Secondly, great cinematic effects are used best when complementing and at the service of great filmmaking and a good story, not in place of it.  The use of music overlapping scenes, the camera coming from the ground to give the illusion of size, and the track backwards from the young Kane to into the cabin are marvelous, and add a great sense of perspective and almost commentary on their respective scenes- and these are just two of many examples from the film.  The reinvention in plot structure, something that's happened only once this decade, in another great film called Pulp Fiction.  All of these elements combine to make an absolutely fascinating portrait of the rise and fall of an infamous, legendary man. Arguably the greatest film of all time, and definitely one of my favorites."

","The biggest movie ever made ! With its critic look at society, its style and its actors the movie really shows what it means to do movies.When it was shot 1941 it was its time by years ahead, and today it`s still a classic. Number 6 on the rankings, but still number 1 for times !"
"janebond_99_2000","10","0","1","16 November 1999"," Orson Welles is a true genius!
","When I heard this was the greatest film ever I did not argue, because it truly is the best film of all time! I am only 16 and even I enjoyed it, well I enjoy all classic films. Orson Welles is an absolute genius in this film! I know when the movie was about to be released it was not a favorite of William Randolph Hearst. I am glad it was released, because it shows that even though everyone hated it(because hearst did not like it everyone else also hated it) Welles believed in himself and in the film and he did not care who liked it and who didn't."
"cuznjack","Null","0","2","11 November 1999"," Citizen Kane is a bummer
","I saw this movie when it was first released, and it emptied the theater faster than a stink-bomb. Before ten minutes had elapsed the parade to the exits had begun, and it continued until there were only about four people left, including me and the projectionist. I stayed to the end, but I have to agree with those people who voted with their feet.  It really was a turkey! I have seen the movie once since, on video, and that did nothingto change my opinion.  It was a boring film about boring rich people, and even as boring as the story was, it could have been improved with better direction. That,s my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>John Nolan"
"patate-2","10","0","1","27 October 1999"," Although there ain't no art contest here, this flick is worth seeing.
","Forget gold, silver and... what is the third one, cop, bronze, I forget. Most buffs with a tendency to play Oscar night tend to grant superlatives to this one while others would prefer to avoid old B&W classics which, they pretend, only please intellectuals. Granted.<br/><br/>Let me say only I had fun and emotions with this one. Would I recommend it? Certainly, but not to everyone for many wouldn't get into it and hold it against me. View with care. This is powerful."
"DIB347","Null","0","2","26 October 1999"," Great classical movie!
","This is a great classical movie!  It's in black and white, so if you don't like movies that are in black and white, you won't like this movie very much.  Also, if you're wanting an action-orientated film, this isn't a film for you.  Since I like classical movies, I loved this movie even though it had it's slow parts.  I can tell why so many famous film critics have this film in their top 20 films of all time."

","This movie was actually pretty good.  At first I started to fall asleep , but I couldn't get to sleep.  So I started to watch it. It turned out to be a really interesting movie.  There was a lot of symbolism in it, and it caught my attention. After all it was a lot better than I expected."
"Staticx-3","Null","0","1","26 October 1999"," SEX now that I've got your attenetion
","Citizen Kane is overall a great movie for the time.  It has great acting and shows how people really thought of Charles Foster Kane.  The deeper issue in the movie is how the media can control what we think by printing anything they want to and we will believe them.  This movie shows how the one man who was supposed to have everything actually was very unhappy and was always missing something.  He tried to buy love and happiness but he never achieved either.  He would have been happier if he would have been with his mother and father his whole life."

","Citizen Kane is an all time movie that anyone and everyone should watch. Despite that the movie is black and white it is great.  The cinematography in the movie is the best of its time.  Oh, how times have changed, anyway Citizen Kane is a good movie that is well directed and has many different meanings in it.  Hope you like it!!"
"flatiron32","7","0","1","16 October 1999"," Great film but very peculiar.
","I liked this movie, and I think that it is very interesting and thought provoking.  I am not sure that it should be the number one film on the AFI list.  Despite that, the film is very though provoking and it is one that you don't want to pause.  As you watch, you get in to the plot and keep trying to put the pieces together.  I would suggest that everyone should see this film."
"GeneralB","10","0","1","12 October 1999"," What can I say?
","POSSIBLE SPOILER<br/><br/>A lot has been said about this film, so my comments are pretty insignificant.  I saw this movie in a film class, where we watched sections of it at a time.  I was impressed, although when you get a bunch of immature students such as myself, together watching it, its inevitable that it becomes the butt of jokes, especially during the more surreal.  You can appreciate this film even more when you compare it to other films of the time.  Its use of camera angles, fade ins/outs, and shadows really stands out.  The meaning of ""Rosebud"" was correctly guessed by at least a couple people in the class, and in retrospect it seems kind of obvious, so don't feel too proud of yourself if you guess it.  One things for sure, it better than Titanic!"
"Nylar","10","0","1","10 October 1999"," The greatest film ever made
","I feel as if I should have an IMDB comment on record for my favorite film of all time... Kane's place at the top of the AFI list is completely deserved. The film is central to cinema history, influencing every major filmmaker from Godard to Scorsese. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Long live Kane."
"Kauffman","Null","0","1","6 October 1999"," Interesting bits.
","Having seen Citizen Kane almost two dozen times I have discovered a few interesting things about it.  You may or may not have heard everything there is to be said about Citizen Kane's innovations--deep focus, low angles, most important American film ever made, and so forth.  If not, one can easily discover these famous ideas so I won't restate them here.  What follows instead is a list of fun things you can look for while viewing this landmark film.<br/><br/>· The opening shots are of the Xanadu castle from different locations on the Xanadu grounds (actually all were paintings.).  There is a light in one window.  Notice that in each new shot, from a different angle, the castle is a little closer than in the one preceding and in each shot, the window is in the same position on the film frame, almost perfectly matching the shot before.<br/><br/>· Joseph Cotton and Erskin Sanford are sitting in the back row of the projection room being extra ""reporters"" or ""staff"" when the ""News on the March"" newsreel ends. · There is very nearly one cut (the illusion of one cut, certainly) when Susan Alexander is first interviewed:  shot of Susie on a poster; pan up over the roof; dolly forward through a ""neon"" sign; down through the rainy window; down to normal camera height; follow ""Thompson"" as he walks over to Susan; follow him as he sits down; rather long scene follows, then he gets back up; crosses the room to the phone booth.  First cut is a reverse angle in the phone booth.   The same thing is repeated for her second interview. There are many ""long cuts"" throughout the film where entire scenes are played in one cut.  They're all interesting to watch but this one is really something.<br/><br/>· Watch how seamlessly the transition goes from one scene to another as Ray Collins (Gettys) and Ruth Warwick (Emily) come out of Susan's apartment. Kane is shouting, ""I'll send you to Sing Sing"" and as the door closes his voice is covered by the sound of a car honking, street noise, a few words are exchanged, they leave, pan up to the number above the door and then there is an almost invisible dissolve to a picture of the same door in a picture in the paper and a news boy shouting ""Read all about it"", shot of Leland as he turns and walks back through a door into a bar, to get drunk.<br/><br/>
· The opera house opening night.  The story is told from two different points of view.  First Leland's, we see the confusion backstage and a front shot as the shadow of the curtain opens.  Later the same story is told by Susan, same scene from the reverse angle.  In the first one, the camera pans up through the fly system of an enormous theatre until we reach the stage hands holding their noses disapprovingly.  This is actually series of paintings all flawlessly put together in the lab, using several traveling matte shots.<br/><br/>· When they go on a picnic in the Everglades.  There is a scene in the tent where Kane's makeup is many years older than the preceding and following scene.<br/><br/>· When Susan Alexander leaves him, she walks across a terrace.  The scene is a triple matte shot.  In the background is an ocean/beach view.  In the middle ground is the terrace. In the foreground for an instant is a screeching ""parrot.""  You can see through the eye of the parrot.<br/><br/>
· In the scene where Kane destroyed Susan's room after she leaves, Welles cut his left hand pretty badly during the take and had to be taken to the doctor.  When he comes up to the glass ball in close up at the end of the scene, he appears to hide his left hand (because he knows it was bleeding, perhaps.)<br/><br/>· The film ends with a long shot on Xanadu.  Black smoke is pouring out the chimney.  This image is in a lot of Welles's films.  See Mr. Arkadin or The Trial."
"creeper-9","7","0","3","28 September 1999"," I can't love it.
","What can you say that hasn't been said? I thought it was boring. I thought it was slow. but i did appreciate it. It was very beautiful. Cinematography was great, but it really wasn't my scene. I understand how people can love it, but i really don't. I didn't really connect with the mood of the film, and the shadows. Sometimes I found it looked too overdone, and extreme, that it took away from the film. It somehow makes me feel like it is a film that instead of being art, is trying to be art. It is just too textbook, every scene and shot is in your face, this is how you should feel and there's no subtlety. The film doesn't let you react in your own way, but it  guides you a little too far. The emotions are already created for you by the director. I enjoy taking more participation in a film I'm seeing."
"Lugbert","10","0","2","27 September 1999"," All around the best possible except . . .
","Did ya'll notice that the minority and female characters were all musicians or dancers?  Kane may've been communist, but he was also a racist.  Well, he might've not been explicitly a racist, but it seems he was prejudiced in his idea of what minorities do."
"EddieB-6","9","0","2","4 September 1999"," Not quite the greatest ever, but pretty darn close.
","Seeing Citizen Kane for the first time, my expectations were difficult to define. On one hand I was seeing a film lauded by many as the greatest ever, while my natural cynicism told me I was destined to be disappointed. I wasn't. Mind you, I don't think this IS the greatest film in history, but it is an outstanding character study of one man's bid to find happiness. As a wealthy tycoon, Kane had it all, yet died alone and unhappy in a decrepit, abandoned Xanadu. The final word to pass his lips spoke of his dear wish to return to the one time he was truly happy: as a child before he was introduced to his life as a wealthy man. There are many facets of this film which make it great: Welles' direction is superb even by modern standards (which is spectacular in 1941), his brooding plot which slowly draws out more of this fascinating character also envelopes the viewer. The controversy caused by the obvious fact that the film was based on (the very real) Randlof Hurst also increases its allure (as only controversy can). But all things aside, even though there are so many great aspects to this film, it just would not have come together were it not for the brilliant performance of Welles in the title role. He brings such a stunning array of emotions to one man that his inner conflict and struggle are painfully obvious (yet gloriously understated) to any who watch.<br/><br/>It may not be the greatest film of all time, it certainly isn't the greatest story, but the character of Kane makes it ONE of the best ever."
"GBailey-3","6","0","3","31 August 1999"," Citizen Kane - Technically Delightful But Terribly Dull
","I can watch any film from any year. I like films. That means that I like films because they are entertaining, not just because they are to be applauded for their technical merits. It's A Wonderful Life is my favourite film, because I enjoy it the most. In the same way, I like The Adventures Of Robin Hood, Casablanca, The Night Of The Hunter, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Dead Of Night, White Heat, The Italian Job, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Star Wars, The Big Chill, Pulp Fiction, Babe, Starship Troopers and The Truman Show because they are entertaining. Citizen Kane, however, is dull. It may have enough technical genius to fill a hundred books on the subject, but as a film that can hold my attention, it fails miserably."
"EmptyLeo","7","0","1","7 September 1999"," maybe had I seen it in 1941..
","Citizen Kane ------------ This was #1 on AFI's Top 100, and it was one of only two in their top 10 I hadn't seen. (Still haven't seen Gone With the Wind.) So I rented this one. I guess the big deal wasn't so much the story, which was a good one, but all the camera angles and lighting or whatever that Orson Welles. Well, I don't care about any of that. I just want a good story and good acting. There was plenty of that here. I knew Rosebud was the mystery going in so I kept my eyes open. I kept my eyes open and figured it out. Lucky guess, or it may have been because I'd seen it in crossword puzzles and never knew what it meant.. You know where the clue is: Like Rosebud, and the answer is 5 letters: asled. <br/><br/>Pretty good movie, not worthy of #1 if you ask me. I give it a solid 7"
