","While not great Woody Allen – it's neither profound, moving nor funny enough for that title, it is quite enjoyable. <br/><br/>The film is made up of four intercut short stories, that share little other than the fact they're set in Rome. Some have fantasy elements, some are more absurdist, others more straightforward character farce.<br/><br/>But somehow, though they don't make much of a logical grouping, the whole thing is lighthearted and fun enough that it seems grumpy to pick on it. <br/><br/>Sure some jokes fall flat and some ideas seem unfulfilled, but a lot of it is wonderfully acted and cleverly written. And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds, even 2nd tier Woody, simply telling playfully comic tales, is a welcome sight."
"napierslogs","9","80","115","17 July 2012"," All of your heart's fantasies played out in Rome with love, celebrities, death and opera
","""To Rome with Love"" is a fantasy film; a comedy about people living out their fantasies. The great thing about it is that it's subtle enough that you don't recognize the fantasy element in all of the relationships until later on in the film. The obvious one is when native Roman, Leopoldo Pisanello (Roberto Benigni), becomes a celebrity over night. ""It's better to be a celebrity than an unknown."" And as Benigni shows, way funnier too.<br/><br/>It's the type of film where everybody gets to see themselves as famous, or supremely interesting, or a guiding angel, or married to a hooker, or the object of a movie star's affections, or on a romantic rendezvous with a thief, or having the ability to change the world with one simple idea. It will take you to wherever your heart desires. And then you'll realize why it's often advised to think with your brain rather than with your heart.<br/><br/>Half Italian and half English, we follow two relationships involving Romans and two relationships with Americans in Rome. A young, Italian, married couple get separated and the young man finds himself living out every other young man's fantasies while the young woman finds herself living out her own fantasies.<br/><br/>Hayley (Alison Pill), a New Yorker transplanted in Rome, falls in love and gets engaged to a successful Roman lawyer. Her parents (Woody Allen and Judy Davis) make the trek across the ocean to meet their in-laws. But Allen's obsession with death and equating retirement with death causes him to create a national disaster (or success story, depending on how you look at it).<br/><br/>Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American architect living in Rome with his girlfriend. First he meets his architecture idol, John (Alec Baldwin), who sees Jack as the younger version of himself. Or more accurately, Jack sees John as the older version of himself (the joke works better that way). Then Jack meets Monica (Ellen Page) who is his girlfriend's best friend and is the object of all men's fantasies.<br/><br/>Page also gets to play the role of the self-obsessed, pseudo-intellectual — commonly referred to as ""the pedantic one"" in most Woody Allen movies. Other than Allen himself, Eisenberg and Baldwin play a sort of tag-team version of the self-deprecating, neurotic hero, although this time with a touch of confidence.<br/><br/>Confidence is not to be confused with optimism because as funny as ""To Rome with Love"" is, it also has Allen's usual undertone of pessimism. Death is going to come sooner than you would like, but not soon enough. And even if you do get to live out your heart's fantasies, they may not lead to everything that you hoped for. This film is the comedy version of death and negativity, and can provide you with the simple joys in life."
"juanpimartinez","8","68","100","20 July 2012"," A movie for fans
","As time passes Woody Allen is able to transform himself and his movies. Don't get me wrong, it is obvious that we are seeing a Woody Allen film from the initial credits, but he still can surprise us. <br/><br/>We see different stories through out the film. Some show aspects of the Italian lifestyle and culture, presented from a beautiful Rome; that city that Allen wants to present to us, his Rome. But other stories present again the issues that have been important to him, those problems that for centuries have raised for humankind: love, infidelity, death, success, fame, happiness; those issues that Allen simply loves to discuss. <br/><br/>The cast is charming and I want to highlight a sincere Roberto Benigni; Jesse Eisenberg, that resembles perfectly the young Woody Allen; and the beautiful and talented Ellen Page, with a powerful character that makes you impossible not to fall in love with her.<br/><br/>I have the huge bias of been a Woody Allen fan and that is probably why I enjoyed so much this movie. It is thrilling to see him acting again. See all that neurosis again in the big screen. This movie surprises, can be as surreal as Buñuel would be and also as real as Allen is with daily problematics."

","In Rome, the America tourist Hayley (Alison Pill) meets the local Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) on the street and soon they fall in love with each other. Hayley's parents, the psychiatrist Phyllis (Judy Davis) and the retired music producer Jerry (Woody Allen), travel to Rome to meet Michelangelo and his parents. When Jerry listens to Michelangelo's father Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato) singing opera in the shower, he is convinced that he is a talented opera singer. But there is a problem: Giancarlo can only sing in the shower.<br/><br/>The couple Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) travel to Rome to meet Antonio's relatives that belong to the high society. Milly goes to the hairdresser while Antonio waits for her in the room. Milly gets lost in Rome and the prostitute Anna (Penélope Cruz) mistakenly goes to Antonio's room. Out of the blue, his relatives arrive in the room and they believe Anna is Antonio's wife. Meanwhile the shy Milly meets her favorite actor Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese) and goes to his hotel room ""to discuss about movies"".<br/><br/>One day, the middle-class clerk Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) becomes a celebrity and is hunted by the paparazzo. A couple of days later, he is forgotten by the media.<br/><br/>The American architect John (Alec Baldwin) travels to Rome with his wife and feels nostalgic since he lived in the city thirty years ago when he was a student. He meets the student of architecture Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), who lives on the same street that John had lived, and he invited to drink a coffee at his house. Jack lives with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig) that invites her best friend Monica (Ellen Page) to stay with them in their house. But soon Jack has a crush on Monica. <br/><br/>""To Rome with Love"" is a romantic movie by Woody Allen with four independent stories of love, adultery and dreams in the Eternal City. The most curious is that the stories are not entwined like usually happens in this type of movie.<br/><br/>The story of the caretaker that can only sing operas in the shower is sarcastic, with the typical humor of Woody Allen that performs a neurotic and insecure character. <br/><br/>The story of Antonio and Milly is funny, with the sexy Penélope Cruz performing a prostitute with a perfect Italian.<br/><br/>The story of Leopold is a joke with the present moment of the world, where mediocrity becomes famous without reason only because, for example, she is hot or he is a soccer player.<br/><br/>The story of John is thought provoking, with a mature man returning to his youth trying to fix his own mistakes. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Para Roma, com Amor"" (""To Rome with Love"")"

","Although nowhere near Woody Allen's great films like Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters and Midnight in Paris, To Rome with Love is still a charming, and entertaining film. Some have called the film, Woody Allen's worst film, and I simply don't agree. (His worse film is Scoop) The whole cast works nicely and all the performances are all around great. My favorite being Judy Davis, she stole the show for me. <br/><br/>I found some of the scenes rushed and haphazardly constructed and some of the dialogue overwritten and under-rehearsed. The film at times, felt very lazy and a bit fake, at times. At 112 Mimutes, To Rome with Love is a good 20 minutes longer than most Woody Allen films, and it shows. The movie was overlong and a bit boring at times. There weren't enough charming and funny scenes to compensate for it's running time. Some scenes should've definitely been cut. Woody Allen's latest effort is flawed, but definitely not a bad film, as most are saying. <br/><br/>7/10"
"littlemartinarocena","5","89","142","30 June 2012"," A Half Cooked Italian Dish
","Rome must be one of the most photogenic cities in the world, no matter how you look at it or who is looking. The Rome of Fellini with all its magic corners or Pasolini's Rome with its poetic darkness. Woody Allen's Rome is pure postcard glitter. What a let down. This is Allen's weakest script so far. Seems undecided and downright lazy. The tribute to Fellini's ""The White Sheik"" verges on theft and the Italian actors delivering their lines in Italian look and sound as participants of a provincial amateur hour. Even Oscar winner Roberto Benigni gives a pale and tired life to a thoroughly underwritten character. Allen himself is very good as is Judy Davis as his wife. But, I wonder what was in the writer/director's mind. I believe that in Allen's filmography from best to worst, To Rome With Love will appear very near the bottom. But, let's not despair, the master is already prepping his next flick."
"nolandalla-447-695930","3","83","133","11 August 2012"," Allen's Most Disappointing Film from Europe
","Woody Allen's seventh postcard from Europe lacks enough postage. It should be rubber-stamped ""Return to Sender."" This is undoubtedly the most disappointing of all his films set in Europe.<br/><br/>Following a lifetime spent channeling New York's neurotic side, creating some of the most memorable roles in modern film history (Annie Hall, Leonard Zelig, Danny Rose, and of course – Allen himself), the 76-year-old film legend abruptly departed his familiar Manhattan backdrop in 2004, taking his introspective wit across the Atlantic, initially to London, then Barcelona, followed by Paris, and now Rome.<br/><br/>His latest release To Rome with Love has all the ingredients of yet another tasty Allen stew. But in the end, all we sample is watered-down broth, poorly seasoned, with stale recollections of the spicy flavors that made Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and Midnight in Paris so thoroughly original and enjoyable.<br/><br/>To be fair to Allen, he's coming off his biggest commercial success ever, which is a hard act to follow. Since his heyday as a writer-director-star during the 1970s, Allen's films haven't performed particularly well at the box office. But like summer stock theater, they tend to make just enough money to keep Allen atop the list of directors most actors long to work with. For that reason, Allen pretty much gets his pick of the litter as to who he casts in his films, and often writes characters perfectly suited to the typecasting.<br/><br/>Indeed for Allen, the blockbuster 2011 hit Midnight in Paris was tough to match – either critically or commercially. But not only does To Rome with Love fall far short, it doesn't even belong on the same continent.<br/><br/>The plot is very familiar territory for fans of Allen's films. Three stories are supposedly entwined, full of quirky characters, ultimately providing audiences with humor, greater understanding, and ultimately-- revelation. That was supposed to be recipe.<br/><br/>Trouble is, this time around none of the stories Allen has penned are particularly interesting or memorable. Predictably, Allen does manage to steal one segment, playing a bored American retiree who is accompanying his wife to Italy. They are scheduled to meet their daughter's soon-to-be husband, and family. As one can imagine, the interaction between Allen and the non-English speaking Italian family has its moments. The story blossoms when Allen unexpectedly discovers the Italian father can sing like Caruso. But the high point of this operatic mini-drama becomes too forced, testing the audience's patience to say nothing of straining credibility.<br/><br/>In the second story, Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) plays an American student living in Rome along with his girlfriend. When the girlfriend invites ""Monica"" to pay a visit, played wonderfully by Ellen Page (Juno), Eisenberg becomes infatuated with the new house guest and the fireworks begin. The always reliable Alec Baldwin, perfectly cast as the debonair know-it-all, oddly provides a voice of reason during Eisenberg's degenerative courtship, hoping to stop his protégé from making a complete fool of himself.<br/><br/>The final story seems both camp and patronizing, cookie-cutting arguably the only Italian actor widely recognizable to American audiences (Roberto Benigni -- Life is Beautiful) as the warm roasting chestnut to provide some wildly-exaggerated depiction of the ""average"" Italian. This story gets old quick, and drags down what would otherwise be at least a mildly entertaining film.<br/><br/>Italy should be perfect canon fodder for Allen's innumerable idiosyncrasies. A nation of wildly-gesturing people full of passion about everything -- art, soccer, food, whatever -- seems the perfect foil for all of Allen's self-centered New Yorkers. Instead, the opportunity is wasted. The film might as well have been shot in Cleveland.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much, there's no payoff in the end. For audiences expecting to see the combustible explosion during the final climactic scene from Allen's vast cinematic laboratory, we are left wondering why any of this mattered.<br/><br/>And that's the trouble – it didn't.<br/><br/>In his masterful 47-year film career, Allen rarely delivers a product that seems so unfinished. It's as though Allen wrote a (somewhat decent) first draft, and then suddenly called in the cameras to start shooting. Allen knows very well that greatness comes through time and repetition.<br/><br/>Like fine wine, this one needed to age a bit. It was served far too early. And like so many bad Chiantis, the tannins were overwhelming to the point of being undrinkable."
"Quinoa1984","7","17","24","2 September 2012"," a light trifle for Woody Allen is still amusing, hit-and-miss entertainment
","You kinda always know what you'll get with Woody Allen films by this point, which is that for every work that he does that knocks it out of the park (Match Point, Midnight in Paris), he'll come back and then... make a film that just stays as a single or double, to use baseball terms (i.e. Scoop, and this film). To Rome with Love is another ""Woody's European City Tour"" that follows London, Barcelona and of course Paris, and with Rome he pays tribute by doing one of those Italian anthology comedies (I haven't seen a lot of them frankly, but I'm thinking like back in the 60's with Boccaccio 62), and there are four stories that Woody could also have made individual films. Well, two would have been potentially amazing if they had the right focus (one of them, not so much, the time it has here is fine). Let's quickly rundown:<br/><br/>Woody himself returns for the first time on screen since Scoop (a little too old to be the romantic lead anymore, aside from, say, married to Judy Davis), and he and his wife go to see their daughter, played by Allison Pill, who is set to get married to Michelangelo. His parents are simple Roman folk, the father a mortician... who is also an amazing opera singer, but the catch is that he can only sing great in the shower (don't we all?) so Woody makes a trick: have him sing in the shower - on STAGE! Alec Baldwin plays a guy who, I think, looks back on his younger self as an impressionable architect (Jesse Eisenberg, very Woody-esque surrogate, but plays his own strengths well as well) who has a new romantic interest in the super-neurotic actress Ellen Page plays (a different turn for her that I had fun watching, though intentionally annoying as a character). An Italian couple are in love and are unfortunately separated and, through wacky misunderstandings, wind up with other partners over the course of one day. And Roberto Benigni is a regular guy chased by the paparazzi. Why? Why not?<br/><br/>Woody juggles between these stories and, the worst I can say about it is, it has an air of a sitcom to it. There's some misunderstandings and usually around fame or love or sex, or all of the above, and it's not too deep. Well, maybe the Baldwin/Eisenberg plot has some poignancy about a Man of the World who looks back on his youthful indiscretion, or would-be one, and there is a lot of humor to be mined. Hell, it's great to see Benigni have fun and be actually funny again in his premise, where he starts to go down deeper in the rabbit hole of fame. And while it's the weakest plot of all with the two Italian lovers split apart, when Penelope Cruz comes on screen for her brief time she's sexy, fun, and intelligent in her acting. Even Woody Allen himself, telling a lot of the brand of old, semi-corny jokes (but ALWAYS with a knowing wit and punchline) is amusing. <br/><br/>But when comedy works, it works, and there's a lot of stuff that worked here for me more than it didn't. Just seeing the old Italian man singing in the shower on stage (and applying/washing off Pagliaci make- up!) is a gag that only the most cynical would turn off on. It's a master filmmaker having fun, and a jazz clarinetist (yeah, I'm going there) noodling around on his instrument in a cinematic sort of way. I think for the summer season, which has passed know, it's a fine way to spend an afternoon or evening, not to mention with a wonderful cast by older-and-young Hollywood players and Italian not-so-well-known folks. Just not in an OMG YOU MUST SEE THIS IT WILL WIN AN Oscar sort of experience."
"paolocasonato","5","69","121","1 May 2012"," a wasted opportunity
","""To Rome with Love"" is a less successful movie than ""Midnight in Paris"", which is a little masterpiece, even though it had a much more ambitious goal.<br/><br/>Stories and characters are enjoyable (apart from Benigni, who in the end is less overacting than usual), but the flaw is in the background. Italy, as it is represented, is neither present Italy nor past, probably more similar to the one represented in the movies of the 50s or 60s . <br/><br/>Woody Allen's movie is a sincere tribute to Rome as seen in the history of cinema. However, this 'golden age' portrait, if compared to the present, seems alienating and little plausible: he might as well have done a costume film...<br/><br/>Some highlights are particularly appreciated though: first of all Alec Baldwin's character, then Penelope Cruz's, the ""newly-weds story"" (which was sufficient by itself to give a shade of Italian Comedy,)and finally the splendid photography. But on the other hand the movie is filled with a sensation of horror vacui that makes it a bit heavy and prolix (which is uncommon in Woody Allen).<br/><br/>It was a pity. Knowing the outstanding results Mr Allen has achieved in portraying human troubles and tragedies, one is left with the curiosity to know how he would have managed to portray (or allude to) the tragicomic current events that Italian reality abundantly offers. <br/><br/>But he would have needed a deeper look, which is hardly possible when one shoots two movies a year. So, instead of a big fresco portrait, the outcome is a nice little postcard."
"Red-125","9","41","72","8 July 2012"," Woody is back!
","To Rome with Love (2012) was written and directed by Woody Allen. In this movie Allen does for Rome what he has already done for New York and Paris--transformed the city into a magical kingdom where anything is possible.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have one plot, it has four. It doesn't have one star, it has about a dozen.<br/><br/>The four plots involve a young small-town Italian couple who arrive in Rome right after their marriage; a retired opera director (Allen) and his wife who come to Rome to join their daughter, who has fallen in love with a young Italian lawyer; a famous architect (Alec Baldwin) who interposes himself into the life of a young U.S. architecture student living in Rome; and an ordinary citizen (Roberto Benigni) who overnight inexplicably finds himself a major celebrity.<br/><br/>Things I learned about Woody Allen from this film: he hasn't lost his touch as a director; he hasn't lost his touch as an actor, as long as he can play Woody Allen; he hasn't lost the ability to write some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear in a movie.<br/><br/>Other things I learned: filling a movie with beautiful women--Ellen Page, Alessandra Mastronardi, Penélope Cruz--is generally a very good idea; Penélope Cruz was born to play an extremely sought-after high-class prostitute. <br/><br/>My wife and I enjoyed this film, and it was clear that other people in the theater liked it as well. Question: why is it rated 6.3 by the IMDb voters? Here's another case--see my review of ""First Position""--where I wonder if the voters who gave it a 6 saw the same movie that I saw. <br/><br/>""To Rome with Love"" is a funny, intelligent film with great acting and great views of Rome. See it and decide for yourself whether it deserves a 6.3 or a 9."
"Galina_movie_fan","8","7","9","16 April 2013"," Woody Allen's Roman Holiday
","During Woody Allen's European vacation, he has made four stops in London, visited Barcelona, dropped for a short visit to New York City, spent one summer in Paris, and then he had Roman Holiday last summer. All the tourist attractions of the Eternal City are in full display in Allen's film and they are spectacular: the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps, the Coliseum, and panoramic views of the city from above, the rain at night, and outdoor cafés. Like in Paris' movie before that, Darius Khondji's camera finds unexpected and hidden angles of famous Rome beauty. The sound of wonderful melodic Italian songs and arias are heard everywhere -and what is Italy or Rome without music? Four different stories in which the Romans and the visitors are involved play against this joyous background of Rome glowing under summer sun. It seems that Allen created a mini Decameron. The stories do not overlap, but they have in common Rome and love in Rome to Rome.<br/><br/>Comparison with last year Allen's film about Paris certainly arises, but as Paris and Rome are two very different cities, even though both are famous, beautiful and often serve as a background or even an important character in the movie (""Fellini's Rome,"" and ""Paris, I Love You"", for example), so the Allen's movies about Paris and Rome are quite different. The Roman film, in my opinion, lacks rare magic and brilliance of ""Midnight in Paris."" The reason seems to be in switching from one story to another, and there are, as I've mentioned, four of them. Each is funny and attractive in its own way, but as the whole they failed to produce magic. As the rule, all stories in an anthology can't be on the same level. The story of Leopoldo, for instance, had intriguing premise but then just lost some of its steam.<br/><br/>Definite plus - for the first time in the last six years, Allen is in front of the camera as well as behind it. Allen knows a secret of physical comedy. He can simply stay in the frame, even in the background and keep silent, and his face will express a range of feelings and emotions, the predominant being a mixture of confusion and dumbfoundedness. Some might say that we've seen it all before but I don't mind. Allen is a good comedian who always makes me smile and laugh. And the same can be said of his Roman film. Allen does not do anything new here but the movie is good. For example, the idea of introducing a singer with the great voice who can only sing in the shower was original and smart. The film is funny, witty, beautiful, bright, and very light, feather-light. Its creator is 76 years but you hardly believe it when he sends us on Roman holiday.<br/><br/>My conclusion - any Allen's movie, even average comparing to his best work, is worth watching. If you are a die-hard fan like me, you've seen it already. I've said many times before and I repeat again - even the average Woody Allen's movie is better than most cookie-cutter comedies released by big studios. If you are not a fan, give ""To Rome with Love"" a chance, you may fell in love with it. This is the first anthology by Allen for many years and I'm sure you'll like if not four by some of the stories. I am personally delighted by the story of the owner of the funeral home, who sang like Caruso and Pavarotti, but only in the shower, to the sound of pouring water while lathering his back. Or, perhaps, you'll like a surreal story of a simple Roman office employee, who one sunny day out of sudden became insanely famous and popular. Moreover, he could not figure out what actually happened and what exactly he did or did not do? Real celebrities and the crowds of the journalists all listened to his every word as the highest wisdom. Or you may click with the story of Jack, a young American architect -student, his girlfriend, and her best friend - a heart-breaker, of Jack's inner voice played by Alec Baldwin. Well, if you cannot stand Allen, I'll let you in on a secret, if you do not know by now. There is also Penelope Cruz in the role of Anna (I think Woody bowed to Anna Magnani's ""Mother Rome"" and Sophia Loren - Filomena from ""Marriage: Italian Style"") and it is impossible to take the eyes off her. Anna - is the character from the fourth story which is about newlyweds who came to Rome for a honeymoon from the small town and the cheerful confusion that occurred when the young bride stepped out of the hotel and got lost in the maze of the Rome's streets. If the presence of Cruz in her second Allen's film is still not enough for you, well, then I do not even know what to say. Only that you should choose for your Roman holiday another Rome, not the one that Woody Allen created."
"Brendonwbrown","4","7","9","27 October 2012"," Scenery with little plot.
","I love movies based on ancient European cities, full of history, scenery and culture. When the movie was over, I found that scenery was all I could take away from it. It would seem that the underlying message of the movie is that people are idiots, will make poor decisions, and still everything will be alright in the end. This movie could have been filmed in any city, town or farmstead, but having Rome at its centre, the weak script, characters whose actions do not follow, and lame dialogue are almost forgivable. Did anyone understand why Alec Baldwin continually showed up at the scene of every activity among the college friends? How bored is an older gentlemen that he has to spend days following a group of unimpressive students around, and how is it the students tolerate him? This looked like it could have been a great movie, but was such a let-down."
"gridoon2020","5","17","27","26 September 2012"," A disappointment from Woody Allen
","The opening sequence of this film filled me with hope....Rome, probably my favorite city in the world, seen through the awestruck eyes of Woody Allen....unfortunately, until the equally magnificent closing scene, he doesn't really make Rome an integral part of his stories....of course there are a few token references to the Collosseum and the Vatican, but also a few too many interior shots. Woody himself, at age 77, is still the funniest performer in the film, AND of course he gives himself most of the best lines as well (""He does it for pleasure, not for money"" - ""Well, there is a lot of pleasure IN money""!). But while his segment is pretty funny, it's also basically one-joke. The segment with the Italian couple moving to the big city begins well and the couple is appealing, but it goes astray when it turns into a story of double infidelity; this could have been handled either as an all-out farce or as a serious drama, but Allen seems, rather disagreeably, to imply that the whole incident was beneficial to the couple! Nevertheless, this segment includes the three loveliest women in the film, the adorable up-and-coming Alessandra Mastronardi, the getting-hotter-every-year Penelope Cruz, and a cameo by the ageless Ornella Muti! (she should have had a bigger part). The segment with the American couple who find their relationship tested by the arrival of the girl's uninhibited best female friend feels mostly artificial and unconvincing - perhaps because Ellen Page never quite succeeds in looking like a strong enough temptation for Jesse Eisenberg to abandon Gret Gerwig. As for the Roberto Benigni segment, it's pointless, unfunny and repetitive. When I saw ""Il Mostro"" at the theater in the mid-1990s, the audience was roaring with laughter; during 90% of Benigni's scenes in ""To Rome With Love"" the audience was dead quiet. Overall, a lightweight disappointment from Woody, though not without moments of pleasure for his fans. ** out of 4."

Woody Allen as always a great, witty and in his fine creative form. I have been very glad to see his on a screen and his performance with Judy Davis was one of the most funny in that beautiful movie.

","""Woody Allen has lost the magic that once made he's a films a delight to watch, Midnight in Paris had it unlike this film""<br/><br/>To Rome with Love revolves around the life of many many people either living or on trip to the city of Rome. They can all be seen by a man who directs where cars go. The American girl (Alison Pill) bringing her parents (Judy Davis and Woody Allen) to Italy so she can marry her Italian boyfriend (Flavio Parenti) and also meet the parents of the boyfriend which includes the father who is turned into an opera singer father and mother . Then there is Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) who becomes a celebrity which seems over night, an Italian man who is mistaken for another when Anna (Penelope Cruz) a prostitute walks in. There is also Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) and Sally (Greta Gerwig) who's relationship is almost ruined by Sally's friend Monica (Ellen Page). The film I believe fails because the script try's to juggle all these story's and in the end I found none of them interesting.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Woody Allen it's sad for me to talk about my hate for this film as I felt every single actor was wasted especially since I like most of these actors. I had high expectations for this film as I felt Allen made a comeback with Midnight in Paris last year but I did learn that it was based on an early story he wrote. So I have to come to the conclusion that he has lost his magic to make interesting films with big casts and none of them being the weak link.<br/><br/>Sure all the actors were good but that's only because they made the most they were given with. Alison Pill was wasted unlike her previous work with Allen, Allen himself was given a lot to do but he is not an actor and needs to give someone else a chance, Davis I almost forgot was in the film is bad because I like her so much. This film gives us a chance to see what happened Benigni after he won the Oscar because he seemed to disappear and in this film he just is a mess showing that sometimes really bad actors can get Oscars. Penelope Cruz when she worked with Allen last won an Oscar but even though she is not as good she is best in the film because she gets to be funny and speak in an accent. Then there is the love story which seemed OK but then how they end it was just off putting with me hating Page in this film. <br/><br/>To sum up my feelings on the film all I have to say was I looked at my watch many times watching the film which is not a good thing when watching a film because it means it's boring. Allen was able to get this company of actors but I feel that he should have cut some plots and maybe it would have followed better then the final product.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: E- (MVP: Penelope Cruz)"

In that movie, Paris was visually excellent and so was UK and new york in his previous films.But this time, Woody failed to show any beauty in Rome.Rome was dull and depressing here.Also the characters were always the plus points in his films.In 'To Rome with love',characters behave the way they are illogically especially the honeymoon couple. Singing under shower on stage is the most annoying scene(s) in woody Allen's career and it is not at all funny.<br/><br/>I was very happy to see woody back to form with 'Midnight in Paris' and he disappointed me with this"

","I am a fan of Woodie Allen, even if I didn't always like all his movies (but I have many favorites). Even in movies I didn't enjoy I understood the point - ""To Rome with Love"" HAS NO POINT. The acting at times is bad, the stories are incoherent and the script surprisingly feels written by a 9 year old child... Something I never expected from a Woodie Allen movie. <br/><br/>I left the theater feeling I had undergone a social experiment by someone who wanted to see, after the success of ""Midnight in Paris"", if someone would stand up and shout ""The king is naked!"".<br/><br/>Of the 4 parallel story lines only 1 was somewhat watchable and that's because of Alec Baldwin, and even that storyline started so incoherently that it was hard to enjoy it for the rest of the movie."

","""To Rome with Love"" comes off as a series of short stories written by a middle school student, lacking any logic and possessing the sexual maturity of a thirteen year old boy. Employing the ""bigger is better"" approach, Woody Allen takes the device he used in the far more successful ""Midnight in Paris"" of a nebbish character swept up in an unexplained fantasy and cranks out a series of nonsensical vignettes depicting nebbish characters in unexplained fantasies, replacing the impressive vistas of Paris for the impressive vistas of Rome. There are a few laughs along the way, but Allen spreads himself so thin that he is unable to provide his universe with any depth or reality and tries to get by on the audience's familiarity with his work and the faded idea that whatever he puts on screen represents quality.<br/><br/>The most successful episode features Alec Baldwin as a world-weary architect who makes a sentimental journey to the street he lived on as a student and encounters young Jesse Eisenberg now in residence and living out a romantic entanglement that Baldwin pops in and out of to provide jaded insight. This sequence at least offers some actual emotion for the audience to connect with (largely due to the fine acting of Baldwin, Eisenberg and Ellen Page as a sexy but neurotic actress steeped in Allen's signature pseudo intellectuality) but is so confused about Baldwin's presence that the audience is unclear if he is simply the person he is presented as, if Eisenberg is his younger self who he has come back to mentor, or if it is some bizarre ""Twilight Zone"" scenario that is never fully resolved. Even when he is in the room with the characters Eisenberg is interacting with, no one makes any reference to Baldwin and no one except Eisenberg can seem to hear what Baldwin is saying (the few times when the other characters do respond to Baldwin only make it more confusing when they don't). Yet this peculiar relationship is never explained and seems a product of Allen's sloppy writing rather than mysterious forces at work.<br/><br/>The rest of the vignettes are just lazy, implausible nonsense whose outrageousness is forced and seems planted there to make up for any genuine wit. The most tiresome sequence is Roberto Begnini as a mundane worker bee who inexplicably wakes up to find himself the most famous man in the world. It's a one-joke premise that goes on for far too long, and since Begnini's boring drone doesn't get any more interesting as a result of what he's experienced, neither does the story. A young couple on their honeymoon are parted just as they are about to meet some people who are important to their future, and the husband implausibly substitutes prostitute Penélope Cruz for his absent wife. The newlyweds end up throwing aside the marriage vows that they just took in an alarming display of Allen's sexual immaturity. And Allen himself makes an appearance as a frustrated opera director who discovers a major talent who can only show off his gifts in the shower, in yet another one-joke misfire.<br/><br/>It is sad that after a long stretch of sub-par work and redeeming himself with some quality films like ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""Match Point"" that Allen is content to present a lazy effort like ""To Rome with Love"" which is so derivative of his ""early, funny films"" without any of the freshness or inventiveness. If you're looking for something to do this weekend, I recommend popping ""Annie Hall"" into the DVD player and giving this one a pass."
"chaz-28","6","19","38","6 July 2012"," Woody Allen sets his camera on Rome this time weaving together an anthology of stories and interjecting Rome as its own character
","We have seen Woody Allen's multiple love letters to New York City, London, Barcelona, and Paris; now he sets his satirical eye on the ancient city of Rome. Starting halfway through the previous decade, Woody Allen altered his standard oeuvre from mostly comedic farce with a dash of autobiographical drama set amongst towering New York skyscrapers to films set in major European centers where the city itself is almost its own character. Barcelona nudged its way into the love triangle of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Paris's nightclubs and streets were a central character along with Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein in Midnight in Paris. In To Rome with Love, Woody is even less subtle about his intentions by loudly proclaiming in the film's title what he is up to.<br/><br/>There are multiple stories entering and exiting the stage with even more characters; however, unlike the majority of films which juggle numerous plot lines, these do not intersect; they exist by themselves and involve their own unique Roman characteristics. There is John (Alec Baldwin) who chooses to retrace his former life as a young man in Rome 30 years ago and ends up having a very interesting encounter with Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), Sally (Greta Gerwig), and the flippant Monica (Ellen Page). John has seen it all before and sets himself up as a Greek Chorus variant to the younger crowd. By the end of their section, every man in the audience over 30 should be nodding their heads in agreement about the Sally vs. Monica pros and cons. Their love triangle is a convenient excuse to insert the ancient ruins and architecture which you knew must fit somewhere in the film.<br/><br/>Hayley (Alison Pill) is in her early 20s and fulfills one of the ultimate lost tourist clichés in Rome; she bumps into Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), falls in love, and decides to spend the rest of her life in Italy. Upon hearing the news, Hayley's parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Allen), jet over to Rome to meet this guy and survey the situation. In his typical Woody Allen way, Jerry has a lot to say about the turbulence on the flight over, sizes up Michelangelo as a Communist, and can barely stand the irony that Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), is an undertaker. Leave it to Woody to be able to fit his absolute phobia of death and all its accompaniments into a film about Rome. This particular film segment uses Roman opera as its backdrop with a very clever farce involving singing in the shower.<br/><br/>The most blatant comedic segment in the film is Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni). He is just a regular working stiff who wakes up at the same time every morning, eats his toast, goes to work, engages in water cooler talk, and comes home. One day, Leopoldo starts getting chased by obsessive paparazzi and screaming autograph seekers wherever he goes who want to know what he likes on his toast, how he shaves, and whether he is a boxers or briefs man. There is no reason for his sudden fame explosion which confuses Leopoldo all the more. This also confused the old ladies sitting next to me; however, this was a brilliant way for Allen to skewer the celebrity fetish. Some people are famous for just being famous even though they have accomplished absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>It seems Woody Allen used his most recent European love letter to fit in some messages he has had stirring around his brain for a little bit. He tackles the odd fascination with know- and do-nothing celebrities, the appeal of going after the vapid and attractive female even though you know she is ridiculous and it will only end badly, and what I suppose is a critique of not being a prude at the beginning of marriage. Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) have just arrived in Rome after their wedding to start their new life. Through a silly and contrived sequence of events which only serve to set up a ridiculous situation, Antonio winds up with a stunningly gorgeous prostitute, Anna (Penelope Cruz), and Milly winds up tempted by her most favorite actor in the world. This particular part of the film does not work too well but it does provide plenty of laughs as inappropriately clad Anna visits the Vatican.<br/><br/>To Rome with Love is not among the top tier of Woody Allen's decade long infatuation with filming in European locales (Midnight in Paris) but it is certainly not the worst (Scoop). Weaving in and out of these disconnected plot lines is fun and most of them are quite enjoyable. Using Rome and all of its wonderful settings to tie all of his characters together easily helps out what will most likely become one of the more middle of the road and average Wood Allen pictures. However, it is worth noting than an average Woody Allen film is head and shoulders above what is playing down the street in your local multiplex right now."
"treeline1","Null","12","22","24 January 2013"," Unbelievably bad
","Four unrelated vignettes involving tourists, newlyweds, and quirky locals play out in Rome. The characters are neither sympathetic, likable, interesting, nor memorable. The plots are like fantasy daydreams but still manage to be incredibly tiresome. I was so glad when the movie was over.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the photography is exquisite. Rome is filmed in a warm, golden light that makes it look like a fairytale city for lovers. Some very good actors get stuck with trite material and Woody Allen is still playing the same loser character he's been doing for forty years.<br/><br/>Terrible movie."
"nogodnomasters","8","2","2","19 July 2018"," I FAILED HIGH SCHOOL SPANISH
","The film consists of four parallel stories that take place in Rome. Each story is a criticism of the entertainment industry. Likewise the total movie is a criticism in that it which incorporates an over abundance of Italian music and formulaic plots. Allen also adds his frequent themes of sex, love, death, and culture.<br/><br/>In one tale celebrity status is spoofed as an ordinary man suddenly is famous for being famous.<br/><br/>In another tale we see a Hollywood actress have an affair with her friend's boyfriend. This was classic Allen as Alec Baldwin plays the voice of intellect and reason within all of our heads, the one we ignore when a woman becomes a possible conquest.<br/><br/>A third tale includes Allen himself as a retired producer with bad ideas, but has convinced himself he is simply ahead of his time.<br/><br/>The fourth tale involves a small town woman almost seduced by a celebrity, while her husband attempts to pass off a prostitute as his wife.<br/><br/>While the stories ran parallel, they were connected through the use of sound track and common style, as if to say, all movies about Italy are the same. I feel the film would have been better if Allen had left off that fourth story and spent more time on the other three. The episode with Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg with Alec Baldwin was my favorite and I wish they had stretched that one out. That was more of the old classic Woody Allen that I love. Perhaps if I was familiar with ""The Decameron"" I would have liked this film more.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb (thank you Ellen); no nudity. Implied sex and sex talk."
"vogun-17563","9","2","2","11 March 2018"," Carry On Woody
","A sophisticated Carry On romp? Which may mean more to UK readers? Others outline the plot and actors etc. and this is for those who want an opinion of, if to watch it or not. I say yes, Woody's in top form here.<br/><br/>It was all going on here at an active pace, with bedroom farce and gags coming thick and fast. Sure, it's not plausible (neither were Marx Brothers films) but that didn't matter to me, I was laughing out aloud in an empty room, which is usually a good sign of a good movie.<br/><br/>I remember when people used to say something like ""Where's the old Woody Allen, when he used to be funny?"" well here he is. He's used the backdrop of Rome and his love of Italian movies to hang his usual incisive observations, absurdity and irreverence, all combined with his comedic skills as a performer and writer. There really are some great lines and visual gags. <br/><br/>A small example: there is one scene where Roberto Benigni, catapulted into celebrity status, is caught by the papparazi (a familiar theme in films about Rome) with a pretty woman, who is not his wife, and runs off to seek refuge and runs directly into a Church Procession, which blocks his escape. A nice touch I thought. <br/><br/>Woody Allen must have the pick of talent from where ever he wants, and he has certainly chosen wisely with a rich array of actors, all going along for the craziness. Rome is the backdrop and is looking good. <br/><br/>If you want the finer detail about the film read others worthy reviews (I can't understand the bad ones of course), but if you want an opinion as to if you should watch, then I thought it's up there with Woody Allen's best, but may not be high art, just great fun. Go along with it and you just may enjoy the ride."
"blanche-2","6","2","2","28 May 2014"," some good moments
","I've said it before and I'll say it again - you can't churn out movies the way Woody Allen does and not have a few clinkers along the way. To Rome with Love is not a masterpiece, but it has some good scenes.<br/><br/>Set in beautiful, breathtaking Rome, the film tells four stories: A retired opera director (Allen) visiting his daughter and her new fiancée discovers the boy's father can sing like Caruso; a prostitute (Penelope Cruz) is mistaken for a man's wife by his family; the man's wife is quite naive, ends up on a film studio and is taken to the apartment of one of her favorite actors; a man (Alec Baldwin) returns to the place of his youth and serves as the conscience/adviser to a young man (Jesse Eisenberg) about to fall for his girlfriend's friend (Ellen Page). And a director (Roberto Benigni) becomes an overnight celebrity and is hounded everywhere he goes.<br/><br/>Some of these worked better than others. I'm partial to the opera singer story - Allen and Judy Davis play Jerry and Phyllis, the parents of Hayley (Allison Pitt), and her future father-in-law, Giancarlo, is portrayed by opera star Fabio Armiliato. Giancarlo's voice is magnificent, but only when he's in a shower, so Allen comes out of retirement (which he is dying to do) and stages a Pagliacci with Canio in a portable, decorated shower.<br/><br/>My second favorite is the newlyweds, featuring Alessandro Tiberi as Antonio, Penelope Cruz as Anna, and Alessandra Mastronadi as Milly. This is the most ""Italian"" part of the film and perhaps the most successful. Milly leaves the hotel, becomes terribly lost, and loses her cell phone. While she's wandering around, Anna (Cruz) enters Antonio and Milly's hotel room, mistaking it for the room she was to go to, and starts trying to kiss Antonio on the bed, just as Antonio's relatives arrive. His uncle mistakes her for Milly, and she goes along with it.<br/><br/>Milly, meanwhile, finds herself at a movie studio and meets her favorite actor, who wants to seduce her. Everyone winds up at the same restaurant together.<br/><br/>I didn't find the acting all that great, particularly in the beginning; it seemed very artificial, though later, I didn't find that as much. I frankly found the Jesse Eisenberg-Ellen Page story a little annoying, as I did the Robert Begnini one. By the way, Penelope Cruz in a tight-fitting, short red dress was drop dead gorgeous.<br/><br/>All in all, worth seeing. I think Allen always has something to offer and even at his age is trying new techniques and new cities."

","In Rome, there are lots of folks on the verge of great love. There is the young American tourist (Alison Pill) who just happens to get directions to the Trevi fountain from a gorgeous young Italian lawyer. Soon, they are seeing the city and having dinner. But, the idyllic phase may be over when her parents (Judy Davis and Woody Allen) fly in from the States to meet the young man and his family. The lawyer's father, a mortician, sings opera in the shower well but fails to make an impact when he has no soap in his hands. Then, there is a young architectural student (Jesse Eisenberg) who has a live-in girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) he supposedly is much in love with. What a curveball when her longtime, struggling-actress pal (Ellen Page) shows up to turn his attentions in a new direction. An older building designer (Alec Baldwin) is around to give him advice. There is also the gentle clerk (Roberto Benigni) who suddenly captures the world's attention, even to what kind of underwear he sports! And, what about the young married couple, straight from the country, who come to Rome for a new, wealthier life and get tangled up with a call girl (Penelope Cruz) and a philandering actor? What doings and what romance is in the air! Dear Woody, don't be scared, but I am a number one fan, among many in the world. Therefore, every work you create is like adding a new element to the periodic table. This one is fresh, funny, clever, and utterly gorgeous in its photography. The cast, very large, is also terrific! Bravo! For all you film fans everywhere, in Rome, New York, or Peoria, go see it. Immediately, if not sooner."

","Hollywood should stop Woody Allen producing movies if he is to recycle his genres over and over and over again. <br/><br/>'To Rome With Love' is a clichéd Woody Allen piece with his hackneyed signatures like multi-layered love stories, couples that came together due to accidents and a babbling, irritating Woody Allen in whichever boring roles he wrote for himself - that last bit has not changed a bit since Annie Hall and man, that was over 30 years ago.<br/><br/>While the film has moments of brilliance, the odd but banal plot does not save the day: Alec Baldwin's part was cheesy and awkward, and one wonders why his younger companions were not annoyed by his presence; what happened to Benigni was left unexplained - in a way it needs no explanation but it sounds ridiculous from the beginning - leaving one feeling somewhat disconnected to the story. In fact, all the stories are not connected, but it is not like Paris Je T'aime where the audience knows it contains unrelated stories. At times, I feel that Woody Allen was trying to make the stories stick together but failed. The incoherence has created such distance between the plot and the audience that the whole film looks like nothing more than a showcase of brilliant actors whose only job was to be beautiful in Rome."
"TheSquiss","1","10","19","21 September 2012"," Reputedly a farce, it is more accurately described as awful.
","Having survived the disappointment of Hope Springs, I crossed to the next screening room confident that my evening's viewing would substantially improve.<br/><br/>Woody Allen has continued his filmic tour of Europe in his 40-something cinema outing as director with To Rome With Love. It's a tour that has introduced his work to new audiences, seen him tread new ground, particularly with the murderous Match Point, and given us some engaging, funny, thoroughly enjoyable films like Vicky Cristina Barcelona and last year's delightful Midnight in Paris.<br/><br/>To Rome With Love is not one of those films.<br/><br/>Reputedly a farce, it is more accurately described as 'awful'. Attempting to weave multiple plot lines through a city apparently filled with love, it manages to lack the quirky charm of Annie Hall, will never garner the plaudits of Hannah and Her Sisters and falls woefully short of the entertainment value of even Match Point. It's not quite a stinker it's just No, who am I kidding? It positively reeks! I like Woody Allen more when he's not acting. Unfortunately, in To Rome With Love there are 2.5 people playing the standard Woody Allen role: Allen, himself, who performs like a knitted, woolen toy that has been through a washing machine cycle a good 60 degrees too hot, Jesse Eisenberg, who does a far better (read: annoying) job of being Woody Allen, and Roberto Benigni who seems unsure whether to give us a third Woody Allen impersonation or reprise his performance from Life is Beautiful.<br/><br/>Allen plays Jerry, the father of Ellen Page's Monica, though he looks more like her grandfather and, at 77, is old enough to be her great grandfather while his wife, Phyllis (Judy Davis), isn't much of an improvement. Poor girl, she must have been severely bullied at school. But don't exert yourself feeling too sorry for Monica, she's purported to be an absolutely stunning Venus in human form and so engaging that men throw themselves at her feet, or so Jack (Eissenberg) and his girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig) believe. Sally believes it so much she invites her to stay and spend time alone with Jack despite the warnings of John (Alec Baldwin). None of them seem to have realized this is Ellen Page we're talking about! Meanwhile, Antonio has brought his new bride, Milly, to Rome to meet his aunts and uncles who may give him a job but he inexplicably pretends his wife is actually Anna (Penélope Cruz) who actually earns her living on her back.<br/><br/>Then Hayley meets, and moments later, falls in love with Michelangelo whose father, Giancarlo, likes to sing in the shower. And then there's Leopoldo (Benigni) who Have you lost the will to live yet? Maybe it looked funny (or even fun) on paper, Allen certainly savours (milks) every line he evidently thinks is funny, but actually To Rome With Love is akin to watching eight year olds improvise for the most part and is always far less amusing.<br/><br/>I tried gnawing my leg off after thirty minutes to see if it was more fun. It wasn't but it was a close run thing.<br/><br/>In the audience of six, the silence at the 'funny' parts was resounding and, judging from the comments I overheard as we all scuttled out before the credits, all of us endured the full 112 minutes because we couldn't quite believe it would be that bad all the way through.<br/><br/>It was. You have been warned."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","6","10","9 March 2013"," Neither terrible or great,, just wildly uneven
","I haven't admittedly seen enough of Woody Allen's films to judge where To Rome with Love stands. Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhatten, Husbands and Wives and Hannah and Her Sisters I love, and Midnight in Paris was also hugely enjoyable. There are a number still though that I need to watch or re-watch, I remember liking but not loving Vicky Christina Barcellona and not liking Scoop at all but that might change on re-watch. I was left disappointed by To Rome with Love though, it is not as terrible as I've seen cited on IMDb as there were parts where I was entertained, but it wasn't really great either.<br/><br/>There are things I did like of To Rome with Love in general, before I get on to what was good and bad about the four segments. The film looks absolutely gorgeous, Rome is stunning and very like a character itself and the photography compliments it wonderfully. The soundtrack is infectious and hugely memorable, with a lot of zesty Italian flavour. Some of the acting is good also and there is one delightful but all too brief cameo, and the script does have its funny moments.<br/><br/>Much doesn't work though, the pacing is very uneven, some of it feels rushed and others too drawn out. While there are some funny parts, there are just as many awkward and clunky parts as well. Nothing really is that insightful or thought-provoking, there is the odd classic Woody Allen moment but at the end of the day it feels under-cooked. To me also, I found only one character that I came close to caring for. The four segments have good parts and bad parts, but on the most part they seem overlong, often with an interesting but thin concept that feels overstretched, and irrelevant to one another. If they were half as long I think they would have been effective.<br/><br/>For me the newlyweds storyline was the best one. Some of the most beautiful scenery of the film is in this segment, and there are some genuinely funny moments like the husband falling off the chair at the sight of his new wife with another man. The characters are not particularly well developed, you never know them well enough, but they are well played. Ornelia Muti makes a cameo, and it is delightful with her still looking great, but you do wish she had a bigger part. Penelope Cruz steals the show here, she is breathtakingly hot- she always was but I can swear she gets more and more so- and she plays the only character in To Rome With Love that comes across as likable as I liked how straightforward she was. Where the segment didn't work so well was the all-too-convenient ending and how it did feel at times like five different plots.<br/><br/>Close behind is the segment with Jesse Eisenberg and Alec Baldwin. The best part of this segment is Baldwin, the best lines go to him and he relishes them in a direct and very funny performance. Jesse Eisenberg is endearing and Ellen Page makes the most of her somewhat ironic role. Greta Gerwig is underused and doesn't have enough time to shine properly. Again there are some good moments and dialogue with Baldwin getting the best of it. But at the same time, Gerwig's dialogue sounds awkward too much, the segment later drags on for too long and ends on an underwhelmingly stupid note. I also wished that it expanded on Baldwin's character, I still don't get its significance or point in the story.<br/><br/>Woody Allen and the opera singer in the shower segment is in third place. The scenery is great, Judy Davis's(who is wonderful in this movie, third best actor in the film after Baldwin and Cruz) dialogue is highly amusing and Allen has some nice ones too(like the Imbecile line) and Fabio Armiliato has a wonderful voice. Allen himself has some good moments and lines, but often he does seem as though he's trying too hard. The man in the shower idea is very one-joke and silly, but in this film it was meant to be and for a vast majority of the time it was classic Woody Allen. As dragged out as it became though, it got increasingly ridiculous. The Pagliacci performance for instance was wonderfully ironic and did a good job of poking fun at badly done concept opera productions, but at the same time it did come too late and the practical problems of staging Pagliacci in that way were too numerous to ignore.<br/><br/>Roberto Benigni's story was the worst. And actually apart from a priceless line from the chauffeur and the lovely scenery and soundtrack, it was the only one that I didn't like at all. The story was just too contrived and thin with the much-overdue moral far too obvious, and Benigni in a very underwritten role comes across as too much of a clown, especially when he is in the road shouting his head off. The writing also was just lazy and unfunny. I understand completely that it was a story about somebody suddenly becoming famous and it certainly happens in real life. But while it is an everyday occurrence and had potential to be shown in a movie if written well, there was just nothing new or interesting about it, telling us things that we already know.<br/><br/>So all in all, not terrible or great, but uneven and disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Moviegoer19","6","11","22","3 February 2013"," A Real Disappointment
","When I saw that a new Woody Allen film was out entitled To Rome With Love, I was thrilled, both because I usually enjoy his films, and because I am going to Rome for the first time in a couple of months. Well, what a letdown it was. Presenting the stories of a few couples and/or families and friends, the film seemed to be an attempt at Woody's usual m.o.'s, i.e., comedy, and his philosophical takes and questions on the things that matter to him, mainly male/female relationships, art/creativity, and life/death. While most of his films succeed in conveying both comic and philosophic perspectives on these issues, To Rome With Love did not. It came off as being a superficial, lightweight attempt at all of the above. In my opinion, some of the humor bordered on slapstick, and much of the script was predictable. I'm sorry to have to say all this as I was hoping for so much more. Maybe the next one will happen. Oh, and BTW, I think Woody should give up acting. At least in this film, he added nothing, and perhaps, detracted from it. The character he plays is hackneyed, worn out, and predictable. Better to have someone else play him, as in Midnight in Paris, which was so wonderful."
"goodone49","9","5","8","27 December 2014"," I thought it was one of Allen's best
","Yes, we've all seen Woody Allen films and know from the outset that they contain several intertwined stories that are distinct yet inextricably linked, and this one was no different. However, the distinction here is the element of fantasy that is involved in each of these stories, which has become increasing central to Allen's films of late, e.g., Midnight in Paris, the stories just seem so much more interesting than I seem to recall in some of his other films. Most noteworthy about this film is the score. It is so beautifully and aptly played throughout that it seems to almost be a narrator of the movie, as it gently guides the viewer from scene to scene. The fantastic score also gives the movie an extra element of rhythm both literally and figuratively in that it keeps things quite upbeat. The acting was very well done, with the exception of Ellen Page, which was not really her fault, because she was simply not well cast for her role. Overall, this movie was great! I thought it was one of Allen's best in quite some time."

","Woody Allen's latest film, ""To Rome With Love"", may be a companion piece to his wonderful ""Midnight in Paris"", having a style and approach similar to the earlier Oscar-winner. Unfortunately, in Rome we're bogged down by four unrelated stories with characters that are charming, but mostly never explored to their full potential. And with many of the scenes taking place indoors, I never found myself being transported to the titular city as I was so completely with ""Midnight"". I will give props to Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz, and Ellen Page for some fine acting and comedic timing, and double-props to Woody for still being able to dead-pan like no other. I hate to compare films, but when your opening title sequence uses the same style and font as the last one you made, can you expect me not to?

Such a great movie! Hilarious, amusing, and cool: full of jokes and funny moments.<br/><br/>Woody manages (as always) to tell his story with humour, deep, jokes and more. This time he tells 4 stories, all amusing and imaginative.<br/><br/>I love that Woody is in the movie, accompanied by the great and beautiful Judy Davis. When they first appear, in the plane, we already get Woody's philosophical humour. He says to Judy: ""I can't unclench when there's turbulence. You know, I am an atheist.""<br/><br/>My favorite character is Leopoldo Pisanello, played brilliantly by the hilarious Roberto Benigni. We laugh every second that he's in the movie. The Italian actors Alessandro Tiberi (Antonio, Milly's husband), Alessandra Mastronardi (Milly), Antonio Albanese (the famous actor Luca Salta), and Riccardo Scamarcio (the hotel burglar) are all hilarious. The legendary Ornella Muti appears 10 seconds in the film. <br/><br/>Fabio Armiliato is a very well-known opera tenor singer who plays the role of Giancarlo beautifully and sings amazing (in the shower). Armiliato has had leading roles and sung in the most prestigious opera houses of the world (Metropolitan Opera House of New York, La Scala in Milan, and L'Opéra de Paris). <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin is great as always. Jesse Eisenberg plays to the perfection the role of a shy and confused young man. Penélope Cruz is wonderful and beautiful as always. Alison Pill (Hayley)'s performance is very fresh, and Flavio Parenti (who is Michelangelo, Hayley's fiancé) is great in his role as an angry ultra left-wing young man. Monica Nappo plays amazingly Pisanello's humble wife. <br/><br/>Since Page and Gerwig opportunistically stabbed Woody right after the world saw Dylan Farrow's crocodile's tears in January 2018 (she's been trying to destroy Woody with her prefabricated story for ages), I can't stand watching them onscreen. Their treason, hypocrisy and opportunism will be always remembered (unlike their acting). Nevertheless, the lines that Woody wrote for them are really good.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film is really beautiful. Cinematographer Darius Khondji (born in Iran but majored in Film at New York University) worked previously with Woody in Anything Else (2003) and Midnight in Paris (2011) and would go on working with Woody in two other films: Magic in the Moonlight (2014) and the masterpiece Irrational Man (2015). Other great works of Khondji include Delicatessen (1991), La cité des enfants perdus (1995), Alien: Resurrection (1997), and Amour (2012). He also worked as a cinematographer in many videos of Madonna. <br/><br/>To Rome With Love is rated in IMDB ""restricted"". I really don't know why. Maybe because Penélope plays a prostitute? Well, as we all know in the States it's OK to watch movies with thousands of bombs, guns, and killers, but love and sex are more dangerous and always restricted. Funny country...<br/><br/>To Rome With Love is another Woody Allen gem. A fresh and funny film, packed with jokes, beautiful long shots, great writing and a wonderful cast. 10/10<br/><br/>The worst: that Page and Gerwig contaminate the film (two ungrateful hypocrites who opportunistically stabbed Woody) .<br/><br/>The best: all the funny moments, Woody, the great Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, and the cinematography.<br/><br/>We love you, Woody!"

","Whilst Woody's character was my favourite, his directing let him down somewhat. Flicking between the four independent little stories every few minutes was enough to drive anyone mad.

","Woody Allen movies seem to always be either a hit or a miss. This particular film didn't even rise to the miss category. It was predictable and dull. There were a few funny lines, which all happened to be Woody's, but even those were few and far between. Woody's last effort, Midnight in Paris, was a delight, pure perfection. This one, however, is so forgettable as to be not worth bothering with. I will say I enjoyed Alec Baldwin's part, but that wasn't nearly enough to carry the movie. It was clear how Allen wanted to have the mix all come together and easy to see what he was striving for with each episode.but none of it really worked. Over-acted and under-written. I would say skip this one and wait for Woody's next film. Odds are it will be a hit.or at least something better than this one."
"stefanocg","3","9","18","1 October 2012"," Un-researched Cliché
","This is a disappointing movie by Woody. It makes a very superficial analysis of the Italian society, which is described as totally frivolous, uninteresting and where women are driven by sexual curiosity rather than principals.<br/><br/>Some aspects of the Italian society, such as the veneration for celebrity and the roman high society should have developed more, instead Woody just glanced over without any reflection.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was totally commonplace, funny only rarely, and overall bad bad acting; only actor which was slightly amusing was Benigni, who was described as ""typical Roman"" in the introduction but spoke the whole movie with a Tuscan accent!! another example of Woody's superficiality in researching the movie."

I like Allen's films, some are more neurotic than others, some are poignant, some have a decent plot. This is mainly neurotic without any meaningful purpose other than to make a film and get some money coming in. I guess that after Midnight in Paris, which I considered very good and funny, that Allen has given up trying to do anything creative. Allen and the stars must be laughing themselves silly about having anyone with any sense of critically rating a movie would find this anything other than other than one worn out cliché after the other. I hope that this is not Allens last film, I would hate to see him go out with this exposing his own neurotic-ism one scene after the other in an awful screenplay."

","To Rome with Love is just a bluff, the work of a man who's probably tired, or even worse, of a man who doesn't have anything else to say. This is the first impression when watching this movie, which lacks all the nice dialogues that are always part of Allen filmography. The characters are also just poor, and so is the acting, only exceptions are Alec Baldwin and Penelope Cruz. The story is just not interesting at all, so as the portrait of Rome, which seems so fake and untrue. Even a TV Italian commercial has a better direction (and much better photography) than this horrible movie. I mean, you are making a movie about Rome, not about Cleveland (with all respect for the city in Ohio. My idea is that Woody Allen just kept taking naps and left everything in the hands of some unknown Italian director, only this might explain this result.<br/><br/>A huge disappointment in every way you look at it.<br/><br/>Save your money!"

I like young Alessandra Mastronardi, know in Italy for many TV movies, well, she is great there, so with her a good future.<br/><br/>The movie is ironic, I enjoyed the part of Roberto Benigni the most, as it's a critic towards show business in my opinion.<br/><br/>The other stories were also entertaining.<br/><br/>What I was puzzled to see was a microphone that was visible in some scenes...

You think the movie can't be worse than the last. But it always is. Woody Allen becomes more irritating with each new movie: the bumbling persona that hasn't been funny for 25 years , the pretentiousness, the pseudo-intellectual fantasy mumbo jumbo, etc etc. wore out their welcome long ago. And yet he persists in making yet another version of the last movie he made. He never grows. He never changes.<br/><br/>I've reprogrammed by DVD zip control.

Maybe because the film, just as one of the characters do (this shows us she's a poseur), completely disregards the real meaning of ""ironic"". That is actually ironic.<br/><br/>Sadly the film failed to do the ONE thing it obviously set out to do, and the one thing expected of a comedy set in beautiful Rome, namely creating charming characters. Believe me, in this film when a woman is neurotic and they say it's charming? It isn't charming, it's just annoying. When somebody glances soulfully into the camera?

"dannimac-1","2","7","14","13 September 2012"," Terrible.
","Woody Allen's latest is terrible. His hackneyed movies about white people used to have epiphanies and the characters grew- Long Long Ago. Paris was weak and shallow but brilliant in its construction. Modern movie-making demands more character development, more substance, more significance. The acting in this is so wooden by all but the true Europeans, the self-discoveries so shallow, the premise so weak that it was difficult to watch. Even Rome is not shown in it's best light. And anyone who used to think Woody being Woody was funny is Now Dead. That was 40 years ago, Woody. They're Dead. 2/10<br/><br/>PS. why are there almost no brown people or Asians in any Woody Allen films? Does he refuse to hire them as extras?

It is a profound mystery to me what might have been wrong, in the reviewer's lives on the day they wrote their piece, for them to have written so negatively, or at best so begrudging with their faintest of praise. Alec Baldwin, as a modern Greek chorus (used previously by Allen), is perfectly cast as the jaded but wise Cassandra. And Roberto Benigni again proves his Oscar-worthiness in his role of Everyman-Nobody. One just can't ask for a more enjoyable movie experience. This is certainly another instance where reviewers' dyspeptic pieces can be safely ignored."
"TheHighVoltageMessiah","8","7","14","11 July 2012"," Very good, actually!
","Okay, so it doesn't quite have the magic of last year's ""Midnight in Paris"". So it isn't the equal of some of Allen's 'great works' like ""Annie Hall"" or ""Hannah and her Sisters"". Still I can say that I was thoroughly entertained by ""To Rome with Love"". It may not be a masterpiece, but nevertheless I found it witty, charming, and fun. I liked it <br/><br/>I liked it a lot.<br/><br/>The film is blessed with a marvelous cast. Nearly everyone gets a chance to shine, breathing life into an outrageous assortment of characters. Penelope Cruz makes the screen sizzle as a prostitute with a saucy and slyly sardonic attitude. Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi are radiant as newlyweds each faced with their own respective crises. They are amusing in their skittishness and flightiness, which is brought out to comic effect when they are both put into absurd situations. But through it all their characters retain a human quality; you can sympathize with their feelings of indecision, confusion, uncertainty and excitement. In the end, I found myself not only amused but touched by their quirky little love story.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is similarly endearing as an unworldly young architect who falls for his girlfriend's friend Monica, who is played by Ellen Page. Page, in the midst of several standout performances, stands out. It is a pleasure to watch her mastery of the character, how smoothly she seems to go from a frumpy, down-on-her-luck actress to an enticing object of allure. With her delicate frame, some may not think Ellen Page suited for the role of a femme fatale. They should reserve judgment. She plays her part to perfection, holding the viewer in her thrall just as she holds Eisenberg's character – although the viewer can sense from the get-go the shallowness and phoniness of her façade. Her performance may be the very best in the film.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin serves as a guide for Eisenberg's character. He's not fooled by Monica's bulls**t for a minute; he's known people like her before. As such, he gets more great lines than I could count – stingingly insightful and caustic quips in which he pegs Monica for exactly what she is. Baldwin's grimly knowing delivery of these remarks is almost as brilliant as the dialogue itself.<br/><br/>Woody Allen himself is great in his usual 'Woody Allen persona', this time as a dweeby father who comes with his psychiatrist wife (Judy Davis) to Rome to meet his daughter's fiancée. The witty repartee between Allen and Davis is classic Woody Allen stuff, and, in my humble opinion, as funny as ever. As the young couple, Alison Pill and Flavio Parenti don't have *that* much to do, but manage to make fine impressions anyway. Taking center stage in this portion of the film is the fiancée's father, played with amiableness and dignity by Fabio Armiliato. Of course, that gentle dignity ends up overturned in a hilarious manner. He's got a talent, you see, a talent Allen's character dearly wishes to exploit. But there are problems. Funny problems.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the film to me is the one with Roberto Benigni, who plays an average working man with a home and family who wakes up one morning to discover he is inexplicably famous. It's not bad necessarily, but somewhat less enjoyable and engaging when compared to other portions of the film. Still, Benigni, like everybody else in the film, doesn't give a bad performance.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's ""To Rome with Love"" has a screenplay that is often intelligent and almost always fun, and boasts a spectacular ensemble cast. By the closing credits I'd had many a good laugh and become invested in the film's wide variety of characters. In my opinion, it deserves more than its current rating of 6.4 on IMDb."
"gradyharp","2","5","9","9 May 2013"," Why Woody Allen should not star in his own movies
","Woody Allen has made some very important and poignant films and he does have quite a following. When Allen casts himself in movies that he writes and directs they become ego trips and almost unbearably dull as Allen's character is always Woody Allen, despite the costume he is supposed to be wearing to alter his character.<br/><br/>TO ROME WITH LOVE has one main character - the glorious city of Rome. The rest of the cast make up little frazzled stories that each seem dispensable: a worker (Robertp Benigni) who wakes up to find himself a celebrity - for a while; an architect (Alec Baldwin) who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student now inhabited by a confused contemporary student (Jesse Eisenberg); a young couple on their honeymoon (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi) whose life is disrupted by a hooker (Penelope Cruz) and a movie star (Antonio Albanese); and a frustrated opera director (Woody Allen) and his wife (Judy Davis) who on a trip to Rome to meet their daughter and her fiancé (Allison Pill and Flavio Parenti) has a talent for discovering talented singers and 'discovers' his future in-law (Fabio Armiliato) who sings opera arias well - but only in the shower. It all sounds silly and it is.<br/><br/>Were it not for the beauty of Rome the film could be easily dismissed as one of Woody Allen's 'off films'. Even a cast of very fine actors can't save this from drowning in the overdone and fallen cake. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

Even though not as terrible as the titles I mentioned, the film falls short in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>I believe Woody is spectacular when focused on a specific group of characters from start to finish. His study of character is unparalleled. In this case, without a subject to focus on, it seems the film was directed by Garry Marshall, in a New Year's Eve / Valentine's Day approach. Not as bad though.<br/><br/>I didn't feel exactly compelled by any of the stories - even Penelope, charming as ever, couldn't save the shallowness of her storyline.

Quite possibly and after some recent hits this one makes me wonder whether age has finally caught up with Woody Allen, who is now 76 and who, by judging from this film, may be well past delivering an even passably enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>What a sad waste of an opportunity to enjoy the marvels of a fantastic city like Rome and its wonderful people and culture. The plot attempts to weave three stories, with quirky characters involved with the magic of this city, through to something for the audience to enjoy. Sadly it is a complete flop. There are basically only three jokes in the whole movie that get relentlessly tortured over and over until they have you squirming in your seat waiting for the movie to end. Not the least bit funny or amusing, and they become increasingly boring.<br/><br/>What a sad waste of a competent cast including Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni (from ""Life is Beautiful"") Penelope Cruz, and Ellen Page etc. The only joy for me in this film was the brief time that Penelope Cruz spends on the screen; she at least marvelously delivers her small part as only she can, despite everything else dragging this movie down.<br/><br/>The role for Roberto Benigni's character is terrible; a simply ridiculous and distracting annoyance throughout the film.<br/><br/>The ending of the film was simply underwhelming.<br/><br/>This film had all the right ingredients, like some of Woody Allen's other European based movies, so why did it turn out so badly ?

"jadepietro","5","8","18","10 July 2012"," Little Italy
","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>In Woody Allen 44th movie, aptly titled To Rome with Love, four stories try to become one whole film, with sporadic success. The film lacks cohesion, with some light romantic tales intermixed with stories of pure slapstick and farce. Occasionally the writer / director hits his stride, but the laughs seem infrequent and the comic rhythms never merge. This is minor Allen, but at least, he gets to travel.<br/><br/>During his prolific career as director / writer, Mr. Allen continues to try a hit-or-miss approach to his personal independent films. The filmmaker seems more concerned with the jokey punchlines and convoluted plot devices than creating any genuine depth or pathos with his characters and their circumstances. It's as if the director was at odds with the writer and neither would compromise their own point of view, sacrificing the final product.<br/><br/>After his witty and highly entertaining Oscar-winning film, Midnight in Paris, the Woodsman sets sail to another European location to create cinematic situations that deal with fame, infidelity, young love, unbridled passion, past regrets, and any flaw that makes us human. This setting is Roma, where love and sex delight and confuse its inhabitants on a regular basis. <br/><br/>The film is a dizzying mélange of the Eternal City, a giddy travelogue to this country and its most popular tourist destinations. It doesn't overstay its welcome, due to the fine ensemble cast, although, in one particular segment, it does come darn close. Still one enjoys the visit, but a return trip is highly unlikely. <br/><br/>To Rome with Love tells its several tales of romantic entanglements and tribulations in four separate vignettes, all dealing with surreal flights of fancy, the illusion of love and the disillusion of relationships, and the inability to escape our unwanted desires. For that reason, I decided to grade each episode individually, resulting in a final average: <br/><br/>Story 1: Jesse Eisenberg is Jack, a happily engaged young man who meets his fiancée's neurotic best friend, Monica ( Ellen Page ). Of course, the more time Jack invests with Monica, the more intrigued he becomes. Enters Alec Baldwin as John, an architect who may or may not be a figment of Jack's imagination. John may be is an older version of Jack, but he mainly serves the story as its narrative conscience, bantering witty asides, as he tries to avert this liaison with disastrous results.<br/><br/>Comment: By far, the best of the lot, although Baldwin's character becomes an enigma throughout most of the film. This episode entertains with its clever plotting and funny conversations. Perhaps if this small slice of Little Italiana were expanded and the script slightly revamped, this vignette could have made a more interesting film on its own. GRADE: B<br/><br/>Story 2 : A newlywed couple, Milly and Antonio ( Alessandro Tiberi and Allesandra Mastronardi ) are honeymooning in Rome. Both lovers are momentarily separated and later charmed and seduced by Millie's favorite actor ( a miscast Altonio Albanese ), and in Antonio's case, a prostitute with, ( what else? ) a heart of gold named Anna ( Penelope Cruz ). Complications ensue with disastrous results. <br/><br/>Comment: Partly successful, this portion uses a convoluted plot structure to interweave its stories about the two separated lovers. Cruz and Tiberi have a nice chemistry and the dialog here is smart. Unfortunately, the story derails as it detours the characters into sit- com situations that have no real payoff. GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Story 3: Woody Allen is Jerry, an opera director who is married to the sardonic Phyllis ( Judy Davis ). This husband and wife team have come to Italy to visit their daughter, Hayley ( Alison Pill ) who is about to marry a handsome Italian named Michelangelo ( Flavio Parenti ). While Jerry mulls over his soon-to-be son-in-law with the usual one-liners and deprecating humor that is Allen's trademark, he meets Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo ( Fabio Armiliato ) a common man, and overhears him singing in an uncommonly melodious voice. Jerry is completely enamored of this vocal gift and wants to arrange for an operatic debut. One small glitch: that voice only projects in the shower. Jerry tries to find a solution to this problem with disastrous results.<br/><br/>Comment: A one joke premise that runs aground very quickly. Silly and inane, the characters never amount to anything remotely real and the premise is a bore. Only Judy Davis survives in this tedious story. GRADE: C<br/><br/>Story 4 : Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo, a comic ordinary everyman who suddenly finds fame and fortune. He tries to cope with the world of celebrity worship since he no longer has any private moments for himself. Oh the price of fame! Hounded by paparazzi and fans, Leopoldo longs for the simple life as he tries to elude all of its fancy trappings and temptations with disastrous results.<br/><br/>Comment: Quite disappointing, easily the runt of the pack. Allen ponders the concept of fame and creates a surreal and sanctimonious look at celebrities and their pampered lifestyle, concluding, not surprisingly, that an idol's life is not that idyllic. Most of the slapstick and dialog falls flat in its heavy-handed predictability. GRADE: C-<br/><br/>Photographed by Darius Khondji, the film has an ugly dingy yellowed tint to many of its scenes which does little to enhance this beautiful city's allure. The non-editing by Alisa Lepseiter is clunky and quite choppy. None of the scenes even try to flow with one another, creating an abrupt and jarring effect. <br/><br/>Overall, To Rome with Love never gels as one solid film, either in its script or in its filmmaking.

"memphislim","1","5","10","4 February 2013"," Don't waste your time.
","Horrible movie. First off let me preface this review by saying I am a Woody Allen fan, I've seen all his movies. Some better than others but none insult the audiences intelligence the way this one does. The only way to watch it is with the sound off so you can enjoy the spectacular cinematography and make up your own story. By doing this, even a three year old could make up a story more interesting and with more logic and sense than this. If you'll read a few reviews with more stars than mine, you'll notice no one mentions the plot/s of the movie. Some don't even really praise the movie in any way but the reviewer still gives 3 or 4 stars. Why? Because it's a Woody Allen movie and critics, actors and the public can't bear to say anything negative about the sometimes brilliant Woody Allen. My guess is after the fine actors were shown the final cut of this film, many frantically called their agents trying to get cut from the film. It's that bad! Nothing makes sense in the movie and suspending disbelief is just to arduous a task here as it is required constantly throughout the film. If you want to be as infuriated as I was that you wasted 2 hours of your life, or want to see how far a film icon like Woody can fall, by all means knock yourself out. You should do what I wish I had done, watch Vicky, Christina Barcelona again and remember Woody for the genius he can be. Please Woody, get a co-writer and/or someone you can trust to be honest with you. This script, or lack there of, should never have been made. Your legacy suffers."
"estebangonzalez10","8","5","10","30 October 2012"," Woody Allen with a European flavor
","¨If something is too good to be true, you can bet it's not.¨ Woody Allen has been directing at least one movie every single year for the past thirty years. It was Rome's turn for 2012 and although it isn't as good as his previous film, Midnight in Paris, which won Allen his fourth Oscar for original screenplay, this was still a well written comedy. I laughed really hard at several scenes and enjoyed the film from start to finish. The only problem I had with the film was that the editing was a little choppy in some scenes and the soundtrack was a little annoying, but beside that the film worked really well thanks to some great performances and a great script. It was good to see Woody Allen acting again after six years (the last time was in Scoop) and he is always a charm on camera. I think I'm enjoying Wordy Allen's films a lot more now than I did his older ones, although it probably has to do because I understand him better now. In To Rome with Love he once again seems to blab about the usual topics such as love, infidelity, fame, success, and death in a very funny and original way. I am a huge Ellen Paige fan, so I was excited to see her on a Woody Allen film and she was just great in the few scenes she shared with Jesse Eisenberg. She never disappoints. I had some high expectations for this film and it never disappointed me. Woody Allen seems to have found a pretty nice groove in Europe and has written yet another very funny comedy. Most fans will be satisfied.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Rome where we have several different romantic stories taking place. These stories aren't interconnected with each other (other than the fact that they all take place in Rome) and probably aren't in the same time frame either. First we are introduced to Hayley (Alison Pill), an American tourist who is asking for directions to a local she runs into named Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). He gladly takes her to the spot she's looking for and romance blossoms between them. Then we are introduced to Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), a married man who's routine life changes all of a sudden when he becomes an instant celebrity (for no apparent reason). John (Alec Baldwin) is a successful architect who is visiting Rome, the city he lived in when he was a student. He runs into Jack (played by Jessie Eisenberg) who takes him to the very same place where he used to live when he was young. We soon discover that John really is reliving his past through Jack. Jack is living with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig) and her best friend Monica (Ellen Paige) is going to be staying with them for a couple of days. Jack can't help but fall in love with Monica. Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) are a recently married couple from the south of Italy who have arrived in Rome for a job proposal. Milly gets lost in the big city and Antonio has a mistaken encounter with a prostitute named Anna (Penelope Cruz) that will lead to a huge mix up. Woody Allen also has a role in this film as Hayley's father who comes to meet Michelangelo's family.<br/><br/>Each one of the stories work really well in my opinion although I did laugh a little harder with Roberto Benigni's scenes which remind us all of the perks of being a celebrity, as well as the disadvantages (the overly exaggerated media attention). Woody Allen was also great as the frustrated Opera director who can't seem to enjoy the idea of retirement and associates it more with dying. I think that is his personal philosophy and thus the reason why he continues to make films at such a fast pace. He refuses to retire from directing. The mix up between Penelope Cruz and Alessandro Tiberi also makes for some funny scenes, but my favorite story had to do with the love triangle between Jessie Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Ellen Paige. There were so many different things going on in this film, but somehow Allen managed to make the film work in such a way that every character was made interesting. I'm usually not a fan of these multiple stories in one film, but here it works really well and the surprising thing is that the stories weren't even interconnected with each other. But it works because Rome becomes the central theme of the film. I really had a fun time with this movie and would recommend it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

All Europeans must repel this infidel, the insults to our way of life from this pail of rancid milk cannot be tolerated , he is way past his sell by date. Why I have to write ten lines for this review?

"CinemaClown","Null","3","5","8 October 2013"," Woody Allen's Love Affair With Europe Continues In This Disjointed Mess Of A Motion Picture
","Not amongst Woody Allen's finest works but still exhibiting some charm, fun & delight of an Allen film, To Rome with Love is a collection of four story lines that are totally unrelated to each other that deals with themes of adultery, fame, fantasy & other stuffs and while it lacks the element of surprise, it still makes up for a pleasant, light-hearted entertainment.<br/><br/>The story of To Rome with Love follows four intertwined but unrelated narratives. The first is about a clerk who wakes up one day to find himself a national celebrity. The second follows an architect who's reminiscing his student years in the streets of Rome. The third concerns a young couple who are on their honeymoon, and the last one is about a girl's parents who arrive in Italy to meet the family of her fiancé.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Woody Allen, To Rome with Love continues the esteemed filmmaker's love affair with European cities and finds him photographing Rome & all its rich beauty in a colourful manner. The plot looks as if Allen came up with four different ideas for a story set in Rome and decided to include all of them into one without offering any connection whatsoever which turns the whole experience into a wonderment for what exactly was his purpose here.<br/><br/>These quadruple snippets aren't compelling either for the different plots just unfold without any sense of direction or any sort of interconnection. Cinematography is a real highlight for the camera gorgeously captures the lush wonders of Rome, made all the more beautiful by its exquisite use of colour palette & bright lighting. The film also offers some laughs over the course of its runtime but none of its amusing moments stays around once the end credits start rolling.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the movie features a star-studded ensemble in Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig & Ellen Page and although none of them leave a lasting impression, the sum of parts isn't all too shabby. But it's not the actors who are to be blamed since their scripted characters doesn't have any meat on them. Also, a few of them actually try to make up for that shortcoming by chipping in with some effort that never quite pays off.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, To Rome with Love sounds like one of those flicks that was crafted just as an excuse to make something in the city of Rome. It sure qualifies as a wonderful ode to this attractive European destination but the story is a disappointment, even if there are few laughs to be had in between, plus every character inhabiting it only feels incomplete in one way or another. Frustrating at times but never really boring, To Rome with Love is funny in little doses plus has its moments but as a whole, it lacks the inventiveness of Woody Allen's best works."
"SundSideUp","7","3","5","6 June 2013"," To Rome With Love: Not Midnight in Paris, but made me want to get on a plane to Rome...
","After seeing Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris last year, my cheeks hurt from grinning. Woody's love letter to Paris, filled with lavish photography of the city's famous sights had me scrambling to book tickets to the City of Light. Could he top it, or even come close? <br/><br/>To Rome With Love opens with Allen's characteristic credits rolling to the nostalgic strains of Volare. The cheesy Italian tourist music proclaims from the start what kind of movie this is: a fun frolic through Rome, its ruins, and its romantic traditions as passed down by decades of Roman Holiday-types of films. <br/><br/>Four separate vignettes reveal the plot, the narratives interweaving in no particular order, each illuminating a different Italian motif. <br/><br/>Allen's films attract top actors, and his direction and screenplays tend to bring out their best performances. In To Rome With Love, this is best seen in the sketch involving the American couple Sally and Jack (Greta Gerwig and Jesse Eisenberg) and Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page), visiting them in Rome. Sally constantly frets that Jack will fall in love with Monica, an actress who possesses an uncanny sex appeal. I had doubts whether Ellen Page could pull this off, but the Oscar-nominated actress (for 2007's Juno) and actor (Eisenberg, for 2010's The Social Network) make us believe it when Jack caves in to her magnetic sexiness. The presence of Alec Baldwin's character John provides an interesting temporal twist to this storyline. He plays an architect that Jack, an architecture student, has idolized. The two run into each other in Sally and Jack's Trastevere neighborhood and from then on John serves as a kind of Greek chorus to Jack (and sometimes to the women), warning him of Monica's less-than-authentic cultural qualifications and of blowing the good thing he's got with Sally. <br/><br/>The conflicting placements in time between Jack and John's story lines bewilder some viewers, but Woody leaves us the key, much like he did by opening the film with Volare. At one point, Monica gushes over the significance of Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, the quintessential Absurdist work that compares the plight of the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus with the absurdity of humanity. Allen has given us his own Absurdist take with To Rome With Love, not spoon-feeding us a straightforward intrigue, but asking us to suspend logic for several hours and enjoy the human spectacle as portrayed against sumptuous Roman scenery. <br/><br/>In another yarn, Oscar-winning Roberto Benigni (for 1997's Life is Beautiful) plays Leopoldo Pisanello, an ordinary man suddenly beset with inexplicable fame. There is nothing subtle about Allen's poking fun at the fickleness and aggressiveness of the paparazzi and at the public that accepts whatever the press feeds it. Benigni's troubles entertain while his character cycles through the phases of his notoriety. <br/><br/>Spain's Penelope Cruz (another Oscar winner, for Allen's 2008 Vicky Christina Barcelona) shows off her linguistic chops with a role as a prostitute in a third sketch completely in Italian. This one, an outright sex romp, follows the mayhem that ensues when a newlywed Italian couple arrives in Rome. The husband is there to take a position with the family firm. The wife disappears while out to get her hair done and Cruz's character assumes the role of his wife when the stodgy aunts and uncles misinterpret why she's caught in bed with the husband in the couple's hotel room. Implausible? Yes, and silly, but mostly it's Absurd, and throughout the rollicking action, we explore ideals of Italian love and sex, of the absurdity of star-struck fans hopping into bed with film stars, and we get to peek at the lovely Roman scenery behind it all. <br/><br/>The fourth tale is that of Giancarlo (played by tenor Fabio Armiliato), a mortician who sings like an opera star, but only when he's in the shower. Woody Allen plays a retired music producer that overhears Giancarlo and insists on bringing his talent before the masses. Their respective children Michelangelo and Hayley (Flavio Parenti and Alison Pill) are engaged and Jerry and Phyllis (Woody and Judy Davis) are in Italy to meet Michelangelo's parents. There are funny moments throughout To Rome With Love, but this sketch had me laughing out loud. The full theater chuckled almost every time Woody opened his mouth (especially when repeatedly mispronouncing ""Michelangelo"") and roared at the opera scenes. Stupidly funny, yes, but again, pure Absurdity is the point. How refreshing to belly laugh at a musical form like opera, one that takes itself so seriously. <br/><br/>To Rome With Love carries an ""R"" rating for the sexual references, and there is a lot of hopping in and out of bed, but there's not much to offend the sensitive viewer. As with Midnight in Paris, foreign language was spoken, with subtitles. Two of the sub-stories were completely in Italian. The Italian language, however, adds to the charm as much as the Coliseum, the Trevi Fountain, and the picturesque alleys of Trastevere. <br/><br/>I could have done without the bookending of the film with two different characters talking to the camera, explaining that there are all these stories taking place in Rome. The one at the beginning was mildly amusing, a flamboyant policeman directing traffic on the Piazza Venezia. I would have kept the scenery of the spectacular monument to Vittorio Emmanuele II, but cut the policeman's dialog along with that of the man on the balcony overlooking the Spanish Steps at the end of the film. <br/><br/>To Rome With Love wasn't Midnight in Paris, but I'm not sure anything will ever match that treasure. As with Midnight in Paris, though, I grinned throughout, and I find myself inclined to get on a plane for Rome. To Rome With Love has received criticism for not acknowledging the economic woes in Italy, but it shouldn't have—it wasn't that kind of movie. That movie's soundtrack wouldn't have opened with Volare."
"rainsummers","6","3","5","10 December 2012"," This film is OK
","This film is mildly amusing and yet contains some glimmers of the old Allen comic genius about it. I found it somewhat charming and overall not too bad. You won't be wetting yourself with laughter but it is 'a painting'of some charm nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film centres on the life/love stories of several folk in Rome hence the title 'Love Letters to Rome' all of which vary in their comedic factor.<br/><br/>Hats off to Penelope Cruz because her performance was outstanding and surprisingly good - she was very comical and great at speaking Italian. I think she stole the film in fact. Not so much the other stars, including Allen himself, largely down to the subdued material.<br/><br/>To go into more depth would bore the pants off anyone with a sane mind. Out of ten? A generous score is a 6 simply because it is an Allen and if feeling harsh, a bare five."
"boblipton","7","6","14","30 June 2012"," The warmth of banked embers
","For most of the past decade Woody Allen has been revisiting old themes in new places. He writes a witty script, hires a good cameramen, has great actors flock to him because he writes great lines for them and directs the film efficiently. So we have travel vistas that he has even been putting the city's name in, like VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, MIDNIGHT IN Paris and now the Fellini-esque TO ROME WITH LOVE.<br/><br/>If you get the idea that I look down on these efforts, let me say I enjoy them very much. Mr. Allen has reached an age and ability in his craft where he can do things easily and smoothly, so that the three farces that make up this anthology set in the Eternal City offer some wonderful excuses to show off the city. My favorite is the one about Roberto Benigni, an ordinary man who suddenly finds himself a celebrity upon whom the media hang. His bewilderment is a lovely, comic performance. However, if you prefer the one about the retired record producer who makes the machetunim an opera sensation in the shower or the the one about the young temptress, that's fine too."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","11","25 August 2012"," Woody Allen attaining complete freedom
","Woody Allen has happily reached a stage when he has no baggage to carry. What he seems to be saying is: I pretty damn well make my movie anyway I like and if you, the audience, don't digs it, tough! Because of this, you sense a lot of ""freedom"" in this new movie, giving a smorgasbord of Allen goodies, without a lot of calculations. As a result, you feel really relaxed watching this unassuming, undemanding piece of work. People who grew tired of Allen have left the scene long ago. People who keep watching him, like this one, never grows tired of Woody Allen.<br/><br/>There has been a painful transition, when this auteur who once vowed never to leave Manhattan realized that this love relationship was gradually becoming one-sided. Manhattan, unfortunately, did not reciprocate with undying devotion. An opportunity to venture into the root of the mother language tantamount to offering him a ""take two"" in his life and career. Acoss the Atlantic he went, to make ""Match point"". The rest is history: a ""second spring"" in Mr Allen's filmmaking.<br/><br/>Some material I've read suggested that ""To Rome with love"" movie represents a collection that Allen recovered form the bottom of a drawer, idea jotted down over the years on pieces of scrap paper. That is not hard to believe. There is a complete absence of structure. What we see are sketches that he didn't even bother to connect in anyway other than the titular reference – they all happen in Rome. Even the temporal reference is haphazard – one story happened all within a day while another takes place over maybe a few weeks, or even longer. But that is perfectly alright. As I mentioned, it gives you a sense of complete ""freedom"" while enjoying it.<br/><br/>Of the four ""sketches"", the least appealing is a limp borrowing of ""The Trueman show"". There really isn't any depth to speak of in this depiction of a John Doe's reaction to becoming famous overnight for no reason whatsoever. Roberto Benigni had never convinced the general audience that his 1997 Oscar was truly deserved, and has long since grown tiresome, unfunny. If iconic Italian content is required for this movie, Monica Bellucci would be top choice. I guess Benigni comes cheaper.<br/><br/>The remaining three are all delightful.<br/><br/>One starts with lovely Alison Pill (quite unforgettable as Zelda Fitzgerald in ""Midnight in Paris"") as an American tourist finding romance in a chance encounter with a handsome Italian lawyer. Most delightful is Allen himself, in his first personal appearance in 6 years, as the father. The Woody-Allen-ish character who is a retired music promoter cum opera director provides Woody-Allen-ish staple through his parrying with the left-thinking prospective son-in-law. On top of that is the mediating effort, with contrary effects, by his psychiatrist wife (Judy Davis). Best-yet-to-come is the deliciously silly development when the Italian father was found to be a ""Caruso in showers"" (played by first rate real life tenor Fabio Armiliato), in a very literally sense as the man sings beautifully ONLY when in a shower. Yes, make your wildest guess on the plot development – and your wish is granted! <br/><br/>Another segment is entirely in Italian, with innocent-looking Alessandro Tiberi and pretty Alessandra Mastronardi as a just-married couple from a small town coming to Rome hoping to launch a career with the help of the young man's relatives in high society. This is where the mistaken-identity charade is played to the full when the innocent couple gets accidentally separated. They each end up having an education in sophisticated sexual relationships, he with an immensely popular prostitute played by Penelope Cruz, and she with a sex symbol of a celebrity actor played by Antonio Albanese.<br/><br/>For language balance, the story centred on a young American architect played by Jesse Eisenberg is entirely in English. It all starts when his down-to-earth lover (Greta Gerwig) takes in a friend on a temporary basis, an actress from L.A, who is simultaneously out of a job and a relationship. Ellen Page is absolutely brilliant in this role, seducing her best friend's lover. Also good to see in this story is Alex Baldwin who starts out as a real character in a chance encounter with the young architect while reminiscing on the days he spent in that part of Rome as a young man. Through a seamless metamorphosis, he becomes surreal, something of the young man's inner voice or conscience, visible and audible only to him. But then, some viewer with a different perspective can also turn the whole thing around, seeing the entire episode of the young love triangle as the older man's mental reconstruction of what happened when he was a young man in Rome. Such cleverness from Allen!<br/><br/>Finally, it's a pleasure to see (hear, to be more precise) the film opening and closing with ""Volare"", book-ending a lively, frothy, delightful Italian adventure."

"Chris_Pandolfi","5","5","11","4 July 2012"," Allen Has Gone Pazzo
","""To Rome with Love"" is a bad movie, and yet it employs exceptional talent and showcases many of writer/director Woody Allen's best loved cinematic hallmarks. It's constructed as four vignettes that are not only bound by nothing apart from the location but also go nowhere meaningful in and of themselves. Lacking a real plot to string them together, the best one can say is that it's essentially a series of concepts that weren't allowed to come to fruition. Allen is a gifted filmmaker, but I sometimes wonder if he has someone, anyone, in his life to tell him that screenplays need to be honed and polished before they can be shot and edited into something watchable. If such a person exists, he or she must have been taking a day off. And how tragic that this had to be the follow up to ""Midnight in Paris.""<br/><br/>Taking place in Rome, the film opens with an Italian traffic cop turning to the camera and announcing that he sees all manner of life on the streets, and that everyone has a story. At a café table sits John (Alec Baldwin), a formerly respected American architect who has since sold out and now designs shopping malls. We learn that he used to live in Rome as a young man, and so, feeling nostalgic, he decides to walk the cobblestone streets to his old apartment building. He's then approached by Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), who admires John's work. As it so happens, Jack is studying architecture, and it appears that he now lives in the same building John once lived in. Jack invites John up and introduces him to his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), who's preparing for the arrival of her best friend, an actress named Monica (Ellen Page).<br/><br/>Monica's arrival marks not only the start of an emotional affair between her and Jack but also a bizarre shift in structure and tone. Although it has been established that John is a real person, he suddenly and quite inexplicably becomes more like Jack's invisible conscience, disappearing into the periphery before popping up at random and saying things that, for the most part, only Jack can hear. He repeatedly tries to warn Jack to stay away from Monica, who appears to show a healthy interest in art and literature but may in fact be nothing more than a desperate pseudo- intellectual. On the basis of the way this story concludes, Allen seemed to be suggesting that John is in actual fact Jack's future self. This is narratively impossible, given the fact that Jack actually recognized John for his body of work.<br/><br/>In another story, we meet an American girl named Hayley (Alison Pill) and her Italian boyfriend Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). They're eventually joined by Hayley's parents, Phyllis and Jerry (Judy Davis and Woody Allen), the latter a retired music producer/avant-garde opera stager. Jerry meets Michelangelo's father, a mortician named Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), and is shocked to discover that the man has a beautiful tenor voice. Initially against the idea of singing professionally, Giancarlo is finally browbeaten by Jerry into auditioning. It doesn't go well. Jerry eventually figures out why: Giancarlo is at his best when taking a shower. This discovery paves the way for a sight gag that isn't as funny as Allen thinks it is. In fact, it's his worst sight gag since the monster breast in ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Sex.""<br/><br/>Two of the vignettes are spoken entirely in Italian. In one, Antonio and Milly (Alessandro Tiberi and Allesandra Mastronardi) are newlyweds who travel to Rome after Antonio accepted a job. Milly leaves the hotel and gets lost trying to find a hair salon; as she wanders aimlessly, getting convoluted directions from the locals, she eventually catches the eye of her favorite actor, Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese), who immediately starts to seduce her. Meanwhile, back at the hotel, a prostitute named Anna (Penelope Cruz) mistakes Antonio for a new client; Antonio's family discovers them both in bed, which means that Antonio must frantically try to convince everyone that Anna is his wife. This will inevitably lead to lengthy discussion regarding Antonio's romantic deficits.<br/><br/>In the other vignette, an ordinary, unknown, middle class office worker named Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) will have his life turned upside down when legions of press and paparazzi quite mysteriously begin treating him like a celebrity. Everything, from what he eats for breakfast to what razor he uses to shave to whether or not he believes in God, are mercilessly scrutinized by reporters with microphones and cameras. Allen is obviously making an absurdist point about the ups and downs of fame, quite possibly as a way to cope with his own feelings on the subject. Its structure doesn't flow as well as it should, and its ultimate message is hopelessly predictable, but it's still the strongest of the story segments in ""To Rome with Love."" Had Allen disregarded the other three, maybe it would have been a much better movie.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

"3xHCCH","4","4","9","9 December 2012"," A Very Disappointing Buffet of Nothing Much
","After the critical and commercial successes of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and ""Midnight in Paris,"" Woody Allen follows these city- tributes up with another one, this time for the Italian capital of Rome. In my opinion though, unlike the previous two films mentioned, ""To Rome with Love"" had honestly nothing to love about it.<br/><br/>The whole film is a string of four different strange stories with apparently nothing to do with each other. <br/><br/>Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his fiancée. When his fiancée's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) comes to visit, Jack gets attracted to her. His friend John (Alec Baldwin) advises Jack accordingly. While Eisenberg and Page have great chemistry together, the seemingly imaginary nature of Baldwin's character makes this episode strange.<br/><br/>Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni)is a man who suddenly becomes an overnight celebrity for no apparent reason. This story is downright senseless and lame-brained. I cannot imagine how Woody finds this story funny in any way. Benigni seemed to just being himself, stupidly.<br/><br/>Antonio and Milly are a newly wed couple from a small town who are in Rome to meet some relatives. Milly loses her way when she was looking for a hairdresser and gets caught up in a tryst with movie ""sex symbol"" Luca Salta. Meanwhile, Antonio was hooking up with prostitute Anna who entered their hotel room by mistake. This episode was also pretty annoying as well as silly, with only the luminous Penelope Cruz, who played Anna, as the saving grace.<br/><br/>Woody Allen himself returns in front of the camera as Jerry a music producer who visits Italy to meet his daughter's fiancé and his family. He was so taken by the great operatic voice of Giancarlo, the fiancé's father played by real-life tenor Fabio Armiliato, that Jerry wants to promote him. But alas, it turns out Giancarlo can only sing well when he is in the shower! Again this becomes another disappointingly preposterous episode.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you will feel like this film is an absolute waste of time. You do not get anything out of it, not even a good feeling. This is a big disappointing letdown from Mr. Allen especially as he is coming off a series of film successes. ""To Rome with Love"" will definitely NOT be one of those successes."
"stensson","5","4","9","6 September 2012"," No, not this time
","It's like reality isn't enough for Woody Allen anymore, because more and more fantasies or almost hallucinations run through his films nowadays. It was like that in Paris and it is like that in Rome.<br/><br/>Many parallel stories here. The prostitute who walks into the wrong room, the young architect guy who does the same love mistakes as the old ghost shadow behind him once did. The boring clerk who suddenly becomes a celebrity for no reason. Like most celebrities.<br/><br/>The dialog is funny also this time. Especially when Allen himself is involved. But Allen scripts dealing with reality outside our minds are certainly better."
"giarmomatthew","3","3","6","17 January 2013"," To Rome with Love Takes Place among Allen's Worst
","Woody Allen films are among my favorites, but he mailed in To Rome with Love. Ever since Match Point, the pattern has been hit, miss, better -- hit, miss, better. Sing a long with me now, Match Point (hit), Scoop (miss), Cassandra's Dream (better), Vicky Cristina Barcelona (hit), Whatever Works (miss), You'll Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (better), Midnight in Paris (hit), To Rome with Love (miss) ... and I'm guessing Blue Jamine will be on par with the better fare. Even going back from Match Point, Melinda and Melinda was a better, and Anything Else a miss. My scheme breaks down with the film prior to Anything Else, which was also a miss (Hollywood Ending).<br/><br/>This is one of Allen's worst films. While I found parts of the vignette in which Allen placed himself rather amusing, there was nothing even remotely delightful or insightful about the other three. I'm still trying to figure out whether Alec Baldwin's character is a muse, an older version of Eisenberg, or some new kind of psychopomp invented by Allen. The poetic license / liberty-taking with film convention wouldn't have mattered at all had the vignette not fallen flat. The characters are all so one-dimensional and undeveloped to be a source of humor for the film, so Allen relies on situation for comedy and here we find him an average sit-com writer.<br/><br/>It's as if Allen was going through the motions in checking off the last leg of a European tour before heading back to the states for Blue Jasmine. Don't we all find that our last day of a vacation, despite our best efforts to make it the best, end up being tired and meandering? The same principle applies here.<br/><br/>To Rom with Love is not as soul-deadening as Broadway Danny Rose, as tiresome as Zelig, as solipsistic as Stardust Memories, or as flat as Hollywood Ending, but I would rank it among his worst."
"RainDogJr","5","3","6","21 July 2012"," Huge disappointment; one of Allen's worst for my money
","Do you remember the last shot of Quentin Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS? That part with Brad Pitt's character sort of echoing Tarantino's very own feelings towards his film by saying something like ""I think this is my masterpiece"". With one of the last scenes of TO ROME WITH LOVE I felt that its director (master) Woody Allen was also talking about his own film – Allen knows his latest isn't a fine one, and is like he just don't care since he has experienced some worse criticism before. Usually, I'm a fan of the Woody Allen pictures that many people hate (HOLLYWOOD ENDING, for instance) so pretty much, out of the 30+ films directed by Allen that I have seen, I would rank this one at the bottom – with the exception of YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER I really can't think in another truly disappointing Allen. <br/><br/>TO ROME WITH LOVE is certainly kind of special since it features Allen's first performance in 6 years. I always liked to believe that he wasn't ever coming back to acting, and not because I thought he was done but just because of the surprising and funny ending of his character in SCOOP (2006). But he is back and his character here does go for the self-referential thing: this character is a retired music producer who is not satisfied at all with his days without any work. As I guess you already know, ""Rome"" presents four different stories - Allen's character is part of one that has some laughs but also ridiculous stuff (that made people at the cinema laugh a lot, actually). I would say many more material here is quite ridiculous, being Roberto Benigni the unluckiest talent of the big ensemble cast (which includes the youngsters Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg -doing nothing spectacular- and Alec Baldwin as a omnipresent character that doesn't make much sense). <br/><br/>Hell, let's write more about the story with Benigni. I think is the key one to say this isn't a success of a film. Allen had something to say here, especially via the part with the star of LA VITA È BELLA (""Rome"" marks Benigni's first performance since 2005, by the way). He is not saying anything new but nevertheless is a nice statement on fame and the media. However we have not only Benigni being totally wasted but also material that doesn't quite belong here – yes, I get the point but that doesn't mean I enjoyed a series of repetitive and mostly unfunny scenes that made me think something like ""what the heck is this?"" <br/><br/>Ultimately, the film also fails when it comes to make of Rome a place to die for; I mean, you can make a place look like heaven or the complete opposite, but you better do something memorable especially if you have the name of the place in the title! In recent memory, the (bad) film EAT PRAY LOVE did a whole lot more for Italy than this one (to tell the truth, Allen's film don't do a thing for Rome) – with that film I wanted to be there, eating lots of great food! So yes, this one is pretty mediocre in every aspect (with the exception of Penelope Cruz, who does a fine don't-do-a-thing-besides-showing-your-sexiness kind of work). <br/><br/>*Watched it on 20 July, 2012"

"Andy-296","9","5","13","30 June 2012"," Woody Allen latest movie is slight but fun
","Woody Allen's choral film set in Rome shows that at 76 he can still be a fine filmmaker. It consists of four intercalated though unrelated episodes, two with Italians in the center, one with Americans and the last with both Italians and Americans.<br/><br/>In episode 1 (the numbers I gave to each of the episodes is arbitrary), a somewhat naive newlywed couple from an Italian small town (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi, who resembles a young Marisa Tomei, and is great as the beautiful but plain Milly) comes to Rome. A series of circumstances will make them to be separated and face temptation, he to a prostitute catering to Rome's high class (Penelope Cruz), she to a famous if somewhat pathetic older actor (Antonio Albanese).<br/><br/>In episode 2 (not completely bad, but probably the weakest of the four), Roberto Benigni, overacting as usual, is a Roman everyman who suddenly and inexplicably becomes a celebrity hounded by the press.<br/><br/>In episode 3 (probably the best), Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his sweet if somewhat bland girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig). Soon the two are joined by a friend of Sally, the unemployed actress Monica (Ellen Page). The beautiful Monica is a great creation by the screenplay, a neurotic pseudo intellectual always quoting authors she has scarcely read. Under a veneer of worldly sophistication, she is a vain, shallow and vapid woman. As Monica tries to seduce Jack, Jack is advised by Alec Baldwin (a middle aged architect visiting Rome) that it would be foolish to leave the dependable Sally for the unstable Monica. The Baldwin character starts realistically but ends up being something of a ghost, since he materializes in every place and only Jack seemingly sees him. In his role as a ghostly adviser to a young male on questions of women and love, he resembles the Bogart character in Allen's great comedy of 40 years ago, the underrated ""Play it Again, Sam"".<br/><br/>In episode 4, Alison Pill is an American tourist who falls in love with a left wing Roman lawyer. Soon she brings her parents from the States (Woody Allen and Judy Davis, who is great as his shrink wife, always ready to psychoanalyze every one of Woody's decisions) to meet her new in laws. Allen is a retired former executive in the classical musical business, and after listening to Giancarlo (played by Fabio Armiliato, a real life Italian tenor), the father of his son in law, singing in the shower, he tries to convince him to try a career as an opera singer, to amusing results.<br/><br/>Some might say that the episodes are slight (and in a way they are right) but the movie contains some wise reflections on old age, fame, love, whether is better to settle or try for more, etc. In any case, I (and the audience with which I saw it) enjoyed quite a lot. The message of the film seems somewhat conservative: if you are happy with what you are, why aspire for more if that means you have to sell your soul. That might be a right message, though it strange to hear it from the famous Allen."
"talibaba777","2","4","10","11 November 2012"," Don't watch this film
","This miserable excuse film pretty much summarized everything I hate about Woody Allen. It was another over sentimental nostalgic sickening tribute to European cities and his own irritating pretentious ideas. Aside from Alec Baldwin's performance, the acting was poor to say the least. Although at times slightly amusing, the jokes were usually fairly awful and I ended up finding every character in the film inherently irritating, and unlike Owen Wilson Jesse Eissenburg or whatever his name is, was nowhere close to providing a strong lead role in order to make the film watchable. I'm only going to give this film a 2 for Alec Baldwin, without him it would a definite 0.<br/><br/>I'll be sure to keep clear of his next film, make sure you stay away from this one."
"dierregi","1","3","7","30 May 2017"," Four compressed versions of Allen's other movies
","The four unrelated plots that compose this mess of a movie focus on classic Allen's themes he tackled better many times before.<br/><br/>The plot featuring Benigni is a compressed version of ""Celebrity"", the Allen movie about the absurdity of contemporary fame-worshipping. Benigni is a most overrated actor/director with a very limited range. His scenes are painful to watch.<br/><br/>The story featuring Eisenberg, Gerwig and Page is the standard Allen's fodder of a young man falling for a neurotic/pretentious/unreliable female, in the past the classic Keaton's role. In ""Anything Else"" Christina Ricci played the Page role. This story is also annoying and the dialogues bad and repetitive. Comments fly around about how sexy and irresistible the Page character is supposed to be, even if she does not strike me as such...<br/><br/>A third story features a young Italian couple acting as if they lived in the 50s. They both are ludicrous but manage to cuckold each other given the first chance. The ""wise"" hooker played by Cruz is straight out of ""Deconstructing Harry"".<br/><br/>The fourth plot was for me the most unbearable, featuring Allen himself at his most Allenish. Stammering, afraid of death and involved in a stupid plan (see ""Small Time Crooks"" and many others), Allen manages to concurrently insult Italian families and operas.<br/><br/>Even the soundtrack is atrocious, with some corny Italian tunes from the 50s. The only saving grace is the photography. However, the real Rome is a mess of ugly buildings and traffic, not the golden collection of monuments showed in the movie<br/><br/>Really an awful mess that should be voted in the negative.... even without mentioning the overbearing product-placement."
"cekadah","2","3","7","6 October 2013"," A silly movie that should be boxed and buried by Giancarlo
","This movie belongs in the 1950's not the 20teen's, because that's what it is, a 1950's style rich people in Europe (Italy here) living goofy lives. If this film had been released 57 years ago it would have been proclaimed as comic genius by the intellectual theatre set. But today it's just a mishmash of half-baked ideas thrown together with beautiful photography and sets to keep the viewers attention.<br/><br/>After the grotesque disappointment I suffered watching 'Midnight in Paris', I was most anxious to see Woody Allen pull a winner out of his hat. With this wonderful cast and reading many glowing reviews I was sure this movie would be a winner. Unfortunately it is silly, simple, and above all very predictable. Who could not see the opera singing father being put on stage in a shower stall by Jerry??? And Monica being a complete fony and flaky.<br/><br/>At one point I decided to finish the flick only because it's a Woody Allen movie. There are other Allen movies I've watched numerous times --- this one is a one time watch.<br/><br/>Also I realized that all the best dialog was given to just 3 actors - Allen himself, Judy Davis, Alec Baldwin."
"diane-34","9","3","7","19 October 2012"," A curious but endearing film.
","Diane and I watched Allen's film this afternoon in Fremantle and although we agree on virtually every film we see, To Rome With Love is the exception that proves the rule. I did not mind the film, in fact, I thought that its quirkiness was very endearing and I enjoyed the afternoon's viewing but then I enjoy Woody Allen more than Diane does. She found the whole business of New York Americans swanning around Rome too hard to take but I just found the movie too peppered with great actors to dislike the film.<br/><br/>People probably already know that the film is segmented into a number of parts; two of which are Italian and two are about American visitors to Rome. They are in the Eternal City for differing reasons and the substance of the film concerns the individual episodes of their life with the beauty of Rome as the background. Because of the vignettes it is easy to have likes and dislikes about each of them but to me the glue holding them together was the quirkiness to Allen's script. I suppose love could be singled out as the movie's theme but this theme (if it is such) becomes so stretched that it morphs into a high school essay topic.<br/><br/>As one would expect with this calibre of actors at work the professionalism is constantly on display. The script, because the Master wrote it, is also of a high calibre even if the twists and turns might cause you to pause on this matter. Take the film as it is and do not wrestle with it too much; it is a very entertaining film and certainly deserves an afternoon or evening of your time in viewing it."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","15","22 July 2012"," A Charming Gem; Too Bad People Are Comparing It to Other Films
","To Rome with Love (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Woody Allen's latest features another all-star cast including the likes of Allen himself, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, Alison Pill, Alec Baldwin, Greta Gerwig, Alessandra Mastronardi, Jesse Eisenberg, Penelope Cruz and Ellen Page. The film basically tells the different stories of unrelated characters spending the summer in Rome. One story involves a father and mother (Allen, Davis) going to visit their future in-laws and Allen discovering that the father is a singing genius. Another deals with a young man (Eisenberg) who is falling in love with his girlfriend's (Gerwig) best friend (Page). Another deals with a young newlywed couple (Alessandro Tiberian, Mastronardi) who find themselves involved with other people. Finally, an ordinary and rather boring man (Benigni) wakes up one morning and is forced to be a celebrity for no other reason than he's a celebrity. It's really a shame that TO ROME WITH LOVE seems to be getting attacked not for being a bad movie but instead of it just not being as good as MIDNIGHT TO Paris. Since that film really shot Allen back to the top I guess it should have been expected that some might leave this disappointed because it's not as good as the other but it's a real shame because this film deserves its own spotlight.<br/><br/>There's no major surprises or laugh-out-loud moments but the picture is just one charming moment after another and I really don't think the smile ever left my face. I think it's fair to say that none of the characters or their situations would have made for a good feature on their own but with everything cut down to basically four different movies, I think the actors bring the parts to life enough to where it really works in this Robert Altman like set up. I think Allen's dialogue is really on the mark as he once again spins that web of romance, mystery of life and of course his various opinions on certain subjects. It seems Allen is having the most fun with the Benigni character as there are many shots at people who are famous for no reason other than being famous. The way Allen gets his point across is extremely well done and it really makes you see how silly it all is. I'd say that all four stories work very well and there's no question that the casting was perfect. Allen is in fine form, a bit slower than in the past but this is to be expected. Baldwin is extremely good doing his best work in years as a person who just shows up to give advice. Both Eisenberg and Page deliver fine performances as does Gerwig. Benigni is a real delight in his part as the ordinary man who gets to experience fame. Cruz is a major standout as a hooker who gets mistaken for a man's wife. I must say that I've never seen her looking more beautiful and it's that one thing more striking that the Rome visuals. TO ROME WITH LOVE is fast, funny but mostly it's an amazingly charming little picture. It's not Allen's best but it's rather amazing how this guy can pump out at least a film a year."

","After experiencing much delight watching Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, I figured I'd get much enjoyment out of To Rome With Love as well. Though I haven't actually seen that many Woody Allen movies before, from what I have experienced, I've decided that his work is both clever and hilarious. He has a knack for capturing the beauty of a city, as demonstrated in Midnight in Paris. He also cast several very notable actors in this film such as Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenburg and of course, himself. He was the best of all. Basically it was a recipe for success. I really liked To Rome With Love. I laughed a lot.<br/><br/>The movie follows the stories of several different characters in Rome, both native Romans and tourists. They vary from a confused young architect (Jesse Eisenburg) enraptured by a flighty young American actress (Ellen Page) to a sultry Italian prostitute (Penelope Cruz) who accidentally comes calling on the wrong man and thus must spend the day pretending to be his wife. All of the different plot lines were so hilarious. I think my favorite however was the one with Woody Allen himself. He is a retired music producer who upon meeting his daughter's future father-in-law, discovers that he has an amazing operatic voice and decides to put it to good use. The only catch is that the man can only sing well in the shower. Thus Woody Allen must put a portable shower on the stage that the man can bathe in while he sings. Too funny!<br/><br/>Whereas in Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen really capitalized on the beauty of the city, almost to an excess, in To Rome With Love, he focused on the characters and just let Rome do its thing. I definitely noticed the beauty of the ruins, sunset and the architecture etc. I didn't feel like he was trying to sell me Rome though. After watching Midnight in Paris, I had an urge to travel there, almost as if it was an hour and a half special on traveling in Paris, hosted by Owen Wilson. The beauty of Rome was subtley displayed yet very effective in this film. I hope to travel there one day.<br/><br/>Oh and on a final note, Penelope Cruz is gorgeous. She's pretty much THE femme fatale. The End."

","It is always easy to dismiss real things as not important. Writing real things do not make them surely understood. You need to be in somebody's shoes or pen to imagine what the words were meant to mean. 1+1 adds to two anythings. But we make abstraction our normal way of seeing things. I am not a Woody Allen fan but I see the real Woody in this film. Expressing the absurd is hard if you want to make sense. 'life is cruel at times and does not fulfill your needs' Rome is an eternal city that is witnessing our short sight. We do not appreciate the effort of our ancestors to leave a testimonial for future generations to pick up. We simply do not understand that saying things once should be enough. We keep on making the same mistakes over and over walking over the signs left for us to notice. Italians are just easier to point out because they shout about it, they are just loud. If you take a peek in the past you end up caught in it so be careful."

","I've watched six films by Woody Allen. The first five (in the order of time I watched them) are Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Manhattan, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris. I watched this one today. I have to say this is the one that lacked in creativity the most. Some characters' storyline was dealt fast and abruptly. It was absurd sometimes.<br/><br/>I did read about the critics this movie got but I went to it anyway because it was Woody Allen and he was acting in it so I wanted to see it a little more. The movie is not that bad, I know there light clichés and weak story lines but there is also the pure Woody Allen cinema we know in it.<br/><br/>If you wanna see the master's latest work, go see it. Don't let a 54 Metacritic point and bad reviews hold you. It's not as good as last year's Midnight in Paris (which I call ""a beautiful and sweet masterpiece"") but it's not disaster, either.

"maurice_yacowar","9","0","0","2 June 2020"," Several love affairs animate the Eternal City
","The Eternal City gets a different kind of travelogue treatment here: a visit by a spectrum of Woody Allen representations. This is Rome seen through the prism of its creator.
The framing song is the familiar old hit parade topper, Volare. That defines the perspective as an American of Woody Allen's age - who would remember that song from the Ed Sullivan Show. It was the rare foreign language song to become an American pop hit
Allen's character serves a double function. As Jerry, tourist Hayley's father, he deploys his familiar nebbish persona, nervous on the plane, suspicious of Hayley's new fiancee, an Italian leftist. He's also a failed music director. His long-suffering wife cares enough to define the reviewer's ""imbecile"" as ""ahead of your time.""
But like Allen, Jerry has a good eye for talent. With more bravery than most: his Pagliacci brilliantly performs entirely inside a working shower. As the conventional opera unfolds exuberantly around him, he performs in his shower box, washing and lathering as he sings, superbly. That lunatic staging choice is an actual necessity. His tenor can only sing well in the shower. This image resonates further: in an apparently conventional staging something personal operates in a private box within, weird but vital. Like the Allen element in any story he tells. It may seem odd but it's necessary.
An alternative Allen surrogate opens the film. The Rome traffic director functions like a director: ""My job, as you can see, is to see that the traffic move. I stand up here, and I see everything. All people. I see life. In this city, all is a story....There are many stories, next time you come."" On behalf of director Allen he introduces the characters and concludes the story.
Robert Benigni plays another Allen, a modest little man thrust into the ordeal of celebrity. TV makes him a sudden star - for being so ordinary. He enjoys promotion, public attention, the service of beautiful women, but he's finally relieved when the spotlight moves on and he can return to his modest family. One might take this as an ironic reversal of the scandal/attention that drove Allen from the US to this cycle of European films.
A similar personal reflection may lie in the story of two newlywed provincials whose move to Rome is complicated by their separate adulteries. Those unconventional sexual experiences have the salutary effect of enabling them to see past the surface allure of Rome. They return to the simpler lives, especially enriched by their respective sexual experiences. Their illicit adventures deepened their relationship.
The other plot has two Allen surrogates. Alex Baldwin is the mature man who returns to the Rome of his student days and through Jessie Eisenberg relives a doomed old romance. The interplay of past and present is a familiar Allen device, especially apt in the Eternal City which unchanged has survived centuries of human waves. The woman the mature man warns the younger not to fall in love with is precisely the kind of enchanting, bright but disastrously neurotic beauty Allen was prone to fall for (as he recounts in his current memoir). As another signature, the ""Ozymandias melancholia"" is revived from Stardust Memories.
Perhaps lacking the moral intensity of Allen's best films, this is still a delight, engaging, rich, amusing, and as this reading proposes - subtly personal."

","To Rome With Love (2012): Dir: Woody Allen / Cast: Woody Allen, Roberto Benigni, Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg: Romantic comedy about the idea of Rome as a romantic symbol when in fact it contains every bit as many problems as any other place. Woody Allen and Judy Davis play a married couple flying to Rome to meet their daughter's fiancé. Their daughter is a journalist while her fiancé's father is a mortician whom Allen learns has a talent for singing opera. The problem is that this talent is restricted to the shower. This plays out as one of the great hilarious payoffs when Allen presents the most awkward stage plays. Roberto Benigni plays an ordinary guy who is suddenly hounded by paparazzi who ask him the most absurd details into his life. It is Allen's humorous attack on fame and its illusions. Alec Baldwin seems to be everywhere when it comes to coaching a young heart throb who is about to cheat on his girlfriend with her best friend, an aspiring actress who has just arrived in town. Penelope Cruz plays a prostitute who ends up in the wrong hotel room and mistaken as the fiancé of someone who is set to meet relatives. His real fiancé is lost within the city and loses her cell phone, but she becomes the target of romance by a famous actor and this leads to the most hysterical burglary attempt ever conspired. Jesse Eisenberg seems to be observing it all, hanging out with Baldwin enlightening each other. This is Woody Allen at his best as he presents witty dialogue, comic encounters at their most inspiring, and a view of Rome that paints a far different picture than reputed. Score: 10 / 10"

The plot concerning the the young married couple Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) visiting the city for the first time and becoming separated has been directly borrowed from the earlier film. Antonio has an elaborate program of events, including a visit to the Vatican as well as an encounter with elderly relatives; once Milly has disappeared, he does not know what to do until hooker Anna (Penelope Cruz) agrees to play the role of his wife. Meanwhile Milly meets her favorite movie actor Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese) and almost goes to bed with him. This is perhaps the best part of Allen's film: the other plots, while being mildly entertaining, are largely unmemorable, save for the farcical sight of Giancarlo (Fabio Armilato) singing on stage in an opera production staged by Jerry (Woody Allen) while showering himself at the same time. There is a perfectly logical explanation for this: Giancarlo can only reveal his true vocal talent in the shower, so the shower has to be constructed wherever he appears, even if it is in the middle of an opera house. TO ROME WITH LOVE makes some familiar points about Rome's peculiar fascination; its history, its color and its capacity to charm most of its residents, as well as tourists. Darius Khondji's lush cinematography, with its soft reds, blues and yellows, reinforces that impression. In this kind of world, people should just relax and accept whatever happens to them: triumph and disappointment should be treated equally. Middle-aged architect John (Alec Baldwin) learned that lesson long ago; his younger counterpart Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) realizes the same thing when his itinerant girlfriend Monica (Ellen Page) leaves at very short notice for Los Angeles. After a triumphant debut at the opera house, Giancarlo opts for a life of happy domesticity, while Jerry returns to a life of retirement. TO ROME WITH LOVE might be a slight piece, but it is filmed and performed with a considerable degree of élan, and is well worth watching."

","nothing surprising. but almost seductive for his fans and for a part of public who discover small slices from normal existence in his movies. only interesting detail is the role of Jesse Eisenberg, a clone of director and nice role of Jake for Alec Baldwin. only sin - it is a pure Woody Allen film. same recipes, only few different spices, same relationship web, same humor and this does it predictable in too more measure. the cast is perfect but the sound is of story is a little strange. not the script, not the director but the sensation of one Shakespeare comedy as homage to Rome can be not the best option. it is not the best, it is not the worst Woody Allen. only the same. and this is all."

","Woody Allen's European tour continues, stopping this time in Rome to tell a quartet of unconnected stories that run from the absurd to listless. It's mishmash Allen in search of Fellini and it gets lost in translation fast. <br/><br/>Working four story lines Rome opens swiftly as Allen inter-cuts the pieces but once established they all begin to bog down in vapid dialog, the pace loses energy and the payoff on all four vignettes found to be lacking. It's like channel surfing four mundane TV comedies incapable of holding your attention beyond five minutes.<br/><br/>The cast has the usual big names to put in twenty minutes each with Penelope Cruz back to play her hot, high wind Mediterranean bombshell, Alec Baldwin whispering and doing the same things he does in commercials, a cadaverous Judy Davis acting and looking uncomfortable in her own skin, Roberto Benigni doing Roberto Benigni from two decades back and Allen himself showing hints of dementia. <br/><br/>Allen's writing is both capricious and lame as he makes observations about the price of fame, the paparazzi, youthful infatuation and singing in the shower with a heavy hand. There's plenty of Fellini homage (Amacord, La Dolce Vita) going so far as to lift the entire plot from The White Sheik for one of the story lines. Little surprise it is the best of the segments but that's not saying much for this Rome ruin."

","Haven't been the biggest Woody Allen fan I for one know that his films are mostly international and involve love, drama, and dreams. And this latest ""To Rome with Love"" clearly fits those themes as it's a watch for it's enchanting interactions of human beings which are interesting characters on screen. It mostly involves around the life of a celebrity, an architect, an opera and a married couple and a mom and dad who've come to visit their daughter Hayley(Alison Pill). Along the way strange relationships and interactions are formed as each is still trying to discover his or her self. Alec Baldwin is a okay as John an actor who once lived in Rome and Penelope Cruz is ravishing as a high class international call girl. Overall an okay film to see if you enjoy stories of human interaction and connection it's proves love and discovery are strange and unexpected."
"StevePulaski","7","3","8","11 July 2012"," From Woody With Wit
","To Rome With Love isn't as intoxicating or as unanimously pleasing as his previous effort, Midnight in Paris, but it does provide us with some joyously, aesthetically pleasing escapism to warrant a recommendation. Allen is seventy-six years old, and still has quicker timing than many directors attempting to channel him and has been churning out a film nearly every year since 1969. With prolific qualities come some lesser works, but the film isn't lesser as much as collectively adequate.<br/><br/>With that phrase, I mean the film, as a whole, knows what it wants to do, is fully consumed in that idea, and sets off to accomplish its task. It has itself together. Yet, despite a rather respectable effort, it doesn't work on every level or ones that it necessarily should. The story is composed of four vignettes, none of which finding cutesy ways to intertwine with one another (probably the best option), and is complimented by an ensemble cast.<br/><br/>One of the first stories centers around Hayley (Alison Pill), who is visiting Rome and falls in love at first sight with Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). She quickly decides she wants to live with him in Italy, and her parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Woody Allen), fly straight over to meet him. Allen's Jerry scores big laughs at every turn, as he complains about the turbulence on the plane, his disdain for pleasure in places, and his immediate write-off of Michelangelo that he is a Communist. Jerry soon discovers that the man's father (Fabio Armiliato, a real life opera singer) has a profound voice, but is self-conscious, untapped, and can only perfect his singing in the shower. This generates the offbeat qualities that only Allen himself can play with a straight face.<br/><br/>Another centers around Jesse Eisenberg's Jack, a studying architect who bumps into famed architect, John, played by Alec Baldwin. Baldwin knows what it feels like to be in Jack's shoes, and he discovers that Jack is dating Sally (Greta Gerwig) and seems to have his life under control. In walks her friend Monica (Ellen Page), and despite her pseudo-intellectual vibe and her overly detailed sex history, Jack begins to fall in love with her, and refuses to take the warning sings from John.<br/><br/>The two others follow Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi), a newlywed couple residing in Rome, when through a series of rather silly and uninspired events, lands Antonio in bed with a gorgeously voluptuous prostitute named Anna (Penélope Cruz), who he must now pass off as his wife, Milly, while the real Milly is being smitten by her favorite actor. The setup is corny, but provides for a nice farce and some chuckles along the way. The weakest story is oddly the one with the most ambition, and it revolves around the seemingly normal Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), who is just a regular Joe with a regular wife and two kids. Out of nowhere, in the blink of an eye, he becomes famous and renowned for the simple things he does every day, like shaving and sleeping on his back. While the vignette is clearly synonymous with the fact at how so many undeserving people are ""famous"" for doing things that are unworthy of recognition and just being themselves, the comedic value is tiresome, the satire is there at the same time it isn't, and Benigni himself becomes rather uninspired as time goes on.<br/><br/>The cast works wonders together, mainly Eisenberg and Page who create a likable chemistry and spark untold possibilities from the start. But the scene-stealer from the first frame is Woody Allen, who returns to the acting position after six years. His presence here immediately sparks for some delightfully awkward interactions with his family, as well as some ""you either get it or you don't"" jokes that Allen seems able to produce effortlessly.<br/><br/>Rome is projected through a lens of credible elegance and warmth, not to mention a true respect for the culture and the character it possesses. To Rome With Love adds to Allen's ongoing European travelogue, and while it certainly isn't his strongest efforts, his lovable vibes are still visible through the sea of sheer craft.<br/><br/>Starring: Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Ellen Page. Directed by: Woody Allen."

","After his acclaimed ""Midnight In Paris"", Woody Allen chooses the location of the the eternal city and directs ""To Rome With Love"", a story about a number of people in Italy, some of them American, some others Italian, some others residents or visitors, and the romances/adventures/predicaments they are all involved in. Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page stars in this comedic ode.

","Well, having an handful Allen's movie under my belt now (just because he casts actresses I like like Amanda, Natalie, Monica), i wasn't expected much of this movie. As it's indeed dull, i'm not disappointed.<br/><br/>If it's a comedy, it's not funny. If it's a romance, it's not moving. I cannot say either if it's an Italian movie that speaks sometimes English or the contrary, but in the end, the double languages are tiring. The story is nonexistent as it's exploded between 4 separate threads that are as flat as each other. Finally, even the locations are trashy: sure, you explore Roma a lot but the golden cinematography kills everything! Allen even succeeds to give Monica the worst part in her career: she really has nothing to do here! <br/><br/>With the recent watching of ""Nine"", it's funny to see big American directors failing disastrously to catch ""bella vita""! Coppola should laugh..."
"Mustang92","1","2","5","19 July 2015"," Woody Allen's Worst Movie?
","Coming off of one of Woody Allen's best movies, ""Midnight in Paris,"" one would not expect ""To Rome With Love"" to be bad. How can ANY director go from making a great movie, to a piece of crap? Never happens. Yes, one may go from a great movie to mediocre, but not great to horse manure.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this movie, just browse through all the other one-star reviews for the litany.<br/><br/>I'm just in shock. This has to be the worst movie he's ever made. In my entire life, I have only ever stopped watching one or two movies, they were so bad and unredeemable. ""To Rome With Love"" is right there with them, turning it off after one hour, not able to stomach this trash anymore. <br/><br/>Why this movie isn't rated lower on IMDb, is baffling. Some reviewers talk here about how this movie is people's fantasies, that the characters are living out their fantasies. What?? No, that's ludicrous and makes no logical sense. Save yourself two hours of your life and choose a different movie."
"bob the moo","Null","2","5","16 November 2013"," Fragmented and disappointing
","I recently watched Midnight in Paris and really enjoyed the light whimsy of it and how effective it was, so as a result I continued to watch To Rome with Love – the most recent of Allen's films to be greeting with cries of ""return to form"" only for the film to generally be less well received soon afterwards. I had hoped this impression would not be the reality in the way Paris wasn't, but sadly it was. The film opens in busy Rome with many people coming and going and plenty of stories – a young married couple gets separated, two sets of parents come together to meet each other but inadvertently change the career path of both, an older man walks the streets and finds a younger man whose situation he recognizes and a perfectly normal man suddenly finds himself the focus of an adoring press.<br/><br/>Amongst all these ideas are some nice ones and some less so ones. The film runs long (for Allen) trying to fit them in and it gives the whole film the feel of a fragmented sketch show where no one thing is done well enough to carry the weaker moments. I did enjoy aspects of most sections but generally I found myself underwhelmed with how they were delivered. The older man/younger man thread is a nice one but it seems stiff and lacking spark and inspiration. Allen himself as actor overdoes it and seems out of place a little – which is a shame to see, but the rest of the cast are mixed. Some are natural, some are ""acting"", some are fun and some are not. It is a very mixed bag and again one that doesn't totally come together. Visually it is very appealing but I found the style a little bit fake and forced – perhaps I felt this as I have only been to Italy a handful of times and maybe don't have the same experience I do in France? Don't know but for some reason I didn't find too much of it to be charming which I guess was the hope.<br/><br/>A shame; forgiving Allen fans will find some enjoyment in it, and it is not without its good aspects, but generally I found it fragmented and disappointing, lacking the charm it really needed to have."

"zetes","5","2","5","3 February 2013"," Bland
","One of Woody's worst, probably my second least favorite after September (though I'll admit I haven't seen a lot of his films from the past 20 years). It's just so damned bland. Several plot lines, none of them interesting, play out with a mostly unexplored Roman backdrop (despite appearances by a few tourist attraction, this could have taken place anywhere in the world). The most notable one probably concerns Jesse Eisenberg, his girlfriend Greta Gerwig and her sexy best friend Ellen Page, with Alec Baldwin commenting upon them like a fly on the wall (we're never sure what exactly the situation is with Baldwin - either he's a Humphrey Bogart-like spirit like in Play It Again Sam or if he's the protagonist looking back on his own past). Another story concerns Alison Pill and her new beau introducing their parents to each other. Woody Allen annoys immensely as Pill's father (thankfully not her boyfriend) and Judy Davis is her mother. Allen, a former classical record producer, discovers that his daughter's soon-to-be father-in-law is a great opera singer, but only if he's in the shower. Thus plays out a hackneyed plot that I literally saw on the Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show when I was a kid (I'm pretty sure). Two other, Italian language plot lines involve Roberto Begnini as a normal man who starts to get followed around by the paparazzi and a young couple who accidentally get split up and then end up with a prostitute and a movie actor. The Italian language plots I mostly lost track of after a while because I got bored of reading the subtitles for such an inconsequential endeavor."

","Midnight in Paris is my favorite Woody Allen film. Something about that movie just really connected with me, and I've probably seen it ten plus times. I also loved films that showcase a great city, like Allen did with Midnight in Paris in 2011 and Vicky Christina Barcelona in 2008. So as you could imagine, I was extremely excited for Allen's latest city love-letter, To Rome With Love, which came out last year. I finally got around to watching it. Did it deliver? Absolutely! To Rome With Love is an absolutely immersing, beautiful, hilarious experiences, and if you can ignore it's few minor flaws, it's completely awesome! The movie focuses on four different story-lines, and though this can get a little bit messy at times, I think this structure worked great. The film is filled with likable, funny characters, beautiful scenery of Rome, and colorful, hilarious dialog. Another one of my favorite things about this movie is the great soundtrack. It fits the movie's tone and pace perfectly, and keeps the narrative on it's feet. There is so much to love in To Rome With Love, it's definitely one of my favorite films of last year, and I would completely recommend this romantic, funny, fantasy. Ignore the critics, this one is definitely worth checking out. 10/10"

","Did you ever fancy stealing a ride away with a secret object of your affection, on a pastel Vespa down the cobbled streets of Rome? The melody of the accordion notes weighs in the breeze, aroma of the oak wines rises with gentle swirls and the drama of architecture dallies with our humble veracities. <br/><br/>Rome is to romance, as romance to Rome, and Allen reprises the magnificence of the Eternal city, in an intertwined pragmatic tale of several characters. Boasting of a seasoned cast as that of Roberto Benigni, playing the character of Leopoldo, an average Joe turned overnight reality television celebrity, bewildered with his newfound claim to fame, John (Alec Baldwin) playing the alter ego of Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), a young confused architect enticed by his fiancé's promiscuous friend, Monica (Ellen Page), a young actress. A young couple arrives in the city (played by Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi), only to be lost in the streets, one to wind up in the company of an acerbic escort (Penelope Cruz) and the other on a dreamy date with a dazzling movie star. Woody Allen , braces the camera after a five year gap with a signature neurotic character, Jerry, a retired music producer rummaging for a way to 'leave a mark on this world'. The movie follows the characters disturbing the equilibrium instilled in each of their lives. Leopoldo misses his fifteen minutes of glory once it's over, Monica leaves Jack for a career in Hollywood, the young couple ends up being adulterous and Jerry is publicly criticized for making his discovered artist sing 'Volare' under the shower on stage! <br/><br/>The movie, laced with droll dialogue in its convoluted tales, is symbolic of truth of our lives. Each heart desires to cheat the pedantic reality with an intrepid action. Each scheme takes a different course in the light of the day. As the dream follows the day, day follows the dream. <br/><br/>Allen, continues his quaint romance with the old world cities, by spinning frothy tales with vibrant tunes of the orchestra and bouncy imagery of talking statues and the ruins of the Colosseum. With dominant performances by Penelope Cruz and Roberto Benigni, the younger lot (Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg) leaves something to be desired for the characters portrayed by them. Alec Baldwin, playing the deadpan inner conscience of Jack, is sure to make you buckle at his dispensing of advice ('if you're going to screw your best friend's fiancé, does the venue really matter?') Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi deliver warm performances as the naïve domestic couple overstepping their boundaries. So make sure all roads lead to ""To Rome with Love"" this weekend to celebrate the genius of Woody Allen."
"FilmStallion","7","2","5","6 September 2012"," To Rome With Love...3 out of 4 Skittles
","In true Woody Allen comedic fashion, To Rome With Love intertwines different stories into one larger piece with the title city set as the background. Some of the story lines are good...some not so much.<br/><br/>The best story arc stars Alec Baldwin playing an architect visiting the city to retrace his steps from thirty years ago when he lived in Rome as a young student. Baldwin runs into his younger self, played with usual neuroticism by Jesse Eisenberg, and follows him through an affair he had with his girlfriend's best friend (played by Ellen Page). The entertaining and amusing story line could have easily been made into a feature length story of its own.<br/><br/>Roberto Benigni stars in what is probably the least entertaining story line as a man with a boring office job doing the same thing everyday who wakes up as a famous celebrity for no apparent reason. The idea is beaten over the audience's head and quickly loses traction. It's one that I wished Allen would have scraped from the story all together.<br/><br/>Even with some of the slower moments To Rome With Love is light and fun, and will entertain Woody Allen fans. It doesn't dive in as deep as some of his other recent flicks, but for Allen, who continues to pump out at least one movie a year, it keeps the train rolling.<br/><br/>For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

","Greetings again from the darkness. I certainly consider myself a fan of Woody Allen's films and am in awe of his prolific ability to write and direct a new movie most every year since 1969. With so many films to his credit, it's expected that a few will be clunkers. After a pretty nice run of non-New York based films, his love letter to Rome falls short ... not from lack of ambition, but rather from a feeling that these stories have been on his ""to do"" list for too many years. They feel mostly stale and dated.<br/><br/>With one of the world's most beautiful and interesting cities as a backdrop, Mr. Allen delivers four stories - none of which intersect with the others. There are some similar shared themes, but mostly what the four stories have in common is mass overacting by all involved. Surprisingly, the one exception might be Alec Baldwin, whose wise-cracking lines are played pretty close to the vest. Unfortunately, all of the other key actors seem to think they are onstage at a dinner theatre and that hyper-activity and bellowing lines are lines required.<br/><br/>In one story, Woody Allen (his first acting gig since Scoop) and Judy Davis head to Rome to meet their daughter's (Alison Pill) fiancé (Flavio Parenti). Allen overhears the father singing in the shower and works out a scheme to get him an audition that leads to a career. The father is played by famed Opera tenor Fabio Armiliato and this story is so goofy, it could easily fit into Allen's ""early funny ones"".<br/><br/>Another story has newlyweds played by Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandro Mastronardi in a series of innocent happenstance that leads to some not so innocent events that include her favorite actor (Antonio Albanes) and high-priced call girl (Penelope Cruz). Most of this has the feel of a Benny Hill skit.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg and his girlfriend Greta Gerwig share time with her visiting friend played by Ellen Page. This is the Alec Baldwin sequence and he is a near-ghost-like entity who pops in to provide obvious advice or warning to the players so they don't make the same mistakes he made as a younger man. This sequence had potential, but never amounted to much.<br/><br/>The fourth story is just an absurd commentary on reality TV and instant fame. Roberto Begnini plays a normal Italian citizen and family man who one day gets thrust into the world of celebrity for no apparent reason. See, that's the joke. Probably ten years past the time when this was relevant.<br/><br/>Bashing Woody Allen is not my intent here. Simply pointing out that there are four stories and numerous actors and none of it struck a chord with me. Not to say there weren't a few well written lines and a couple of terrific shots of Rome ... just not enough to keep me going for two hours."
"infodaddy","6","2","5","6 July 2012"," Can't decide
","Same age as Woody. From same neighborhood. Great, nah. Enjoyable, okay. But on this one, can't decide beyond that level. Being decisive and indecisive, being experienced or inexperienced, seem to be underlying themes, with subterfuges by the characters to be neither or both.<br/><br/>First Woody Allen movie where I found his music choices lazy, I mean, Domenico Modugno's tired ""Volare"" to vamp us in? Come ON, man!<br/><br/>Worth seeing for the outstanding performances of young actors Allison Pill 27 and Ellen Page 25 though as I recall they did zero scenes together. Ellen and Allison / Page and Pill. Love to see Woody write a 3-act story, for film, for the two to solo in, maybe add Alan Rickman as Greek chorus, as Alex Baldwin was in this one.<br/><br/>As to this movie, some hit-n-run philosophical points made, and Woody finally recreated his orgasmotron, at least metaphorically, which suggests he's got some slapstick left in him. Though it was not nearly as funny.<br/><br/>Stay tuned. 77 ain't nuthin'. Ask me. Per IMDb, his next effort is back in NooYawk to which I say, 'bout time!<br/><br/>Next day I had this added thought. That since these three or four (?) separate stories are not connected, perhaps they had accrued in Woody's notebook over time as individual unplaced items, and he finally found a way to incorporate them into one structure. Possible? And perfectly legit as creative process if they work in that context."
"phd_travel","8","2","6","4 October 2012"," Very funny parts even if it's not Midnight
","How nice to have Woody Allen's humorous look at Italian culture and people especially the paparazzi element. Wonder what country will be next? The formula of different stories intersecting in a European city works.<br/><br/>Great to have Judy Davis acting in one of Woody's tailor made roles again. Penelope Cruz is quite good as the sexy Italian. Alec Baldwin's thing with Jesse Eisenberg wore a bit thin. Ellen Page is good. Woody has a good role for himself here. The interesting and not internationally known (except for Roberto) Italian cast lend an authentic flavor and there are lots of subtitles. The opera scenes are hilarious and my favorite.<br/><br/>It's not as magical or delightful as Midnight in Paris. But it's not fair to compare it to that gem. We can't expect more of that style anyway. It's a thoroughly pleasant comedy with some unexpected original laughs and is well worth a watch."
"valadas","8","2","6","23 September 2012"," Only apparently superficial
","Woody Allen is a movie director who has a deeply knowledge of modern urban life (his more significant films take place in New York, London, Paris, Barcelona and now Rome) in its various aspects mainly those concerned with human relations namely in what refers to love and the several ways it reveals itself including sex. His movies are only apparently superficial. Behind the good humour with which they are made we often find also drama and frustration. And romanticism is almost always present though not in a very patent image. Besides being charming in terms of images of beautiful Rome, this movie tells us several crossed stories that have to do with the idiosyncrasies of present society mainly one that the story shows admirably: the illusion of the social and with media coverage fame that has its example in the office clerk who becomes suddenly famous without knowing why and with all the inherent public homages and reverences and also the undertaker who sings well opera but only in the shower. These are obviously social caricatures but well presented and performed. On the other hand we have the love relations in the three young couples with the interference of a third party in two cases (the seductive pseudo-intellectual girl in one of them and the fine hotel whore and the famous movie actor in the other). This gives way to a lot of excellent gags and funny situations but which have to do with real sentiments and their realistic evolutions sometimes unexpected but acceptable in terms of psychological reactions. All this i. e. images, scenes, stories, the performers's work and the gags, everything treated, related and shown with great skill make this movie one of the best in the current year"
"lindaz","8","2","6","5 September 2012"," One of Woody's all-time Best and (IMO) funnier than most.
","Everyone in the audience was laughing at the dialog and the funny plots. We were definitely in a crowd of Woody Allen fans, even a new-comer would have been laughing.<br/><br/>I read the IMDb reviews before watching this film and not all were so positive, so with trepidation we bought the tickets and I'm SO GLAD we did.<br/><br/>I can't remember laughing this much while viewing his other films and I enjoyed nearly all of them. Compared to his last goody, Midnight in Paris, the camera-work and lighting were not as well done, but the humor, the actor's delivery and their lines were spot on.<br/><br/>There are 2 characters (male) who deliver lines that are definitely from Woody's own experiences. A few times while watching, I could imagine what it would be like to be in his place or in the place of any famous person that realizes they are just a human-being like we all are, yet battling with ""idol"" frenzied fans.<br/><br/>One thing you know you're going to get in Woody's movie is clever, intelligent and very funny dialog. This film delivers all of that and more.<br/><br/>Someone commented that this movie is too long or draggy. My husband and I feel that one scene could have been shortened a bit, but all in all, it was just right for anyone who is a Woody Allen fan.<br/><br/>Aside from the plots of the film, the views of Rome make you feel like you're there. One can fully understand his enchantment with this culturally rich city and it's ""roman""tic inhabitants.<br/><br/>If you love Woody Allen films, don't miss this one."
"OneMovieLover","7","2","6","25 July 2012"," Far from Allen's best, but undeniably entertaining
","'To Rome, with Love' is pretty darn close to a mess. Even those who very much like the movie (including me) should admit that. Yet, it's also hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of 2012. The odds are, you will see half a dozen films this year better than 'To Rome, with Love', but you won't enjoy them as much, and/or they won't be as much fun. It honestly had the potential almost to be a B-movie, except it wasn't actually bad.<br/><br/>I wished that the stories had intertwined a little bit more. Having Jesse Eisenberg's character meet Woody Allen's character would've been great. The problem with non-intertwining stories is, difficult it becomes to put yourself in the lives of all these different characters. Sometimes, it felt like I was only watching the people instead of actually being able to put myself in their shoes. That said, some of the stories require treatment like that.<br/><br/>Take the ""paparazzi story"" as an example, where a worker suddenly finds himself famous. I thought this premise was brilliant; but at the same time, the execution was overlong...we get it. Satire on how someone doing everyday things will get in the paper as long as they're a household name...but that's mostly all we get every time Allen decides to switch back to this guy's story. However, I will say that the scene with his wife's torn stockings being mentioned on the red carpet is downright hilarious.<br/><br/>I liked the story with Woody, and it was nice to see him acting in his own film, which he hasn't done since 'Scoop'. It was a bit silly, but still creative. I'd say that one has the greatest one-liners (""you're figuring that in Euros, in American Dollars it's much less""). It has a jesting, visual style of humor that worked well.<br/><br/>The story with Penelope Cruz had a subtle and well-executed twist near the end, and it was mildly funny but not as much as the one with Allen's acting. I felt that the Jesse Eisenberg story was very stylish, despite being another one where you felt like you were just watching them.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that 'To Rome, with Love' is guaranteed to be one of the most enjoyable films of the year, even though it has very little cohesiveness; none of the stories are really expansive enough for a feature-length film. At times, certain elements are silly and borderline implausible, yet the film stays fresh with great cinematography and visuals of Rome, as well as sufficient comedy. Nearly a mess, but a surprisingly charming one at that."

","It still holds true for me that I cannot go wrong with a Woody Allen movie. TRWL is no exception.Woody Allen has a very distinct style and the viewer must be willing to accept unorthodox points of view from his characters and narrators, as well as leaps of faith for the sake of storytelling. Such is not for everyone. But Woody, rather than attempt to show you how clever he is or feed you some ""in"" jokes, seems to sincerely want you to see humor and seems to know that what he finds humorous has a universal appeal; as opposed to cultural, age specific, genre, etc.. I've never agreed that Woody offers only high-brow or East Coast, Brooklyneze humor. Rather, Allen seems to know that humor is often situational or revolves around language. I'm guessing that Woody is truly Old School and believes in an actual obligation to his fans. Doesn't matter, I doubt I'll ever miss one of his movies. That said, TRWL is rather long for a Woody Allen film and suffers a little as a result. The movie has four distinct tales and eliminating one would leave a moviegoer fully satisfied. I'd elect to drop the ""Everyman Becomes Celebrity"", not because it is inferior but because it doesn't ""fit"" in as well. Aside from a casting choice or two, I cannot complain any further."
"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","6","2","6","16 July 2012"," Very good Woody
","While certainly not the best of WOODY ALLENS films, it's better than most. There are four story lines which do not link. That's part of its strength. Nice to see a film where the Italians speak Italian (sub titles make it more realistic). This is a definite must-see if one is a WOODY ALLEN fan. Even if you're not, there is something very enjoyable about it. Implausible to say the least, but that's what makes it so much fun. Time elements are all over the place, and logic must take a 'back seat' if you're going to enjoy this clever movie. Not as clever as MIDNIGHT IN Paris, but clever in its own terms. Everyone will have a favorite segment. Mine is the one in which WOODY actually appears. His daughters future father-in-law is a great opera singer...IN THE SHOWER. Woody makes note of this and his shower taking is incorporated into the story. Must be seen to be appreciated. The ALEC BALDWIN/JESSE ESINBERG segment is a bit confusing, but fun. Poor Jesse. That poor guy. He's no actor. He delivers the SAME PERFORMANCE IN EVERY FILM. He has an acting range from A to B!!!! PENELPE CRUZ, on the other hand, really makes her segment come alive and one wishes there were more of her. She's featured in the newlywed segment. The weakest segment is the one with that Italian actor who won an Academy Award years ago, Roberto Bergini. While he does fine with the material, the story seems a little forced and too long. Although the scene at a movie premier with his wife is hysterical when the press is commenting on the wife's apparel."
"ElMaruecan82","6","1","2","7 February 2018"," From ""To Rome With Love"", to ""To Woody, With Hate""...
","Woody Allen has always been enamored with Europe and Europe has always repaid him well in return. Nothing extraordinary with Allen's European appeal since he's always been influenced by Bergman and Fellini, both emotional and intellectual school of film-making approaching the things of life, with Allen's humor to spice it all. In result; there has always been a love story between Woody and Europe. ""To Rome With Love"" only states what we've known already and on the scale of the many masterpieces that paid heartfelt tribute to Allen's European heritage, it's a minor offering.<br/><br/>
Besides, ""To Rome With Love"" was released six years ago which on the scale of Hollywood history and the major upheavals following the Weinstein's scandal, are an eternity, the end of 2017 shook up Hollywood like no other year did and the tectonic resonance of the MeToo and TimeUp movement finally reached Woody Allen. Recently, many stars who starred in his movies expressed their regrets and validated their apologies with donations to the concerned organizations, Chalamet did it right after starring in the next Allen film. Colin Firth regretted working with Allen, so did Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page who both starred in ""To Rome With Love"".<br/><br/>
I was just complaining that Allen might have lost his touch after the dreadful ""Café Society"" but I'm afraid that it would be now the least of his concerns. The director who feared the Weinstein scandal would turn into a witch hunt seemed to have indirectly prophesized the very crumble of his legacy, at a time where media outrage is more vocal than court judgments. It seems that stars believed the best option is to believe the allegations against Allen, whether they're right or wrong is beside the point, career-wise, it's the right move. So, I'm not sure how we can exactly judge ""To Rome With Love"" with today's scope, the film seems like a relatively feeble attempt to resurrect the charm of his more glorious decades while not totally devoid of hilarious moments. I wish I could love the film more, but it seems so futile by now, like an exercise in Allenisms with actors trying to play the game while not totally in it... or am I influenced by their late statements? <br/><br/>
Anyway, there is a moment where a retired opera director played by Allen discovers a man who can only sings perfectly under the shower, I don't know if it's intended to be a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes' cartoon ""One Froggy Eveneing"" but only in an Allen movie, you could have an opera scene where a man sings Pagliachi with an incongruous shower set on stage. It was so nonsensical and yet predictable that it could almost be strung with the most surrealist Allen's moments and enough to earn this film two extra points of rating. If only the other parts were as good.<br/><br/>
One of them involve Jesse Eisenberg falling in love with a young student who seems to know exactly what to say to arouse him sexually, she's played by Ellen Page. Alec Baldwin is in every scene, like a not so imaginary friend, for the record, he's the only one who didn't backstab Allen yet. A second story involves a family misunderstanding between a man who must present his fiancée to his uptight family but must save face by pretending it's the luscious prostitute played by Penelope Cruz, meanwhile his fiancée lives another adventure involving a sexy burglar and has been actor. And the fourth is about an average clerk played by Roberto Benigni who suddenly becomes a celebrity without any reason.<br/><br/>
And it's very telling when the part that obviously tries to ""make a statement"" about celebrity ends up being the least successful one. The film is never as funny as when it goes to the zaniest direction and never as boring as when it tries to say something. There are many questions raised in these short films, but only the lighthearted moments allow the film to elevate itself above its heavy contrivances. Rome is such a big presence that it doesn't take much to make a film about it, but Allen overplays the postcard homage for no reason at all, granted it was part of his European tour, but Allen have proven to be a heir to Fellini with his ""Radio Days"" and ""Stardust Memories"".<br/><br/>
Indeed, there's always been something Italian without the need to go all ""Mamma Mia"" without it... no pun intended of course."
"oOoBarracuda","8","1","2","31 July 2017"," To Rome with Love
","I was too quick to judge Woody Allen's films that take place outside of New York. I still much prefer the more familiar setting of New York in Woody Allen films, but MIdnight in Paris and To Rome with Love prove that Woody knows exactly what he was doing whether he was in the U.S. or not. His 2011 film, MIdnight in Paris won Woody an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Allen's 2012 film To Rome with Love may not have won him any statuettes, or much critical acclaim, for that matter, but it did prove Allen's prowess outside of New York that film audiences have associated him with through most of his career. Starring Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, and the return of Woody Allen, To Rome with Love, is an entry late, but a worthwhile entry in the career of Woody Allen.<br/><br/>In a familiar structure for Woody Allen, To Rome with Love follows four unrelated stories which take place in The Eternal City. In one story we follow a native New Yorker, Haley (Alison Pill) who meets Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) a lawyer and political leftist. After spending some time together, the two fall in love and plan to marry at the end of the summer. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis (Judy Davis) fly to Rome to meet Michelangelo and his family. Jerry, a retired opera director hears Michelangelo singing and becomes convinced he is a star in the making and sets his sights on turning the shower singer into an opera hit. The audience also gets to know Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Millie (Alessandra Mastronardi) newlyweds who have just moved to Rome so Antonio can take a job with his relatives. Millie gets lost in the city and Antonio, refusing to go to a lunch meeting/introduction of his new wife alone enlists the help of Anna (Penélope Cruz) to pose as his wife. In yet another unrelated story, John Foy (Alec Baldwin), an architect from America who now designs shopping centers stumbles upon Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) an architect student who reminds John of himself 30 years younger. Jack and his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), a fellow student, are enjoying a vacation when they get a call from Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) who is unexpectedly going to meet the couple in Rome to help herself get over a breakup. Jack and Monica share an instant attraction which builds in intensity the more time they spend together. Luckily for Jack, John is in tow to act as a life guide for Jack in hopes of helping him prevent making a big mistake. The final story finds Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) a loyal husband and a hard-worker who doesn't have much excitement to look forward in his life suddenly thrust into fame without explanation. All of a sudden, Leopoldo's life is documented by reporters as he is constantly followed by the paparazzo. Stuck between being happy that he is now being noticed and wanting his quiet life back, Leopoldo is left with only being able to ride the wave until he is returned to his former life if he ever is.<br/><br/>I will never cease to be amazed at the incredible depth Woody Allen can give to so many stories simultaneously. Often times, throughout my viewing of To Rome with Love, I felt like I was watching a mini-series there was so much independent detail to each storyline. The quality writing of Woody Allen is a facet of his I will never tire of. My favorite part of To Rome with Love, despite Woody Allen's portion of the young love segment, was the time spent with Leopoldo. Just as Woody did in his 1998 film, Celebrity, he takes a scathing look at the celebrity culture, even providing commentary on the differences in treatment male and female celebrities must deal with. Hearing reporters yell out inquiring why Leopoldo's coffee spilled and whether he wears boxers or briefs resonates with anyone who has flipped through a magazine while in line at the grocery store. The way Leopoldo is abandoned when a new ""celebrity"" emerges and resists the quiet life he thought he wanted back, clearly illustrates the fears of those in the public eye rarely explored. Roberto Benigni was a brilliant bit of casting to tell Leopoldo's story. Benigni came to the attention of many American film fans only in 1997 after years in the entertainment industry when he enthusiastically walked on top of the seats at that year's Oscars ceremony to pick up his statuette for Best Actor in the Best Foreign Language winning film, Life is Beautiful. The parallels to Benigni's own life and Woody Allen's focus on the seedy aspects that are lumped in with the glamour of being a celebrity. Each story had its high point, and each added to the overall narrative, but Benigni's was my personal favorite and perhaps had the most to say in regards to society."
"sb88","7","1","2","4 March 2014"," A minor Allen film, but still very enjoyable.
","With a film being made every year, Woody Allen's career has highs and lows. 2011's Midnight in Paris and 2013's Blue Jasmine are his two highest points in many years. In between is To Rome with Love. Unlike the other two films, it's pretty minor overall, although it's still a very funny comedy.<br/><br/>The film tells four different stories, all unconnected to each other. Some are stronger than others, although each has it's interesting points. The highlight is a love triangle involving Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page, with Alec Baldwin as an all seeing commentator. This might have even worked as a film on it's own, and is in the same vein as many of Allen's romance tales. <br/><br/>The other entries include a husband and wife who find themselves wrapped up in other people, a man who suddenly becomes famous for no reason at (the weakest entry of the bunch) and a young couple's parents meeting for the first time (with Allen playing one of the parents, his first role since 2006).<br/><br/>Allen's story in particular contains a very funny conclusion that seems right out of his sillier early 70s movies. Plenty of great one liners and comedic situations pop in all the stories overall. This isn't one of Allen's films that explores anything deeply or carries a big message, but provides a lot of laughs. And that alone makes it worth seeing."
"jvdesuit1","8","1","2","8 February 2014"," Woody Allen At its best
","When I read all the negatives reviews here I just get mad! Let's put things right first: I'm not an unconditional admirer of Woody Allen. I find him in many of his so called astounding movies, boring because of his uninterrupted dialogs and his permanent excitement and so on and so forth. But some of his films have captivated me, like Midnight in Paris, Whatever works, Hollywood ending,Small Time Crooks.. What I will not deny is that Allen is an incredible observer of human nature and especially of the negative sides of the human being.<br/><br/>To Rome with love is typically the film which presents this aspect of Allen's genius. It is a ferocious portrayal of the stupidity of the common man and woman when confronted to medias. Of course the result of these critics is that people will say as above ""Allen's Most Disappointing Film from Europe"", or""a wasted opportunity"" or ""Unbelievably bad....The characters are neither sympathetic, likable, interesting, nor memorable. The plots are like fantasy daydreams but still manage to be incredibly tiresome.""<br/><br/>When I check the origin of the review, most of the time I find that the reviewer is either from the US or a continent outside of Europe. Did these reviewers ever set foot in Europe? If they did for how long ? Do they speak the languages of the countries they visited?.. The answer to these questions individually are most probably: NO!<br/><br/>I would not be surprised too, that some of them are in a job more or less related to the media or show business. But this is not important because even if you're not related to those type of jobs, Allen in his film points his finger to all of you who watch stupid reality shows on TV, spend hours reading the stupidities of tabloids; if this is not the case maybe you're among those who think you'll solve all your personal problems with a shrink or to be sure no one can blame you for being uncultured, will have the behavior of Monica...<br/><br/>Hey! hey! You don't like me stating that! That's what Allen wants to point out in the movie, our foolish behaviors, our snobism; he gives us a hilarious portrait of the idiots who today massacre the operatic repertoire, with their so called ""avant garde"" staging, what we call in French ""relecture of libretto"", that's how last summer Bayreuth Festival had the nerve to present The Ring staged in a Texaco gas station! And there were people to applaud in ecstasy! We had the same in Paris with Aida staged in the Italy of Mussolini with PK machine guns and tanks!<br/><br/>Someone here has compared this movie with Midnight in Paris. What a mistake. Midnight in Paris is a superb homage to the French capital. To Rome with Love is a ferocious painting of men and women excesses and which town in the world, which nation in the world represents best the excesses of human behavior? Italy, Rome, Naples, Sicily! People shout like mad at singers if the right C has not been given by the Soprano, drive like mad in the streets of Rome or on the motorway around the Sorrento Peninsula, spend hours with their mobile phone and have two or three of them if not more, can't speak in a normal voice as not to be heard 100 yards around etc... He has softened his critic by giving us some beautiful but not original views of the city and its ruins; but that is the decoration of the plate he serves us to savor. The dish is very spicy and gives us heart-burns because we don't like to be presented with our most spiteful aspects of our characters. In doing so Allen has given a new masterpiece of ferocious humor. Thanks Woody!"
"bob-rutzel-1","5","1","2","18 October 2013"," Disappointing
","Woody Allen gives us 4-stories and performs in one of them. 1. A very good opera singer is discovered. 2. John (Alec Baldwin) appears and disappears almost at will and, at times, proclaims what will and won't happen if certain actions are/are not taken. 3. A newlywed passes a prostitute off as his wife. 4. Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo who is a favorite target of paparazzi<br/><br/>None of the stories are related as in a CRASH scenario. Sorry. <br/><br/>The movie moves along nicely, but only because the scenery around Rome is so captivating, and Allen lets us see many historical buildings. The stories we see have no substance, no pull and we wonder why they are there and why was this made. <br/><br/>The only good line I found was when someone said of (prostitute)Anna (Penelope Cruz) in a very tight, and obscenely seductive red dress when they were going on a tour of the Vatican: Will they let her in? That was it folks. See? That was the only line I chuckled at. Anna was pretending to be Millie, Antonio's (Alessandro Tiberi) wife due to another mix-up and misunderstanding. <br/><br/>Well, you ask where was(newlywed) Antonio's wife Millie? She got lost in Rome and runs into a huge movie star who wants her opinions on things, but in his hotel room. Ahhh! See?<br/><br/>Allen,as Jerry, finds Giancarlo (played by opera singer: Fabio Armiliato) his future In-Law, and who he feels is an exceptional opera singer, but can only perform in a shower. Give me a break. And, it is here that the opera singing goes on for way too long at times. My uncle used to sing opera in the truck as we went somewhere. I would always tell him: I think I heard a wounded animal out there.<br/><br/>John (Alec Baldwin) appears to Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) who lives with Sally (Greta Gerwig) but has eyes for her friend Monica (Ellen Page) and John seems to tag along with them wherever they go. Sometimes others address him, but at other times it seems he is only visible to Jack. He constantly gives forth his knowledge of life. Was this some form of ""magic"" that was so crucial to MIDNIGHT IN Paris? We were not amused. <br/><br/>And, Roberto Benigni (yes, you all wondered where he went ) as Leopoldo who is the target of the paparazzi for a reason explained by his one-time chauffeur: they want someone to be famous and they make him so and follow him everywhere. Well, something like that. See, no pull. And, these scenes are clever in the beginning, but go on for too long and become annoying. Not funny. Just annoying. <br/><br/>When we see a Woody Allen movie we expect some comedic lines whether the movie is a drama or a comedy that he writes and directs. What we have here are very bland slices of life that have no relevance, hence no pull, but we keep watching because we feel something good will come along and make all the blandness worthwhile. Didn't happen. Yes, this was disappointing. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb spoken by Monica"
"SnoopyStyle","5","1","2","25 August 2013"," No favoritism for Woody
","In order to do a honest review, we have to show no favoritism. And if this was a love letter to Rome, it was nothing more than a tourist postcard.<br/><br/>The storyline with Woody Allen is passable. I hated the boyfriend. Making him so annoying was a mistake. Woody had a few good lines but he was the only highlight.<br/><br/>Penélope Cruz is another who's alone in her storyline. She had no help. The guy is doing a nervous Woody and doing it badly. The girl is naive, and separated from the other half of their storyline.<br/><br/>Did anybody find the Roberto Benigni storyline funny? At best, it was cute, but it was never funny.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg's storyline actually had some fun especially with commentator Alec Baldwin. Although, I thought Ellen Page had absolutely no chemistry with Jesse. I get the story was for Jesse to go against the grain. But Jesse and Greta Gerwig share so many of the same mannerism. It just works so much better with Greta.<br/><br/>Everywhere there were problems.... and tourists... both distracting."
"bptr-1","7","1","2","14 July 2013"," Not the best Woody Allen but still fun
","Cartoonish with bad contrived forced acting (like a dry run-through of a script). This required a huge suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part. Why was Woody even in this? He is FAR too old to be a plausible parent - should have been the grandparent. He apparently decided to take the bold approach of having his usual stand-in little Jewish kid (Jesse Eisenberg) AND himself in the movie (some kind of existential paradox?). Having said that, I do still like Woody in his own films - but I want him off to the side as in Scoop. The only actors who were good were Roberto Benigni (outstanding), Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz, and Greta Gerwig. Also, Fabio Armiliato is a fantastic singer,<br/><br/>Here Woody Allen takes his own invented genre to its own cartoonist extreme. We, the viewers, are supposed to suspend all sense of reality to accept this. This is the new genre of Woody Allen totally using a city as a crutch to support any contrivance of a plot and script. It is like each actor is doing a Woody Allen imitation (are they that intimidated by his presence???). He also relies on his tired formula of having several unrelated story lines intertwined.<br/><br/>If you drop your critical eye and just enjoy this movie, it is entertaining. Actually the brilliant Roberto Benigni makes this movie on his own. He is hilarious. Penelope Cruz is also a lot of fun.<br/><br/>p.s. I can't believe that reviewer Grey Gardens called Scoop Woody Allen's worst film! I loved that movie."
"mfshill","4","1","2","17 June 2013"," Not exceptionally bad or very good.
","A Woody Allen film with multiple story threads set in Rome. Allen's recent offerings have been a bit hit and miss. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I actually enjoyed Midnight in Paris where Owen Wilson managed to produce a good performance. Unlike that 2011 feature, To Rome With Love is devoid of any charm or the snappy dialogue and finessed editing of Allen's older films.<br/><br/>I think the main issue comes down to the cast. With half the film spoken in Italian, the Italian cast do a good job of showcasing the frenetic energy of Rome and with comedic elements thrown into the mix these scenes are enjoyable to watch. In stark contrast to this, the sequences in English with the American cast are just painful to watch.<br/><br/>The dull performance from Jesse Eisenberg had me hoping he would be killed off early so I wouldn't have to endure his presence on screen. The same can be said for Ellen Page, who rolls out her usual quirky act that just leaves me cold. To date I haven't enjoyed any of Eisenberg's films and Page was fantastic in Hard Candy, entertaining in Super but just insipid throughout all her scenes here.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin did his usual charming old man routine and for the most part he was the most entertaining English speaking participant.<br/><br/>Had the whole film been in Italian I think it would have worked much better, I have no idea what Allen was aiming for with this film but it falls short of being a full blown comedy or romantic piece. The idiosyncratic elements that littered his early work are still present, like the story of a worker who wakes up to find himself a celebrity for no apparent reason, but the rest of the film takes the edge off these amusing tableaux."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","11 February 2013"," Just a fun romp, as most Woody Allen movies are.
","As the extra on the DVD explains, Woody Allen is a fan of the older Italian movies and wanted to do an homage of sorts, to make a movie in Rome with some of the Italian style and comedy represented in those older movies.<br/><br/>He has several, independent, parallel stories going on, each with its own quirks. I like Woody himself in small doses and here he has one of the roles, as a dad, recently retired from the classical music business, traveling to Rome to see his daughter and meet her Italian fiancée. Most of the humor involves Giancarlo, the father of the fiancée, and the actor is Fabio Armiliato, who in actuality is a well-respected operatic tenor. He is an undertaker and they discover that he sings really well in the shower, but only does so-so in the audition that he very reluctantly goes to. The solution is funny, they modify well-known operas so that he always sings while taking a shower, and the audience loves him. <br/><br/>Roberto Benigni, of ""Life Is Beautiful"" fame, plays Leopoldo, a lowly clerk, who one day is unexpectedly confronted by cameras and microphones, for no apparent reason everyone takes an interest in every detail of his life, what he eats for breakfast, what kind of shaving cream he uses, whether he wears briefs or boxers. He is very annoyed. Of course it is Woody's comment on people who become ""famous for being famous"" with no basis. Later when people lose interest in him he misses the attention and tries to get it back.<br/><br/>There is a bit about a young aspiring architect meeting up with an architect who had, like the young architect, lived in the same area of Rome 30 years earlier. Now he is known for designing shopping centers. <br/><br/>Another bit is about a young couple taking their honeymoon in Rome and getting separated, he meeting up with a hooker, she with a hotel robber, then finding out they would rather lead a more normal life away from Rome. <br/><br/>You can look for deep meaning in Woody Allen films but to me there isn't any, just some humorous scenes and characters that more often than not are a commentary on some facet of our everyday lives. But examined from a unique Woody Allen angle.<br/><br/>An aside, for years Woody Allen has insisted that his movies have a ""mono"" soundtrack, because that is the way it was at movie houses. Yes it ""was"", many years ago. But modern movie houses have incorporated some form of ""surround sound"" for years now. Well this movie, ""To Rome With Love"" has a Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. And when I went back to check, ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011) did too. But every movie before that is listed with a ""mono"" sound. It is nice to see Woody Allen has finally accepted modern sound design, it makes the movie much more enjoyable."
"conono","5","1","2","26 January 2013"," Treading Water
","After Woody Allen's surprisingly deft script for 'Midnight in Paris' many had high hopes for 'To Rome With Love' despite its title indicating a retread. Well, a retread would have been more welcome than this meandering, unformed, and undisciplined collection of predictable vignettes.<br/><br/>I won't belabor the mini-plots as a few hundred people have done that already. I'll just point out that a couple of them--starring Roberto Benigni and Fabio Armiliato--are themselves belabored well past the threshold of intolerance. Why? Because each vignette has just one joke behind it and could have been entertaining for five minutes. Not twenty. (At least Armiliato does have a good singing voice.) <br/><br/>Allen, as he never tires of reminding us, adheres to Nietzsche's 'Great Man' theory, wherein mere mortals should hope at most to bask in reflected glory of the Superman, never to question him. And the Superman never follows the rules which apply to lesser mortals. But someone needs to tell Mr Konigsberg that his jokes are inevitably overextended and many fall completely flat. Alas, like most self-styled supermen he appears to have no one around who dares to be honest with him. <br/><br/>Even Woody's visual tribute to 'Roma La Bellissima' falls somewhat flat despite the visual pr0n on display. He consistently selects locales which would have been clichéd and tiresome to an American tourist in 1960. Spanish Steps? Are you serious? I wonder if he knows the city at all.<br/><br/>The film (as so many of his are) is actually a more transparent paean to adultery. In Woody's world, cheating on your lover is a productive, life-affirming, transformative act which improves your life in almost every way. Even your betrayed partner will be delighted at the new you! Woody? This is called self-justification, and you never tire of it. If only the rest of us could say the same."

After an unsure start the film settles into a consistently amusing tone which occasionally moves up a gear into the very funny .The stories themselves are quite slight,no more than extended gags in some cases and given the light tone of the film this is perfectly acceptable,however as the film has an almost two hour running time i felt that perhaps ten or fifteen minutes could have been pruned to maintain the light atmosphere.I'm sure also that natives of Rome would take issue with the authenticity of the portrayal of life in that particular city!<br/><br/>It's obviously the film of an older writer director and as such probably wont connect as readily with younger audiences,but a pleasant experience never the less and it's sunny ambiance makes it a tonic on dark wintry evenings."
"e-horssius","5","2","7","14 September 2012"," Plagiarism in To Rome with Love?
","Scent of plagiarism? In the creative arts, it's not possible to copyright the idea for a movie, the plot outline for a new opera. You only have copy able rights to such a product when the thing itself has been produced. As they say, if a writer, or for that matter, a director steals from one person it's plagiarism; if he steals from several it's research. Let's now turn to Woody Allen. One of the US' great original minds. That original that you can hardly picture him as a plagiary. Yet, let us talk about ""To Rome, with love"", Allen's latest accomplishment. What we have here is a hilarious and repeating scene use of an amateur opera singer. An old American visitor of Rome, played by Woody Allen himself , discovers the singing talent of a Roman undertaker. This undertaker, like so many of us, is more than capable as an opera singer when he is taking a shower. This old American visitor of Rome, happens to be an agent, and resolves the amateur's problem by putting a shower on the stage, to allow this talent to sing on a public stage., whilst washing himself on stage.. This scene, an important scene in this film, could also be seen first in a 1999 movie of Chinese director, Zhang Yang. In this film, titled Shower, the scene I s et in a Beijing bathhouse One of the visitors sings ""O sole mio"". Turn out the hot water, the singer is silenced and shameful again. I would argue that Woody Allen has used this very scene in his latest movie. I double checked the credits of Allen's movie: there was no mentioning of Zhang Yang. There was, however, on the credits of another 3 movies that were directed by Allen, (a.o. Sweet and Lowdown) the name of Zhao Fei. The cameraman Zhao Fei is of about the same age as Zhang Yang and Allen publicly praised his work as a cameraman on ""Raise the Red Lantern"" by Zhang Yimou. It seems clear that Allen is no stranger to Chinese film. Which brings us to the big question: is the use of scenes of the amateur opera singer an homage to another fellow director, or is there more than meets the eye. If it is not plagiarism, why was Zhang Yang, who got an 2000 Rotterdam Film Trophy for this piece of work, not mentioned? Eric Horssius<br/><br/>."

However, this is a very watchable and fully enjoyable movie for the summer. I promise you'll break a laugh or two. <br/><br/>Watching this movie I could feel Woody Allen is at a very fulfilling phase. After his disturbed, yet immensely creative work with his NY movies, he has gone off to his period in Europe, where he seems to be having the time of his life. I can only imagine the relaxed atmosphere in a set working with remarkable Roberto Benigni, luscious Penelope Cruz, and the ever cynical Alec Baldwin. <br/><br/>Bring a positive mindset, remember low expectations are the path to happiness, and let yourself be entertained for 90 minutes.

Unlike Woody's wondrous ""Midnight in Paris"" which was both a love letter to a divine city and also a captivating narrative, ""To Rome With Love"" was just simply the former and lacking the latter. Now, I did enjoy some facets of ""To Rome with Love"" but like my personal European trips, they were far and few in between. Woody seemed rushed in constructing the movie, it was like he was trying to build Rome in one day. The film features several story lines set in the titular city, some with natives and some with tourists. We start the Rome adventure with a trip to Haley's Comet, which would be the young American Haley who travels to Rome in an excursion. Haley falls in love with the Italian Michelangelo (no, not that Michelangelo, this is not ""Midnight in Rome"") and therefore since it is a romance in the most romantic city in the world, they get engaged. Haley's American parents Jerry and Phyllis visit Rome to meet Michelangelo and his parents. Jerry is played by none other than Woody himself, and Phyllis is portrayed by Judy Davis. Jerry, who is a retired Opera Director, notices that Michelangelo's dad has a brilliant opera singing voice when he hears him singing in the shower; so therefore Jerry decides to try to ride that ticket to a return to Opera glory even though Michelangelo and his mother are totally against it. Let's just say this storyline was not showered with magnetism. It was great to see Davis in an Allen film again, being a veteran of so many Woodyflicks. And Woody was just being Woody with another neurosis-filled performance. Allison Pill turned out a solid performance as Haley. I want to say so much on the promise of Allison's acting career, but I decided to take a chill pill and move on to our next stop in our Rome film review excursion. That would include the beautiful return of Roberto Benigni (remember him?) as the Italian family man Leopoldo who obtains instant stardom when he inadvertently becomes a Reality Star phenomenon, and gets plummeted with press observing every move he makes during the day. Allen is obviously depicting the unauthentic aspects of Reality Show fame, but the joke starts wearing thin at times even though Benigni portrays it with precision. Moving right along to our next Rome storyline, there is a story that was prostituted for cheesy laughs. And that would be of a young Italian married couple Antonio and Milly who visit Rome to meet Antonio's uncles but a series of events lead Antonio and Milly to separate Romeatic adventures including Antonio having a bombshell Italian prostitute named Anna pretend that she is his wife for reasons that would take too much time and energy to explain. Besides that, the story was not funny; but Penelope Cruz did look ravishing even though her performance was overacted and not even in the same ball park as her Oscar-winning performance in Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". And our last stop in ""To Rome with Love"" was the most entertaining narrative of the movie. It includes Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, and Alec Baldwin. Eisenberg plays Jack, an architect student living abroad in Rome with his American girlfriend Sally, that girl is portrayed by Gerwig. Jack meets the effervescent middle-aged John (Alec Baldwin), who when he was Jack's age also studied architecture in Rome. John becomes like a guiding force and voice of reason or unreason to Jack by giving him advice on a dilemma that occurs when Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) visits Jack and Sally. Monica is cerebral, analytical, and chatty which are all attributes that attract Jack to her. So where they be a ménage a trios as the Romans do?, o wait that is the French. Baldwin nailed the John performance, and is worthy enough of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Ellen Page has just turned another page in her impressive young acting career with another fine-tuned performance. I do have to credit Allen for scribing a very witty screenplay within this storyline, but this is the only one that did it for me. Allen does show breathtaking scenes of Rome that brilliantly captures the beauty and romance of the beloved city, but that was not even enough for me to unanimously recommend this movie. ""To Rome with Love"" is not a total disaster, and it does have numerous good things in it, but if I were you I would not spend too many Romeing charges on it. *** Average"

","This is a lighthearted, enjoyable film full of humor and irony over human condition. Typical Allen in what he always excels. Don't expect from this film great philosophical and existential dramas. People who leave bad reviews either don't get the irony or maybe it resonates with their personal similar experiences. It is a bit like relatives of Antonio writing some of the reviews. The current 6.3 grade undervalues the film, in my opinion it is a firm 7.5. IMDb in general undervalues European-style films. Watch Allen's film, enjoy the walk through Rome, derive moral lessons at your will. This film is on par with his late films (obvious comparison with Midnight in Paris, Magic in the Moonlight and others). Midnight in Paris probably has a bit more depth,just due to the script. This film consists of four stories developed in parallel, with only the city of Rome joining them together."
"pennyelenabooks","3","1","3","11 April 2016"," not good enough
","You would expect more from an Allen movie, but in this case, it fails completely to even be funny. Many stories are presented, with the only thing in common that they are taking place in Rome. Okay, the scenes of the city are beautiful, but the movie is a madness, with no real story, and, in the end, no real purpose. I mean, was it about the city? broken relationships? misunderstandings? paranoia? No clue. The story about the opera and the shower was kind of funny, I guess, and the one with the newlyweds cute and probably the most interesting story in the film. Now, the one with the uni students had some depth in it, and the one with the unexpected fame was rhetorical, if not crazy. But still, they didn't mingle well with each other. So 3 out of 10."
"ntsci","Null","1","3","21 January 2014"," Hilarious study of love and life in Rome
","Cute movie. Four stories of love and life in Rome. One story was of an older man following what appeared to be his younger self around and advising him about falling in love with a friend of his girlfriend.<br/><br/>In another story an ordinary man is suddenly made into a celebrity complete with a photo paparazzi. and the media hangs on his every word for a couple of day... and then he is dropped as an object of importance. I'm not sure if that was supposed to be some sort of cruel reality TV show. <br/><br/>The film was directed by Woody Allen. He also played a part as the father of one of the other characters, and he used to be involved in the music business, but was ahead of his time. The most hilarious part, to me anyway, was Woody's discovered of a fantastic opera singer, who can only sing in the shower. I shall now always expect an opera star to be carted onto the stage in a shower.<br/><br/>The fourth story is about a shy couple in the big city for the first time, lost and confused, and who accidentally end up both cheating on each other. <br/><br/>Enjoy."
"JackCerf","6","1","3","25 September 2013"," Spotty But Worth It
","Of the four disconnected story lines of 2RWL, the plot with the newlywed couple, the hooker and the movie star was completely dispensable, the plot with the shower singer was recycled early Allen shtick that could have been a sketch from Without Feathers 45 years ago, but the plot with Benigni's schmuck becoming a celebrity was enjoyable (and I never thought I'd want to see Benigni in anything ever again). <br/><br/>The film is worth seeing for the plot with Baldwin, Eisenberg and Page -- a good, cynical, mildly malicious meditation on the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. Page has the guts to play a thoroughly dislikable character with real zest, and Baldwin glides gracefully as the voice of rueful experience. Like an icon that shows a saint simultaneously at several stages of being, Baldwin is at once Eisenberg's real older contemporary, the inner voice of his better judgment, the omniscient narrator and the older, successful Eisenberg looking back on the young idiot he was.<br/><br/>Allen loves the theme of getting away with something -- murder in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Bullets over Broadway and Match Point, infidelity in Hanna and Her Sisters and Vicky Cristina. 2RWL has not one but three never detected infidelities, not to mention Benigni's more or less open dalliances that his bemused wife simply accepts as the perks of his bizarre celebrity."
"AvidClimber","7","1","3","12 June 2013"," Interesting tales about dreams and desires
","To Rome with Love is an eclectic mix by Woody Allen. You find reality shoved in side by side with memory and fantasy for a surprising picture of dreams and desires battling reason and facts. If there's a moral you can take out of it, it's probably: don't take yourself or life too seriously.<br/><br/>The good. Sincere and very interesting story that works to make us think. Nicely paced scenario. Solid dialogs.<br/><br/>The actors. A star studded cast with nice results. I'll just name a few here: Penélope Cruz, Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin, and Roberto Benigni.<br/><br/>The bad. Nothing.<br/><br/>The ugly. Nothing.<br/><br/>The result. A nice change of pace from most films produced these days."
"BrianLlywd","7","1","3","9 March 2013"," A commentary on celebrity
","Anyone who takes this picture at face value lacks insight. Yes, it is a series of vignettes, some romantic, that are placed in Rome. But no, it's not a typical Woody romantic comedy. It's a commentary on celebrity and a fairly biting one. From the short, fat, balding ""sexy"" movie ""star"" to the ""celebrity of the day"" Woody demolishes the star making machinery in which he has existed for the last fifty years or so. The shallowness of movie starlet love, the need for a fading producer to have one more big hit, the vacuousness of celebrity and its fleeting nature. Those are the themes of this picture. And if these are accepted at face value, then the picture is terrific. Any dullard who judges it against ""Midnight in Paris"" back to ""Annie Hall"" is bound to be disappointed. But that should be held to their account for not being very bright. An excellent commentary on post-modernism and the current value of impression when measured against real value. Including Adam Baldwin as an imaginary figure in the picture is an excellent choice, because he and his entire family are mostly famous for being famous, not for having talent."
"wordsmiths_communication","4","1","3","24 January 2013"," Even a great artist can't copy him/herself
","The Midnight in Paris Formula didn't work in Rome. Midnight was stupendous, wonderful movie. To Rome With Love was dialed in, and in my opinion had none of the magic of the other movie. The soundtrack was awful...sort of what a director thought Italian music should sound like. He didn't give enough screen time to any main character and as a result we wound up caring about none of them. The switching back and forth gave me a headache. Rome is a visual treat but the shots of the city were like the music. I hate to use the word cliché, but it fits. I classify this flick as mildly entertaining, at best. Woody isn't an actor, we know this. His twitchiness was especially cloying in nearly every scene. He must make a decision not to display neurotic behavior. However, and this is my problem, my expectation level was very high after Midnight in Paris, so I feel let down."
"kosmasp","8","1","3","3 January 2013"," To the fans with love
","Woody Allen is not everyones taste. Just the fact he is in most/some of his own movies, might be a turn off for most. But this one is a series of different stories all grounded in Rome. A decade ago no one would've guessed that Mr. Allen would ever do a movie outside of New York. And here he is touring Europe now! Maybe Rome will become his new muse (no pun intended) after London.<br/><br/>The fact that we have so many stories with so many different characters also means, that we get different quality in those stories. So you may like one storyline more than the other. The one involving Woody Allen wasn't my favorite, because it was too obvious what he was trying to make there. My personal favorite is the one with Alec Baldwin. It's a tricky one, if you want it to be. And very well written too!"
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","1","3","15 October 2012"," It made me smile
","One of the great strengths of To Rome With Love is that it's never content with being funny. It's hysterical, but at age seventy-six writer-director Woody Allen still realises that jokes cannot exist by themselves. Humour must be supported by a purpose and grounded in some form of reality. Philosophically, Allen has said in any profession, everything a person does is for the opposite sex. His film reflects this by offering a deeply cynical view of the way that people are seduced, not just physically, but also by a need to satisfy their self-interests, like status and materialism. Seduction is a broad theme, but Allen finds clever ways of applying it to two of his favourite staples: relationships and cultural decline. His screenplay smartly avoids structural contrivances, refusing to connect the stories arbitrarily. They're told in fragments but skilfully bridged together in theme. The central ideas and the accompanying staples are always visible, meaning there's no sense of irrelevance. This structure is also pivotal in contributing to its own unique concept: each episode is viewed as a microcosm of this beautiful city (sumptuously photographed), reflecting the continually unwinding nature of personal stories within any place or situation. Woody's decision to magnify the inner lives of these characters against a larger canvas provides the film with humour that exists on a visual spectrum as much as a verbal one. <br/><br/>The film's two best threads are divided between Woody's character and the younger talents, Page and Eisenberg. This is Woody's first acting role since 2006 and he doesn't miss a beat. His token hysterical, hypochondriac role has lost none of its charm and his comic-timing is impeccable. Try not to laugh when Jerry asks Giancarlo what exactly he has against live people or the look on his face after they shake hands. While Woody also touches on classic fears, like his obsession with death, nothing prepares you for the funniest gag involving a bizarre stage performance. There are two microcosmic threads at play, which fuse theme and image seamlessly. Jerry's decision to return to music, after his own failings (Rigoletto, with actors dressed as white mice we're told), is openly questioned as being like a final grasp to enhance his own personal reputation. He opts to gamble heavily on the success of Giancarlo's magnificent but untested voice (Armiliato is a real life tenor), continually pressuring him into performing, even though the man has no interest in sharing his gift. Similarly, the stage production itself, which I won't spoil, offers a hugely inventive visual gag that shows how a performer's private life is projected into the public sphere, hilariously becoming accepted by audiences as a piece of high art, instead utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jessie Eisenberg's thread has a lot in common with the Allen vehicle Play it Again Sam (1972), using similar narrative techniques and threads to construct a cautionary tale about misguided passion. The thread remains coy about whether Jack is John's younger self. But what's important is that one man's story leads into another. Wherever the fatal mistake occurred in John's life, it has led him into a fabricated life, where he is now designing malls, instead of something truly artistic and remains dissatisfied by his mistakes and personal regrets. However, the best asset of this thread is the charisma of Ellen Page, a gifted actress whose fast lipped verboseness finds a perfect marriage with Allen's dry wit. The story she tells about her experience with a woman, with reaction shots on Eisenberg's face, was side-splitting for me and brilliantly executed. Listen to the subtle irony in the tone of the dialogue too. Monica insists that she couldn't possibly sleep with Jack in her best friend's house! But they can go straight to the car instead! Or Jack mentions that he can't breakup with Sally because she has her exams coming up...so he'll do it straight after! As funny as this dialogue was, I was also heavily invested in how this thread would unfold and liked the way that it ended on a relatively dark note. <br/><br/>The other two threads are little bumpier but still hugely entertaining and full of laughs. Benigni is restrained but has the least developed of the stories. It's funny to see him mobbed by the press, but it's intentionally repetitive, true to Woody's gripe with the banality of journalism, focussing on boring, talentless people. The last story is splintered in two parts, and the case of mistaken identity is a lot of fun, particularly with an actress as engaging and luminous as Cruz at the helm. The superficial nature of class is parodied wonderfully when Antonio does his best to hide Anna's identity, only for every man at a party to recognise her and make bookings. Milly's thread and her relationship with an actor does not receive as much time as the others, but I especially liked her comedic dilemma, dwelling on being unfaithful or being able to tell her grandchildren about it one day. All of these threads crisscross, which means that you will have to wait for your favourite to re-emerge. The film might not be as a refined as Midnight in Paris (2011), it's a touch too long, yet it has more laughs and as many complex ideas. It's a cheerful movie about some very strange people and one of my favourite comedies this year. It made me smile."

","I must say this is not my favorite Woody Allen movie.<br/><br/>Every work is different of course but is very weak, especially compared to match point which I think is a masterpiece.  Also Vicky, Cristina! Barcelona was an epic movie showing how Allen has always been ahead of his time.  Funny enough he, himself plays in from Rome with Love, exactly as an artist (in opera production business). <br/><br/>You can still see that your watching a Woody Allen movie.  It's his quirkiness, unexpected twists, parallel stories...  It's all the elements characteristic to his style- what it lacks is the dire shock!  Think ending of the match point,  the intense encounters of Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona.  There is nothing as remarkable as these scenes in his latest movie. Maybe it didn't have to have. It's a love story at the end of the day- at least three to be more precise. Well you can't be precise though. Everyone who watches this movie will have a separate interpretations of the stories.<br/><br/>There are the obvious relationships and their not so honest extrapolations but there are also sub stories of loving and fake admirations towards celebrities, there is also the stories of the love between son and father, love towards art and architecture, love towards work- love of life at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Hmm when I look at at like this, maybe this wasn't a bad movie after all.  Ok it  gets a 7 from me. <br/><br/>Enjoy the movie, Gorkem"
"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","26 September 2012"," A Nutshell Review: To Rome With Love
","I've only started to follow the works of Woody Allen more closely when he brought his filmmaking out of New York and into Europe, where he had made a number of films in the UK, and continues his sojourn through the continent with odes to her major cities, from Barcelona to Paris and now Roma, or Rome. And true to Allen's form, this film was really done with love, about love, and with the usual self-deprecating humour each time Allen decides to go in front of the camera as well.<br/><br/>Fans will undoubtedly lap up his writing and characterization featured in the film, where he tackles no less than four separate story lines, making up a myriad of stories about love and relationships set in the eternal city. And all things interesting about the film really had Allen's writing strength to thank, to make up scenarios and situations so differently, revolving around the emotion's broad theme, coupled with his pull to get recognizable names attached to his project, as we gaze at the backgrounds of what the city had to offer, and do a little bit of star-gazing as well.<br/><br/>Starring in one of the roles himself, Allen plays Jerry, a retired music executive who is in town with his wife Phyllis (Judy Davis), who are there to celebrate their engagement of their daughter Hayley (Alison Pill) to Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), an Italian lawyer with values quite unlike Jerry's, and threatens to tear everything apart. That, and coupled with Jerry's insistence in making a business out of the voice of Michelangelo's father, the mortician Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), after hearing the latter singing in his shower, meant a clash of values and an almost absurd, comedic take on desperate innovation of the opera. Allen though, didn't manage to break out of his usual mold in the characters that he play, and Judy Davis' sarcasm looked pretty much scripted and poorly delivered, but fortunately Armiliato steals the show with his down to earth character.<br/><br/>Then we have Penelope Cruz barge into the scene, and pretty much stealing everyone's thunder in her segment, where she plays call girl Anna. Here, an Italian couple Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) are about to embark on a new life in the city, but their first experiences are separate, and we get two story arcs instead. Antonio gets tangled with Anna, who barges into his hotel room when Milly was away, mistaking him for someone else whom she has to service, while Milly's solo venture brings her onto a film set, where she gets to meet her film idol Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese), who turns out to be quite the slimy celebrity he is. Expect the unexpected here, with the primary couple being faced with temptation just when they least expect it!<br/><br/>And celebrity is a theme explored in the segment headlined by Roberto Benigni, who plays an everyday, average Joe, leading an unspectacular life, until he finds himself suddenly, and inexplicably, thrust into the limelight of celebrity, living it up, and lapping at all the attention showered upon him. In some ways this is quite the surreal story arc that doesn't really fit too well with the others, since it's fantastical, but has a degree of examination into how fleeting fame can be, and how fickle are those who put you on a pedestal, only for it to be yanked away once someone else rolls along who provides a different, more popular appeal. It's easy come, and easy go.<br/><br/>The fantastical also had a place in the final story arc, that deals with reminiscence and memory, reliving one's regrets. Alec Baldwin stars as a famous architect who may have sold out in his trade, and is in Rome on vacation, trying to retrace the familiar locales he had once come across. He meets Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), an architect student who is living with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), whose best friend Monica (Ellen Page) is also bunking in on a post-breakup vacation. The three way relationship between Jack, Sally and Monica is what makes this particular arc stand out, dealing with how sometimes we get enamored by another, and are willing to risk it all to try and make things work, but sometimes reality and expectation are moving in vastly different directions, despite warning sites that we may choose to ignore, and are most likely ignoring.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast should just about excite any moviegoer to give this Allen movie a go, and to watch how he weaves the narrative in and around the different stories so effortlessly. At the same time, he creates a character out of Rome, that goes beyond the usual sights and sounds of the city all captured into more than just a background for this film, drawing a fine balance to prevent going overboard with the very touristy moments. It's pretty amazing how Allen has a knack in crafting all the characters for the film, since it is no mean feat to have them all distinct, with purpose.<br/><br/>One should expect the usual from a Woody Allen movie, and To Rome With Love bears all the usual hallmarks of the director, as he celebrates Rome's allure. Recommended!"
"EephusPitch","6","1","3","4 July 2012"," When in Rome...
","A slight, fitfully amusing collection of thematically linked but otherwise unconnected vignettes, all taking place in Rome. The highlights were the casting of Judy Davis, the perfect Woody actress; the story of the mortician who would rival Domingo, if allowed to sing in the shower; and the city of Rome itself, which is pretty damned gorgeous. Most of the segments are intermittently amusing, but more than anything else this reads like a collection of Woody's prose, brought to screen, which he accomplished with much greater success in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY. Altogether, a good reason to avoid 4th of July lunacy, but certainly not a great film."

","Weak, and quite silly. Probably Woody Allen's worst movie. <br/><br/>The stories were mostly incoherent, and farcical. The only one which was meaningful was the Roberto Benigni one, with its examination of everyone having their 15 minutes of fame plus stardom, it's perks, downsides, superficiality and fleetingness. Others are mostly quite dull and meaningless, though they all have their moments.<br/><br/>All-star cast does the best it can with the rambling script. Penelope Cruz was the stand-out, and not necessarily for her performance (that red dress...).<br/><br/>Setting is amazing, of course. However, this is possibly a smokescreen on Woody Allen's part.

","Sorry for throwing another stone, as others have done before me, but they are right!It's hard to believe that Woddy Allen did not realize what a boring film this has become. Just putting a lot of famous faces before a camera is not enough. Alac Baldwin for example has almost nothing to do but look and giving some advises to Jesse Eisenberg that are so unconvincing one thinks he just wandered onto the set and Allen out of the blue gave him some lines to say. We have seen other weak products by Mr. Allen but usually the had some merits to cling to. Here I only looked at my watch hoping time would go by faster. The film feels like someone stole the first draft and executed it without any changes. The jokes are old, lifted from other (better) movies or simply predictable. What a waste of actors!

","One of Woody Allen's easily disposable movies, full of half-baked ideas and a bunch of story lines, none of which is interesting enough, either dramatically or comedically, to hold your interest.<br/><br/>The best part of the film, other than its gorgeous Italian setting, is the presence of Allen himself and that of one of his regulars, Judy Davis. Any time the film veered away from them, I sat impatiently waiting for their return, despite the fact that the film gives these two actors, both so talented at being funny, absolutely nothing funny to do. But the film doesn't give any of its cast -- which includes Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz -- anything to do either, so Davis certainly shouldn't take it personally. She just landed herself in one of Allen's stinkers. Too bad she couldn't have gotten a part in ""Blue Jasmine,"" a film that reminded me why I return to Allen again and again despite his tendency to make three terrible movies for every good one.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

"jjedif","6","1","4","14 July 2012"," The whole is better than the parts.
","Moving back and forth between four intertwined vignettes, Allen gives us his views on how Fate influences Fame, Love, Marriageand Fame.<br/><br/>In the vignette featuring internationally-known actor and comedian Roberto Benigni (""Life is Beautiful""), Allen ridicules the capriciousness of meaningless fame promoted by the media. I was immediately reminded of Eça de Queiroz's ""The City and the Mountains"" (1902). A ticker tape machine inside the main character's ultramodern home in Paris spits out the following information: ""the Russian frigate Azoff has entered Marseilles after a mechanical failure"". The character immediately hangs up the phone and rushes over to read the ticker tape, and a friend asks the main character if the Azoff's problem affects him directly. He answers: ""Does it affect me? No, it's a news item."" In fact, it's a completely meaningless event that the news media has chosen to make into its story of the day. However, the vignette itself is as ridiculous as the new media it parodies. Although I loved Roberto Benigni in ""Down by Law"" (1986) (Allen's movie borrows from director Jim Jarmusch's style), I found this vignette to be the weakest of the four. But if you like Roberto Benigni channeling Jerry Lewis, you might like it.<br/><br/>A second vignette features a young Italian couple that has just arrived in Rome from the country, where their extended family has offered to set the young man up in a good job. Then by mistake or fate, Penelope Cruz enters the couple's life. This vignette is only slightly less weak than the one above. It just wasn't all that funny nor was it in any way original; Penelope Cruz is merely channeling her crazy Maria Elena character from Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" There is a third vignette featuring the ghost-like Alec Baldwin (it's not clear if he's a real person, or a ghost, or both) unsuccessfully and ironically trying to help Jesse Eisenberg avoid an inescapable mistake imposed by fate. Just as Charlie Sheen was obviously playing himself in his hit series ""Two and a Half Men"", Alec Baldwin is obviously channeling Alec Baldwin although officially Alec Baldwin isn't ""Alec Baldwin"" in the movie. If you like ""30 Rock"", you'll like this vignette.<br/><br/>Finally, the strongest vignette oddly enough is the one that features Woody Allen and Italian tenor Fabio Armiliato. Yes, Woody Allen is channeling a Woody Allen-type character and isn't that good. But this particular vignette does have the best set of characters of any of the fourand it is a good critique of the ""America's Got Talent"" mentality juxtaposed against Allen's ""you have to risk (and experience) failure and derision to be true to yourself"" philosophy.<br/><br/>*I* had to go because my wife loves Woody Allen movies and Rome (she gave the film an ""okay""; not as good as ""Midnight in Paris""), so I get point for taking her to the movies. If you want to see what Rome is like before you go, definitely go see the film; the cinematography is very good, and it definitely makes Rome seem like a charming place worth visiting. And since modern Italian films and TV are pretty terrible (yes, mostly much, much worse than US films and TV), it may be your only chance to see Italian actors (who *aren't* all terrible) in a movie or program that is NOT terrible.

","As far as I'm concerned, this was one of Woody Allen's best pictures in years.<br/><br/>It deals with Romans and Americans caught up in a variety of situations in the eternal city.<br/><br/>Not only is their hilarity but we can actually make sense out of how these people get away from these confronting situations to lead a normal life.<br/><br/>From the plain couple who run into a prostitute, a movie actor and burglar, these situations shall only reinforce their love. To the hilarity of the Allen character discovering that his daughter's future father-in-law sings opera beautifully provided that he's in a shower and how that is handled is an utter joy to watch. How the young man discovers love with his girlfriend's best friend is amazing and how he reconciles with his girlfriend is pure Hollywood gold.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin serves as a mentor to Jesse Eisenberg. Judy Davis, who plays Allen's psychiatrist wife looks more and more like the late Geraldine Page. If ever they make Page's biography, she should definitely have the lead role.<br/><br/>Roberto Benigni is as clever as ever as the common man whose opinions are suddenly valued. When his fleeting fame ends, he longs for it.<br/><br/>This is a real crowd pleaser of a film."

","The genius is back for another spin around life's simple things. Woody Allen is, as I have mentioned before, one of my favorite directors for his smart way of tackling any subject and making it a pleasure to watch. <br/><br/>""To Rome With Love"" offers not only a stroll through the wonderful city and it's amazingly beautiful spots, but also a very funny comedy of customs and delightful insights. Life itself is a spring of inspirational cues and Allen knows exactly where to step in and make the experience an intelligent ride. Fame and fortune, social concerns and the nonsensical effect of silly preoccupation about things that do not deserve the least of consideration are packed in this Italian adventure that entertains without any serious impact or damage. It's simply a lot of fun."

","In ""To Rome With Love"" Woody Allen weaves 4 story lines around our obsession with celebrities. It's not captivating like last year's ""Midnight In Paris"" but it's Woody Allen so it's smart, funny and a nice piece of entertainment that should please most people. And the charming Roman scenery doesn't hurt either. Allen appears in one segment as a guy who isn't comfortable with his future son-in-law's leftist views. He's also a talent agent who can't resist one more shot at making a star despite the bizarre lengths he's forced to go through to bring it to fruition. Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as a successful architect who becomes a mentor and adviser to Jesse Eisenberg who falls for an out-of-work actress (Ellen Page) who may only see him as a temporary diversion between acting gigs. Roberto Benigni is delightful as a clerk who awakens one day to the relentless pursuit of reporters and paparazzi hanging on his every syllable. Finally there's a couple that get separated and end up in farcical situations involving a prostitute wonderfully played by Penelope Cruz and an Italian film star (Antonio Albanese)."

Couldn't help but think about Silvio Berlusconi's contribution to the arts in Italy as I watched. Allen and Davis are a great sparring pair and have a chemistry that complements the other. Allen seemed to ""read the lines"" rather than act them, and Davis appeared to ""live the lines"" as if she had been married to him for decades.

Only problem is the dad only sounds good in the shower, so some how we see him on stage in operas, singing while in a a make-shift shower. So silly. The only good story was the guy whom has a prostitute show up and she's seen by his family, so he pretends she is the girlfriend. They go to this high society party, and a lot of her clients are there. Then the last one involves college students.

","Writer-director Woody Allen not only continues to make a movie almost every year, but also continues his European exploration genre of films with his latest movie, ""To Rome with Love"", which even though it didn't have the same taste and wonder found in ""Midnight in Paris"" or ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", it's still a decent and enjoyable motion picture from Woody Allen. Set as an ensemble motion picture, ""To Rome with Love"" follows the paths of different story lines, all going back and forth with one another. There are so many story lines, that it's kind of difficult to keep up with them, all in one time. You seem to forget one storyline, then it leads to another, and then you go back to the one you forgot about, and you realize that it was still in the movie to begin with. But at least Woody Allen peppers those story lines with great performances, great writing, and good precision. Even if the movie kind of felt too long in the process. In one storyline, Jesse Eisenberg suddenly falls for his girlfriend's exotic best friend, played by Ellen Page, while the hilarious Alec Baldwin tries to persuade Eisenberg that it just might not work. Also, the very iconic Roberto Benigni returns on the screen, who becomes famous for no exact reason. Penelope Cruz stars in her second film with Allen, as she plays a prostitute who has been asked to fill in as a lawyer's wife. Then, there's the one and only Woody Allen in a very hilarious performance as the wise, fast-talking, and often awkward man who tries to take the father of his daughter's fiancée, and turn him into a great opera star. Some stories are entertaining, while others just flat-out don't even matter. I will say that I was a little disappointed by this movie, but at least I wasn't overall. I still seemed to enjoy the experience of that movie. The writing is top-notch, the acting is brilliant, the sights of Rome look beautiful this time of year, and the music is just gorgeous. But there's really not a lot of something else to make this movie brilliant. This movie still had something missing, which I wasn't found impressed by. Even though ""To Rome with Love"" isn't one of Woody Allen's finest masterpieces in a while, I will say it's perhaps a rather decent one! ""To Rome with Love"", in my review, ""earnest and decent, but nothing remarkable""."

","""If you stop a hundred Romans, they'll tell you: I could give you a million stories."" Woody Allen's production notes <br/><br/>Rome has always been more hectic and less romantic than Paris to me but with equally competing foods and women. Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is more romantic and humorous than To Rome with Love. The latter is flat by comparison, a picture post card of four vignettes rather than a short story with heft. After all, he opens it with Volare, hardly his usually sophisticated jazz and much too pop for a mature director/writer.<br/><br/>Although I loved seeing Woody as a retired, avant-garde producer of operas, grousing in his usual way about the world's annoyances such as airline discomfort, the rest of the story, which involves instances of Seventh Commandment violations along with the illusions of celebrity, is generally dull and will be unprofitable for the Woodman: ""You're famous for being famous"" is one person's answer to why the negligible Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) is besieged by reporters. It's Woody's weak interpretation of a major theme. Oh, well.<br/><br/>With a writing Oscar for Midnight, Woody should have had better dialogue. Not to be. Yet even setups like the mortician who can sing glorious opera only when he is in the shower lead Woody to opera scenes that bore after the first splash of shower (the allusion to Woody's own successful staging of Puccini's Gianni Schicchi makes this sequence even more painful by contrast).<br/><br/>A minor delight is Alec Baldwin as John, an architect, who acts as a Greek chorus for a young Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) about to compromise his relationship with Sally (Greta Gerwig) for her friend, Monica (Ellen Page). John's ironic admonitions about Jack's foolishness (heard and seen at times by only Jack—think Bogart in Play It Again, Sam) are spot-on, e.g., calling Monica ""a self-absorbed pseudo-intellectual."" Not enough Baldwin, however, to save the film.<br/><br/>After all the infidelity the Eternal City induces on visitors and locals alike, the film becomes just postcards of famous places like the Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps, places that become a cliché like this film."

Four fairly insubstantial tales are told alongside each other and some work well enough and others not. The loose remake of Fellini's The White Sheik is very well done and Penelope Cruz gives it her all. The most successful segment is probably that with Alec Baldwin and the beguiling Ellen Page. It is probably the most recognisable picture of Woody Allen and his foibles although he himself is in a less good section with the singer in the shower elevated to operatic stardom - this one joke piece soon wears thin. Similarly thin is the section featuring the most unlikeable Roberto Benigni who seems to be thrust into fame, becomes anxious to get out of the reach of the paparazzi, then to get back in again. A confusing and seemingly grossly over acted piece that is somewhat lost on me because of a lack of subtitles. My print was of Italian origin and featured 'original dialogue'. Unfortunately although there is much English and Italian spoken, I can only assume that where this ever showed in an English speaking country, the Italian would have been subtitled.

","I give the movie 9 out of 10 - for the cute Italian actress, the beautiful Roman scenery and the helpful, rather unsubtle warning that a relationship with a Hollywood actress is a thing better left alone. However, I give this movie one complete point of deduction for being, in my humble opinion, utter rubbish! Just Because Mr. Woody Allen is confused and clearly overburdened by the task of finding a meaning to life, does not mean that he has to torture his audience as well with his lack of purpose. I don't know, perhaps in America Mr. Woody Allen is beyond criticism, and therefore the American audience and his peers regard his work as brilliant no matter how bad it is. Regardless how many movie stars you put into a production, the film remains bad, if the script is bad. This being said, I do admit there was a kind of genius in some of the sub-plots of the movie - you just had to dig very deep to find it, below all the layers of rubbish covering it. So my advice to Mr. Woody Allen is this: You can do better! Just keep it real - less madness and more realism!"

I gave the stars to the story which is at least well paced, a bit cliché too but also ""cinema"" which means dreaming and caricature but above all for the beautiful images of the city of Rome which for me is really (as a tourist) the most beautiful city in the world.

The screenplay is just purely stupid for me, particularly with all those stupid twists within each of the sub-stories.

","I like a movie that lets you explore the beautiful sights of a place. In this particular movie, it was Rome (duh). If you have seen Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, then you'll surely like To Rome With Love which also happens to have Woody Allen in it. The only difference is the latter movie revolves around multiple stories.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I disliked about the movie, it's the fact that it's inconsistent with time. Some of the stories occur in just one day while others occur in a series of days. It's a bit confusing. I still loved the stories especially the one with Leopoldo Pisanelli. It reminds me of how fleeting moments can be especially if you're a celebrity. One moment, you are tinseltown's hot topic, with people asking you the silliest questions because then again, you are famous and everything you say is gold for these people. The next thing you know, nobody's paying attention anymore because everyone's moved on to the next person. It's no wonder why celebrities try so hard to do anything that brings attention to them.<br/><br/>I also liked the story of the couples who came from a small town. They're the conservative type but after a day of being accidentally separated, they become very different. The meek husband gets lessons from a prostitute and the wife releases all of her inhibitions by agreeing to sleep with a criminal. Those encounters help them discover something within themselves that will most likely help them improve what seems like a boring marriage that they have.<br/><br/>Lastly, Ellen Paige's character at first seems pretty charming. Greta Gerwig's character is obviously right for feeling insecure and fearing that her boyfriend might fall in love with her. Monica, (Ellen Paige's character) is passionate, sexual, cultured and adventurous. Or so it seems. Just the type of girl any young guy in his 20's would fall for.<br/><br/>Spoiler: I was so happy when she and Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) didn't end up together. She would have been a big mistake. With her haste decision to go to Japan after accepting a movie role, there was no way their relationship would ever work."

","I saw a two-part documentary on Woody Allen a few months ago. At one point during the documentary, he pulls out a box filled with bits of paper and he says something to the effect that he is constantly writing ideas down on pieces of paper. From those pieces of paper he creates his scripts. I thought he meant that an idea then comes to fruition from the musings he has gathered. In To Rome with Love, it appears that he just reached his boney hand int0 the box, pulled out six or seven pieces of paper, and wrote six or seven separate little silly stories with the ideas from each.<br/><br/>There is no plot, just a series of conversations that speak to some neurosis of Woody's that must have been bothering him when he was working on the script.<br/><br/>There is no editing. There are no segues between scenes. Just a choppy sea that bounces us around on top of waves that randomly hit the bow.<br/><br/>There are just a series of scenes set in lovely Rome (which made me want to visit again; I haven't been there in ten years) that have no relationship to each other, and frankly, it is Woody Allen at his laziest. I have already determined that Woody Allen is a lazy writer and director. He mentioned in an interview that he's fast and on budget because he has other things he likes to do, other interests in his life, and thus has no desire to spend more time than he has to on the set. He is notorious for giving little direction, for not providing much input to enable actors to see his vision. Actors speak of this tendency with reverence as if no direction makes him a great director. Huh? I believe his technique of inserting actors into scenes as teachers of the scene's point is lazy too. He doesn't have to show us the way to anything, he just sticks someone into the scene who has no business being there to tell us what we are supposed to surmise from the action around it. That's Alec Baldwin's job in To Rome with Love, and he does it well. And the message he's giving us is so ""Baldwin"" that you are willing to sit and nod in agreement. Juliet Taylor is also well cast. But as a woman, the entire vignette about Monica, the manipulative, deceitful, seductress of the innocent, and Jack, who never had a prayer of escaping her black widow's web, makes me furious. And I think Woody thinks that way. He's just an innocent guy who has been made out to be the bad guy by women who always planned to destroy him Enough about Woody's personal life. Back to his lazy professional life. Looking back, I've decided he was lazy in Midnight in Paris too. He brought in all kinds of literary giants from another era, but he presented them in shallow characterizations, rather than doing some homework and really having them respond as they might have to some of the questions Gil could have asked them. Instead, they just showed up and bantered in a shallow, one-liner sort of way. It could have been truly thought provoking and unique if they had responded to questions about present-day intellectual challenges.<br/><br/>The last scene is worth the trip. ""Volare"" played by a brass and string band on the Spanish Steps is marvelous. I hummed it all the way home, much to the chagrin of my aunt and cousin, who attended the movie with me. But why not? I would have loved to have been there in the dark when they were filming it. No one around. The middle of the night. ""Volare"" wafting into the night. A little whimsy is a good thing.<br/><br/>I may be done with Woody Allen. I have said it before, but maybe this time I mean it. Work a little harder Woody, and quit resting on your laurels. Your sharp wit and pathetic neurosis are getting as old as you apparently feel."

","Woody Allen's best film in many years, Midnight in Paris, wasn't really about a great city, it was about the dream of a great city, one seen through the eyes of a perennial college student turned screenwriter whose read the all the books on the reading list, and has had the usual pre-programmed insights. The charm of it is that Woody, now in his late seventies but still the eternal NYU sophomore, can laugh at himself and all his literary pretensions. The trouble with To Rome with Love, however, is that it is not a dream film, but one that pretends to have some deeper insight into the intertwining lives of American living in Rome and their Italian counterparts, but, sad to say, there is no depth whatsoever. Woody is apparently incapable of observing the real world anymore, other than through the double-glazed windows of a 5 star hotel, and if he goes down into the streets, as this film forces him to do, all he seems capable of doing is looking around quickly, buying a few picture postcards, and recycling old Italian films. One of the four plots of this film, the young couple from the Italian provinces, is an embarrassing rip-off of the plot of one of Fellini's earliest films, the 1952 Lo Sceicco Bianco (The White Sheik). If it is meant as a homage to a fellow director, it is a shallow one indeed. The young American actors, fine as they are, are asked to play very tedious characters. They all seem like graduate students trying too hard to learn about life and failing. As for the others, Penelope Cruz is busty and sexy—not much of a stretch--and Robert Begnini underplays a one-joke idea about celebrity, which he does, surprisingly, without his usual zaniness. (That's like casting Jerry Lewis as Prospero.) Judi Davis, of all people, has somehow inherited the part of the typically castrating New York wife, a character who surfaces in many of Allen's films; she's an odd combination of two of the women in Woody's life: Diane Keaton in her quirkiness and Louse Lasser in her kvetchiness. (A remarkable feat for an Aussie, I might add.) Woody himself wanders in and out of his own film, as if he is the wrong place at the wrong time. The Bob Hope jokes and wisecracks, once his trademark, now fall flat. He plays an old man, but he is an old man, all the zest that once was so charming is gone. This is a very bad film from a great director. Perhaps it's time for Woody to stop making one film and year."

The large ensemble cast is headed by a few name stars, among them Alec Baldwin, Roberto Begnigni, Penelope Cruz and Judy Davis. The storyboard seems more French than Italian art film because Woody, himself plays the generic, mature French art film male physical comic, an at first normal seeming business or professional man who soon envelopes the whole cast in chaos as he breaks out out in uncontrollable body twitches, inappropriate insults out of nowhere, impossible dreams and whatever classic French comic heroes puff up to to make their character a nut case. The French art film mode is continued by the most alluring women in the cast photographed in scenes of particular romantic allure. It becomes more typical Italian art film when most masculine guys are filmed looking embarrassed while, although ""displaying nothing"", photographed in a waist wrap towel or boxer style underpants.

I would prefer that either he finally explores USA beyond New York including older characters, or at least - moves action to more original foreign places. As it is now his choice of classic European cities makes his last movies more like tourist folders for cruises. And plot definitely would gain with less characters. The movie could be better, in my opinion if the plot had concentrated only on the clerk who became a celebrity for one day played by excellent Roberto Benigni. He was the best actor playing the most original character - sort of Buster Keaton of our times - trying hard to be a proper member of society but having too many hidden quirks which makes him a very fascinating comedic personality. He certainly was much more interesting and realistic actor than other members of the cast - all acting in the same ""Woody Allen"" manner which after seeing so much of it becomes a little tired. Not to mention that they all speak in a similar fashion which is a big mistake of any script (as a rule people talk differently). The idea of instant celebrity would be enough to build the whole movie around it as a comment on our world - a bit of reality which so often is missing in movies of the director. There is still plenty of imagination left in Woody Allen to try something completely different."

","...and this is from a Woody Allen fan. I get the fact that people get famous for being famous and that Rome is a beautiful city. I now also get that either all these actors cannot act or that Mr. Allen has lost touch with writing and directing. Watch ""Midnight in Paris"",""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters""; but don't waste your time with this film. Mr. Baldwin was good as the ""conscious for Mr. Eisenberg but the other players were either flat or overboard. If that was the point it did not play well. The story is contrived and too cutesy to be either believable or a fantasy. Even the ""little"" plot twists were very predictable. A rating of 4 is generous."
"DegustateurDeChocolat","6","0","1","21 April 2013"," Portrait of a fairy tale Rome
","I was very curious of watching this movie and how Woody Allen would have portrayed Rome and I must say I was hugely disappointed. Allen depicts a fairy tale Rome with unrealistic clean streets of the working class Trastevere neighborhood and with an unrealistic color of the picture which gives the idea of being in some wonderland. Another example of how Allen has a strange idea of Italy and its inhabitants is how the couple Milly and Antonio, coming from a provincial life, are dressed, which is with clothes youngsters would have wore in the 50s. It's clear by some scenes of the movie how the director wanted to deliver his homage to Rome and to Fellini, but he totally misses the soul and the essence of the eternal city. After watching this movie I wonder if Woody Allen's recent previous movies, set in European cities, which I was pretty pleased with, had the same effect on the inhabitants of the concerned cities as ""To Rome with Love"" had on me. However I give this movie a 6 because I found Allen's jokes funny and the scenes of Giancarlo, the aspiring Tenor, performing in the shower very amusing."
"cnycitylady","4","0","2","15 February 2013"," Woody Allen, where'd you go?
","This is probably one of the worst Woody Allen films made to date. This movie lacks all of the quirky, weird and generally unique sensibilities that make a Woody Allen movie a Woody Allen movie.<br/><br/>The characters are all under-developed, and un-relatable; Their corresponding plots are either predictable or just incomprehensible. An example of this would be the plot line to Jesse Eisenberg's story; while watching you know that it won't work out between himself and Ellen Page. She's too flighty for a sensible man such as he, and what was up with Alec Baldwin always hanging about them? He was with them for days, was Jesse Eisenberg's character imagining him, was Alec Baldwin reminiscing? What the heck was all of that about? And what was with that average Joe all of a sudden famous, and then not famous? <br/><br/>The story lines were just all over the place. He lacked solid ideas, and the few that he had were not elaborated upon to actually produce something worth watching, and the fact that the movie is just under two hours doesn't help its case. There is nothing in this movie that makes you want to sit through it for longer than you have to, and when it passes the ninety minute mark, it's longer than you have to.<br/><br/>Now I don't think that this movie was all bad--just mostly bad; mainly bad. There were a few laughs, but they weren't of the odd joke or Woody Allen kind. They were simple, plain jokes that usually have no business in a Woody Allen movie. And I feel that if some of the storyline's were given an entire movie length, say about ninety minutes, then they would have had something to go on, but condensed to about half an hour each and scattered in-between the other stories just hurt what little they had to give in the first place.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a tedious viewing and not at all worth watching for substance. Perhaps if you are looking for something to watch to kill time you can allow it to play, but other than that I would pass over it to watch one of the more classic Woody Allen films such as Annie Hall, Match Point or Midnight in Paris."

","I am very selective in watching movies by and with Woody Allen, I am no loyal admirer of him. His plots are uneven and dragging, and the characters performed by him are almost lookalikes - irrespective with topic, age, era etc. But this time I was eager to see how the event fit into The Eternal City - Rome, which I have visited several times.<br/><br/>And I had my joy of recognition from the very beginning, and soon several witty and versatile events began to develop, making me giggle from time to time as there are many funny lines and scenes. Typical to Allen, there are lots of confusions, multi-levels and reasonings, but as the movie lasts a bit over 1,5h, they did not become boring. The cast is also interesting, but uneven: great performances were carried out by Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Roberto Benigni... The rest - and especially other actors from Italy - were not catchy. As the city of Rome is the major supporting actor, I cannot imagine how this movie would be comprehended without prior visiting - probably not so much.<br/><br/>To Rome with Love is a quality entertainment, but definitely not among the best works by Allen. On the other hand, I can't see why his fans could get disappointed; so, you have been warned! :)"

","Back in 2011; a screenwriter named Gil Pander traveled back in time to the roaring 1920s of Paris, and mingled with literary greats in nostalgic fantasy Midnight In Paris. Last year, an entourage of whimsical characters plucked from the same vivid imagination make their way to Rome. And therein lies the structural spine of Woody Allen's latest film, To Rome With Love.<br/><br/>Four stories unfold simultaneously in this romantic comedy: a mortician discovers his vocal talent in the shower, a young architect is tempted by his SO's salacious best friend, a pair of newlywed's find themselves entangled in sexual exploits, an office clerk awakens to find himself catapulted to overnight fame.<br/><br/>In one particular vignette; American girl next door Hayley spends her summer holiday in Rome and falls in love with lawyer, Michelangelo, in a typical tourist-meets-local encounter. The couple's spur of the moment decision to wed brings forth the arrival of Hayley's retired parents, Jerry and Phyllis--a cynical opera director and his incisive psychiatrist wife.<br/><br/>During a get-together hosted by the Italians; Jerry discovers that Michelangelo's father Giancarlo possesses a soprano voice fit to sing Pagliacci in the Vienna Opera House. Plausibly driven by resentment towards retirement--Jerry promptly takes it upon himself to unveil this extraordinary find to the rest of the musical world.<br/><br/>At one point; after Giancarlo's live performance involving stage lighting and a portable shower box, Jerry declares that he is one to ""think outside the box"". To which Phyllis tiredly laments (in Allen's archetypal neurotic fashion) ""You equate retirement with death. Giancarlo is an undertaker. He puts people in boxes and you want to think outside the box.""<br/><br/>*cue snort*<br/><br/>Classical plot structures often take the form of a journey, an escape or a search. With regards to this virtuoso of expressive cinema; Woody Allen's Jerry is fleeing from an invisible, allegorical enemy. Subject matters of doomed love, sex and death have always been dominant themes in Allen's works; provoking the kind of painfully self-aware and deadpan humor unique to his stylistic neurosis. To Rome With Love is no different from those pieces. And audiences familiar with the menagerie of characters as real as Allen's dramatic concerns will delight in this film. <br/><br/>It has been many years since Woody Allen graced the silver screen--that our favorite skeptic exits hiatus in his forty-fourth feature is a rare event to be relished by fans.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"
"cosmo_tiger","6","0","1","14 January 2013"," A typical Woody Allen type comedy. Four major story lines going on. If you like his style you will like this movie. I say B-
","""In this city all is a story."" Much like any Woody Allen movie this movie has multiple story lines. A man trying to revisit his past in the city he grew up in. A newlywed couple having troubles during their honeymoon. A semi-retired opera producer trying to find the next big star and a man who gets what he wants, only to find out the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is true. There isn't much to say about this movie to convince you to watch or not watch. This is a Woody Allen movie and he has a built in audience already. On the other hand he also has a real style that turns people off and they won't watch because it is a Woody Allen movie. I thought this was OK and I am not a Allen fan at all. I really liked his last movie (Midnight In Paris) but this one was more of his older style and more quirky and I just don't like his style of humor. Also just as a heads up half the movie is in Italian with subtitles (in case that bothers you). I thought the movie is OK but definitely Woody's style of comedy. Overall, if you like Woody Allen you will like this movie, if not you may not. I give it a B-."
"strasnov","7","0","3","16 October 2012"," Decent homage to the city of Rome
","To me ""To Rome with Love"" is a movie full of perceptions. It is a Woody Allen's tribute to the city in which Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni created their masterpiece ""La Dolce Vita"". Roberto Benigni character fully represents that with paparazzi chasing him around asking the most banal questions and hanging tight on each - even more banal - answer. In a way it is a reflection of our society and its obsession with celebrities; about how our vain we are and what happens to those celebrities suddenly taken out of the public spotlight (Lindsay Lohen meltdown anyone?) as our interests evaporate while we shift our attention elsewhere to another meaningless ""famous"" person...<br/><br/>It is also an older Woody Allen's funny perception of women (Alec Baldwin character); with display of what he portrays to be their cunningness compared to what he might have consider to be ""romanticism"" in his younger years. I said it was ""funny"" because I'm a guy so as you can see ladies I'm clearly biased :)<br/><br/>Finally you find some laughs as well in the character being played by Woody Allen himself and his dealings with Italian family his daughter is getting married into.<br/><br/>The movie by no means reaches the heights of ""Midnight in Paris"" but it is not (as some others have claimed) the worst movie Allen's ever made. It is a solid effort in a tough task of paying a homage to the city of Rome."
"dario_malic","6","0","2","7 September 2012"," The Eternal Woody
","Woody Allen's latest movie, ""To Rome With Love"", continues his tour around Europe (London, Barcelona, Paris) bringing us to the capital of Italy, The Eternal City. It's envisioned as a collage of four separate stories taking place in Rome. The themes which the stories explore are classical Woody. Love, fame, culture, sex, art, fear of death, insecurity and lots more. The problem is, although nearly every Allen's movie tells the same (or similar) story, they're not all equally good. And this one isn't one of his better works.<br/><br/>The main problem I found with it was a lack of coherence. Allen jumps from story to story seemingly without any plan or structure and, as if that wasn't enough, some stories seem to unfold over a period of a week or so while other take place during one day. It gives the impression that Woody didn't care enough to put it all together in some logical way and that's disappointing. Add to that some uninspired acting (bigger part of the cast and this time even Woody himself), unsuccessful recycling of his previous work (Woody again, that is, his character) and a sketch-like feel of the movie, and you could think Allen' s time has passed.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie has its bright spots too. A sketch with a man who can only sing under the shower turns out to be hilarious when his son's father in law Jerry (Allen) puts on a version of ""Pagliacci"" with a shower cabin in the center of the stage. One more thing which should be noted about that segment is Judy Davis playing Jerry's wife. It's been a while since she starred in an Allen movie (almost fifteen years) and she's great fun to watch here so I hope we'll see her again soon. There's also Penelope Cruz, whom it's always nice to see, playing a prostitute teaching a young provincial boy a trick or two and improving what is one of weaker movie segments along the way (although not considerably). But the best acting is seen in the only segment which feels like it has a story. Jesse Eisenberg plays a young architect living in Rome with his girlfriend but slowly falling for her friend played by Ellen Page. There's also Alec Baldwin in a now I'm here/now I'm not/am I even real? kind of role, but I'm gonna leave that one for you to figure out. Eisenberg and Page are fantastic. They both play more or less typical Allen's characters but this time those characters are unusually young which makes them even more interesting. Jack (Eisenberg) falls for Monica (Page) even though he knows he can't have a serious relationship with her and gets swept off his feet with her smart remarks and quotations although he knows she's a fake (or, as Allen wonderfully put it, a con artist). Monica (who's an actress) on the other hand seems to fake everything but does it with so much sincerity that you can't help getting intrigued by her, and the credit for that goes to Page.<br/><br/>In Allen's latest movies cities turn out to be one of the main characters and I expected that here too, but didn't get it (I don't know if it was supposed to be that way at all though). There are few sightseeing shots but for most of the movie you couldn't say if it is happening in Rome or any other Mediterranean city, which suggests that the movie didn't live up to it's title. Nevertheless, it seems the combination of Woody Allen and Europe simply can't completely fail. The movie has its charm, not diminished by any of its flaws, and is pleasant to watch. But why am I writing so much? In my experience there are two groups of people, those who love Woody Allen and those who don't. The second ones probably won't bother to read about an Allen movie, and those belonging to the first group know they're gonna watch every new Woody Allen movie no matter what. And that's perhaps Allen's greatest accomplishment.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"
"nick.johnson","3","0","6","13 July 2012"," Beautiful and Awful
","Four interweaving and completely independent story lines: 2 of them all in Italian, 1 all in English, 1 mixed language, all featuring gorgeous scenery, but dreadfully written. Two of them were, as others have said here, one joke premises with zero payoff (the one with Roberto Benigni and the one with Woody Allen). The only time I even chuckled in the whole movie was when the lost Italian women was trying to get directions from strangers on the street (""go the next road over, take it down to where it ends at the fish restaurant, you can't miss it, turn right there over the bridge, go past the stairs then take the next two lefts and it's on your right"", etc.). Alec Baldwin's character had some witty lines, but his capricious presence/absence in that story line was so confusing it was hard to appreciate anything he said.<br/><br/>I guess it doesn't bother me when the dialogue is funny, but when it's not I find it very annoying how many of the characters in Woody Allen's movies seem to be doing an impression of him constantly (in addition to Woody being himself on screen in this one). <br/><br/>So many of Allen's movies portray (often multiple) characters committing (and usually getting away with) adultery and/or murder that I don't think you could call it a spoiler to reveal that this movie is no exception. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's getting tiresome.<br/><br/>This is no ""Midnight in Paris."""

","TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) *** Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Alison Pill, Alessandra Mastronardi, Flavio Parenti, Alessandro Tiberi, Fabio Armliato. The Wood-man's travelogue to the Italian capital di amor is a mixed bag quartet of love stories involving: the filmmaker as a semi-retired opera director who makes a startling discovery in the form of his future in-law as a true find ala Caruso; Baldwin as an American actor abroad who acts as a Greek chorus to a young architect (Eisenberg) dealing with his wife Gerwig's oversexualized friend Paige (ridiculously and preciously miscast - all you JUNO haters are gonna loathe her here!); a young newlywed Italian couple accidentally separated with hot hooker Cruz involved and the absurd poke at celebrity when a mid-level Italian bureaucrat (shockingly low-key live-wire Beningi) finds himself the epitome of how media-crazed the world has become when he is the focus of the minutia of his meek life. Kudos to veteran lensman Dariu Khondji for the strikingly romantic cinematography craving you to book your next flight ASAP to Italia! Ciao!"
"don_p_clemenza","7","0","7","4 July 2012"," Enjoyable, but lacking
","Quite liked it, obviously not one of his better movies but even on a bad day I still think Allen does a better job with rom-coms than most other directors.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Allen return to the screen, still his neurotic old self and keeping the best jokes for himself too. Also, Alec Baldwin's pop-ups made me laugh often. The rest of the cast was fine: not irritating but not particularly memorable either.<br/><br/>The main problem I had was keeping up with the plots. The Italian and English mix was confusing at times, and certain plot elements were vague or undisclosed (like the ending of the storyline with Penelope Cruz, that ended quite abruptly) and left me wanting something more.<br/><br/>Also, the multiple plot lines resulted in quite a bit of rehashing. With this I mean the fact that there are basically 4 Woody Allen-ish characters (Allen himself, Eisenberg, Benigni and the Antonio character) which after a while started to annoy me, because it started feeling like I was watching 4 different episodes of a series at the same time, and not a particularly coherent series at that.<br/><br/>What possibly annoyed me even more though were the two ladies sitting next to me in the theater, who had probably never heard of Woody Allen before but felt inclined to both hum along to every song on the soundtrack that they knew, and to, whenever a famous Roman site was in a shot, meticulously recall what they did at that site during that one time they went to Rome. I actually think that sums up my idea of the film nicely: if you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll probably enjoy the film, but if you're not that fond of him, it's probably better to just buy a picture book about Rome and look at that."
