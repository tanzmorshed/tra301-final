","A down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, Max Biolystock (Zero Mostel), is reduced to funding his shows by romancing old ladies for cash. Enter neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), arriving at Biolystock's apartment to do his books. Upon discovering that Biolystock had extorted $2000.00 from his last Broadway flop, Bloom, simply on a whim, mentions to Biolystock that he could've made a fortune on the flop if he'd only gotten more money from the old ladies. Needless to say, this revelation gets Max's mind working---get the old ladies to invest $1,000,000 on what Biolystock knows will be a surefire flop, then run off with the excess cash! Max convinces the gullible Leo to join him on the scheme, and off the two men go, on a crusade to produce the biggest disaster Broadway has ever seen. They come across a god-awful work written by a former Nazi (Kenneth Mars) called ""Springtime For Hitler,"" and decide to produce it. If it's a flop, Max & Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit, they'll go to jail....<br/><br/>If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorching-hot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon, ""The Producers,"" there's always this, the original 1968 movie version to watch & enjoy. This Oscar-winner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic, and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece, a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel & Gene Wilder are hilarious & perfectly cast as the con-artist producers, with terrific chemistry between them (just their opening scene together, including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket, and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max, is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting). Kudos all around to the rest of the cast, too: Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of ""Springtime For Hitler,"" Christopher Hewett as the no-talent gay director who only makes ""Springtime"" even more misguided than it already is, Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D., the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler (his audition song, ""Love Power,"" is a major highlight), and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla, Max & Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the ""Springtime For Hitler"" production number itself---yes, it's everything you've ever heard about it, a wonderfully hysterical ""you gotta see it to believe it"" moment in film comedy.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks' direction is spot on, and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better (though his co-writing with Gene Wilder on ""Young Frankenstein"" comes close). His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved, indeed. ""The Producers"" is a timeless comedy classic, and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career."
"Doylenf","7","25","28","20 January 2007"," Zany Mel Brooks comedy is over-the-top laugh riot...
","There are so many laughs in THE PRODUCERS (long before Mel Brooks lost his magic touch), that you'll be in tears by the time Brooks gets to his ""Springtime for Hitler"" routine. ZERO MOSTEL's early scenes with ESTELLE WINWOOD are hilarious enough, but he and GENE WILDER top themselves by the time you get to the frantic ending.<br/><br/>LEE MEREDITH is the curvy Ulla who can shake a mean hip and DICK SHAWN is the hilariously daffy Lorenzo St. DuBois (LSD for short), and everyone in the cast has a fine time delivering over-the-top performances in the spirit in which this sort of satire requires.<br/><br/>The story is simply that of a producer running short on cash who devises a scheme whereby if he produces the worst musical in the world, he can actually get his investment back and then some. He convinces his mild-mannered bookkeeper GENE WILDER to join him in the scheme and then the fun gets off to a great start.<br/><br/>The climactic ""Springtime for Hitler"" is just one of the delirious highlights (if politically incorrect by today's standards), and is probably the reason so many of the comments here resent the film and everything it stands for. But there's no getting away from it--the script is downright brilliant and original--winning an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and numerous other writing awards including an award from The Writer's Guild of America.<br/><br/>Summing up: Mel Brooks at his wittiest."

","When you see a movie once and think it's hilarious, that's a good sign. When you see a movie about a half-dozen times and think it's still hilarious, that's more than a good sign. That means that not only can you put up with seeing it multiple times, but you also find new things that you didn't see before. Plus, there are some scenes that are too hilarious not to laugh at! The chemistry between stars doesn't hurt, either. What movie am I talking about? Mel Brooks' The Producers, his most sustained and inspired piece of lunacy!<br/><br/>Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel have amazing chemistry as meek accountant Leo Bloom and scheming Broadway producer Max Bialystock. Max seduces little old ladies for checks, and when Leo comes into his office one day, he finds that a producer can make more money with a flop instead of a hit. They decide to do his ploy, and create the world's worst play, Springtime for Hitler (a gay romp with Adolf and Eva), and meet interesting characters, including author Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), director Roger DeBris (Christopher Hewett), and their Hitler, Lorenzo St.DuBois, aka L.S.D. (Dick Shawn).<br/><br/>What makes this comedy such a gem is its mixture of types of comedy. There is slapstick, there's satire, there's bad taste, and everything but the kitchen sink! The scenes I have seen so many times, but what makes me love them is how they, mainly Wilder, play their roles. Wilder is somewhat crazy, and relies on his blanket to calm himself down. Not only does he have comic perfection, he's a darned good actor to boot! Mostel is great as the would-be sleazy loser-producer, with eye movements that put Silent Bob to shame and a great voice.<br/><br/>The songs in it are great, also. Two of them were written by Brooks himself, `Springtime for Hitler' (with which I have auditioned for a role in a musical with) and `Prisoners of Love'. They're both very funny (real Brooks-ian) (note to Merriam-Webster: include that word right next to `bling-bling'). It's not exactly a musical, but The Producers is in a class of its own. Long live The Producers!<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for bad taste and homosexual themes."
"lawprof","10","56","71","20 June 2004"," A Milestone in Film-making
","The DVD release of ""The Producers"" sends me every viewing back to 1968 when I first saw this brilliant, barrier-smashing comedy. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were the perfect pair to bring to life the adventures of a Broadway faded impresario, now a con man, and his neurotic, hyper, accountant accomplice.<br/><br/>Together they fleece old ladies, something Mostel's Max Bialystock was doing before the auditor, Max Bloom, came by to check the books. Mostel's seduction of the old, the awful and the ugly has no equal in movie physical comedy.<br/><br/>The scheme: put on the worst flop imaginable and when it closes virtually after opening night the two scammers snare riches: the investments they don't have to return. But if the show is a hit...<br/><br/>The producers' vehicle, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" both brought audiences to a new level of appreciation for the malleable, creative power of film and...it made some viewers genuinely nervous, even upset.<br/><br/>Following Steve Allen's observation that a formula for comedy based on history is Tragedy+Time, director Mel Brooks brought to the screen, less than a quarter century after World War II ended, Dick Shawn as a campy fuehrer surrounded by the Nazi counterpart of the Rockettes. And Max and Leo are clearly Jewish in character if not so openly identified.<br/><br/>Kenneth Mars grabs laughs as the author of ""Springtime for Hitler,"" an unreconstructed, Hitler-adoring flake who raises pigeons on the roof of a Manhattan tenement while accoutered in the odd leftovers of Wehrmacht uniforms.<br/><br/>When I fitted in seeing ""The Producers"" in its opening week I sat in the middle of an audience that was, to a certain extent, as befuddled as the film's playgoers watching the first part of the intended-to-outrage musical comedy about the Third Reich. Not only were SS uniforms, swastikas and photos of Hitler on the ""stage"" but the movie theater audience also digested, perhaps for the first time, a send-up of an uproarious gay couple, two real queens. One is effeminate to the core, the other is a cross-dresser (and a faultlessly garish one at that). This kind of stuff hadn't been done before in a Hollywood flick.<br/><br/>1968's audience had many who well-remembered World War II and some had fought in the conflict. I knew people who admitted feeling that the horrific global battle against Hitler had been trivialized by Brooks and his extroverted cast - until they could no longer hold back guffaws that segued rapidly into uncontrolled laughter.<br/><br/>That ""The Producers"" is also now a runaway Broadway hit is no surprise and I'd love to see a DVD release with Lane and Broderick. However fine they would be, it's the original that broke barriers. <br/><br/>The DVD has a number of worthwhile features including a fascinating ""Making of..."" segment. Peter Seller's short, famous encomium is read and there are the usual other additions. An outtake presenting an alternative blow-up of the ""Springtime for Hitler"" theater is interesting, largely because it shows how perceptive Brooks was in scrapping it for the shorter scene actually used.<br/><br/>""The Producers"" is, in some ways, a subversive movie. Without stridently proclaiming a new aesthetic, it is exactly that and so it's a timeless classic. This is not satire about Nazism, Hitler and the Third Reich. It's treating as suitable material for slapstick and quick gags the detritus of an evil time.<br/><br/>But it's also a bit dated, no subject is taboo today for comedic treatment, and many who see it for the first time (as my teenage son did tonight) will enjoy the movie without getting the full impact of its assault on conventionality.<br/><br/>Is there any historical topic that will not, in the passage of time, be employed for pure comedy? Is it possible that the next generation will laugh at a comedy parodying Auschwitz? I hope not but I also can't be sure.<br/><br/>Many years ago I refused to watch ""Hogan's Heroes"" on TV because I personally knew former U.S. POWs. But that show, with Werner Klemperer as Colonel Klink, was very popular. ""Hogan's Heroes"" was to TV what ""The Producers"" was, and is, to film. And both made a mark that will be emulated as future generations go beyond satire to humorous treatment of matters most today consider beyond the pale of acceptability as a vehicle for laughs.<br/><br/>10/10"
"CHARLIE-89","Null","8","8","6 February 1999"," Mel Brooks' Masterpiece
","THE PRODUCERS might just be the funniest film ever made. It stars Zero Mostel, as a bankrupt Broadway producer, and Gene Wilder, as his emotionally-retarded accountant. Together, they figure that they could actually make more money producing a flop than a hit, so they become producers and put on ""Springtime for Hitler,"" a sure-fire flop. However, things go horribly ""right,"" and soon the producers find themselves in a tight spot trying to repay their investors. It is not the flop they hoped for, and they wind up in jail, with a hilarious finale.<br/><br/>This is Mel Brooks' masterpiece. Brooks' won an Oscar for Best Screenplay-1968-no surprise,as this is as funny a film ever to be made!

","Mel brooks' first attempt at directing is this film "" The Producers, "" originally entitled ""Spring Time For Hitler."" It's the story of down and out producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), once known as the 'King of Broadway' who can't believe his incredible streak of bad luck. Once when the Moon of his Fortune rode high, he had Six shows running at once. However now-a-days he's so poor, he wears a Cardboard belt. Into his life arrives a timid little man named Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder). As an accountant, he makes a startling discovery. In his last play Max, raised more money to produce his show than he needed. As a result, Leo speculates Max could make more money with a flop, than with a hit. Max demands to know how and a crooked scheme develops. Max decides to find the worse play ever written. He will then hire the worse, director, the worse actors and then raise a $1,000.000 for a flop of a play which is sure to close the first night, allowing Max to keep all the rest of the money. This then is the plot and with Bloom becoming his partner, the pair plans on keeping the fortune. The movie which also casts Dick Shawn as 'L.S.D.' or Lorenzo St. DuBois, Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, Christopher Hewett and Roger De Bris all combine to create a wonderful masterpiece of hysterical madcap comedy. It is with little wonder this film began as an unwanted idea and ended up becoming the surprise hit of the decade. A milestone for Mel Brooks, but a Classic for any audience. ****"

","This is a marvellous piece - a combination of utter farce, black humour, Jewish schtick and high camp, ""The Producers"" remains a truly wonderful film.<br/><br/>From the opening sequences, where Theatre agent Max is a despairing old fool trying to avoid tax, through the ""little old lady seduction"" scenes, to the gorgeous rooftop scene where a mad German pigeon fancier tries to remain within the bounds of sanity and fails, via the meeting with ""top"" Hollywood director Roger"" we're not alone"" de Bris, the film traces the hapless and eponymous producers who devise a foolproof scheme to make money out of a flop.  They employ a Nazi writer to script the musical ""Springtime for Hitler"", which is guaranteed to be a flopperoony. Of course, they manage to totally miss the mood of the day and the projected flop is a huge hit - whereupon they have to pay back the 16,000 percent of the cost that they acquired....<br/><br/> Wild, manic, joyous and deeply perceptive, this is Mel Brooks at his finest - Jewish gags abound, but never alienate, accountants get the mickey taken (cheers all round!) and the final production - well, if you haven't seen this film, where have you been living? One of the greats."
"doned88","Null","19","24","6 August 2002"," A Classic!
","This is a classic film with wonderful performances all around (although I didn't take to Dick Shawn's as much as the others). Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were perfect casting as was Christopher Hewitt (later to be known as TV's ""Mr. Belvedere""). What's even more impressive are the various elements of truth that are beneath the histerical if not obsurbed storyline. The current Broadway hit doesn't compete with this film. The performances are good on stage but not as wonderful as here. Due to long term business problems this film wasn't released for home video and cable until much later then it should have been. Outright broad comedy and silliness belong in our daily lives and this film offers them very well. EVERYONE should see this film!"
"dtb","10","21","27","18 April 2007"," This Quotable Classic is Still One of Mel Brooks' Very Best
","I know more people who quote lines from THE PRODUCERS than from Shakespeare; make of that what you will! :-) That said, people seem to either love it or hate it, but most folks I know agree this nutzoid farce has, to quote groovy LSD (delightful Dick Shawn), ""Love Power!"" Writer/director Mel Brooks' insanely zany yet strangely sweet tale of down-on-his-luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock (the great Zero Mostel, who should have been nominated for an Oscar himself) who uses his powers of persuasion (and wheedling, and bellowing, and conning :-) to convince meek accountant Leo Bloom (justifiably Oscar-nominated Gene Wilder) to help him make a surefire Broadway flop that, if their nutty book-cooking scheme works, will land them in Rio -- or, if it doesn't work, Sing Sing. This screamingly funny, no-holds-barred comedy won Mel Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and put the former YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS writer on the map as a filmmaker. Anyone trying to make a comedy depending on controversy and questionable taste for its laughs should watch THE PRODUCERS first and see how a master does it! For that matter, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder ought to watch it again themselves; after the duds they were churning out for a while there, maybe they need a refresher course in how to be funny. (Hell, it might be as simple as them teaming up again; Wilder seemed able to temper Brooks's mania for poo-poo humor and Brooks seemed able to help Wilder to better balance out his trademark blend of shrill hysteria and sweetness.) Much as my family and I also loved the Broadway and film editions of the musical version co-written by Brooks and Thomas Meehan and starring the incomparable Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick (even though I felt that Broderick wasn't quite as good as Leo Bloom as Lane was as Max Bialystock. That said, together they have great buddy chemistry), the original is still the champ."
"elinlin","6","8","9","23 April 2018"," A little bit disappointed
","From what I have heard about it I was a little disappointed with this Mel Brooks creation. The movie has aged poorley, with many jokes that aren't funny. It's often slow and draged out, but the jokes that do work almost makes up for it. The best thing about it is the general plot idea and the climax. Overall, the movie was okay and interesting to watch but it's lacking something."
"theaz_man","8","8","9","30 January 2005"," Unique and funny film
","Although I saw this film after seeing some of Brook's bigger works, such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs, I still found this very funny and entertaining. It's hard to fault the antagonistic partnership of the two main characters, and are played so well. The actor who played Hitler in the show was so bizarre that it worked much like the play 'springtime for Hitler' was to the audience I presume! The only character I thought was unnecessary, was the babbling 'old-school' Nazi, but you could argue that he was necessary for the plot to move forward.<br/><br/>Overall, great light-hearted fun."
"jzappa","8","7","8","13 October 2010"," ""Bad taste is simply saying the truth before it should be said."" -Mel Brooks
","In 21st Century America, the one feature of The Producers that astounds even today is the boisterous, exaggerated, confrontational impulsiveness of its two lead performances. But in 1968, the film's content was like a suicide bombing of the audience's idea of good manners. There's such greed in its heroes, such merry deceit, such eagerness to concede every ethic, that the 1968 audience just had to surrender, stick with it. How did Brooks get away with that? By proving the dishonorable struggle of both lead characters at the start, by casting them with actors you couldn't help liking. Mostel's Max Bialystock is a man whose yearnings are so measureless they exonerate his voracity. There's a scene where he rubs his grubby office window with coffee, peeps through the dirt, sees a white Rolls-Royce and shouts, ""That's it, baby! When you've got it, flaunt it!"" You can drink a tall glass of his gluttonous self-indulgence. ""Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!"" It's characteristic of this movie that after he says the line, he rips off the belt, tears it to smithereens.<br/><br/>Mostel, a distinguished thespian, blacklist foil, and academic, here gives a tour de force of low comedy. Regardless of a comb-over that starts just above his clavicle, he propels buoyant egotism, spitting on his hand to slick back his hair before an elderly female investor enters for her weekly frolic. What Mostel propels in particular is unreserved self-assurance. He never has doubts. Maybe he never thinks at all, just simply carries on out of evolutionary necessity.<br/><br/>Wilder was a fresh mug in 1968, familiarized to audiences with a significant supporting role in Bonnie and Clyde a year before, also as a rather hysterical character. His performance in The Producers is a tinge short of cardiac arrest. On the floor with Mostel over him, he shrieks, ""Don't jump! Don't jump!"" Mostel begins to leap in a flurry. ""I'm hysterical! I'm hysterical!"" Mostel pours a glass of water and chucks it in his face. Wilder serves a perfect line: ""I'm wet! I'm hysterical, and I'm wet! I'm in pain, and I'm wet, and I'm still hysterical!"" Gene and Zero reel on the floor so violently we expect them to chew on one another. Mostel's so overexcited and feral, Wilder so flustered and frantic, you marvel that slobber didn't get on the camera lens. The entire movie's toned on that plane of turbulent anxiety. One of the delights of watching it is to see how the actors are able to manage timing and distinctions even while shrieking. Timing is in the hands of actors, but without scripts, there would be loads of tedious improvisation. Good timing in the written words is the gateway to good timing on screen. I'm sure we'd be surprised at how snappish the dialogue seems on the page. But Brooks, a veteran nightclub act himself, leaves space for delivery while simultaneously working economically with form. Characters repeat the last thing another character said to extend the laugh. Characteristic of Brooks, that's often what causes the laugh. Language is ecstasy to him.<br/><br/>Kenneth Mars is a militant live-action cartoon, up on the roof with his pigeons, singing Nazi songs, later commanding an audience member to stop laughing because ""I am the author! I outrank you!"" Brooks includes gay jokes, with the ostentatious couple of Broadway director Roger De Bris and his right-hand Carmen Giya. At one point Max, Leo and Carmen crowd into a teeny elevator, and are ejected breathless and ill-at-ease. Heterosexuality's epitomized by the nubile Lee Meredith, as Ulla, the voluptuous secretary, who types one letter at a time then stops for a pat-on-the-back smile. The other terrific performance is by Dick Shawn as the actor who plays Hitler. In a movie made at the pinnacle of the hipster era, he's a hippie comprised out of archetypal junk scraps, with his finger cymbals, soup can necklace and knee-high shag boots.<br/><br/>To produce a musical named Springtime for Hitler is naturally in the worst achievable taste, as an exiting audience member remarks in the movie, to the glee of Bialystock and Bloom, who're depending upon precisely that response. To make a movie about such a musical was also in bad taste, apparently. It's clear that Bialystock and Bloom are Jewish, but they never touch on that. As Franz Liebkind rages, they nod, because the more repugnant he is, the more liable his play will fail. Brooks throws in merely one brief flash to indicate their personal feelings. As the two men walk away from the playwright's apartment, Bloom covers the red-and-black Nazi armband Franz has given him. ""All right, take off the armband,"" says Bialystock, taking off his own. They throw both armbands into a garbage can and spit in it.<br/><br/>Whilst jabbing at the troubles of Broadway, Brooks' directorial debut's concerned with two overtly Jewish characters who are, in the best tradition of Jewish comedy, doomed to failure, in a film steaming with conflict on every level. Whilst there may be a prominently Jewish-American sensibility about Brooks' work, it's a feature that he's chosen to leave out after this film, apart from the Yiddish Native American chief in Blazing Saddles, the metal detector scene in High Anxiety, occasional comments in To Be or Not To Be and the fictitious trailer for Jews in Space in History of the World Part I. But what he's maintained, and what I feel---having grown up in a family of Brooks fanatics---is what makes a particular generation enjoy him so insatiably, is a pure audacity, mischievous delight, eagerness to leap any bound for a laugh. They'll say, ""Ah, comedy today's all eff this, eff that, fart on this, have sex with that. It's all bad taste."" And I say, look at your boy Mel. He knows better than any of them: Bad taste can taste the best."

","How can a Broadway producer who has seen his day really make a lot of money? Leave it to writer/director Mel Brooks to answer that, and answer it he does in the uproarious comedy `The Producers.'  Zero Mostel stars as the producer in question, one Max Bialystock, with Gene Wilder co-starring as Leo Bloom, the meek accountant who steers Max onto the path to instant riches with a scheme that (in Max's hands) simply can't fail.  With Leo on board as his new partner, Max embarks upon a search for the perfect script, the first step of the plan that will lead them to the pot of gold at the end of the Great White Way.  And with Brooks at the helm, it's the beginning of a laugh-filled movie that gets funnier every time you see it. 	Mostel is perfect as the unflappable Max, the charlatan who woos a string of old ladies into becoming investors in his show; his personality and countenance match the broad approach Brooks takes with his comedy, and it's a fit made in comedic heaven.  Wilder, however, nearly steals the show with his terrific, definitive `long' takes and sideward glances that have served him so well during his career.  Here, in one of his first screen appearances, he works it perfectly, creating just the right counter-balance to Mostel's boldness, and it makes Leo a truly memorable character. Visually, there is enough in this film to generate plenty of laughs, but that it's delivered with wonderfully witty and clever dialogue as well (the screenplay earned Brooks an Oscar), makes it a true classic in anybody's book. 	Also unforgettable here are Kenneth Mars, as Franz Liebkind, author of the play that Max and Leo undertake to produce; Christopher Hewett, as Roger De Bris; and especially Dick Shawn, as Lorenzo Saint DuBois (`L.S.D.' to his friends), who becomes the star of Max and Leo's production.  Rounding out the great supporting cast are Estelle Winwood (`Hold me, touch me' old lady), Lee Meredith (Ulla), Renee Taylor (Eva Braun), Andreas Voutsinas (Carmen Giya), and William Hickey (Good Natured Inebriate). 	`The Producers' is every bit as funny now as when it debuted in 1968, maybe even funnier; it proves that good comedy is timeless, and this is comedy at it's best.  This is a must-see, not only for Mel Brooks' fans, but for anyone who just likes lots of good laughs.  Believe me, this is one funny movie you're going to want to see again and again.  I rate this one 9/10."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","6","7","2 June 2004"," Brooks' earliest and arguably his finest
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Mel Brooks is a legend. At least he used to be. Whilst writing a lot of classic films throughout his career, Brooks was awesome. With ""The Producers"", ""Silent Movie"", ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"" and others, Brooks created a collection of some of the finest spoof/comedy collections of all time. The 1990's were considerably more cruel on Brooks however. With the very average ""Life Stinks"" Brooks began on a downward spiral and this was only confirmed more with ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"" and ""Dracula: Dead And Loving It"". Whilst these two films at the end both featured the gorgeous Amy Yasbeth, the scripts were hideous. With these three films under his belt then, it seems of little surprise that Brooks would retreat to his first (and arguably his finest) success, ""The Producers"".<br/><br/>In this film, we are introduced to Max Bialystock (the superb late Zero Mostel), a washed up Broadway Producer who is forced to fraternise with old ladies as an attempt to get their investment in his plays. Entering into Bialystock's life is Leo Bloom (the God that is Gene Wilder), a nervous wreck of an accountant who retreats to his blue security blanket, the second he is placed in peril. Together they team up to produce a Broadway flop, since a flop makes more money when the particular scenario is right. Will Bloom & Bialystock succeed and make their fortune? Or will they screw up in mammoth proportions and end up in prison? This is Mel Brooks, it's obvious which of the two options is more likely!<br/><br/>Whilst I confess to never seeing Brooks' recent theatrical remake of this film (the problem with plays being limited to America), I must have seen this original piece countless times. Whilst I confess that nowadays it feels slightly dated, it remains hilarious and remains wonderful to this day. In Nostel and Wilder, there is a perfect partnership of the brash loud mouth and the quiet withdrawn type. Added to the main partnership are a superb supporting cast of Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn and others. Mars in-particular as the eccentric Nazi writer of ""Springtime For Hitler"", the duo's chosen play, is hilarious in his extremeness.<br/><br/>There's not much more to be said really. ""The Producers"" remains one of Brooks' finest pieces of work, and I pray that the film remake (based on the theatre production) is going to be acceptable. Ultimately though, even if that remake is dire, lets not take away from the original. This film is a beautiful piece of comedy and if you haven't seen it yet, then get yourself to the video store straight away."
"Hairy_Lime","10","9","12","23 February 2005"," A movie that rises below vulgarity
","This is one loud, obnoxious, vulgar movie. And oh yes, funny. Very, cynically, deeply misanthropically funny.<br/><br/>So how do you critique a movie like this one? I guess you start by noting that the acting starts out over the top, and goes from there. And the script thinks that human weakness, greed, and lust are uproariously funny. Which, in the right hands, they are. And Mel Brooks's hands are the right ones.<br/><br/>The movie makes great fun of pretty much everything - Broadway, Nazis, Old ladies, sex, gays, theater critics, Swedish models, Franz Kafka (not quite bad enough!), you name it, with gleeful abandon."
"dimplet","10","7","9","14 August 2011"," A bittersweet comedy
","The Producers is the most bittersweet of comedies.<br/><br/>The year is 1968, 23 years after the end of World War II. The scene is New York City, where countless Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and Europe, survivors of Nazi concentration camps like Auschwitz, and relatives who have lost family to the Holocaust, live. The horrors of the Holocaust can never be forgotten by those whom it touched in any way, but for those who stared evil in the face and lived, survival eventually becomes a celebration of life. <br/><br/>By turning the Nazi Holocaust into a joke, Mel Brooks, Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, all Jewish, of course, are thumbing their nose at Hitler, saying, We're alive, and you're not! Such black humor has a long tradition in Judaism, a way to maintain sanity in a hateful, irrational world. And it has precedent in the 1942 Ernst Lubitsch film To Be Or Not To Be, starring Jack Benny. <br/><br/>The element of celebration of life gradually comes out in The Producers as Zero teaches Wilder to relax, be happy and live a little, such as the scene in Central Park in the boat. Wilder says as much in his statement to the jury during sentencing. The little old ladies are hardly complaining, either. <br/><br/>Yet if you think too hard about the story line, and really understand the history behind this, it can bring tears to your eyes. How can the sadistic, evil murders of more than 6 million Jews, and millions of others, at the hands of brutal Nazi monsters not? <br/><br/>But Mel Brooks is saying, It's finally time to let go. He is also making an outrageously funny movie. Brooks appears briefly in the film as one of the dancers, with the line: ""Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi Party!"" It reduces Nazism down to its most banal essence. <br/><br/>This was Mel Brooks' first film, seemingly coming out of nowhere. But he had been one of Sid Caesar's main writers in the early days of live television, so he knew what worked in comedy. <br/><br/>If you look at a list of comedies from 1968, Funny Girl, I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, Inspector Clouseau, The Odd Couple, The Party, not to mention Disney's Blackbeard's Ghost, it becomes more apparent how radical The Producers was for its time. <br/><br/>Hello, Dolly! was to come out the next year, and fall flat. The Producers was something of a flop, itself, but at a cost of less than $1 million to produce, not too great a disaster. The studio didn't even bother to release it in the American South, given its ethnic humor and the Baptist lack of humor, so much of the country didn't even hear of the movie until decades later, with its re-release on video, and with the remake and Broadway musical. <br/><br/>In the interim, when I would occasionally try to explain the movie's premise, and how funny the song and dance number, Springtime for Hitler, was, people would give me a look of pity like I had lost my mind. I gather there are still some people who don't get the joke. <br/><br/>To appreciate The Producers, you've got to watch it, and watch closely; listening is not enough. So much of the humor is in the expressions, of Zero especially, the absurd situations, and the details, like the tacky costumes in Springtime for Hitler. By today's standards, I suppose The Producers might seem tame to younger viewers used to shock jocks. Yet The Producers somehow accomplishes the rare feat of being funny the second time you watch it, and the third and fourth and .... <br/><br/>Thinking about the family I never met that died at the hands of the Nazis, of the people I've known that survived the concentration camps, of the infinite suffering multiplied by millions, always brings tears to my eyes. <br/><br/>But The Producers brings a smile to my face just thinking about it. And for a movie about the Nazi Third Reich, that is a remarkable feat. For that, I say thank you, Mel Brooks!"
"eibon09","Null","7","9","16 August 2001"," One of the Funniest Films of the Last 35 Years
","The Producers(1968) has three things that make it a pleasurably funny film. One, the humorous interreactions between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.  Two, the film's memorable and unforgettable ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical number.  Three, the energetic and fresh style of the filmmaker, Mel Brooks.<br/><br/>
Mel Brooks does a fantastic job in his masterful film debut as film director.  Blends the crude humor of Blazing Saddles(1974) with the subtleness of Young Frankenstein(1974).  Brooks's direction is daring and isn't afraid to use material that might be a little risque.  I believe Mel Brooks direction in The Producers(1968) is excellent and surpassed only by his more mature direction for Young Frankenstein(1974).<br/><br/>
The screenplay is terrificly good for a comedy of this kind.  Perhaps the best written film by Mel Brooks in his directorial career.  Boasts some original lines of dialogue and strange situations.  The film's screenplay received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay(too bad The Producers[1968] wasn't considered for Best Picture or Best Director).<br/><br/>
Gene Wilder was the best alter ego as actor to Mel Brooks as director.  He was in the director's three top films and that is no accident because Gene Wilder always added more laughs to the films of Mel Brooks in which he was in.  The Mel Brooks pictures where Gene Wilder wasn't in lose a lot with the lack of his presence.  In my opinion Gene Wilder worked with Mel Brooks in a way the director has not worked with anyone before or since.<br/><br/>
The characters of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are opposites in personalities yet they make a perfect duo.  The two leads give brilliant performances in their roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom.  Two is a number that plays an important role in many of the Mel Brooks films.  In his films there is a leader and an assistent whose plans never work as originally envisioned.<br/><br/>
A satire on planned failure and unintentional success that was daring for its time.  Deals with how a bad or below average product can be popular due to good fortune.  In the film, Max and Leo attempt to produce a failure on Boardway to collect the insurance.  To their chargin the play becomes a big time success.<br/><br/>
The main idea of the story was eeriely prophetic because today there are many lousy films that are big box office successes.  The Producers(1968) message was that people will go to see anything even if the product isn't very good or excellent.  Its funny to see how truthful The Producers(1968) was in portraying a certain element of human nature.  To see films like Blair Witch Project(1999) or other lousy big hit films become successes shows that The Producers(1968) in one way was ahead of its time.<br/><br/>
I have no intention of watching the Boardway play based on the film for several reasons.  One, the actors in the play do not bring the same type of humor or style of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.  Two, the story worked much better when written during the late 1960s.  Three, anything that has been inspired from film into Boardway usually turns out to be not very good at all.<br/><br/>
Kenneth Mars rounds out the main cast in a hilarious turn as Franz Liebkind. One of the best sequences is when Max flirts with old women to get their money.  The final scene is another brilliant moment in The Producers(1968). The set designs are beautifully constructed and visually depicted.<br/><br/>
William Hickly makes an obscure appearence in a film before his breakthrough role in Prizzi's Honor(1985).  The Producers(1968) is Mel Brooks at his best and most enthusiastic.  I can tell the film was made in the late 1960s because of the manners and style of the characters.  A classic comedy made at a time when the cinema took chances and weren't afraid to use its artistic freedom to the fullest extent."

","I initially had low expectations for this movie, having not been wowed by the other Mel Brooks films that I'd seen up to that time. This one, however, did live up to Brooks's reputation as a comedy legend.<br/><br/>The cast of characters and the actors portraying them are quite distinctive and memorable. Zero is pitch-perfect as the mildly devious Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder is ideal as his straight man sidekick, Leo Bloom. The supporting cast is exceptional as well, with memorable performances from Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn & Christopher Hewett.<br/><br/>The script isn't filled with meaningless gags but rather with comedy that's built upon characterization and plot. Sure, some of the comedy may be dated (particularly LSD's mannerisms) but it's all entertaining nonetheless. I really enjoyed the plot, particularly the ending.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint it would be that the comparatively small amount of music left me wishing for more. The production's main theme alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the recent remake but it would have to be awfully good to be an improvement on this. Stick to the original and you won't be disappointed."

"The_Void","8","35","63","11 January 2005"," An amusing gem that works despite not being hilarious
","I'm not a fan of Mel Brooks. At all. For a comedy director, I find him painfully unfunny and therefore very difficult to like. The Producers is often cited to be Brooks' best film, and for good reason; as it is. Although it never reaches the realms of hilarity, and quite a few of the gags aren't funny in the slightest, it's a breezy little comedy that's based around an amusing idea and is hard to dislike on the whole. The idea is that a Broadway producer can, in theory, make more money from a flop than he could from a hit. When accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) suggests that this could be the case, a plan forms in the mind of once great producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), and we're on course for an amusing ride as the two set out to find the worst play ever written (a drama called ""Springtime for Hitler"" eventually wins out), and pull out all the stops to ensure it's a sure-fire Broadway flop! <br/><br/>Through a stark colour scheme and overacting from all concerned, Mel Brooks succeeds in creating a distinct comic-book style that lends the film a very comedic, and fun, edge that few films have succeeded in capturing adequately since. The cast helps this film enormously, with everyone giving hammy performances that help in creating the film's sense of fun. Brooks regular Gene Wilder is, of course, the star of the show despite not being the absolute central character. His performance is more subdued than Mostel's, but still very over the top. The play itself features a very tasteless, yet very amusing and catchy opening song that will no doubt be swirling around your head for days afterwards. The play itself is actually the funniest thing about the film, with most of the hilarity coming from the monumental miscasting of an Elvis impersonator-esquire character calling himself 'L.S.D.' (Dick Shawn) in the role of the fuhrer himself.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very fun film. The sense of fun is carried throughout, even if the jokes don't always work. I can almost guarantee a good time from watching this movie and it's one that fans of this sort of film shouldn't go without seeing."

","Leave it to Leo Bloom to figure out the possibilities in having the worst show on Broadway, and yet, make a bundle by collecting a small fortune from innocent old ladies investing their savings in it. It's no wonder Max Bialystock jumps for joy upon hearing about how to really succeed in show business without really trying!<br/><br/>This 1968 version of Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" is a much better film than the recent one unveiled at the end of 2005. We had watched the original movie some time ago and we thought it was quite funny. On second viewing though, some of the fun one had that first time, seems to have disappeared somehow. It seems inconceivable, but this time we found little to laugh about, although this version should have been the definite one because of the presence of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is far superior than the stars seen on the latest version.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel was a colossus in the New York stage. He was a man who could do anything at all and still give an honest performance to everything he did. It was Mr. Mostel's misfortune to have been blacklisted at a time where his career was at an all time high. When film work stopped, Mr. Mostel had the theater to go back. Who knows how far this actor would have gone if he hadn't been a victim of the McCarthym that ruined many lives.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel made a creation out of Max Bialystock. This was a man who had seen better days in his producing career days and now finds himself dodging his creditors because he doesn't have the money to pay his debts and has to rely in his stable of old ladies for living. Zero Mostel was the perfect man to play this larger than life character.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder, whose second film this is, showed from the beginning to be a genius in the movies. His Leo Bloom was an excellent creation and his chemistry with Zero Mostel seems to be real. The film owes a great deal of its success to Gene Wilder who acts as the straight man.<br/><br/>In supporting roles we see Kenneth Mars as the lunatic author of the musical. Christopher Hewett is the gay director who turns the material into a great musical. Lee Meredith makes Ulla fun to watch. Dick Shawn who plays Hitler, makes a good impression. Also some other faces in the cast, Estelle Winwood, Renee Taylor, William Hickey, Frank Campanella, Madelyn Cates, all New York based actors with long experience in the stage and screen.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks was going for laughs, and at times, he succeeds brilliantly."

","Broadway theatre producer, down-on-his-luck with a string of losers behind him, takes the joshing advice from his accountant to stage a sure-fire musical flop and sell off the interest in it, thereby leaving him a millionaire when the show closes after one night. Low-voltage hysteria from Oscar-winning screenwriter Mel Brooks, who also makes his debut as director. The timing is off, the scenes ramble without punch, the sets and art direction are appalling, and the opening scenes with Zero Mostel wooing different elderly women for show-money are disastrous. Oscar-nominated Gene Wilder has a very funny early scene freaking out in Mostel's office, and the auditions for their lopsided extravaganza are amusing. However, aside from the musical number ""Springtime For Hitler"", Brooks never quite gets the lead out. His pacing drags, and he's surely not helped by the flagging editing and overacting from just about everyone (Dick Shawn and Kenneth Mars are the worst culprits). Even though this is early-era Brooks, one is automatically inclined to cut him a wide berth for both his customary belly laughs and groaners--unfortunately, much of ""The Producers"" is lined with groaners, particularly in the third act after the show has opened. Later transformed into a Broadway musical and a 2005 film-adaptation of that show. ** from ****"

","Zero Mostel blew me away in this film (even though I've seen enough of his work that I shoulda seen it comin'!), which I think is the best Mel Brooks film that I've seen. He manages to make Max one of those classic ""lovable scoundrels"" while at the same time providing a plausible mentor for Gene Wilder's Leo, a young accountant who Max cajoles and corrupts into joining his scheme to produce Broadway's biggest ever flop. Along the road from profitable failure to disastrous success, Leo emerges from the shell of his insecure conservatism to become a jaded -- and free-spirited -- fellow manipulator.<br/><br/>Although the film often feels somewhat ""stage-bound"", I'd still argue that it's the most cinematic project I've seen from Brooks. That's partly because here he isn't spoofing a particular genre and adopting its visual style, but mostly because of the greater depth and resonance of the characters. I especially enjoyed the ""seduction"" scene with Mostel and wilder at the big Parisian-styled fountain -- I felt the magic of cinema there in a way that I've never really felt with a Brooks movie before. I felt myself really wishing I could see this in the theater with a bunch of other people instead of at home on DVD with my girlfriend.<br/><br/>At times the humor is a bit obvious, leaning as Brooks often does on simple puns. But the characters -- including supporting ones like Dick Shawn's wasted hippie ""L.S.D."", Kenneth Mars' suitably overstated Nazi playwright, and Estelle Winwood as a violently lusty crone -- keep things moving pleasantly. The performances are good and the dialog unusually subtle for any comedy.<br/><br/>I felt the conclusion was a little bit of a letdown, even if it was just Brooks being self-reflexive on the obvious nature of dramatic resolution (courtroom scenes are the very definition of ""obligatory""). But the way the play itself unfolded, though again perhaps a bit too fast and obvious, provides an insightful and humorous view of the subjectivity of the artistic experience in general.<br/><br/>An excellent film, featuring Zero Mostel at the peak of his considerable genius and Brooks at his most restrained and human."
"Captain_Couth","9","4","5","27 August 2005"," Mel Brooks' directorial debut!
","The Producers (1968) was the first film that Mel Brooks directed. It was a critical smash as well. Gene Wilder stars as a accountant to a Broadway producer (Zero Mostel). Whilst going over his books, he noticed that his productions that bombed actually made money instead of the successful ones. Mostel has an idea, what if he makes a Broadway play that is such a disaster that it only receives one run. He needs two things in order for this plan to go into effect. One, he has to sway Wilder to his side and two, he needs to have a huge amount of investors.<br/><br/>Whilst Wilder fixes the numbers, Mostel goes out to all of his elderly female clients whom he swoons with his charm as they write out checks for him to invest in his play. He over sells shares into the play, so when it bombs he doesn't have to pay them back and pockets the money. Now only one question remains, what kind of production will they do that'll be so awful that it'll play once and never again? How will these ""Producers"" be able to pull off this ingenious scheme? To find out you'll just have to watch THE PRODUCERS!!! Co-stars Kenneth Mars and Dick Shawn as Lionel Saint Du Bois (L.S.D.).<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"mfisher452","Null","4","5","18 August 2002"," There's something here to offend almost everyone
","""The Producers"" has something to offend almost everybody: Jews, Germans, Swedes, blondes, old women, young women, gays, hippies past and present, directors, accountants, Italians, tenors, the list goes on. The plot is by now well known: Broadway producer Max Bialystock (which is the name of a town in Poland with a Jewish community as venerable as any in Europe) has been cursed with a string of flops and is an impoverished has-been, reduced to romancing little old ladies who think the checks they write are going to finance plays when in fact they are going to pay his rent. He is visited one day by Leo Bloom, the quintessence of the stereotypical repressed, anal-retentive accountant. After an initial acquaintance that is---to say the least---difficult, Leo sits down to do Bialystock's books. He makes an innocent, casual remark about ""creative accounting"" (""under the correct circumstances, a person could make more money from a flop than from a hit""). Producing flops, of course, is what Max Bialystock has become best at, and he eventually talks Bloom into conspiring with him to find and produce the worst play ever written and to abscond with the vast amount of excess funds they have swindled out of hundreds of little old ladies. It goes without saying that despite their efforts to produce the worst script (""Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgarten"") with the worst director and the worst actors, the show is a huge success. Now they have to pay off all the backers, something that will be a bit difficult as they have committed fraud and raised 250 times the money they really needed, and there wouldn't be enough profits in a million years to pay off the backers. ""WHERE DID I GO RIGHT?!?"" laments Bialystock. The script goes downhill from there, and the climax of the story is not really very satisfying; in fact, the anticlimax that ends the film is better than the climax. I guess you'd call it a happy ending.<br/><br/>By the mid-1960s, Mel Brooks had a reputation as a gifted comedy writer for television, and as a performer as well, mostly from the ""2000-Year-Old-Man"" recordings with Carl Reiner. But with ""The Producers,"" he was taking a big chance. World War II and the Holocaust had been over for only about 20 years, and were still extremely painful memories. For someone to write a play in which Hitler becomes a comedic figure, even indirectly, was awfully presumptuous, especially for a Jew, but if you think about it, ONLY a Jew would have the chutzpah to do it. You can try to rationalize or justify the use of Hitler because, of course, Bialystock and Bloom explicitly label the play ""Springtime for Hitler"" as the worst play ever written, and Brooks makes its author, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), the broadest of caricatures. It just doesn't work: Hitler's crimes were so transcendentally monstrous that not even ""The Producers"" can distract from the horror of it all. Despite this, Act I, Scenes 1 and 2, in which Bialystock and Bloom meet, are 18 of the funniest minutes ever put on film. Although the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the beginning, much of it is intermittently hilarious, especially the scenes with Roger De Bris and the opening production number of ""Springtime for Hitler"". Any viewer of Mel Brooks's movies knows that realistic characterization is not his forte, and ""The Producers"" is no exception: Even inspired clowns Zero Mostel (Bialystock) and Gene Wilder (Bloom), despite their best efforts, barely manage to elevate their characters above caricature. (I wonder if Brooks was inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy when he chose two actors who resemble them physically.) The rest of the characters are completely so. Probably the most irritating piece of casting was Dick Shawn as the hippie ""L.S.D."": He is WAY too old to be a hippie (he was 44 when the film was shot) and he was the un-hippiest hippie in history. He looked like Liberace and played his character as a combination of Elvis Presley and a Borscht-belt comedian. Despite the fact that they DID play caricatures, Kenneth Mars as Liebkind and Christopher Hewitt (pre-Mr. Belvedere) as Roger De Bris, the worst (and swishiest) director in history, have left us with some unforgettable moments. There are also some nice, gentler touches when Brooks quietly acknowledges his cultural roots: Among the photographs that fill Bialystock's office can just barely be seen a famous portrait of Sholom Aleichem, who is considered by many the greatest author in the Yiddish language.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks the performer is one of the funniest men alive; Mel Brooks the filmmaker has made more bad films than good. ""The Producers"" was his first, and it hinted at Brooks's future as a maker of mostly unsuccessful movies with leaden humor, toilet jokes, and caricatures rather than characters. 'The Producers' will never quite be an unqualified success; still, the first 18 minutes reduces me to helpless laughter every time I see it."

This is great stuff that Brooks let his guys run with. Even within the skits, there are levels: Wilder as observer, Leo Bloom.

The gag is supposed to be the same as in Chaplin's `The Dictator:' preening evil as ridiculous.

","The Producers, starring Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is about a broken down Hollywood producer, (Mostel) so desperate for money that he hires his accountant (Wilder) to come up with a crocked scheme. Create and produce a sure-miss Broadway flop, get the most gullible people to invest in the scheme, and than keep the money all for themselves without paying any money to their investors of the project. What they don't count on, is that the play they produce, ""Springtime for Hitler"" becomes a shocking Broadway hit. What can they do, if anything to avoid jail? When I saw this movie some years ago for some reason, I remembered it being good. I just watched it again for this review and found it weak. Director Mel Brooks may have intended The Producers to be a laugh-filled riot movie. However, the film is flawed in many ways, which prevent it from achieving classic status. For one thing, there are annoying pauses in the opening credits of the film, where a bunch of jokes are told that are supposed to set the tone of the film. They are not funny at all. The movie than drags on to Wilder and Mostel making jokes about their mundane lives that once again fall flat.<br/><br/>Even the preparation in finding people for the play is drawn out. The screen testing for ""Hitler"" drags on, made even worse by of all things, a song that appears to be tacked on to the film to kill time. The Nazi jokes aren't even funny.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the song ""Springtime For Hitler."" It FINALLY gets the viewer into actually seeing the play. The ending number ""We're Prisoners of Love"" is well done. But it is a L-O-N-G struggle and strain on the viewer to get to those parts in the movie. You have to wait for over an hour of an only ninety minute movie for those scenes. These songs save The Producers from being a complete dud. However, they occur too late to salvage my overall impression of the film."

","This was Mel Brook's first big success which he wrote, directed but did not act in. Over three decades later he turned it into a successful Broadway play and there was a remake with Nathan Lane in 2005. The legendary black-listed comedian Zero Mostel (one of the original Hollywood Undesirable 12) plays a failed Broadway producer Max Bialystok who has taken to scamming old ladies. A young Gene Wilder (the fish-faced enemy of the people) is an accountant who has the disastrous idea that an unsuccessful play can earn more money than a successful one.<br/><br/>He and Max sell shares for their sure-fire flop Springtime for Hitler - written by a Nazi psycho. They sell shares for slightly more than 100% - more in the vicinity of 25,000%, but thats OK because a play portraying Hitler as the hero is bound to fail right? Wrong! We have the lead actor playing Hitler - called LSD (another in-joke I think!)to thank for that.<br/><br/>While some of the dialogue is certainly funny, personally I think the film didn't age too well. I saw it for the famed Zero who originated the Tevye role in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway, because I'd never seen him before in any movie. But, I understand the Nathan Lane remake is better.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'll see that soon, but anyone wanting to see The Producers may want to watch the newer version instead which is supposed to be better than the original."

","This will always be a personal favourite, right from those trendy sixties credits it just grabs me every time, there's just so much joy pouring out of every moment, especially the Wilder-Mostel thing, two top geniuses doing their stuff to full effect. Some of it has obviously dated a bit poorly, but it still has more than enough magic to captivate and inspire, an everlasting pleasure. The moment when Blum realises he can do whatever he wants and starts running around the fountain is to me one of the most beautiful and uplifting moments in cinema, and every second of Zero's performance is inspired brilliance.

"StevePulaski","4","4","6","9 March 2014"," This is where comedic subjectivity is affirmed.
","There comes a time in every critic's life, be it newspaper critic or online critic, syndicated or local, hobbyist or elitist, when he watches a highly-regarded classic for the first time and feels underwhelmed by it. He proceeds to write a not-so positive review of the film and what follows is a long-run of neverending hate-mail about the comment for the rest of his career. <br/><br/>If that's what my review of Mel Brooks' The Producers brings so be it. This isn't my first rodeo with not liking a relatively high- regarded classic. I proved not to be such a big fan of Easy Rider, the classic road movie that portrayed sixties culture in a way many found profound and accurate. My main reason for not loving that particular picture is because I found it ""spoke to a generation that no longer had ears to hear it,"" and unless you're from the generation when big political and social changes began to take effect, chance are, it was an alienating and sometimes tedious film to indulge in.<br/><br/>That's a whole different complaint than the one about to make for Brooks' The Producers. Given Brooks limitless track record for uproariously funny and subversive comedies of yesteryear, I felt popping in almost any one of his films would be an immediate winner. The bottom line with The Producers is it's simply not that funny and never that interesting. Concerning a hack producer named Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and his neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the film follows the two halfwits as they attempt to conjure up a travesty of a play when they run the math and realize that a bomb could work better for a producer than a hit in terms of shares and rights solicitation. <br/><br/>In efforts to produce a play that is destined to play for one night only, Max and Leo right and produce ""Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden,"" a work that is labeled ""a love letter to Hitler"" written by an ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), which is German for ""Frank Lovechild."" The play turns out to be a musical, and to assure nothing but total and unprecedented chaos, the two producers decide to follow every step in the ""what not to do"" section in the unwritten book of performance art. They hire the wrong director, the wrong actors, pick the worst and potentially most offensive story, and find a writer who is four tires short of a car. <br/><br/>Mel Brooks does just about everything he can against the wall with The Producers and it's surprising and a shame to admit so very little of the humor actually sticks. To begin with, it's no denying Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are extremely talented performers, but somehow, Brooks found the way to make both extremely tired, irritating, and tedious. This especially goes for Wilder, whose over-the- top neurosis exhausts itself well past the perimeters of being funny. Mostel, on the other hand, occasionally hits admirable strides, but his character is so blatantly selfish that it's difficult to watch him for very long let alone to side with him.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the ideas of satire are barely noticeable here - something the film should've set its sights on heavily. Instead, we get frequent vignettes of situations that aren't very funny simply because they're burdened by overacting and boring physical comedy. I never knew the latter words went together. Mostel and Wilder both have unbearable characters and, in return, give us somewhat unbearable performances.<br/><br/>Brooks has made a name for himself as one of comedy's great voice and, through some mystery far beyond anything I'm willing to conjure up at the moment, The Producers has become a staple in the comedy genre. It has earned its place on the American Film Institute's one- hundred best comedy films among many film critics' favorites as well. I conclude by saying that I don't expect my opinions to be agreed with or shared but at the very least respected. Sometimes I feel comedy is the most subjective of all genres because one thing that makes somebody laugh can make someone else uncomfortable or annoyed. The funny thing is I've seen films very similar to The Producers hit considerable highs. I suppose I'm just trying to figure out where it all went wrong here.<br/><br/>Starring: Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Kenneth Mars. Directed by: Mel Brooks."

Although it is mercifully short, there is not a single chuckle-worthy moment in the entire film. The vaudevillian comedy is sophomoric and utterly unfunny. Everybody overacts embarrassingly.

At last I have managed it and have to say that I sat leaden-faced through the entire movie. I could not believe that any so-called comedy could be that unfunny. Zero Mostel shouted hysterically with frenetic gestures, obviously thinking that he was being extremely funny when he was nothing of the sort. As for the famed Gene Wilder all I can say is that he had nothing of the subtlety that Matthew Broderick brought to the role, though at least he was not as appallingly irritating as Mostel. Scenes referred to by previous reviewers as classics of comedy were to me just noisy and childish. It was interesting that the original was much shorter than the remake, but it seemed about twice as long. I only just managed to sit through it all. A complete dud."

There was an occasional giggle here and there, but I found it frequently annoying and stupid.  The comic timing is perfect, Zero and Gene have a great chemistry.  Too bad there's no good material to work with.  What we're basically watching is the two of them fumbling around like a bunch of idiots for a mindless hour and thirty minutes.  Now, Mel had some good ideas. ""Springtime for Hitler"" could've been hilarious, but even that fell flat. Come on, a drug-induced sixties, flower-power stoner playing Hitler is supposed to be funny?  Maybe I missed something.  Maybe I should give another look.  On second thought...no.  There's a whole bunch of weird bits of comedy that are definitely original--but that's all they are.  That originality has no zest or appeal.  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder stumble through each scene like Abbott and Costello with crappy material.  Did I have to be born in the late sixties to get the humor?  Is this a dated comedy?  There has to be some reason why one of the ""supposedly"" funniest comedies of all time only sparked a few giggles and a bunch of groans and snores out of me.  And I'm a fan of Mel.  He's definitely a comic genius like no other.  But I'm sure even the greatest of writers--if you look back in time--wrote a really bad essay in sophomore year of high school.  This is like that essay.  Loved all his other movies.  This one should be thrown in the trash."

A show producer is a total flop when trying to pick a hit, so he and his accountant hatch the idea of making money the Enron way, through creating a big fraud. Brilliant! Unfortunately, the movie version suffers from about 50% too much film that was used seemingly to fill the gaps between the well written and funny parts. Those who have heard of the musical and are anxious to see/hear more of the wonderful music will be let down because the actual Springtime for Hitler play is but a brief part of this movie version.<br/><br/>My advice: cross your fingers and wait for the 2005 remake!"

Yes, he has his moments, but the films as a whole are more miss than hit. The plot for The Producers is ingenious enough, but the whole affair has a theatricality that makes it seem more suited to the stage than screen, while the gags are extremely laboured, the performers overcompensating for the lack of genuine laughs by wildly overacting.<br/><br/>I admit to giggling at Dick Shawn singing his hippy rock song Love Power, the extravagant Springtime for Hitler musical number is fun, and Lee Meredith is a delight as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla, but once again, I find Brooks' work to be highly overrated."

While most of this movie does work today, and I did find myself laughing a couple of times – once really loud, I'd much rather see this in 1967 or 1968 when it rolled out. Though decades had passed by that point, WWII and Hitler, especially, were still fresher in people's minds than almost half a century later.<br/><br/>The producers of the title are trying to get rich quick by producing a ""guaranteed"" flop of a Broadway play/musicalonly, it's painfully obvious where it's headed.<br/><br/>Although I liked the movie, it was a tad short – I definitely feel seeing more the creation of the play would've been more interesting.

","The plot to this movie is really quite interesting, and gives Mel Brooks a podium to go completely over the top with one politically incorrect (whatever that phrase means) joke after the other. The ""Springtime For Hitler""-sequences are pretty hilarious, just so in your face, even by today's standards. Nazis who are singing and dancing are just really really wrong. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder work well as a duo, but it's really Kenneth Mars who steals the show as the insane German guy stereotype. The whole comedy acting is pretty old-fashioned, by the book even, but this is just the type of screenplay that needs to be done that way. Exaggerated characters and grotesque situations, the system works. I wouldn't go as far as calling it the funniest movie ever made though. Don't get me wrong, it has plenty of good bits(the auditions, for instance), but not all of the material is that great and it does tend to drag at some points, I didn't really care for that.

","For Mel Brooks, The Producers is the gift that keeps on giving. The film, the Broadway musical based on the film, the second film based on the Broadway musical...maybe you can make more money with a flop than with a hit but I'm sure Brooks has done just fine for himself with The Producers. And this is certainly no flop.<br/><br/>A plot summary seems rather unnecessary as most everyone should be familiar with the story. And the story is really secondary anyway, there really only to set up a succession of jokes, sight gags and one outrageously funny, utterly brilliant musical number. The film is not always uproariously funny. For much of its running time it inspires mild chuckles rather than gut-busting laughs. It's a movie that certainly has its moments but it is not consistently hilarious. But just when you think this might be just another reasonably amusing comedy it happens. ""Springtime for Hitler."" The musical number so perfect, so outrageous, so impossibly funny that it elevates the movie as a whole. In this moment everything comes together and the comic payoff is priceless.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes and gags do fall a little flat but overall the film always manages to be entertaining. The cast is terrific. If it is true that opposites attract Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder could not be any more perfect in their roles as Max and Leo, the producers themselves. The bombastic Mostel and jittery Wilder play off one another brilliantly. They are the two central characters but they are surrounded by a terrific ensemble which really brings the lunacy of Mel Brooks to life. Kenneth Mars as a deranged Nazi playwright, Christopher Hewett as a ludicrously flamboyant Broadway director and Dick Shawn as a hippie Hitler are among the standouts. And while her screen time is minimal Lee Meredith is an absolute treat in the role of Ulla, Max's Swedish receptionist. Ulla may not be much of a receptionist but she sure is fun to watch. In the end The Producers is a real treat. Other movies may be more consistently funny but this one is certainly funny enough. And it has that one transcendent moment which is simply as good as film comedy gets. Well done Mel Brooks. Turns out you can make plenty of money with a hit."

I personally wouldn't go that far as I think Brooks was still learning his craft, which would soon take off but at the same time there's no question that this is a rather unique and interesting comedy that has enough laughs to make it worth watching. <br/><br/>I think the greatest thing this film has going for it are the performances by Mostel and Wilder. There's no doubt in my mind that no other actors could have made these roles work as well as Mostel and Wilder did and especially when you consider the chemistry that they have together. The two of them really do seem like a life-long comic team because they just work so well off one another as if they have been making pictures for decades! The two of them really deliver some great laughs throughout the picture. You've also got Lee Meredith who is a lot of fun as the sexy secretary.<br/><br/>Brooks certainly handles the material quite well and the film for the most part is rather laid back. It's more of an ""intelligent"" comedy that some of the more visual comedies that the director would do in the following decade.

While both movies are very similar, I enjoyed this version better, the period seemed more appropriate.<br/><br/>When you see a show like this, you do so for the acting and production numbers, not for the story. This is the movie version of the hit Broadway play, and has the look and feel of a stage musical. The performances are very good, the musical numbers excellent, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>The story is the same as in the other movie. Producer Max Bialystock hardly ever has a successful show. While being audited, the CPA Leo Bloom casually mentions that Max might actually make more money with a flop that opens and closes the same night, and just keeping the up front money that he convinces all his little old lady followers to cough up.

Max and Leo set out to find the absolute worst script, the worst actors, and the worst director, while raising $1Million.

And the worst stage play ever written is the incredibly tasteless ""Springtime for Hitler"", penned by an unrepentant nazi (Kenneth Mars) as a romp in the Third Reich for the 'lovable' clique of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and all the other sordid characters that ""Franz Liebkind"", the nutty Nazi, loves to the time.<br/><br/>But Bialystok and Bloom, both obviously Jewish, have to 'seduce' the crazy nazi into believing that they have empathy with Liebkind's desire to express his love for the Fuehrer and his cause, even to the point of wearing swastika armbands that they despise in his presence.<br/><br/>The casting for a ""Hitler"" finds a hippie-like actor who can't hold a tune or even make sense. The play, above all, is to have its premiere in New York City, a place where one would expect an audience only slightly less sympathetic to Nazis than Tel Aviv.<br/><br/>Bialystok tries to offend the critics by offering a small bribe small enough to insult the critic. The play opens with anticlimax with stale music, bad lyrics, and an incompetent dance scene. Some dancers have tasteless headdresses (including a beer stein and a pretzel). The introductory dance scene incorporates the goose step and in the end a salute with artillery.<br/><br/>Nothing could be a more certain failure -- but it SUCCEEDS!

Brooks' satire on the show business profession can bring tears to your eyes in some scenes. The entire plot and the tongue in cheek style of the film makes the movie all around hilarious.

This is Mel Brooks first film and although he had won an Academy award for a cartoon and had been a big name in television as a writer and director I don't think he had enough film clout to sustain this in the theaters very long and it probably had a short run on the big screen and disappeared to turn up on late nigh TV movies. It did go on to win Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and a nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor for 1968 but the film was released on March 19, 1968 and it didn't win it's Oscar until April 14, 1969 so it was long gone from the theaters by then. I first saw it a couple years after its release on a late night movie on TV. I immediately loved it in a cult-like way you catch onto some movies. I'd then always look for it to be on TV and catch it every time I could. Brooks of course would go on to direct such classic comedies as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and High Anxiety in a film career as an actor/writer/lyricist/producer/director. It's the story of a Broadway producer and his accountant who come up with a plan to get enough people to over invest in a play that will close after a single performance that they can walk away with a profit.

"Sargebri","Null","1","1","12 March 2006"," A Classic Farce
","This is definitely one of the greatest farces in the history of film. Of course, this could only come from the mind of one of the greatest masters of farce, Mel Brooks. The whole idea of purposely putting on a flop to make money could only come from Brooks' mind and not only that, to have the plot revolve around Adolph Hitler is still very shocking to this day. However, Brooks pulled it off and created a classic. Also, the casting of this film was sheer genius. Zero Mostel is perfect as Max and Gene Wilder as Leo was genius as well. In fact, his characterization of Leo would pretty much be his trademark for years to come. Also, Dick Shawn puts in what is perhaps his best performance since his appearance in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. He really shines as the overage hippie L.S.D.. This film is truly a classic."
"EUyeshima","9","1","1","11 March 2006"," Still a Classic with Brooks, Wilder and Zero in Peak Form
","I have seen the smash hit Broadway musical version with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. While I love the update and added music and schtick, I have to say that I still prefer the original 1968 film upon which the show is based, the first movie Mel Brooks ever directed. By now, the story of two producers seeking to profit from a Broadway flop is familiar, but the concept is still priceless. The comedy scenes are original and nonstop, and unlike Brooks' later films, they actually seem to feed a solid, original storyline that does not take its inspiration from other films.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel, with his greasy comb-over and heavy-lidded, bugged-out eyes, is the ideal choice to play has-been theatrical producer Max Bialystock. Though larger than life as always, he seems downright subdued at times compared to the sideshow of characters surrounding him. Somehow the thought of Mostel as a paid lothario for wealthy old ladies stretches beyond the bounds of credibility and taste, all the more reason to guffaw at his antics in securing investment money for his big production. With his saucer-eyed innocence and apologetic demeanor, Gene Wilder is equally hilarious as nebbish accountant Leo Bloom. All the familiar mannerisms are there, but in his first major film appearance, he seems just right in expressing first his disdain for Max's unsavory business practices and then his excitement in breaking out of his shell when he realizes he's about to become a big Broadway producer.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are among Brooks' most creative concoctions - the Hitler auditions; the too-close-for-comfort elevator ride with mincing assistant Carmen Giya; the euphoria Leo feels when he becomes corrupted as he skips around the Lincoln Center fountain; and of course, the elaborate opening number of the musical that Max and Leo hope will flop, ""Springtime for Hitler"". I still think the audience response immediately after the number is priceless, among Brooks' best shots, especially when the one guy who applauds is attacked. The entire supporting cast is great - the underrated Kenneth Mars as devoted Führer-loving Franz Liebkind, a pre-""Mr. Belvedere"" Christopher Hewitt as the over-dramatic transvestite director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla (given several unrelated opportunities to go-go dance in a bikini - predating Goldie Hawn on TV's ""Laugh-In"") and even Dick Shawn in full hippie-dippy mode as the star of the show, L.S.D. Although there are certain touches that date the film including Shawn's character, there is a sense of quaintness and even sweetness about it that does make you sad it has such a brief running time (90 minutes). There is a film version of the Broadway musical in the works, but I still think this movie stands on its own and continues to get better over the years. A deserved comedy classic."
"NYC Lion","Null","1","1","22 November 2002"," Hitler as Comedy
","First, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder played their characters with genius. ""Over the top"", for sure, but in an exceedingly entertaining way. I'm surprised when folks criticize their portrayals and go on to praise Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. ""Over the top"" is Mel Brooks' endearing style. So, if you laughed at Frau Blucher, Igor, Mongo, Hedley LaMarr and Lili Von Shtupp, you'll be right at home with Bialystock and Bloom.<br/><br/>Second, its easy to understand that some folks have a difficult time with Hitler/Nazis as comedy. For the rest of us, comedy is born from adversity. Mel Brooks understands that laughter and ridicule are the best ways to disarm your enemy's ability to continue to terrorize you. Even in WWII, it was deemed wise to trivialize Hitler in political cartoons. The Producers gives us a more frivolous version of Chaplin's Great Dictator. ""Survivor humor"" is, and always has been, everywhere. Hitler has no special reprieve from ridicule. On the contrary, as Franz Liebkind points out, laughing at Hitler is a disgrace to his memory. And that should be good enough for all of us.<br/><br/>For those of you that enjoy a funny movie with wonderful acting, I highly recommend this flick. I just watched it again and it has weathered the years, like it's brothers Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, without becoming ""dated"".<br/><br/>As an aside to the commentators that were personally offended by this movie because of their direct connection to the horrors of WWII, I was at the World Trade Center on 9/11 and I can't imagine anything funny about that day and the events surrounding it. Nevertheless, something tells me that, someday, someone with find something humorous in that disaster and, maybe, that's not such a bad thing."

","One of my favorite lines from ""The Producers,"" was the one where Max Bialystock read the play about the man who turned into a giant cockaroack, and said ""It's too good."" How can you go wrong there? As for Roger DeBris's secretary/lover, I'd like to know if Mel Brooks named him after the Volkswagen Karman Ghia, and just changed the spelling, because until I saw this movie, whenever I heard the words ""Karman Ghia,"" I thought of the car. Furthermore, Lorenzo St. DuBois's song ""Love Power,"" was butchered on the soundtrack. I know it was played for laughs, but it's still a halfway decent song. I'm surprised that some band never did a remake of it.  This movie IS one of the funniest of all time, and had an incredible impact on me as well. On occasions where I've visited Lincoln Center in NYC, I've had to fight the temptation to prance around the water fountain  and shout ""I'LL DO IT!!,"" at the top of my lungs. I wouldn't be surprised if other people have done things like that over there."

A very young Gene Wilder gives a great performance as the repressed accountant Leo Bloom who literally ""blooms"" under the tutelage of the exuberant Max.  Leo is going over Max's books when he discovers that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than with a hit. The search is on for a sure-fire flop, and a script written by former Nazi soldier Franz Leibman (played to the hilt by Kenneth Mars)called ""Springtime for Hitler"" is chosen.

They go to great lengths finding the perfect script which will translate into a play which will last for only one show.

An actor who has come for the wrong audition is selected as Adolf Hitler and the play is shown on Broadway. Written and directed by the comic genius Mel Brooks, the movie starts a bit slowly and then picks up pace after Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder join hands. The movie belongs to Mostel who is excellent as the producer who frauds old women for love and takes money for them. Gene Wilder, in one of his early roles, is a bit over the top. Dick Shawn as LSD, the actor who plays Hitler, is amazingly funny. The songs are good. However, i found the humor to be a bit forced at some moments. The movie is still pretty decent fun.

"ElMaruecan82","9","2","4","13 March 2012"," So ... can we laugh about everything?
","On that question, one of the most notorious politically incorrect French comedians, Pierre Desproges provided the most overused answer: ""Yes, but not with everybody."" In other words, the most racist joke has to make a non-racist person laugh without creating a bond with a racist one. See? The distance between the content of his joke and its author must be evident. A bit oppressive isn't it? Or maybe we can all agree that humor essentially depends on the intelligence of the listener.<br/><br/>With all its racism, sexism and inner vulgarity, the intelligence of ""The Producers"" is that it works on a self-reflexive way as each joke might get the two sorts of reaction that the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"" inspired on the stage audience: a slack-jawed shock or cheerful applauds. But that's what the ""not with anyone"" means in my opinion, you trust the intelligence of the viewer enough to believe he can see behind the laughs where your opinions lies, and that making fun of something is also part of a subtle exercise of self-derision.<br/><br/>Was it really necessary to show Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) removing the Nazi armband, putting it in the trashcan and spitting on it. Maybe as a reminder of the Nazi's barbarity but I thought that bit sinned by underestimating our capability to read between the lines. Anyway, apart from that moment, ""The Producers"" remains one of the funniest films ever made carried by the incredible Mostel and Wilder duo, ""The Producers"" outshines whatever defined humor in the sappy 60's : it's outrageous, irreverent, naughty and so blatantly amoral that calling it 'politically incorrect' is the understatement of the century.<br/><br/>""The Producers"" pulverizes all the barriers of good taste with a daringness that flirts with genius in its incredible mix between a chaotic hysteria and a perfect comical timing. The scene where Leo Bloom frenetically screams ""I'm hysterical"" before Max throws water on him and then shouts ""I'm hysterical and I'm wet!"", the whole scene punctuated with so many unintelligible noises is some of the funniest pieces of comical acting ever made and maybe a landmark in comedy. When the water comes out of the fountain after Leo Bloom decides to have ""everything that's in the movies"" feels like exultation, an orgasmic liberation from every principle ruled by the movies through a hilarious hymn for selfishness and greed.<br/><br/>The selfish and greedy one is Max, influenced by his new accountant and future accomplice, he decides to raise money to produce a flop in order to make the greatest benefit. The most likely play to flop, is a musical comedy about Hitler, a ""love-letter to Hitler"" written by a manic Nazi nostalgic wonderfully played by Kenneth Mars. And to be sure the play will fail; they take the worst director of all the showbiz, Roger De Bris, played by Christopher Hewett. It's a real delight to see Otto from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Mr. Belvedere"" in such hilarious performances, ""The Producers"" is served by a wonderful gallery of supporting performances where everyone has a moment to shine, even Ulla, the sexy Swedish receptionist whose name rhymed with Oh-lalaaaaa.<br/><br/>Asking how they got away with calling a woman a 'toy' is pointless because the real question is how they got away with the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"" and this swastika choreography that concludes it with Hitler's picture? Well, I feel that there are two reasons: right and wrong.<br/><br/>Right first: by ridiculing even the most atrocious aspect of human history, you stop turning it into a sort of sanctified taboo. Humor becomes the true barometer of freedom of speech and if we can make fun of God, politics and sex, why should there be barriers even in the 'dark side'. As Mel Brooks said, the 'movie rose below vulgarity' it's so deliberately crude and vulgar that it never cease to mix the amazement with the enjoyment. The spirit of Mel Brooks is what differentiates mean-spirited propaganda and true slapstick, to the Donald Duck fans, between ""Commando Duck"" a bad cartoon with no other purpose than mocking the Japanese culture and the masterpiece ""Der Fuerher's Face"".<br/><br/>Now, what was the bad reason that spared an accusation of bad taste : because only Jewish people could have made fun of Nazis and even of Jewish people with such audacity, without being accused of anti-Semitism. After all, the portrayal of Max's greed exploits some stereotypes that even the Nazis used in their propaganda, if you don't take them into perspective. Many would discuss this argument but didn't Sacha Boren Cohen invoke his own ethnic background to justify the Anti-Semitism displayed in ""Borat"" as a running joke.<br/><br/>While I understand that never a gentle director would have dared to make such a movie, I totally disapprove the setting of racial barriers in humor, with its tacit rule to make fun only of our own ethnic background. It politicizes comedy and set rules when the very purpose of humor is to be deprived from anything except the capability to make people laugh. There's no way to avoid critics because the line between being offensive and funny will always be uncertain, but that's the subversion of humor. Many comedians were labeled as racist when they mocked some communities, as if the translation of ""yes, but not with anyone"" became ""not by anyone"" which distorts the very principles of humor.<br/><br/>""Can we laugh about everything?"" I guess the answer is in the question, if we laugh, then it's funny. If we're intelligent enough to get it, then we can make a difference between insults and jokes, between mockery and mean-spiritedness, and to those who can't, I recommend ""The Producers"" as the greatest fertilizer to grow a sense of humor in the field of their constipated minds."

We'll never know, but this is the first time I have come across abysmal spelling!<br/><br/>Now for the film, which was Mel Brooks first, and best, even if it at times shows that the budget was small. The acting is brilliant by everyone; from minor roles like the character Goebbles, played by David Patch, the character Hitler, played by Dick Shawn, to major; as those of Zero Mostel (THE producer), Gene Wilder (the accountant) and Kenneth Mars (Nazi immigrant who has written a play about Hitler, called Springtime for Hitler), which the director de Bris (played by Christoffer Hewitt) turns into a musical!!!<br/><br/>But we have a smattering of minor roles, such as the dumb Swedish blonde Ulla, excellently played by Lee Meredith (if not Swedish one bit!), to old dear ladies wanting a bit of sexual excitement with Zero, et cetera, et cetera.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel has the most expressive face I ever seen - a true gem! Gene Wilder never gets better, but that is very good indeed, while Kenneth Mars' acting is second to none, in this one of the funniest film ever!<br/><br/>Notwithstanding some goofs (like before Mostel and Wilder are allowed to visit de Bris' flat they are forced to take off their shoes, and yet when they sit in his den they have their shoes on!), horrible subtitling and one or two other things that could have been better the Producers is worth nine out of ten!"

","In a day when Adam Sandler is called a genius, it makes you feel like a member of a special club to know about the classic comedians of the 60s. The Producers recalls a different time in hollywood comedy, when broad humor didn't mean that the audiences intelligence was insulted.  When comedies weren't required to follow a formula (idiotic man-child meets girl, gets fooled by snobs/crooks, loses girl, beats snobs, gets girl).  It recalls a time when comedy was the refuge of genuinely anarchic personalities.<br/><br/>Only Mel Brooks could think of the story, two crooks devise a plot to steal a million dollars by producing a flop play.  The one that they come up with, Springtime For Hitler, shows up on the screen as a hilarious parody of the overproduced musicals of the 60s.  The wildly unpredictable screenplay is, at times, almost unbearably witty.  Some of the jokes are a bit dated; the hippy actor has intials that spell out LSD, the director's homosexuality is played for laughs (although the jokes are never as cruel as the gay jokes in, say, Revenge of the Nerds); but overall, the jokes still hit.  Most comedy screenplays from 10 or 20 years ago have aged much more poorly.<br/><br/>But the films still wouldn't work nearly so well without its top notch cast. Gene Wilder proves himself to be among the finest comic actors of his generation as the manic depressive accountant.  Zero Mostel, on the other hand, is hilarious as the unscrupulous producer, at times seeming like he is about to explode from greed, lust, and excitement.  The supporting cast is also great, particularly Dick Shawn as LSD.  You might balk at first, seeing the definitely middle aged Shawn playing a jive talking hippy, but both his flower power debut and his hipster portrayal of Hitler are riotous and dead on.<br/><br/>I'm sure that a lot of people, programmed to search for our standard movie formulas and stock jokes, are not going to get it.  I will say you should give it a chance, no matter your age (I'm only 25, so I'm not the target audience here), and maybe you'll find something great."

","""The Producers"" is Mel Brooks' first film - it is also his most original, the only one to win him and Oscar (for Best Screenplay), and to many (myself included), his best. There are certain filmmakers who seem to create their own sort of film with a different style than anyone else (people like Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, for instance), and Brooks is one of these. There isn't anything else that has the ribald, comedic, sarcastic, and overly theatrical tone of a good Mel Brooks film.<br/><br/>This is, in such a sense, Brooks' master work - the film is imbued with a natural theatricality in the way each character is seemingly caricaturized, and the presence of Broadway favorite Zero Mostel in the leading role just adds to the effect.<br/><br/>The movie is of course, about a play - a work entitled ""Springtime for Hitler"" (a spring with Hitler and his lover Eva, showing the Fuhrer's lighter side), which ought to tell you everything you need to know about the sense of humor necessary to enjoy such a movie. The movie is full of blatantly (and purposely) tasteless humor - Bialystock (Mostel), a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, raises funds by wooing little old ladies whom he refers to with such names as ""Hold Me, Touch Me"". His partner, Bloom (Gene Wilder), is pretty much a full-blown wimp who still carries around a ""blue blankie"", and together they make quite a pair.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast fills out nicely - Kenneth Mars as the yammering German Franz Liebchen, full of love for ""you-know-who"" and no grip whatsoever on reality, Christopher Hewitt as the flambloyant director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as Ulla, the secretary who speaks no English, Dick Shawn as Lorenzo Saint-DuBois (or, as his friends call him, L.S.D.), an hippie actor who ends up playing Hitler, and excellent cameos from the likes of Estelle Winwood and Burgess Meredith.<br/><br/>It would be amiss to talk about this film now and not mention the current hit show actually on Broadway. The play is, to be honest, probably a bit better. The majority of the best one-liners and scenes remain, but the play fits even better into Brooks' theatrical, over-the-top stylings (indeed, at times the play goes so far over the top as to not be in the same atmosphere as normal entertainment, such as the character of Carmen Ghia in the play). The Broadway adaptation features a slightly different storyline and drops the character of L.S.D. altogether, but it comes out as a more entertaining production than the film. That said, and with apologies to Matthew Broderick and (especially the excellent) Nathan Lane, Mostel and Wilder play these characters better than their newer counterparts, so there is a bit of a balance.<br/><br/>The film itself stand alone, and is definitely worth seeing, not only for the greatest musical number ever to grace film stock (also named ""Springtime for Hitler), but for the entertaining feel and pace of the film."

In his scene which is only about 10 minutes long it is fantastic to watch the trust develop between the naive, emotionally withdrawn Bloom and the flawed but charismatic Biallystock.

","It is often said that the greatest way to get back at someone is to make fun of them in a way that they don't know they are being made fun of. The Producers takes this premise and spits on it. Mel Brooks was a writer for ""Sid Caesar's Show of Shows"" and ""Get Smart"" before penning his first movie, The Producers. Brooks, who is Jewish (and if you didn't know that, you should have your head examined), used his big chance to get back at the enemy of the Jewish people, Hitler. The Producers unapologetically makes fun of not only Hitler, but how people would react to a Broadway play devoted to the dictator. Not only a smart and funny movie, The Producers features great acting by Zero Mostell as play producer Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder as accountant Leo Bloom who makes the mistake of finding out that a play that flops could make more money than a Broadway hit. This leads to the conning of little old ladies to invest in a play called ""Springtime for Hitler."" The play is directed by the flamboyant and terrible Roger De Bris, played by future Mr. Belvedere Christopher Hewitt, and written by ex-German army officer Franz Liebkind, played by Kenny Mars. The problem? The play actually turns out to be a hit, ruining the plans of Bialystock and Bloom and perhaps saying Hitler can be a commercial success, if in the hands of the right people. Mel Brooks makes fun of Hitler in all of his movies, but makes it a critical plot point in his first movie. Brooks would then go on to write a Broadway musical version of The Producers 30 years after the movie came out and won critical and audience approval. A movie version of the musical is due out in 2005, making it a movie version of a play version of a movie based on a play. Got that?"

In the process they pick up the worst show ever written 'Springtime for Hitler' showing Hitler, his intentions and accomplishments in a bad taste. After they select equally superlative bad choices for director, actors etc.. they were just waiting for the show to get burned the first day and spend the money made out of it.

","All of Brooks' movies are basically one joke. The joke in this first film was arguably his best one to date: no wonder it got adapted and then remade. Unfortunately the execution here is often subpar. It isn't like an early Woody Allen, where the bad jokes just fly by with the good. It's slow-moving schtick, and it's often overplayed as if the actors weren't even sure what kind of shot they were supposed to be in. There are some flat spots and an a-w-f-u-l lot of setup before the heart of the joke, the play itself. After staging this hilarious topper (and it's even cleverer than you expect) there's not much for Brooks to do except try to find an even funnier way to get out of the movie, which he doesn't quite do. A few scenes, like the one with the secretary, also run on and on long after you've got the joke. Was this because the newcomer deferred too much to his actors, especially Mostel? Brooks' later films are cut faster and are often funnier. But overall this was still a pretty impressive debut and worth seeing once. Hewitt and Voutsinas were funny, I didn't care as much for Mars though I don't see how else the part could have been played. Mostel is all over the place. Wilder's underplaying saves the day."

","I saw this movie in anticipation of the new one and the Broadway play. It was disappointing after hearing about how great the play was. because Mel Brooks didn't use as many jokes as he normally does, and the two stars of the movie, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, were not as good as they could be. Neither of them had very many quirks, except for Mostel's sexual quirk, which is almost completely ignored in the whole movie except the beginning. A couple of rare moments in the movie shined, however, with Mel Brooks-type quirks. One example is the audition for the part of Adolf Hitler with many hysterical freaks trying to do what they think is excellent but truly pathetic. It ends with LSD's audition, which is funny as $#**! The other part is the Busby Berkely opening of the musical, making fun of Nazis, etc. However, towards the end the movie starts to seem more like a semi-adventure movie, which doesn't fit any of the movie's makers at all."

","With his business basically in the toilet after yet another flop, producer Max Bialystock has taken to extorting old women for small cheques. A visit by accountant Leo Bloom and an off hand remark about insurance puts a plan in Max's mind. With Leo he plans to gather a large amount of investment to produce a play that will be a sure fire flop and claim the insurance money when it closes on the first night; the only risk being that, if it makes money, then they will be in debt to all their investors and be charged with fraud. To make totally sure of a flop they decide on the most tasteless film they can possibly find, the worst director and the most unsuitable cast and, thou, the curtain is soon raising on ""Springtime for Hitler"", a musical about the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>With the play making headlines recently for big name starts dropping out of the London production (despite a great reception) I decided to rewatch the film again. As with my other viewings, I found the film to be consistently amusing with a handful of great moments but generally unworthy of the high regard that many seem to hold it in. The plot is a great concept and it produces the high point of the film with the wonderfully tasteless title song of the show, but too much of the humour is rather broad  and not in the way of Brooks' better spoofs but rather broad as in being generally amusing. The script lacks a real sharp edge to it and I didn't find myself laughing that many times even if I did find it to be consistently pretty enjoyable stuff.<br/><br/>The cast are a big reason that it keeps this tone going, in particular the lead two, who ham it up for all they are worth in performances that suit the material even if it isn't their best work. Mostel plays it up well and a good chemistry with Wilder who overdoes it in a quieter way. Support is good from Mars, Shawn, Hewett and Hickey. As with the material, they are all very broad and enjoyable without ever really being great.<br/><br/>Overall this is a funny film but not to the degree that some viewers may expect as a result of the high regard it is held in. All those involved have made better films and I found it to be rather broad as both comedy and satire and didn't excel as either. Despite this, the highs compensate for the odd moment where it falls flat and generally the film is a fun and enjoyable 90 minutes."

","Mel Brooks wanted to make a movie about how two producers schemed to make a killing on a sure-flop musical entitled, Springtime for Hitler. The problem was that no one wanted to finance a movie titled, Springtime for Hitler.<br/><br/>After several years of begging, Sidney Glazier agreed to produce it and the money was put up by Joseph Levine, a producer with an international reputation. Like many movies that end up being classics, The Producers was made by people who ended up hating each other (well, except for Gene Wilder, of course). It was a very unhappy eight week shoot in NYC. Then came months of editing. Finally, it was released, sort of. It opened in a small theatre in suburban Philadelphia (Glazier's hometown) where I saw it. There were not a lot of people in the theatre and no one was laughing except for me and a friend who had seen it the night before and dragged me to it the next night.<br/><br/>Then, it was released in New York. Most of the critics didn't get it - they criticized the movie for being about a musical based on the life of Hitler. One critic wondered if they were going to do a musical about cancer next. In spite of the mixed reviews, the movie made money in NYC but was, generally, a flop. The fact that the producers in the movie wanted to produce a sure fire disaster musical as part of their scheme to steal millions and that is why they produced a musical about Hitler was overlooked. A musical about Hitler? This was blasphemy!"
"classicsoncall","7","1","2","8 June 2018"," ""I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!""
","The execution is often over the top and the comedy acting may have an outdated feel, but you have to admit the concept is outrageous. No, not the idea of producing a play that will intentionally flop, but the entire theme of 'Springtime for Hitler'. That is just so outlandish that it would have to work, and to a great extent it did. The choreography and costuming in the play was great, and as hideous as it might seem, the Hitler tune is catchy and stays with you a while after the film is over. The only thing that didn't make sense to me was why Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) offered shares in the play at twenty five, fifty and a hundred percent to Max Bialystock's (Zero Mostel) ardent female admirers. Profits if any would have been distributed on a proportional basis of ownership, so no need to despair on that point. <br/><br/>But that's not the sentiment the film makers were going for. If the producers were to go broke, they had to go broke in a big way. And on the flip side, why would having a hit on your hands be such a big problem? Just take that lemon and make more lemonade with it. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder have good chemistry as the scheming producers, backed up by an eccentric cast of characters led by Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars and Lee Meredith. Meredith's Ulla might have been better named Ooh-la-la, or is that inappropriate to say these days? In any case, this was a funny film that was probably better received back in the day, but still holds up well enough for fans of the principals. <br/><br/>Say, did I get this right - Max bought two hot dogs from a street vendor for half a buck? Now that's outrageous!"

Upon meeting Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the hysterical and insecure accountant, the two come up with the perfect scheme to gain a fortune. This time they have to fail (something they are both good at) by producing a flop rather than a hit.<br/><br/>The producer (1967) was the first film to be directed by Mel Brooks. His debut film is an amusing satire with a mood that makes the viewer lightheartedly go along the wickedness and fraud shown by the main characters. The jokes are rather genuine and the performances help a lot. Many say that the characters scream a lot (especially Wilder), but I only found that to be part of what made his hysterical personality so funny. The gay characters of Roger De Bris (Hewett) and Carmen Ghia (Voutsinas) and the Nazi Franz Liebkind (Mars) added a lot to the hilarious plot. Also, I should say that some of the names and jokes used reflect a witty and culturally knowledgeable Brooks.. (Using the name Prince Myshkin from Dostoyevsky's novel ""The Idiot"", or Carmen Ghia = Karmann Ghia.. etc.)<br/><br/>The film was criticized also for depicting the two main characters Bialystock and Bloom as two Jews that are trying to cheat theatrical investors; an aspect that many found unoffensive and remarkably clever especially when added to the ""Nazi play scheme"" planned for by the protagonists.<br/><br/>Although the film was more shocking back then in the 60s (it is claimed that Peter Sellers had to intervene with the executive producer Joseph E. Levine to convince the studio to release it! And it was released on one condition that is changing the title from Springtime for Hitler to The Producers), it is in fact gaining more and more respect throughout the days. Many critics such as Roger Ebert, consider it one of the funniest movies ever.

Gene Wilder, while quite hilarious himself, frequently got on my nerves with his manic episodes. It was funny the first couple of times, but it annoyed me afterwards. The true star of the film was Dick Shawn, who played the lead actor in the musical 'Springtime for Hitler.' He was such a pleasure to watch. Overall, I would say this is one of the more straightforwardly comedic Mel Brooks films. I certainly laughed more consistently than with his other ones.

Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom plays a hyper-sensitive, anxiety-ridden, security blanket holding accountant who puts ideas in his head for the ultimate scam. Kenneth Mars' Franz Liebkind is a crazy Nazi who probably fears the atrocities in Germany just as much as he praises Adolf. Dick Shawn's L.S.D. is a goofy flower child who vainly tries to sound and act hip. Lee Meredith's Ulla is sexy eye candy; like Leo Bloom, you can't keep your eyes off of her.<br/><br/>Scenes like Bialystock seducing octogenarian women, the hundred or so men doing ""Heil Hitler"" at the audition or L.S.D.'s terrible singing are classic comedy. As for the play itself, the opening is very entertaining; especially the Swastika dance. The scenes with L.S.D. seem to come off as Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In to me, though that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>All in all, a very entertaining film and deserving of its Oscars.

It's a scene that looks so great, that Brooks placed it as the final scene of the end credits. It's really hard to hate a Mel Brooks film, and this is no exception.

"secondtake","7","1","2","10 May 2011"," Clever, bald, crazy, fast, funny and funny!
","The Producers (1968)<br/><br/>I had forgotten how really funny parts of this movie are. It sometimes is too shouty for me, or a little just obvious in its step by stepping through disaster, but Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are truly amazing, both outrageous and subtle, a stunning combination.<br/><br/>It might be hard to view the movie in the light of 1968. It has some of the 1960s mad-cap element, mixed with Jewish Broadway humor, with a dash of New Hollywood liberalism thrown in. Influences of late Billy Wilder and early Woody Allen can't be dismissed, but in a way this is Mel Brooks himself coming to his own. His background in Catskills resort stand-up is clear, but he interweaves a cogent plot in a way that we'll see many times later, almost with a Marx Brothers logic (or illogic?). No, call it logic. This movie depends on actually making absurd sense in the end.<br/><br/>Mostel of course had a whole incredible career of his own, including in Woody Allen's ""The Front"" in 1976. And Wilder has a kind of legendary fame for his leading role in ""Willy Wonka"" in 1971 (though his career had a small kick from the seminal ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in 1967). <br/><br/>In some ways the over the top (of course) idiosyncrasies of two side kicks help make the film the farce it is. Dick Shawn as a kind of drugged out Elvis imitator named L.S.D. (playing Hitler of course) is perfect, and so is Kenneth Mars as the German/Nazi/writer who had the whole idea of ""Springtime for Hitler"" in the first place. If you aren't laughing through some of these scenes you have a gene missing for this kind of New York hilarity.<br/><br/>The movie has taken on a different meaning now that the actually Broadway version (not a flop) was a fixture there for six (six!) years. The irony is plain, but the talent even more so. The movie is a funny take on the times (unlike the play, which is set in the 1950s) and so has a weird kind of authenticity to it. Not that you care one bit. It's just belly laughs all the way."
"ingemar-4","8","1","2","10 April 2008"," A fun movie with some visible holes in the plot
","I understand that this movie was a hit, and I did enjoy it very much. Mostel and Wilder are truly great, and the idea behind the plot is superb.<br/><br/>There are, however, a few weak points. The biggest one is the mystery how Bialystock first have to court old ladies to barely earn a living, and then suddenly can swindle them of a fortune. There is no obvious reason. Why would he need to produce anything if the old ladies are naive enough to invest in a play that they haven't even seen the script for? If, on the other hand, they had started with a first-rate script, sold too many shares on THAT, and then do all they can to make a flop out of it, that would have been much more logical. Without the bad script, we would not have the mad writer (Kenneth Mars), but the plot would have been convincing. I have read at least one story based on The Producers that avoids those logical problems.<br/><br/>The other total lunatics, like deBris (Christopher Hewett) all make sense (and over-act as they should), and how deBris and the actors can fit together to make the result a hit is quite sensible.<br/><br/>A second weak point is Ulla (Lee Meredith) the blond bimbo. She is a cliché that adds nothing to the movie, she is not fun but only makes me sad. Of course her presence is a result of Bialystock's strange ideas of luxury, but just finding a complete idiot like her is too unlikely. She could possibly have been part of the play (as Eva Braun?), but as a pet secretary she is only offending.<br/><br/>There is one more weak point. The turning from flop to success, by actors performing a high school student level farce is not convincing. Rather, the grandiose opening was more likely to work as something so superbly overdone that it becomes a good satire. So when the play goes from grandiosely overdone musical to cheaply improvised amateur play, that is not the point where I expect the audience to start loving it. They could possibly start smiling at a bit of simplistic farce, and THEN get enthusiastic at how it fits with the music numbers, but not the other way around. Or is the audience that easy to please? But I take this problem as a problem with time; it would take too much time to show high-class humor with tension and perfect timing.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the actors (and most likely first-class direction of them) carry this movie. Mostel, Wilder, Hewett and most others (even most smaller roles) do terrific acts that add up to a very enjoyable movie and I can choose to ignore the logical errors."

The storyline works really well and Gene Wilder steals the show really but Zero Mostel holds it up really well. This show has got a lot of good things in it 1. Mel Brooks famous humour is very clear while it being probably his smartest movie.2. The storyline is the best out of a lot of movies and 3. It is very very original.

Gene Wilder is a book keeper who just happens to suggest a way to make money by cooking the books & deliberately producing a failure of a play. Mostell, desperate enough to grab at straws, grabs this one & tries to really produce a stinker.<br/><br/>The only thing that goes wrong is that by trying to screw everything up, they accidentally make the play funny & in the process a hit. This is white collar crime in the 1960's, simple & funny unlike today when white collar crime has made this type of crime look like something from the age of innocence.<br/><br/>The material in this is good enough the Brooks managed to recycle it all, but as far as this film & its newer incarnation, this one is the better one."

I plugged it into my DVD player, turned it on, and boy was I in for a surprise. It is nothing like the new version. OK, they are the same story, but the original is so much better than the old one.

Growing up I would hear of this film through older siblings and older family friends. Genius, they called it. Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin agreed, and, at the tender age of 14, I was impressionable. My hopes were set pretty high, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I was completely let down. My 14 year-old self said: ""This is supposed to be better than Young Frankenstein? Really?"" I thought Mssrs. Ebert and Maltin were yanking my chain. It was amusing in fits and starts, and Gene Wilder, as always, was wonderful, but... Where were the belly laughs? Where was the offending material? <br/><br/>The film follows Max Bialystock, a washed-up Broadway producer, who hits upon a scheme with wallflower accountant Leo Bloom that will fleece rich old women of their fortunes as they (the old women) fund a sure-fire flop--""Springtime for Hitler."" It's a clever plot for a comedy, especially for a comedy produced in the late 1960s, but the humor is dated methinks. In 1968, the film might have been outrageous; today, it seems tame. It's still amusing and there's a chuckle here and there, but it doesn't hold up next to Young Frankenstein, a vastly superior comedy by Mr. Brooks. <br/><br/>I appreciate Mel's attempts to integrate allusions to Modernist fiction (Joyce and Kafka make appearances sort of) into a film reveling in adolescent humor, but I think it needs to take its humor an additional step. The musical numbers in Springtime still evoke a hearty laugh, but the buxom Ulla, well, isn't funny. Bialystock's trysts with old women seem quaint these days too. What Brooks once described as rising below vulgarity doesn't seem vulgar at all to these younger and, perhaps, more jaded eyes (and don't get me started on that Brooks quote--it's not clever but condescending and pretentious). <br/><br/>The Producers is good enough, but it wouldn't be until Young Frankenstein that Mel Brooks made a masterpiece--unfortunately, his only one.

Filmed on a pittance using real Manhattan locations (less than $1 million, cheap even by Sixties standards), THE PRODUCERS almost died unrecognized until it became a cult hit in New York, L.A., Chicago and then, everywhere.<br/><br/>**SPOILER GRAFS: The plot is brilliantly diabolical: a corrupt Broadway producer (Zero Mostel) and his nebbishy accountant assistant (Gene Wilder) deliberately oversell a play with the design to create a flop and keep the proceeds. They hire the worst possible playwright, director, and choreographer and deliberately insult the drama critics. But ""Springtime for Hitler"" is so hilariously awful it becomes awfully hilarious. The essence of 1960s camp: It's good because it's so bad.<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate just how good Mel Brooks' first movie is. The Manhattan location shooting, though prompted by fiscal restraints, ironically results in a fresh, not cosmetized look of the Big Apple. (Compare this to the 2005 movie, which goes to great lengths to present Manhattan in the ""indeterminate past,"" with every street dressed in circa-1957 cars and Checker cabs.) The premise of a play about ""Adolf and Eva in a gay romp at Berchtesgaden"" was, if anything, more offensive just 23 years after the end of the Second World War than it is today. Although this is his first movie, Brooks was already a fifteen-year veteran of the comic art, particularly TV (such as GET SMART). Essentially he throws hilarious comic brickbats at all the excesses and absurdities of show-biz and American social standards in the Sixties: among the sent-up are hippies, pretentious *artistes* both gay and straight, nutty Nazis, avaricious producers, trite and overblown Broadway spectacles, and folks who can't do without their blue blankies. A big gamble on Brooks' part, but it played. **END SPOILERS GRAFS.<br/><br/>Even so, it's doubtful that this over-the-top confection would have triumphed without top-notch players. Zero Mostel is spot-on as the blustering Broadway producer forced to seduce little old ladies to finance his shows; this is Gene Wilder's first movie but you wouldn't know it from the dead-certain tone of comic near-hysteria he rocks the movie with. Add to it Lee Meredith as a ditsy Swedish secretary, Kenneth Mars as a Nazi playwright hiding out in lower Manhattan, and the wonderful Dick Shawn as ""LSD,"" the hippie who auditions with a Campbell's soup can around his neck, and I am not ashamed to invoke the old saying, ""A comic *tour de force*.""<br/><br/>The ""deluxe"" version of the DVD costs several dollars more but contains an engaging documentary about the making of the movie, and cinema cast notes and stills, goodies that are notably missing from the cheaper, ""movie only"" version. It's not too surprising that the 2005 musicalized version with Matthrew Broderick and Nathan Lane, while good, is no match for this movie. Enjoy!"

To direct the play they hire the worst director they can find, Roger De Bris who selects Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D.) (Dick Shawn) a stoned aging hippie to play Hitler.

Mostel was born for the part of the obnoxious Bialystock and Wilder looks like he's always been the timid accountant. Add the absolutely crazy Nazi Kenneth Mars and Dick Shawn's riotous parody of flower-power hippies to the cast of already lunatic characters. The musical numbers for Springtime for Hitler with chorus girls dressed as giant pretzels and beer steins are probably the funniest ever filmed. The Producers easily gets my vote for the funniest film ever made."

"esdavis","Null","1","2","28 August 2001"," Mel's Best Film? *contains spoilers*
","Mel Brook's has always been a favorite director of mine, not because I believe him to be a genius, but because 90% of his work is side-splittingly hilarious.  Only after seeing The Producers, Mel's first film, did I realize how much of an impressive director he is. Not only is the movie wildly amusing, it's perhaps the one of the most well written farces of all time.  It certainly is Mel's most skillfully written film, possibly surpassed only by 1974's Young Frankenstein.<br/><br/>
Max Bialystock (Mostel) is a washed up New York producer whose last attempts to fund his business involve the seducing of elderly women.  All seems lost, until his neurotic accountant (Wilder) gives him an idea. After raising millions of dollars for a play that is a sure-fire flop, they can keep the remaining funds when it tanks on opening night.  The two quickly develop an outlandish friendship and rummage around for the most appalling play they can find.  Salvation is found in what seems to be the crudest play of all time, `Springtime For Hitler'.  After recruiting an abnormal director, and the worst actors ever to grace the stage, Max and Leo assume they've closed the deal.  There's only one problem `Springtime For Hitler' turns out to be a hit.<br/><br/>
Gene Wilder received an Oscar nomination for his work as Leo Bloom, and it was completely deserved.  His quirky antics as the nervous accountant easily stand the test of time, providing a character that's very pleasurable.  On the other end of the spectrum, Zero Mostel was a gluttonous, self-centered, greedy shmuck whose schemes never acquiesce, even in prison.  In other words, he was superb.  No one else could have fit the huge, in more ways than one, role of Max Bialystock.  Highly amusing characters makeup the rest of the cast, from Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) as the sadistic author of Springtime For Hitler, to Ulla (Lee Meredith) Max and Leo's slightly under-qualified secretary.  Every supporting actor gives a top-notch performance in The Producers.<br/><br/>
The screenplay is fantastic for a comedy of this kind.  The character interaction is brilliant, especially between Zero and Gene.  The scenes were a little choppy, and the picture didn't have the blazing fast pace later Brook's films provided.  Brook's himself, wrote the songs including `Springtime For Hitler', proving that his writing talents are slightly superior to his directing abilities.  He won the Oscar for best original screenplay, but wasn't nominated for best director. Still, this movie is nothing to complain about.  It's drop dead hilarious, extremely witty, and a must see for anyone who loves a brilliant laugh-fest. B"

","So far, 5 people have written a bad comment about ""The Producers"" (one person said it was mediocre). The major complaint of these 5 people is that they don't find it funny. YOU, the movie-lover unsure whether or not to see this film, should not judge the movie by this statement. Funniness is very subjective, so even if these 5 people didn't find ""The Producers"" funny, YOU still might.<br/><br/>But at least one of these comments included that the two stars were overacting.

Zany, hilariously bizarre spoofs like ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Spaceballs"", ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"", etc. And I think that this film is also one of those zany, hilariously bizarre spoofs. All the overacting, the shouting, the kooky actions, the hilarious one-liners - all this is Mel Brooks experimenting with this particular genre of comedy.<br/><br/>This film is not to be taken seriously.

","I love this movie.  It is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it IS something that must be seen to be beleived.  Overall, the first 3/4 of the movie is absolutely fantastic, and the final 1/4 approaches the sublime. However, the movie does miss a few spots here and there and there are quite a few jokes that were probably a lot funnier in '68 than they are now (this film does not translate as well as Blazing Saddles, but is still a damn funny movie).  <br/><br/>Ultimately, none of that stuff really matters, as the only truly important part could justify the rest of the film being a blank screen... the performance of Springtime for Hitler is, quite simply, one of the most beautifully absurd things that the world has ever been witness to.  This one single scene was so vulgar and hilarious and offensive that many were paralyzed over how to react to it when it was released (much like the audience in the film itself).  You may find yourself having to rewind it several times in order to catch all of the wonderfully obscene lyrics (not South Park obscene, just obscene), but you will find it worth your while.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Brooks seems to back down from his initial premise and softens the blow of the play a bit with some cheap shots at the 60s counter-culture (not that there is really anything but cheap shots to take at hippies, but he does it anyway).  The film achieves truly sublime humor for a few minutes and then falls back into a pretty standard (if inspired and somewhat brilliant) comedy.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth seeing, perhaps several times."

When things can't get any worse he's about to be audited when drone little accountant Leo Bloom shows up in his office and starts going over the books. <br/><br/>If this had been a Looney Toons cartoon the light bulb would have been over Mostel's head and flashing as Gene Wilder as Bloom explains how with a little creative accounting one can make lots of money off a flop show. Then it's off to go out and try to create the biggest flop in the history of Broadway. Something no one has ever actually tried for in the history of the theater itself.<br/><br/>Certain films are seminal moments in the history of the genre. In comedy two previous ones in my opinion could be It Happened One Night and Some Like It Hot. Both by creative geniuses Frank Capra and Billy Wilder and both radically different films. Mel Brooks put himself in that category with The Producers. And like another genius David O. Selznick spent the rest of his career producing good film, even great ones but never topped his first and best.<br/><br/>All I can say is that when the film opens with that Springtime For Hitler number done in Busby Berkeley style you'll react like Brooks's theater audience did and say he succeeded. But if The Producers teaches us anything it is that flops are born, not made.<br/><br/>Brooks put together a perfect cast in support of Mostel and Wilder. Standing out are Dick Shawn as the method acting Hitler, Kenneth Mars as the crazy Naxi author, and Christopher Hewett as the worst director on Broadway who takes a real liking to Wilder.<br/><br/>The Producers got an Oscar nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor.

","Mel Brooks 1967 ""The Producers"" was way ahead of its time in terms of of zany, satirical comedy. It is utterly hilarious almost entirely throughout &, for my money, is THE champion mick-take film of all time. Mr. Brooks never spared anyone in his comedy films, of course. All were fair game but in this film Adolf Hitler & his Nazi party are taken to the cleaners & hung out to dry. So too homosexuals. The movie's premise is that Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) & Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) are trying to produce an almighty musical flop on Broadway after selling 100 per cent of its shares ten times over. After it's first night it should bomb so catastrophically that it will close, but they will make a bomb financially. So they search for the worst musical play they can find ""Springtime For Hitler"" written by a crazy ex-Nazi soldier (played by Kenneth Mars) living in New York. When they meet him for the first time he rambles on extolling Adolf Hitler's praises whilst denigrating Winston Churchill. After he left school Hitler went to art college & began his working life as a painter. Churchill, too, used to paint as a pastime for relaxation. ""Hitler was a better painter than Churchill"", he told Max & Leo. ""Hitler could paint an entire apartment in one day, TWO COATS!"". Absolutely brilliant & hysterically funny!!!. They cast another complete lunatic (Dick Shawn) in the role of Adolf Hitler & employed a raving transvestite homosexual (Christopher Hewett) as dance choreographer. One of his ideas is to dress his lady dancers as Nazi storm-troopers dancing in swastika formation. Max also hires himself a very sexy Swedish secretary, Ulla, played by Lee Meredith. Her shorthand typing isn't up to much but she even manages to make lighting Max's cigars sexy. ""You'll bury me you Swedish tease!"", he tells her. The audience, at first, don't find ""Springtime For Hitler"" remotely funny & are stunned into silence. ""Well, talk about BAD TASTE!"", exclaims one lady in the audience. Max & Leo, meanwhile, have retired to the bar before they get ""stoned to death"". Then Dick Shawn's madcap Hitler does his thing & the audience start to find it comical. The hoped for disaster does not transpire & they are facing financial ruin. As I say it is all utterly hilarious. I have read that Peter Sellers was first offered the role of Max Bialystock but turned it down. When he saw it he realised he had made a mistake & thought it the funniest movie he had ever seen & I can easily understand why. For anyone who has never seen it, if you get the chance DON'T MISS IT. The 2005 remake is pretty good but steals an awful lot from the original!. Adolf Hitler would have had everyone involved in this lined up against a wall & machine-gunned to death!!!."

","Mel Brooks is definitely a force to be reckoned with in 1968's comedy The Producers. The acclaimed director and writer leaves his mark on this film with witty one-liners, outrageous songs, and oddball characters. The opening scene, Zero Mostel's character flirting with an eighty-year old woman for money, may leave the viewer in a state of strange wonder, but the film soon turns the confusion to humor when an accountant (Wilder) sets up a scheme with Mostel's has-been Broadway producer to make a theatrical flop in order to scam the IRS and the play's investors out of millions of dollars. <br/><br/>What results is a play praising Hitler (Springtime for Hitler) written by a Nazi (Mars) with an obsession for pigeons and bad-mouthing Winston Churchill, directed by a gay man who wears dresses in his spare time, and starring a lovable yet tone-deaf young man representing the ""Free Love"" ideal of the sixties. Much of the humor is supplied by the character L.S.D. (Shawn), whose portrayal of the leader of the Third Reich ensures the play's success, much to the dismay of the producers.<br/><br/>My only complaints about the movie are that the funny moments could have been funnier by Brooks' standards, and that Gene Wilder's face seemed to be frozen in one expression, regardless of whether his character was embarrassed, hysterical, or happy. But overall, The Producers is a showcase of how many ways and times an audience can laugh at both Hitler and Broadway in a mere ninety minutes. If for nothing else, the film is worth at least one viewing simply for the play it centers on, and Dick Shawn's performance, which is reminiscent of the early works and stand-up routines of Robin Williams."

Another reviewer noted Peter Sellars' high praise. Robin Williams and Martin Short mark it as the best as well. The ""Springtime for Hitler"" dance scene alone makes this film a classic. This is so good that it overshadows the genius of the initial Franz Liebkind scene (in the pigeon coop). The opening of the audition scene (just go back and see it again) may be the greatest sight gag ever. Oh wait, maybe the fountains spurting with Leo Bloom's conversion is the greatest sight gag ever.

In walks Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) who is an accountant who has to go through Max's books. While doing this, he puts an idea into Max's head: a producer could make a lot of money by producing a flop and asking for a lot more money than he needs and when the play is a flop, he can keep the rest of the money. Max manages to talk Leo into joining him as his partner. They then set out to make a Broadway flop by getting the worse play, the worst director and the worst actor. They think they have succeeded when they find a play on Hitler.<br/><br/>Wilder and Mostel are the best comedic double act and they work well together. Wilder has me in stitches at times especially the scene where he gets hysterical. I have to watch the scene more than once as it is one of my best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>What annoys me about some critics is that they say the film is in bad taste but it isn't and they don't get what Mel Brooks is trying to do. Instead of praising Hitler, Mel mocks him especially having a hippie play him which would have probably made Hitler's blood boil if he had been alive to see it.<br/><br/>The film is crammed with characters which I love. Kenneth Mars who plays Franz Liebkind. Mars is brilliant with the mad look he always seems to have throughout the film. Forever keeping his Nazi helmet on, never taking it off, no matter what he is wearing. Christopher Hewett who plays Roger De Bris and Andreas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia, I can't imagine anyone else playing those characters, they make them their own. The character I really adore is Dick Shawn who plays Lorenzo St. Dubois. He is a hippie who it is decided will play Hitler. What a stroke of brilliance having his initials spell out L.S.D. The scenes where you have him shocked to see himself surrounded by Germans is humorous and when he says Baby, he just has me fits of laughter.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks is a genius. He has the best cast that delivers his script with humour, he has come up with an original plot, his songs add to the humour. He is one my favourite directors who if any of his films are on, I have to watch them.<br/><br/>What is interesting about the end is you don't want Leo and Max to be put away because you have gotten to like them by the end, mainly because of the friendship that they have formed while trying to pull off this big con.<br/><br/>There is nothing bad I can say about the film except it might feel dated to some of the audience who were not around when it was made but you can still laugh at the humour."

I won't add to the well earned praise heaped upon the film. Nor will I analyze it in the minute detail that other reviewers have done so well.<br/><br/>But, people always seem amazed when I point out the fact that Bialystock & Bloom are characters straight out of a Nazi propaganda movie. One is a sniveling, somewhat effeminate nerd and the other a loudmouthed pushy sleazebag who would cause anyone who shook hands with him to count their fingers. All ethnic groups have their charlatans,swindlers, and even rich old lady seducers. But an anti-semite would tell you that only Jews would be so cravenly amoral as to profit from their own people's misery. And Bialystock gives the impression that he would pull the old lady routine on his own mother. They don Nazi armbands, and sing old beer hall songs with their arms around the author of ""Springtime for Hitler"", all the while assuring him that they only want to show the world what a kind and gentle man Hitler was!?! <br/><br/>This is exactly what a Nazi would tell you is wrong with Jews. Some of the more academically inclined anti-semites of the past even expressed a degree of sympathy for this behavior. You see, not having a nation state, the poor Jews couldn't help being liars and cheats oblivious to everything but survival and making a buck. Nothing, not even their own people's suffering; much less abstract notions of honor and human decency; could be allowed to get in the way. Mel Brooks (himself a Jew) seems to understand this and makes it an important component of this riotously funny, yet extremely dark comedy.<br/><br/>Please understand that this writer is NOT anti-semitic. In fact, I'm a member of the ""Tribe"". The wry, cynical, iconoclastic sense of humor that has become a part of Jewish culture is also one of the causes of the disproportionately high involvement of Jews in progressive and humanistic endeavors. It has allowed them to see beyond the blind loyalties and literalism that often retard social progress. Not to mention getting them through more than three thousand years of conquest and persecution.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just surprised at how few have this perspective."

Everything just worked together flawlessly.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, this was the first of several brilliant movies for Gene Wilder (followed up by Young Frankenstein, Start the Revolution Without Me and Willie Wonka), though the movie was really the showpiece for Zero Mostel! Mostel plays Max Bialystock, a washed up Broadway producer who seduces VERY old ladies to finance his long series of flops. Wilder is his assistant who helps him plan the ultimate caper---to deliberately produce the world's WORST play and sell 25,000% of it (since it will fail--who needs to pay off the elderly backers?). Unfortunately, despite their finding the worst play imaginable (""Springtime for Hitler""), the worst director and worst actor, it is taken by the audiences as great camp and the play becomes an unexpected success!! And then, the fun begins! This movie is simply great. It is unconventional, but not quite as much as some of my other favorites (such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Strange Brew), so MOST viewers (if they give it a chance) will enjoy this."

If I tried to make a movie like this they'd hang me (because I'm not a famous person). Funny is like: Getting Even With Dad, Home Alone, City Slickers, Naked Gun, and (recently) Just Visiting. These movies, and others like them, will make you laugh. The Producers will make you wish you never wasted the time (watching it) or money (renting it). And for God's sake, DON'T BUY IT! The concept IS funny (potentially). But the way it was implemented, was not. There is no chemistry here - not between the actors, not with the audience - nothing; it's just stupid. The timing is off, and the actors are just running through the script (to get it over with it seems). The only way I can think of this movie getting a positive rating is by paying the reviewer - and paying them big bucks. That might even motivate me to see something good in this film - but I doubt it!"

","The premise for ""The Producers"" is marvelous. Two guys get a bunch of elderly women to invest in a play and look for subject matter that will be a certain flop. As the investments have gone well over 100%, there will be plenty of money for Max Bialystock (a memorable Zero Mostel) and his sidekick bookkeeper (Leo Blum), played by Gene Wilder, to keep.<br/><br/>Max hires a transvestite director known for his failures to direct this bomb-to-be. Can anyone imagine a musical ""Springtime for Hitler,"" including an opening number where June Taylor-like dancers make a swastika while singing and dancing Springtime for Hitler and Germany? This is outrageous but it works as the play turns out to be an enormous success. What's there left to do? Blow-up the theater and then face the music in court.<br/><br/>What hurts this farce is the subject matter regarding Hitler which is definitely offensive. While I realize that the purpose was to create a sure flop, writer Mel Brooks has gone way over the top. Why not a musical on Julius Caesar? How many people would have been offended by that? I have faith in Brooks as he could have made the latter a riot as well.<br/><br/>Kenneth Mars unfortunately is funny as ""the kraut,"" the guy who authored the Hitler musical.<br/><br/>Have Max and Leo learned anything from their experience? Not really. As jail-birds they get the inmates to invest in ""Prisoners of Love."" Aren't we really imprisoned by this utter nonsense?"
"jboothmillard","8","1","5","3 July 2006"," The Producers
","Written and directed by Mel Brooks (Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein), this was his debut as director, it has always been looked on a classic of the comedy genre, cementing its place in history, I watched again to confirm this was the case for me as well. Basically Max Bialystock (Golden Globe nominated Zero Mostel) is a washed up Broadway producer, and is resorting to wooing and seducing old and wealthy women to raise money for his shows. Nervous and prone to hysterics Leo Bloom (Oscar nominated Gene Wilder) is an accountant sent from Max's firm to audit his books, looking through them he finds that his last show raised $2,000 more than was actually required, and the show was a flop, Leo agrees to hide this minor fraud. Leo has a revelation and makes a passing comment, that a producer could make more money with a flop that closes after only one performance than with a hit that runs and runs, as he would not have to pay back the investors who have bought into a specific percentage of the show. Max goes along with this idea and scheme, and together he and Leo agree to raise as much money as possible to produce a show that is guaranteed to be a flop and close after only one performance, and their first task is to find the worst show ever written. In their pile of scripts they find what they believe is a gem, an instant failure, an offensive musical titled ""Springtime for Hitler"", a love story to the infamous dictator written by Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), a patriotic and deranged Nazi German. Man then goes into overdrive using his seduction skills on all the old women investors he knows to raise the money, he is so successful in his venture he has sold 25,000% of the show, and he decides to get human plaything Ulla (Lee Meredith) as his short term reward. Max and Leo also hire who is considered the worst director in the business, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett), to bring this flop to life, and auditioning the leading role of Hitler they deliberately miscast Lorenzo St. DuBois aka ""L.S.D."" (Dick Shawn), who sees himself a cool smooth talker. Finally Springtime for Hitler is ready to go, the tickets are sold, and Max and Leo are smiling with glee as they watch the opening title song shock the audience in disgust, but then L.S.D. comes onto stage with unintentionally comedic performance as the dictator, and the audience go back to their seats laughing and applauding in delight. Max and Leo are shocked however hearing audience reactions that they have inadvertently produced a hit show, the only person truly offended is Franz who is angered by the mockery of the portrayal of the Fuhrer, he is initially crazed and tries to kill the producers, but they help him to settle. In the end the show is declared a smash hit, and the only choice the three see to stop it is to blow up the theatre, in court Max and Leo are found ""incredibly guilty"" by a jury, and in prison they seem to be back to producing, creating a new show titled ""Prisoners of Love"", but the scheming continues with the prisoners, and even the warden, giving them unreal percentages. Also starring Estelle Winwood as 'Hold Me Touch Me' old lady, Renée Taylor as Eva Braun, Andréas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia, Josip Elic as Violinist, Madelyn Cates as Concierge, John Zoller as Drama Critic, William Hickey as The Drunk and Frank Campanella as The Bartender. Mostel is great as the sweaty, down on his luck Broadway impresario, and Wilder became a much bigger star following his fantastic performance as the shy and highly sensitive accountant, together the duo create good chemistry in their misadventures, and Shawn is really funny as the hippy Hitler actor, the scam of the film is one filled with hilarious absurdity, and the final theatrical performance is in brilliantly bad taste and will make your jaw drop, a fabulously funny and musty see comedy classic. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. It was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Songs (""Springtime for Hitler""), it was number 69 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 50 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 76 on The 100 Greatest Films.

","I BOUGHT this thing on tape because the Broadway revival has obviously gotten it reissued.  I looked up and was astonished to see nearly fifty minutes of it had passed.  This thing is dull. I'm thinking this is an hour and a half long movie and it has been this boring?  I heard the song ""Springtime for HItler"" on Dr. Demento years ago and thought the rest of the movie would live up to the hilarious parodied song, but no, this is empty. It is watching like 'Laugh-In' and seems to want to satire that period in history, but isn't doing it well.  Wilder worked better as the enigmatic Willie Wonka and Mostel worked better with the Muppets.  Dick Shawn was funnier in 'Mad World'. But now the most peculiar moment has been in Kenneth Mars as the Nazi author.  He was the only one enjoying the play when 'Springtime' was on, but when Shawn starts with the tired hippie Hitler act and the audience laughs, Mars is offended.  It would have been funnier if he had enjoyed it as well, or better yet, misunderstood why everyone was enjoying it. <br/><br/>Was there supposed to be humour in the audience laughing at Shawn's Hitler? Or was the humour in Shawn's performance?  It was in neither.<br/><br/>I reset the counter when 'Springtime' began because I will never watch that first hour again.  And it doesn't seem likely that I will venture beyond the song much either."

","The perfect script, which was recognized by Academy Award, looks modern nowadays. This story about unsuccessful producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), who was ""The king of the Broadway"" in past. The idea to stage the worst play of the world, which came to him thanks to appearance of an accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), sounds like a madness. And because of this crazy idea producers' life became very funny and surprising!
The script is well built and the characters are skillfully designed. The author of the play named ""The springtime for Hitler"" justifies his nature. He is fond of Hitler and he admires the greatest tyrant. This madman speaks with birds and shoots a gun and whole his feelings and motivations are accurately played by Kenneth Mars. 
It is a slapstick comedy which mixed different types of humor, jokes, tricks and gags. Needless to say, absurd dialogues make the narration more interesting and intriguing. There are also details of screwball comedy, especially scenes where Max encompasses for elderly ladies to get some money, and the funniest depiction of casting for Hitler's part in performance, where the comic sing a song about ""love power"". 
The plot is untypical because of the results of the opening night. The ""genial plan"" was destroyed and the ""sure-fire flop"" was failed. The play was a success with viewers. The producers were very upset and the author was very angry. The main value of the script is unpredictable climax and astonishing resolution. The producers never give up, they have got a new ""genial idea"". Their project is called ""The prisoner of love""!"

Now he lives in his seedy office, cadging cash contributions from wealthy old ladies in exchange for sexual favors. His new accountant, Leo Bloom, the soul of honesty, suggests that Max produce a hit to try to recoup his losses, but Max knows that it's too late for that. Leo discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, however Leo has a revelation...<br/><br/>The story is very fun, though the plot is a little confusing. The theme is a matter of taste, but I think that Mr. Brooks did not taken into account the sensitivity of a certain part of the audience. The conclusion is nonconforming with the rest of the story, although a certain amount of sentimentality rescues the situation. However, the relationship between the two major protagonists is remarkable. Their conversations are hilariously fun, but their product has made the greatest damage to this movie. <br/><br/>""The Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart."" It is so grotesque and vulgar, yet it has caused a positive response with a fictional audience.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock is a cunning fox, who catches the last straw of salvation in his life. His performance is very funny, however, his brutal fraud reminds us of a some daily routine. Gene Wilder as Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom is a nervous, hysterical and shy accountant. He is Mostel's support, but his character changes, so that he becomes aware of the consequences of their scams, but still he is more satisfied with himself than he was before.

","Mel Brooks is a curious person in the film industry, he started out big with such films like Blazing Saddles (1974) and The Producers (1967) then tumbled down until Dracula: Dead and loving it (1995) where he stopped making films all together. On one hand most people remember him to be a comedic marvel with razor sharp satire while on the other hand people remember his work to have some.....outdated comedy that hurts otherwise great movies. Let's find out!<br/><br/>Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a washed up playwright who is struggling to make ends meet, he has not had a profitable play for a long time and fears he might not last long. When a mousy accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) inadvertently mentions a way to scam people, Max enlists Leo to create an intentional flop to scam the investors. Thus Springtime for Hitler: A Gay romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden by mad ex Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars ) is made.<br/><br/>Hilarity ensues. <br/><br/>To not mention the famous Springtime for Hitler number would be wrong, it is amazing, and such a delightful middle finger to Hitler and Nazis in general, the music is catchy as well. I was humming it for a good few days with a big silly grin on my face. I love how that number takes Nazi propaganda and mocks the hell out of it and shows just how stupid it all is when you boil propaganda down to its most basic and honest level, I love it. <br/><br/>The comedy is great all round for the most part and the performances for the most part are really good, the timing is on point and, again for the most part are characters and not one note clowns that exist only to make us laugh. <br/><br/>There is a reoccurring problem with the Mel Brooks movies, at least with this and Blazing Saddles is that there is a period of time where all the comedy just dies. In this case it is with the gay characters, they are the only characters that not three dimensional people but just the camp gay stereotypes that are relying on being gay camp stereotypes. It is not funny. In any way whatever, I have seen more offensive variations on this stereotypes, it is just boring and annoying. It brings the entire movie down for a time.<br/><br/>However the movie does recover from this and the stereotypes never come up again in any major way. The film benefits from this as that period has aged so badly and does the movie a massive disservice. The movie's real straight lies in the satire and the two main leads which Mel Brooks does well. <br/><br/>The trouble with reviewing any good comedy is there is very little margin for spoilers, so much of what is good about it is can be considered a spoiler so I will end this review now.<br/><br/>This is a very good comedy, not for everyone and some of it has not aged well at all but there is a wit and intelligence to this that makes it very watchable. <br/><br/>I would recommend it."

","In order to take advantage of a tax loophole, theater producer Max Bialystock(Mostel, flamboyant) and accountant Leo Bloom(Wilder, a nervous wreck) put on a play together that's sure to fail: Springtime For Hitler.<br/><br/>This is the only version I've watched. I've loved every Brooks-directed film that didn't have Dracula in it, meaning, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, History of the World: Part 1, Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. And, yes, this. You can tell it's his debut. Quality, and thus, laughs, range greatly over the course of it. It's really broad. And vulgar from frame 1. For the first several minutes, it feels as though it's (possibly unintentionally) meta. Like the movie itself wants to offend the audience, not entertain. Then it starts to come together. The material that's strong in the good way piles on. And honestly, even when I wasn't laughing, the effort is still there.<br/><br/>This has tons of great personalities. Everyone is on the verge of a complete breakdown, many for different reasons and in other directions than the others. Adolf himself is portrayed by a flower-child whose mind is just barely still there from all the acid. He remembers his name only because the initials are LSD. Do note that the first performance of the piece itself, which is almost the only place that has musical numbers, is two thirds through the running time. This mocks all aspects of show business, and of Nazism. The aesthetics, the idea to wage war, and, yes, the devoted supporters that it still had when this came out. And sadly, to this day. Nothing disarms like comedy. Any moment that imagery from The Third Reich(which, as you might not know, meant Germany) is shown, it is ridiculed. The person, the clothes, the sound accompanying, the reaction, *something*, about it is risible.<br/><br/>The DVD has trailers for this, and movies like it. OSS 117: Cairo: Nest of Spies, OSS 117: Lost in Rio, The Last Remake of Beau Geste, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Silent Movie, High Anxiety, To Be Or Not To Be and The Cannonball Run.

","It is incredible to think that The Producers was Mel Brooks' directorial debut. An incredible feat not just because the film remains a classic 50 years after its 1967 debut, but also because of its subject matter. Making a comedy about making a play about Adolf Hitler, one of the worst world leaders in world history seems like an odd vehicle to launch a career with. Nonetheless, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel join together in a brilliant display of chemistry to tell the story of two producers who hatch a plan for mischief and riches, in a way only Mel Brooks can tell.<br/><br/>Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), an aging Broadway producer is now relegated to attaining money for his productions by seducing wealthy seasoned women. One day, when Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), an accountant with White Hall and Marks meets Max to go over his books, the discovery of a fund-raising error gives Max an idea. If he were to raise a great deal amount more money than a play will cost, then selects a play that is sure to be a flop, the two will be infinitely wealthy since they will have no profits to pay the backers of the play. Leo, a perpetually nervous individual, is skeptical to go along with Max's plan. After Max takes Leo under his wing, shows him a good time, and treats him like a person, Leo agrees to help with the plan because for the first time in his life, he has found happiness. Springing into action to execute their plot; Max and Leo must find the worst play possible, a play that is so awful it is sure to only run one performance. Springtime for Hitler; a musical preaching the overlooked good qualities of Adolf Hitler looks like the perfect play for their plan. After meeting with the playwright, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) a German-born American with pictures of Hitler littering his walls, the three agree to bring the play to audiences. After the effeminate well-known terrible musical director Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) is hired, the play is sure to be a disaster; the only way their plan could fail is if the play is a hit.<br/><br/>Mel Brooks proves he was put on this earth to be a director with his debut film, The Producers. Arguably his best picture, his first film was an instant classic and clearly illustrated the type of parodies we could expect, and come to love from genius comedy director, Mell Brooks. Thankfully, years before The Producers came to be, Mel Brooks found Gene Wilder acting in a play with Mel's then girlfriend (and later wife) Anne Bancroft. Although it would be years before the pairing would come to fruition, Mel asked Gene if he would be interested in playing the part of Leo Bloom, and never forgot about him. Only his second film, The Producers was the first lead film role for Gene Wilder. From the bit part, he had in Bonnie and Clyde the same year, to sharing the lead in a film with Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder certainly proved to be quite the actor, and would go on to collaborate with Mel Brooks 2 more times, each classic in their own right.<br/><br/>Wilder played the role of the neurotic nervous Bloom with great tenacity. It's hard not to sympathize with his character who just wants a friend and a purpose for his life. Always being a rule breaker had gained Leo nothing in his life except a mundane existence. Although the relationship with Max didn't come to the best of outcomes, it begs the question, does it matter what results in a friendship as long as it is real and fun?"

","The premise is perfect for a hilarious comedy: produce a play praising Hitler in order to have a flop and make a million dollars; except that the actor playing Hitler turns the play into a farce about Hitler, causing it to be the biggest hit on Broadway.<br/><br/>But the comedy would not have reached the limits of outer space of hilarity without the casting of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder as the producer and finance guru, respectively, along with Kenneth Mars as the Nazi writer of the play. Mostel and Wilder give performances that were the best of their entire careers, with Wilder periodically screaming for his blue blanket, and Mostel yelling ""flaunt it"". And who can forget Mars arguing that Hitler was a better dancer than Churchill, as well as a great artistic painter, able to give two coats of paint to an apartment in one afternoon.<br/><br/>There is only one component of the film that could have been improved upon: Dick Shawn's character as LSD. Although an essential character of the play, it misses the bull's eye of perfection like the other characters and performances, particularly with his introduction and singing of the song, ""Love Power"": it doesn't measure up to the humor of the other songs in the movie. Sorry, Mel.<br/><br/>I read that many were offended by this film because it was deemed anti-Semitic by them. I did not see that at all while watching the film. Quite the contrary: how can a satire on Hitler, making him and the whole ideology of a master race appear ridiculous, be anything but anti-Naziism, rather than anti-Semitic?<br/><br/>My favorite scene, although there were many, is the first act of the Broadway play. The showgirls dressed as stormtroopers singing ""Springtime in Germany"", with the sound of machine guns in the background, and all on stage ducking bullets, had me rolling on the floor in convulsions of laughter. Folks, it doesn't get funnier than that scene. <br/><br/>This is certainly the BEST film that Mel Brooks ever made.

","An underrated sleeper at the time of its original release, ""The Producers"" has since gone onto cult status thanks to the excellent screenplay and brilliant casting which was definitely not appreciated at the time. The mid-late 60's saw a barrage of flop musicals on Broadway, and in the book ""Not Since Carrie"", the reasons are obvious. Too much confidence in the golden age of the Broadway musical had created many egos, star producers like David Merrick and tons of missed opportunities. There were also some major fiascoes, which this spoofs to the max. Only an ego the size of a Max Bielestock (Zero Mostel) could dare to present a musical based upon the life of Adolph Hitler, and the musical sequence, ""Springtime For Hitler"", has obviously influenced later Mel Brooks films (just look at ""The Inquisition"" from ""History of the World Part I"") and other film producers. (""Songbird!"", a musical spoof of ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" and ""Elephant!"", a scathing look at the RSC in ""The Tall Guy"", spoofing ""The Elephant Man"", are just a few examples.) Here, Max and exhausted bookkeeper Leo Bloom (an excellent Gene Wilder) aren't out to make a buck. They are out to loose it, that is for the other investors, so they finance their show with way more than 100% of what they need. Their intentions are to ""Grab That Dough!"" and sneak off to Brazil on the opening night closing. As fate would have it, the show is a big hit, and eventually, the accountants close in. So what do you do? Put on a musical in prison, of course, with the intention of transferring it to Broadway upon your release.<br/><br/>It's ironic that Brooks chooses Hitler to spoof here, especially since he looked so much like David Merrick, ""the abominable showman"", whose fascinating life behind the scenes of Broadway's golden age could be a mini-series in itself. As Mel explained, ""What better way to get vengeance on a master criminal like Hitler than to make him look like a fool?"" A dangerous fool, to be certain, but by making him look at a buffoon, he's reminding future villains of history that they too are ripe for spoofing. Just look at Saturday Night Live and its scathing images of recent world villains. Mel Brooks knew exactly what he was talking about, and his initial failure has brought him the last laugh thanks to a Broadway musical that revitalized the Broadway musical when it really needed it, and has definitely influenced the next wave of movie comedy men. Without ""The Producers"", many of the great spoofers of cinema (Woody Allen, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon among them) might have had a tougher time expressing their distaste towards the world through comedy, showing that not only is laughter the best medicine, but perhaps the true way to educate the world to its foibles and follies.<br/><br/>So the next time you refer to something as ""bad taste"", take a look at the non-P.C. genius of these men who teach that the world which can laugh at itself is the type of the world which will truly survive. Horny old ladies anxious to pass over ""the checkie"", sexy Swedes who believe ""When you got it, flaunt it"", nerdy accountants who don't think they can ever break out of the florescent lights of a miserable and boring career, and Broadway producers who are determined to become immortally infamous will keep you in stitches."

","Mel Brooks' debut film is also his best film, telling the story about a down on his luck producer Max Bialystock (played by Zero Mostel) who has been romancing elderly women , ends up meeting an accountant named Leo Bloom (played by Gene Wilder) who together plan intentionally on producing the absolute worst play in Broadway history called ""Springtime for Hitler"". On opening night for the play at first the production duo think that their plan is working until the end of the show when it becomes a success and they get mad that their plan had failed, and then blew up the theater and the audience that was scheduled to see the play was crying because the theater blew up. Brooks' film has so much laughs in it but in case if you laugh so hard your going to need a drink of water while you pause the film. But i did love it, so much it belong with other comedy movies as the funniest movies of all time such as Some Like It Hot (1959), Tootsie (1982), Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), It Happened One Night (1934), The Gold Rush (1925), Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), Spaceballs (1987), Mrs. Doubtfire, Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), and The Kid (1921) etc. Also not only that this movie is the funniest movie of all time it is also a very well done and masterful comedy that is worth seeing over and over again."

","The Producers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a comedy classic that brings me joy and laughter on every viewing, I love the whole concept of the Producers and have enjoyed any version of it I have seen (remakes, theatre plays, etc.), but this version still stands out on its own. <br/><br/>The only thing that ever really bothered me about this movie is the lack of development for both Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, the characters are still effective to watch as a result of great writing and performances. However, we learn very little about the two as people prior to them beginning their journey, nothing really in terms of their lives outside of show business. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is outstanding and without any doubt the thing that holds this whole movie together. They are both well capable of handling the comedic moments, as well as the more dramatic ones. Gene Wilder even got an Academy Award nomination, and rightfully so, as every line he delivers is sincere. I never viewed him as a comedian, merely as an actor who did comedies, that is very evident here.<br/><br/>A combination of charming performances, bizarre plot twists and a catchy musical number make this a memorable, unique experience on every viewing. A classic that still holds up pretty well today, as does everything else Mel Brooks wrote, I would recommend the Producers to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>When two producers discover that it is possible to make more money with a flop than you could with a hit, they set out to make the biggest disaster on Broadway. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Gene Wilder"

","Max Bialystock, a seedy Broadway producer, is persuaded by his dodgy accountant Leo Bloom, that he can make more money from a flop than from a hit. They come up with what they believe will be a sure money-making scheme. They take more money from investors than they can repay (overcapitalising the production to the tune of 25,000%) and then look around for a play certain to close on its first night, their logic being that the investors will not be looking for a return from a play known to be a failure. (A similar dishonest scheme was featured in an earlier film ""New Faces of 1937""). They find an unpublished script by a half- mad German playwright, Franz Liebkind, who wants to show the world ""the Hitler with a song in his heart"", and persuade him to let them produce it. They hire the ultra-camp Roger De Bris, a director whose plays ""close on the first day of rehearsal"" and cast in the leading role a drug-addicted hippie who hardly seems to know his own name. (He goes by the name ""LSD""). Of course, the show turns out to be an improbable and unexpected hit, which leaves Bialystock and Bloom with one problem; how do they find the money to repay all their investors? <br/><br/>Seen as a comedy about a dishonest producer and a crooked accountant, the film is no more than moderately amusing. Some of its scenes, notably the ones in which Bialystock is romancing the lecherous old ladies who constitute most of his investors, are frankly embarrassing, and those involving De Bris and his equally camp partner Carmen Ghia may seem a bit politically incorrect (although still funny) these days. The character of Ulla struck me as unnecessary, unless writer/director Mel Brooks assumed that a pretty girl who regularly takes her clothes off is something necessary for the success of any film. The ending seems rather weak; Brooks seemed to have difficulty finding the right endings for a number of his films. (The ending of the otherwise excellent ""Blazing Saddles"" is even more of a let-down than this one). <br/><br/>""The Producers"", however, is much more than just a comedy about a dishonest producer and a crooked accountant. What makes it a cult classic is the nature of the play which Bialystock and Bloom put on, an all-singing, all-dancing musical comedy extravaganza about Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, entitled ""Springtime for Hitler"". (Brooks wanted to use that as the title of the film itself, but was overruled by the studio). The crazed neo-Nazi Liebkind's script, as interpreted by de Bris, comes complete with a high-kicking chorus line of girls dressed as storm-troopers and unforgettable lines like ""Don't be stoopid, be a smardy, come and join the Nazzy Pardy"", voiced by Brooks himself in a broad New York accent. The first night audience in the theatre are initially repelled by what they see as bad taste but later decide that the play is in fact a brilliant satire which will run on Broadway for years. <br/><br/>Over the years critical opinion about ""The Producers"" has been just as divided. There have always been plenty of critics such as Pauline Kael ready to lambaste it as vulgar and tasteless. The very broad style of acting, deliberately exaggerated and non-naturalistic, may also not have been to everyone's taste. My initial reaction was to call it ""theatrical"", but in fact it bears only a passing resemblance to any style of acting I have ever seen in a theatre, even in a comedy. A closer comparison might be to a group of stand-up comics going through their routines. Zero Mostel who stars as Bialystock actually started his career as a nightclub comedian, although it must be said that Gene Wilder as Bloom is even more ever-the-top than Mostel. (Wilder started as a serious Method actor and this was his first venture into comedy, the genre in which he was later to specialise). <br/><br/>Other critics such as Roger Ebert, however, have defended the film, and I must say that I am in their camp. There is a serious purpose (as there often was) behind Brooks's apparent lapse into bad taste. Just as the racial humour in ""Blazing Saddles"" served to expose the racist assumptions which underlay Hollywood's Myth of the West, so the ""Springtime for Hitler"" scenes here are satirical black comedy, not mere tastelessness for its own sake. Brooks himself said of the film ""If you stand on a soapbox and trade rhetoric with a dictator you never win.... But if you ridicule them, bring them down with laughter, they can't win. You show how crazy they are"". It was essentially the same idea which Chaplin had when he made ""The Great Dictator"" or Orwell when he wrote ""Animal Farm"", lampooning Stalin as the biggest pig in the barnyard. Dictators can survive the polemics of their political enemies. They cannot survive ridicule, and the Nazis have never seemed more ridiculous than they do here. <br/><br/>My favourite story about the film is one told by Ebert. Shortly after ""The Producers"" was released Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft were approached by a woman who said to him ""I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar"". Brooks's response was ""Lady, it rose below vulgarity"". That is just what ""The Producers"" does. It rises triumphantly below the level of vulgarity. But it does so with good reason. 8/10"

","Mel Brooks's irresistible zany style was already in full bloom for this theatrical directing debut, a gleeful concoction about a hard luck Broadway producer, Max Bialystock (multiple Tony award winner Zero Mostel) who cons old ladies out of their money by agreeing to play games with them. Into his life comes a meek accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) who's supposed to go over the producers' books. Leo casually ventures the idea that one could make a lot of money selling well over 100% of a play which would be sure to flop. So the two of them think that they've found their surefire flop in ""Springtime for Hitler"", an invention by disgruntled ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Of course, their plan goes seriously awry when the play is tweaked by its no-talent director, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) and then performed for laughs by hammy star ""L.S.D."" (Dick Shawn), and the audience ends up loving it!<br/><br/>This viewer personally didn't find the movie to always be terribly funny but there are most certainly very good moments throughout. The cast is so utterly enthusiastic that they do win you over. Mostel and Wilder are a great comedy team, especially in their introductory scenes; Leo is afraid of having Max jump on him and, much like Linus from the Peanuts comic strip, is attached to a blue blanket that he carries around with him! Mostel is a true force of nature as the slimy Max, while Wilder, who of course would go on to do other great things for Brooks, showed here his unmatched ability to completely flip out in a comic way. The other actors are fun, too; Mars is a riot as the unhinged Franz, especially towards the end when he, Leo, and Max make their last ditch effort to salvage their scheme. Lee Meredith is smoking hot as Ulla, the Swedish bombshell hired as a secretary who thinks that ""going to work"" means go go dancing. Viewers will also delight in the appearances by Renee Taylor (as Eva Braun), William Hickey as the drunk, and Barney Martin as Goring.<br/><br/>The songs, not surprisingly, are catchy, with L.S.D.'s audition performance a standout. Brooks fans will know that his voice can be heard dubbed into the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number.<br/><br/>This movie didn't do so well at first but amazingly found a supporter in comedy star Peter Sellers, and his endorsement would motivate people to revisit it and give it a fresh evaluation. 46 years later, it's now also extremely well known for inspiring a very successful Broadway musical, itself filmed in 2005.<br/><br/>It's must viewing for all those eager to see the beginnings of Brooks's film career, a couple of years before he hit his biggest peak with his spoofs ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"".<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","In some ways, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are a conventional comedic duo in the vaudevillian tradition. One is skinny and awkward, the other fat and self-assured. In a typical duo, one would play the straight man caught up in the other's foolish foibles. Mel Brooks' twist is to make both characters fools in their own ways. The crazy schemes mostly come from the bombastic producer (Mostel), but the twitchy and vaguely creepy accountant (Wilder) soon becomes a willing participant. As strange as these lead characters are, both seem almost normal next to the other lunatics in the film: a raving ex-Nazi playwright, a hippie singer nicknamed ""LSD,"" and caricatures of New York theater people. Brooks' brand of comedy (plenty of simple, corny, but funny ideas mixed with risquÃ© and taboo-defying humor) works well for the most part, but as with other Brooks movies a few weak jokes are stretched out too long. As a whole, though, the film actually feels too short, and more catchy tunes from its so-bad-it's-good musical ""Springtime for Hitler"" would have been welcome."
"MBunge","7","0","1","6 April 2012"," I love Zero Mostel
","Before it was a Broadway musical and before it was a movie based on that Broadway musical, The Producers was one of the boldest films of its era and remains damn funny after all these years. With a plethora of tremendously hilarious performances and one of the most jaw-droppingly mischievous premises you'll ever see, this film would have been the highlight of any other writer/director's career. Of course, Mel Brooks went on to do Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, proving that there must be a God because only He could make someone that smart and talented.<br/><br/>Not that Brooks did it all on his own. I mean, just take that opening scene between fallen-from-grace theater producer Max Bialystock and timid accountant Leo Bloom. It is astonishingly long, covers an unbelievable amount of dramatic ground and is stuffed with enough gags and shtick to choke elephant. No matter how great a director you might be, you can't pull off a scene like that with just any old actors. As wonderful as Gene Wilder is at soaring between the almost bi-polar extremes of Bloom, you can maybe imagine another guy in that role. If Peter Sellers had taken it, Leo would have certainly been different but potentially just as funny. But the number of men who could have pulled off the character of Bialystock besides Zero Mostel can probably be counted on the fingers of one hand after you've had a terrible accident with an industrial slicer. That Mostel is sporting one of the most catastrophic combovers in human history, yet reduces that by force of personality to just a little detail of the humanistic grandeur that is Max Bialystock, gets more amazing the more I think about it. That hairdo is all you'd remember with most actors. With Mostel, it just seemed normal.<br/><br/>Since its revival on stage and then return to the silver screen, most folks have probably got a handle on the plot but you shouldn't overlook how well constructed is The Producers. With a lot of comedies, the plot is an excuse for humor that's ignored as much as it's followed. The way Brooks carefully builds this story, with one scene leading to the next and to the next, gives away the secret of his genius. Brooks is known for his broad and standard-changing subversive humor, but that's only the surface. Brooks is so good because he works so hard at getting the underlying dynamic right. The sequence where Bialystock is squiring Bloom about town, slowly seducing him into the life of a huckster and fraud, is so incredible because where the characters are and what they're doing is both rooted in and reflecting their individual natures. When Bloom gives in to temptation and goes running around that fountain, it's not just a great visual. It represents Bloom breaking through the boundaries of his old life and surging into something new. You don't even notice after that how the character isn't nearly as neurotic or brittle, because it makes perfect sense and feels absolutely right.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure any other comedy has ever has three brilliantly over-the-top supporting performances like Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars and Christopher Hewett. Even after so many decades and the roles being unmoored from their cultural milieu, you still can't help but laugh at them. You don't have to know anything about hippies or post-war Nazis or New York theater folk to enjoy such enthusiastic oddity.<br/><br/>I will say, The Producers is one of those movies that makes you wish you had a time machine. As fantastic as it still is, think what it was like to be one of those people in 1968 who had never encountered something like ""Springtime for Hitler"" before? There's no way the film can have that same bite in the early 21st century, but it remains a spectacular bit of work."

Its oddly episodic with an array of patchwork meetings and rendezvous with one kooky character after another that either hits or misses and most of it hits before teetering on too much absurdity. Brooks frantic style goes well with Max's desperate plan but he does lay it on a little too long and too thick at times. <br/><br/>Mostel is a life force unto himself and more for better than worse allowed to do as he pleases. Wilder's malleable lack of fortitude partners well with Zero and a handful of precious bits by Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn, Christopher Hewett and 84 year old Estelle Winwood insure a steady steam of hilarious moments in keeping with a film that deals with putting on a musical called Springtime for Hitler. <br/><br/>Brooks as a director would go on to get a better handle on film grammar in future films. Much of the Producers is shot in close-up though a Busby Berkeley moment and a casting call for Hitler types show him to be just as effective in his intent when he pulls his camera back.

","It's the first movie that Mel Brooks directed and it's a qualified success. There are at least as many belly laughs as in most of his later works. And the production gets bonus points for being sui generis. It's not a satire of Westerns or historical epics or silent movies. It's an original story. Generic conventions provide a kind of springboard from which to launch a spectacular send up. It's almost too easy. <br/><br/>Want to satirize a traditional Western? Have the African-American laborers break into an a capella version of a Cole Porter standard. Throw in other anachronisms and allusions to contemporary issues. Funny but easy.<br/><br/>Brooks the writer didn't have any such facile tactics at his command here because the plot was built of more or less novel elements from the ground up.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel is a selfish and materialistic Broadway producer, down on his luck, who enlists the help of the shy and chronically anxious accountant Gene Wilder to bilk money out of rich little old ladies. The idea is to sell each of their ancient backers a large percentage of the profit from a play, but to make the play a total failure and keep the extra money for themselves. Why would the Internal Revenue Service be interested in the books of a play that folded on Night One? So they buy a thoroughly rotten play from a Nazi writer, played by Kenneth Mars, a musical celebration of the Third Reich that glorifies Hitler. Of course, there is always the risk of being caught and sent to jail. If, for instance, the play should be a hit they would have no way of paying off their investors.<br/><br/>Mostel: ""Bloom, how much of the play can we sell?"" Wilder: ""Max, you can't sell more than a hundred percent of anything."" Mostel: ""And how much of 'Springtime for Hitler' did we sell?"" Wilder: ""Twenty-five thousand percent."" The movie has yocks galore. Both Mostel and Wilder have immensely expressive face. In a bar, they are joined for one scene by the marvelous Bill Hickey.<br/><br/>But Mostel sometimes goes too far. He shouts, screams, makes gargoyle faces, jumps up and down, and the effort shows. And Wilder is forced to do much the same, weeping, shivering, ululating, shrieking gibberish. Kenneth Mars rarely reaches such a pitch of hysteria but he's consistently high on the scale from beginning to end. Dick Shawn plays Hitler and the audience, having second thoughts while walking out, finds him side splitting. I didn't. The best thing about Shawn's overdone performance is his singing the lyrics of Mel Brooks' song, ""Flower Power"" -- ""Then he flush her down the sewer with the yukkk runnin' through her...."" <br/><br/>Some of the jokes, too, are dated. In 1968, commercial films were in a transitional state and, despite his brazenness, Brooks shades his gags on the cautious side. LSD is alluded to, there is no marijuana, and homosexuality is implied rather than openly exploited.<br/><br/>But when the performances and dialog aren't over the top, they're absurdly funny. Mostel falling asleep on the doorstep while waiting for one of his paranoid patronesses to undo the dozens of locks on her apartment door. And the expressions on Mostel's and Wilder's faces in the theater when they realize the audience is applauding rapturously are unforgettable."

That Mel Brooks, in his directorial debut, could hang a very funny movie on this song (to which, despite not being able to read music, he wrote music and lyrics, actually dubbing ""Adolf's"" baritone solo himself onto the soundtrack) is a testimony to Brooks' diabolical ability to get the ""last laugh"" on the author of the ""final solution."" Hitler himself would be spinning in his grave--IF he had one! My summary quote from the film comes from the ""winner"" of the ""worst script"" contest run by producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) early in the story--namely, the Fuhrer-worshiping Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). It might as well have been said by Brooks directly to his OWN producer, Joseph E. Levine, when the latter said SPRINGTIME FOR HlTLER would NEVER see the light of day!"

","Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder aim Mel Brooks' bawdy jokes at the third balcony, and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made. As anyone who doesn't live under a rock by now knows, Mostel and Wilder play Max Bialystock, failing Broadway producer, and his hysterical accountant, Leo Bloom, respectively. When the two realize that they can make more money off a Broadway flop than they can with a hit, they set out to make the worst show ever made, and ""Springtime for Hitler"" is born.<br/><br/>The fun in ""The Producers"" is watching Max and Leo assemble their team of show-biz disasters. Not since Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road on the way to Oz has a more colorful assortment of characters been added one by one to a film's cast. There's the play's author Franz Liebkind, who spontaneously bursts into the Nazi anthem and whose plans include world domination; Ulla, the Swedish tease, whose hips move independently from her torso and who Max meets in the public library; Roger DeBris, who thinks the third act of the play ""has got to go"" because the Nazis are losing the war; his ""assistant"" Carmen Ghia, who slinks around wearing a pointy beard and a monocle and who enjoys (maybe too much) his ride in the elevator with Max and Leo; and last but not least, Lorenzo St. DuBois, also known as LSD, who sings perhaps the film's funniest song, ""Love Power,"" while wearing furry thigh boots and finger cymbals and which ends with him breaking a banana in half and sticking his thumb in his mouth.<br/><br/>The high point of the movie, of course, is the ""Springtime for Hitler"" production number, that includes dancing girls dressed as pretzels and beer tankards and includes lines like ""We're marching to a faster pace/Look out, here comes the master race."" Just the shot of the audience watching the show, their mouths hanging open in dumbstruck shock at its awfulness, is alone worth sitting through the movie for.<br/><br/>My only complaint with ""The Producers"" is really a compliment, and it's that there's not enough of it. The whole movie has a sketch-comedy feel, and each supporting character gets really no more than a big scene or two. I really wanted more of Roger and Carmen, and more of LSD. And of course it would have been great if Brooks had filled out ""Springtime for Hitler"" even more. Indeed, that number is such a show stopper that the movie deflates a bit after it's over and never quite recovers.<br/><br/>This is easily Brooks' best film, and it's wonderful to see such an unapologetically in-your-face comedy work so well. It's crass and crude and silly, yet remarkably intelligent all at the same time. If you don't come away with at least a dozen lines to quote, you weren't paying attention.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"barefaced_chic","10","0","1","30 November 2005"," A treasure from a time when good writing was key to a good film.
","This film is without a doubt the best Mel Brooks ever created. The chemistry between Mostel and Wilder has never been recaptured in film. For most people, ""Springtime for Hitler"" is the greatest scene. For me, it is Max and Leo's visit to Roger De Bris' apartment (the most non-stop laughs of any movie scene). Zero Mostel is a comic genius, and with Mel Brooks' wonderful script manages to extract every possible nuance of humour and fun from his lines. People may call The Producers dated - but Max and Leo follow the same marketing strategy which allows Uve Boll to be so successful today. An insightful, slick and above all hilarious film, which in my view deserves far more recognition than it gets."

","In the first place, note that I believe this movie was completely excellent. <br/><br/>My first intro to it was the stage production, which of course, you know, since the '68 movie was much... ""less"", made it a let-down, but it was certainly ""good enough for me"". The movie, just as the musical, left me completely bouncy, cheerful, and ridiculous. I'm still experiencing side effects! ((laughs)) <br/><br/>My critiques are many, though... in the opening, some of the pictures in which are ""paused"" are a little... well, dated. I just don't really see why a man toppled over a table in the corner while credits are rolling about is a ""good"" effect. Even if, by the second time one sees this movie, they find it funny (myself included.) <br/><br/>The Producers is definitely near the top of my favorite movies list, I'll tell you that much. And having a zillion show-girls singing, ""springtiiiiime for Hitleeerrr and Geermanyyyy..."" is, in fact, rather humorous. Definitely 10/10, even if it is a little offensive to some. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with young children :) Why do I like this movie? It's simple. It's show-biz about show-biz. Some people despise this kind of thing, but I adore it!"
"riderpridethemovie","7","0","3","10 May 2005"," The medium is the message
","Impossible to judge the movie's efficacy after watching the vastly improved musical (which I'd give a 9). Brooks cleaned up the story arcs, added more hilarious numbers and, most importantly, got Ula on stage longer. It will be interesting to see how the new movie-based- on-a-musical-that-was-based-on-a-movie will fare. This is a brilliant premise that, since it is about a stage production, probably translates better to the stage. But funny is funny, and this is funny, although it could do with less yelling and mugging. Especially underwhelming is Gene Wilder's performance, which is just schtick. Wilder is usually golden, but the material here is so good, it doesn't need all the bells and whistles he provides."
"newkidontheblock","Null","0","1","4 August 2004"," What A Film!
","I saw The Producers about a week ago and I loved it! This '68 classic by Mel Brooks (his major film if I'm not mistaken) made me laugh so hard my sides hurt. The whole thing with the Nazis, only Mel Brooks could pull that off, sheer brilliant, Brooks can not be a mere mortal! *Spoilers possible* So, this film is about a man named Max Bealistock (played by Zero Mostel) is a failing Broadway producer who depends on rich old frisky woman to give him money for sex. In short, Max hates his whole life and is constantly looking for new ways to get lots of money, and fast, So he hires an accountant named Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder). While looking though the books, he found a loophole, if the play is a flop, they can make more money. Unfortuntly, Leo said it out loud and Max could not help but go though with this brilliant but yet wrong plan.<br/><br/>So they go on the look out for the worst scrip ever and they find it! To quote Max ""It's practically a love letter to Hitler."" So they went to the residents of a one Franz Liebkind (Ken Mars) who is a major Nazi. He agrees to direct it, and they go on the look for the ideal Adolf with there super fruity casting man Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett)and found in the stoner of the century: L.S.D. (Dick Shawn). The play is set to be a big flop, and the classic showstoping number ""Springtime For Hitler"" helped matters, but in a bar across the street, celebrating there big accomplishment, there met with a big surprise.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films ever! I would suggest it to anyone. Please see The Producers, you will love it!"
"jpm-15","10","0","1","13 June 2004"," An exceptional comedy!
","I first saw ""The Producers"" when it was theatrically released. It became my favorite comedy, and it still is. The writing is excellent, and the casting and acting is too. Admittedly, it's not a film for everyone's taste. (Perhaps it helps to have grown up in New York, and having some familiarity with this broad humor.) <br/><br/>I can't imagine this movie being made with anyone else but Zero Mostel as Max. He gives a perfect performance: Comic delivery, expressions, timing. And, the other actors are right on the money too. <br/><br/>**MINOR SPOILERS The whole film holds together so well, it's hard to pick out favorite scenes, but I particularly like Max and Leo's visit to the quite ""flamboyant"" director's apartment, and the scene where they first meet the Nazi playwright (""Springtime for Hitler, a gay romp with Adolph and Eva at Berchtesgaden""!)<br/><br/>The DVD extras are interesting, particularly for those who really enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I rate it a 10!"

","I had somehow never seen The Producers until the mid 1990's on an international United Airlines flight classic channel and now have a DVD of it that I watch a couple of times a year.  It ranks with Spaceballs and To Be or Not To Be as my favorite Mel Brooks films.  Mel does us all a great service as well by holding the Nazi's up for ridicule in this movie as he did in his remake of the 1942 original To Be or Not To Be with Jack Benny. The casting of Dick Shawn to play the actor performing as Hitler on stage was perfect.  The contrast of Dick Shawn on stage as a laughingstock hippie Hitler while Kenneth Mars as the quite serious Hitler supporter and writer of ""Springtime for Hitler"" squirms and grows angry (""Hitler never said 'baby'..what is this 'baby'"") is hilarious."

","Minor Spoilers Herein!<br/><br/>""How could this happen? I was so careful. I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast. Where did I go right?""<br/><br/>As a screenwriter, one of my primary influences -- in terms of comedy -- has always been Mel Brooks. I was not familiar with his early work until recently, although I was familiar with their existence. As most viewers, I was introduced to Brooks through his comedy ""Spaceballs,"" bashed by critics upon its initial release in 1987 but followed by adamant fans to this day. And after watching ""Spaceballs"" on network TV for years on end, I finally got the chance to see his earlier works of comedy, which are much harder to find broadcast on television these days.<br/><br/>Brooks is famous for his slapstick comedy, but I was astonished to find that ""The Producers"" is cleverer than anything else. This is Brooks' first mainstream film, and it remains one of his best.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most flat-out ironic film of all time, Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" (1968) is a film by a director who has not yet perfected the art of constant hysterical laughter, but a director who is at the peak of his 40-year + career in terms of scriptwriting. Brooks' later films, including ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Spaceballs,"" had more laughs but less irony and strong scriptwriting. In terms of plot and irony, and not actual laughs, ""The Producers"" is Brooks' finest achievement.<br/><br/>Don't make a mistake sitting down to watch ""The Producers."" This isn't the frequent, laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy that Mel Brooks' ""Spaceballs"" (1987) is. It isn't the clever spoof that ""Young Frankenstein"" was. But it is a very funny comedy, with great classic moments and some scenes so joyously outrageous; you just have to see them to believe them.<br/><br/>Zero Mostel (credited during the end credits as simply ""Zero"") plays Max Bialystock, a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer struggling to get by on his own terms. To survive, Max cheats old women out of money just to afford his apartment rent, offering them strange sexual games for payments. (The opening credits with Max and a band of old women are subtly suggestive and quite disturbing -- don't be put off by it.)<br/><br/>Gene Wilder plays Leo Bloom, his worrywart accountant. After walking in on Max during one of his strange affairs, Leo checks Max's records and finds that Max earned $2,000 more than he earned on his last flop. And so the two hatch up a crazy plan that just might work -- over finance a total failure of a play, and keep the extra cash for themselves.<br/><br/>And so begins their quest to find the absolute worst play of all time -- a play destined to bomb on Broadway. And they soon find ""Springtime for Hitler,"" written by a neo-Nazi playwright named Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), who prances about with German World War II attire and is frightened when Max and Leo approach him, afraid that they might be taking him away to jail. He starts to sing The National Anthem.<br/><br/>Max and Leo find the absolute worst Broadway director, a homosexual transvestite (Christopher Hewitt), and assign him the task of handling the play. He loves it, and accepts the job, but first he addresses a problem. The Germans lose the war in the script. That's sad. He'll have to change the ending. Perfect, they think.<br/><br/>The long-awaited scene, in which their travesty, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" is unleashed upon the public, is a bold movie even by today's standards -- only Mel Brooks and the Farrelly Brothers could ever get away with such an idea. Watching a band of Nazis form lines and dance about is gut-busting enough, but the sight of Hitler (Dick Shawn), a hippie with a moustache, is just outrageous.<br/><br/>I think that part of the success of ""The Producers"" is the casting of its two leads, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Mostel was a dramatic actor at the time, familiar with small roles on television and a few minor supporting roles. Here he is a bumbling, energetic fool, with such a sense of frenetic hyperactivity that his weight seems not to hinder his inner energy.<br/><br/>Gene Wilder (who stole the show for me) was hardly a major star by this time, either. Leo Bloom, in ""The Producers"" was his breakthrough role, and he teamed up with Brooks for years to come. This is one of his finest performances, and the famous beginning sequence that introduces his problems with insecurity and hysterics is classic. (""I'm hysterical! I'm having hysterics!"" Water is thrown on him. ""I'm hysterical and I'm wet!"" He is slapped. ""I'm in pain! I'm in pain, and I'm wet! And I'm still hysterical!"")<br/><br/>In regards to ""The Producers,"" Roger Ebert wrote, ""This is one of the funniest movies ever made."" I can't say I agree. In terms of laugh-out-loud laughter, the film seems tame. It is dated. But while it may no longer be as raunchy or hysterical as it was in 1968, ""The Producers"" is certainly one of the most ironic and smartest comedies of all time, and for that it deserves extraordinary credit.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","I've glanced at a few reviews posted by others on IMDB, and it appears to be general opinion that the comedy in this film is dated and the movie itself is over-rated (`forgive the pun,' as stated by Andreas Voutsinas). But whoever thinks this film isn't funny must be joking, because in my opinion The Producers is Mel Brook's second finest film (next only to Young Frankenstein). Comic legend Peter Sellers himself once stated that this is `the ultimate film,' and he is most definitely correct. I mean, what else could you expect out of Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, an Academy Award-winning script, and a play entitled `Springtime for Hitler?' Simply put, this movie is comic genius. Built solidly upon the concept of pounding irony into the ground until it is no longer ironical, Mel Brooks' story is about two producers (one of which is inspired by a real person he knew at 16) who concoct a scheme to raise more money than needed to make a Broadway flop and -- after the play closes on opening night -- keeping the rest of the dough and cooking the account books. The irony aspect REALLY becomes evident when the play -- Springtime for Hitler -- becomes a runaway hit, and they must blow up the theater in order to keep it from being a success. I found it a sheer delight to watch Zero and Gene fumble about attempting to do exactly the opposite of ordinary (casually throwing about lines like, `I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast; where did I go right?'). This entire movie could have very easily been a total disaster, but with such fantastic casting and brilliant dialogue, it truly deserves to be called one of the funniest films ever made. It also must be noted that the newly released Special Edition DVD -- with remastered picture and 5.1 Surround Sound -- has a must-see documentary with stories that are almost as funny as the movie itself (`She refused to wear swastikas on her t**s, so we replaced 'em with black eagles').<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I will make no bones by saying this is one of my favorite films of all time. It's brilliant, ingenious and pokes fun at something that wasn't  funny. I'll repeat that to make a point: IT'S ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY. Ya gotta ask yourself, why did the audience find it funny?<br/><br/>When this film came out, I was no where near an age to see it. I actually saw it for the first time in the 1980's and I laughed my butt off.<br/><br/>The films premise is easy -- a once great Broadway Theater producer is now barely able to get a show together and has resorted to bilking little old ladies out of their money to finance the small theater plays he still can do.<br/><br/>In walks a meek but nervous accountant who discovers a slight financial error that, if done on a larger scale could make millions for the ones doing it. Of course the has been producer jumps on the idea and enlists the meek accountant to help. Just one problem, what could be the most tasteless, horrid play one can do that would upset theater-patrons, major critics and anyone who would get a whiff of it? A theater play that would close in one night so the Producer and Accountant can keep the millions of dollars they got by over extending the profits from investors?!?!<br/><br/>The play they find is ""Springtime For Hitler"" and it fits the bill. How horrid, who could sit though a glorification of Hitler and his life?!?! Not only were they going to produce this play, they needed the worse people to stage it. They sign the worse choreographer/director and the worse actors. In their minds, there is no way this can do anything but flop.<br/><br/>Everything is in place but what happens, instead of offending folks, this becomes a comedic triumph! The toast of broadway! Which means, the Producer and the Accountant committed fraud because they financed the picture with investors that they promised over 100% of the play. Their scheme backfires and they know they will go to jail.<br/><br/>This film is so brilliant on all levels! Considering it was done in the 60's, it holds up wonderfully today with striking parallels (Remember the dot.com industry and the greed of Corporate CEO's???) And what about Hitler...how can that be funny to anyone?!?!?<br/><br/>The Producers -- It's about greed, its about women being seen as nothing but objects, its about the young not knowing history and playing it for a joke not knowing that's even more destructive than Hitler could ever be, its about comedy, its about homosexuality, its about the mind of a criminal and how jail as supposed to rehabilitate etc., etc., -- it has much to offend many, but it also reflects time. The best part of the film to me is even after they are convicted and in jail...and they promise they ""will never do it again""...then you see them in prison...doing it again!!! Brilliant.<br/><br/>I find that younger people who see this movie for the first time hate it. I find that folks feel there's nothing funny about Hitler, and there ISN'T which is THE point of the film. How can something so horrible be so funny to audiences when it WASN'T MEANT TO BE -- but it DID. There is social commentary there, and very much of it. The writing is superb, many many references there. I really feel sorry for those who miss out on all of these elements.<br/><br/>""The Producers"" was done in a time when I feel ""films were films"" very layered themes and elements not just dependent upon film production values. The Broadway play is a darn good updated version, but this film is ""The King"". Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder - the best.<br/><br/>You're missing out on one of the greatest film comedies of all time in not ever seeing this one."

","Just saw (Aug. '02) a new print on a full sized theater screen. Though 1968 seems a world away, The Producers is still fresh and very very funny. Zero Mostel is a force of nature, but 85 year old Estelle Winwood steals the opening sequence right out from under him. So many terrific character actors shine in great comic bits, the upcoming DVD will be a must-have.

","Hilarious, and it just gets better with age. This is the best that Mel Brooks ever turned out. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are palatable but the real star of the show is Dick Shawn as a completely whacked out version of one of history's most whacked out characters. Shawn was an unappreciated comedic genius that for some reason went for long periods of time without a gig. His hipster Adolph Hitler with an earring is guaranteed to both repulse and convulse just about anybody into a state of stunned hilarity. Add a Rockettes style chorus and the dancing Swastika and you're on the floor before you know it. One of Hollywood's craziest, daring, and most inventive scenes. Catch more of Dick Shawn's best work in Way Way Out, Mad Mad World, and Evil Roy Slade. 8/10"

"glassman-4","Null","0","5","8 July 2002"," So-so prelude to ""The Producers"" musical
","I'm not a huge fan of Mel Brooks movies, I admit. They have good lines, but as coherent movies, they usually come up short. Such is the case of ""The Producers"". Although it may be a ""cult"" classic, it never became a REAL classic because it just doesn't work in this format. <br/><br/>BUT as a Broadway musical (THE PRODUCERS, that is, not SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER) it is a real gem. Brooks' talent comes through full force, but he gave enough authority to other people involved to cut out his often silly, un-funny sophomoric humor, probably since this was his first play. Watching the movie now simply reminds one of all the great musical numbers in the broadway show. In the genre of great old musical comedies, it is set in the 1950s and works much better that way.<br/><br/>The movie however, taking place in the ""present"", i.e. 1968, the classic musical was already going out of fashion, and it is no surprise that Max was no longer successful. The contemporary sixties clothing, sets, and ""L.S.D."" are out of place as they do not conjure up images of classic broadway musicals and the atmosphere that went along with them.<br/><br/>
If you like the movie, you'll love the musical. This movie was BEGGING to be made into one, and I'm glad it finally happened. I just hope Mel is able to bring it to the big screen one day, although it probably won't be until the touring company finishes, and that may not be for years and years. In the meantime, get your tickets (a year in advance) and make your plans to go to NYC or London, or wherever it's playing when you read this (even your community theatre someday?). <br/><br/>Don't miss the late great Chris ""Mr. Belvedere"" Hewitt as Roger DeBris."

"ramidr","10","0","1","19 August 2001"," I wanna be a Producer
","One of the most clever films ever made.  No need for political correctness, the film that is now the King of Broadway relies on solid linear storytelling, ingenious characters and fun dialogue.  Brooks' work here is not that of the broad satire found in ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Spaceballs"" but rather inahbits an environment that is just realistic enough that one starts to wonder if Biyalstock and Bloom's scheme could indeed work, that their reality is that of our own.  Indeed, Brooks has admitted that Max Biyalstock was based on a real producer he knew at a young age.  And what a character to know.  Zero Mostel gives one of his most charming and yet at the same time sleazy performances.  You love this character, his manic obsessiveness coupled with Gene Wilder's Bloom's anatagonizing over everything makes for an incredibly enjoyable on-screen duo.  But it's not just the dialogue and great songs (if you want more go, if you can, to the outstandingly, mind-numbingly great musical), or wild characters but it's the little things that set this film high above shlock like the ""Brady Bunch"" movie.  For me this means the genuinely charming moments where Bloom decides he'll ""do it"" and water shoots from the fountain behind him as he will now be free of his accounting job.  When he realizes he's having fun in the park with Max also always brings a smile to my face. Lastly my big laugh out loud momet is right at the start of the film, as Max lunges for Lick Me, Bite Me only to make a grand fallthrough a table. Standard for a comedy I know, but Mostel's reaction is just so perfect that one can't help but laugh.  If you thought fallling through tables was the domain of Chris Farley your wrong.

","This is a very funny movie, with several classic moments, and is definitely worth watching.  However, the casting of Dick Shawn was a tragic error. Shawn -- who was actually a very good standup comedian in real life -- was no actor, and the middle-aged Shawn's attempt to play a stoned-out 1960's hippie falls sadly flat.  In a remake, I'd vote for someone like Eddie Murphy or Christopher (""Jim Ignatowski"" of Taxi) Lloyd for this part."

A lot of writers and directors are afraid to go over the edge, which stunts a films ability to be outrageous and just plain fun to watch.  Be a GOOF!"

","I saw the movie for the first time last spring(time) and found it to be ""cute"" but not quite as brilliant as I was expecting. Then I was lucky enough to see the Broadway show with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick last month. What a masterpiece!<br/><br/>The new show scales back on some of the characters (no LSD, for example) and expands others (Ulla is a much more central character), but for the most part it is pretty faithful to the movie, even down to a lot of the dialogue. So why did I like the movie and LOVE the show? I think the difference is, the story lends itself so perfectly to being a brassy, broad, over-the-top musical, that the film seemed somehow too ""little."" It should be larger than life, just like Max Bialystock. The show's score (all written by Mel Brooks) is lush and melodic, but just listen to the bawdy, hilarious lyrics! I'd highly recommend to all fans of the movie to get new cast recording of The Producers on CD.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooks, if you're listening, please, PLEASE consider shooting a musical remake with Nathan and Matthew, especially for all the fans who won't get a chance to see it on Broadway. Who knows, maybe it would spark a new generation of movie musicals, something Hollywood is sorely lacking right now. In the show, Roger DeBris is seduced into directing ""Springtime for Hilter"" by the lure of a Tony (""Tony-Tony-Tony""). Maybe Mr. Brooks will answer to the call of Oscar-Oscar-Oscar..."

","Although this film predates me my 3 years, I just can't get enough of 'The Producers' by Mel Brooks.  Zero Mostel (Max Bialystock) and Gene Wilder (Leo Bloom) are delightful in their roles as a washed-up theatrical producer and a mousy accountant, and the chemistry between Mostel and Wilder is just incredible.  Dick Shawn is hilarious as the Jim-Morrison-wannabe Lorenzo Saint Dubois (or as his friends call him, L.S.D.).  Several smaller roles provide an assortment of oddballs that makes the movie enjoyable -- the good-natured inebriate, the concierge, the assortment of Hitlers, Ulla, Carmen Giya, Roger DeBris, and the ""Hold Me Touch Me"" lady.<br/><br/>However, the movie's big scene-stealer is Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, the author of Bialystock and Bloom's planned theatrical flop, ""Springtime for Hitler.""  His performance is Oscar-quality, and he delivers some of the funniest lines of the film: ""Hitler -- there was a painter. He could paint an apartment in one afternoon, two coats!"" and ""You are the audience.  I am the author.  I outrank you.""<br/><br/>I first saw this movie on VHS, and I can easily say that this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever on film.  I had to buy my own copy, and I can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it. The plot is well-developed and funny, and ends on a hilarious note.<br/><br/>

","In 1968, the world had seen the second world war end, and managed to push out of it's mind the horrors committed by the Nazis in it's duration.  How to deal with such horrors in a way that would commit entertainment ? Mel Brooks attacks the problem with the weapons the Jews have always armed themselves with in order to survive: humor, or in this case, heavy-handed yet clever satire.  During the tale of an over-extended ""producer"" of plays (Zero Mostel) and his adoption of his accountant and the accountant's innocently declared scheme to oversubscribe investors in a play to be found---and   guaranteed to fail---thereby with no questions to be asked by the investers, with Mostel and his accountant(Gene Wilder) escaping with the $$$$$ vast oversubscription.  They locate a Nazi loyalist living in Manhattan who has written a play honoring Hitler.  It seems a cinch...until the unexpected happens, all after Mostel has sold thousands of percentages of the play all to ""little old ladies"" who are enticed by Mostel's charm and promise.  The movie uses the play's author, Naziism, and Hitler himself(with great help from comedian Dick Shawn)as the butt of jokes/ridicule throughout the unfolding of the scheme. Even after these 32 years intervening since 1968, a multitude of the joke lines remain alive and well ...and in frequent use."

The premise of two producers seeking the worst play in the world is brilliant, but even so does not prepare you for the farce of ""Springtime For Hitler"".  The song and dance routines are unforgettable, as are the flower-power actor called L.S.D., the director who likes wearing ballgowns, and the furious author in a German helmet.<br/><br/>The ridicule and fun are relentless, but  Mel Brooks' greatest comedy is a triumph of human spirit too.

Zero plays Max Bialystock, a once great Broadway producer who now prostitutes himself to ""little old ladies"" to earn money for shows that he will never really produce. When an accountant named Leo Bloom shows up to do Max's books, the nervous Leo (Wilder) realizes that a Broadway producer could make more money with a flop than with a hit show. Max's ears perks up, and he soon cons Leo into co-producing the worst show ever to hit the Great White Way. The play, a musical, written by an German ex-patriot named Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars, the wooden-handed policeman in Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"") is called ""Springtime For Hitler"". To make sure the show is a ""sure-fire flop"", they hire Broadway's worst director (actor Christopher Hewett as the flambouyant ""Roger DeBris"") and worst leading man (actor Dick Shawn as ""Lorenzo Saint DuBois).<br/><br/>What could go right?<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Brooks' ""History of the World Part One"", you will recognize director DeBris' personal secretary ""Carmen Giya"" played by Andréas Voutsinas. Look for actor Barney Martin (he played Jerry Seinfeld's dad ""Morty"" on the hit tv show ""Seinfeld"") as one of the stage Hitler's generals, and listen for Mel Brooks' voice dubbed into the show's big opening number. Believe it or not, but THE PRODUCERS has more quotable lines of dialogue than the rest of Brooks' films combined!
