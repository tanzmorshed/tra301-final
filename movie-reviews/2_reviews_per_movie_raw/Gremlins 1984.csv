"ITTMovieFanatic","10","83","100","8 June 2004"," 20th Anniversary Review
","Exactly 20 years ago today ""Gremlins"" opened in theaters across the U.S. It went on to be one of the biggest smash hits not only of the summer of 1984, but of the entire year. And in my opinion, it deserved to be a hit. I remember seeing this movie at a movie theater with some friends of mine right after it opened 20 years ago, and I said afterwards, ""this is going to be a huge hit"". And it was. <br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is a story that plays like a darker version of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T."" Which is funny, because it was Spielberg himself who had the vision of ""Gremlins"" becoming a movie. Spielberg, along with his then collaborators Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy (the trio founded the production company Amblin Entertainment), served as executive producers of the film. Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies as well as the first two ""Home Alone"" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's ""Piranha"", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit ""Jaws"", and a segment of Spielberg's ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"" a year earlier). What they created was a movie that was great fun from start to finish.  <br/><br/>
""Gremlins"" is about a young man who receives a very unusual Christmas gift from his inventor father. He gets a little friendly creature called a Mogwai, which is as cute as a button. But there's a twist. There are three rules that must be followed in caring for the Mogwai: Rule #1 - Keep them away from light; Rule #2 - Don't get them wet; and Rule #3 - Don't feed them after midnight. When the rules get broken, all hell breaks loose as mean-spirited little monsters turn everything upside down. ""Gremlins"" then turns into a super-duper special effects picture, with the creatures created exceptionally by Chris Walas (Oscar winner for the makeup job on the 1986 remake of ""The Fly""). These monsters are scary to be sure, but also very funny with some of the antics they provide. <br/><br/>Even though the special effect monsters steal the show, the acting by the human actors is very good too. Zach Galligan makes the most of his film debut as Billy Peltzer, the young hero who tries to stop the gremlins; Phoebe Cates is effective as his girlfriend; the late Hoyt Axton is a hoot as the inept inventor father (some of his crazy inventions are hilarious, especially when the inventions backfire into slapstick catastrophes); Frances Lee McCain is good as the mother and housewife (who has one big scene with the nasty critters); Polly Holliday is wickedly funny as Mrs. Deagle, the meanest woman in town; and Dante regular Dick Miller is a riot as Mr. Futterman, the nice man who's always complaining about hand-made products being made out of foreign parts. Judge Reinhold and Corey Feldman have small roles as Billy's bank co-worker and good friend, respectively, and look for a quick cameo by Spielberg himself. <br/><br/>""Gremlins"" was such a big hit in 1984 that it got re-released back in theaters the following year before it made its debut on video. The movie grossed over $153 million at the box office (combining the original 1984 release and the 1985 re-release). And it stands alone as a great creature feature. ""Gremlins"" was also imitated many times shortly afterwards. Following in its footsteps came 1985's ""Ghoulies"", and 1986's ""Troll"" and ""Critters"". All these movies spawned sequels of their own, and none of them came close to capturing the greatness of ""Gremlins"" (although the original ""Critters"" came the closest; it was the only movie out of that bunch that I mildly enjoyed). Six years later came the ""Gremlins"" sequel ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"". It wasn't as good as the original, but it's still a good movie sequel. I'll take ""Gremlins 2"" as well as the original ""Gremlins"" over ""Ghoulies"" or ""Troll"" anyday.<br/><br/>***** (out of five)"
"Big Movie Fan","Null","79","99","5 January 2003"," Ugly Bunch Of Creatures Causing Chaos
","Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.<br/><br/>Basically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn't have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.<br/><br/>The film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can't be easy. Most comedy horror films are a joke (such as some of the Ghoulies films which emulated the Gremlins series) but Gremlins is both funny and scary. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well.<br/><br/>Gremlins deserves a look from anyone interested in seeing a good comedy horror movie."
"jenn_nm_","7","43","53","22 August 2005"," Funny, entertaining, a little scary. Perfect as a child's first ""scary movie"".
","This movie used to scare me immensely when I was younger. It was the first ""scary movie"" I saw as a kid, and I think that may effect why I love it so much today. Nostalgic purposes, indeed.<br/><br/>I think this movie is good for it's purpose. It's not meant to be some life-changing, or hysterically funny, or terrifying suspense movie. It's meant to give you some scares, some laughs, and entertainment. And it does indeed entertain.<br/><br/>We've heard since the 50's about little green men, and in this movie, they are there. And they don't even have to come from outer space, just Chinatown. The actual mogwai (what the gremlins are before they transform) are adorable. So at first you are surprised at how this cute little furry creature who sings a little song could produce other mogwais whom are not so nice. I won't give away how they reproduce or turn into gremlins, but it's all kind of strange, and very fantasy-like.<br/><br/>A great movies for adults to watch with kids for their first ""scary movie"". I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot. I would recommend maybe six years or older, and if they get too scared, tell them it's really just puppets. (It is.) Overall, this film is entertaining, very 80's, a little scary, and pretty funny."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","9","58","74","4 August 2000"," Nobody's got a story like this one. Nobody!
","A dark, crazy, twisted, inventive, and violent Christmas classic. There's really no way to classify or categorize Gremlins. It's too mean-spirited to be a kid's film, but not quite intense enough to justify a higher rating (though the 15-rated UK version makes a mockery of the BBFC guidelines). That grown-up 15 logo on the old VHS and the classic John Alvin poster artwork was enough to intrigue me as a kid and I've been hooked ever since.<br/><br/>Gremlins has long been an annual tradition for movie fans. The cozy, snowy atmosphere of Kingston Falls (which appears to be in upstate New York somewhere but is, in actual fact, Hill Valley at Universal studios) is the perfect small town that we all wish we came from. Even when the Gremlins invade it's a homely place to be envious of.<br/><br/>I was frightened of the Gremlins when I was a kid, but they're really nothing more than gigantic smiles with arms and legs. They exist only to have fun at the expense of human life and private property. I suppose they could be a metaphor for hedonism or apathy. Originally a much more evil script (intended to be an anti-Wonderful Life), Chris Columbus was inspired to write Gremlins as he listened to the rats in his apartment scurry about in the dark during the night. He lightened the material somewhat before filming began, but Joe Dante's wild vision makes it a twisted, festive reality.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of Jerry Goldsmith's outrageous score and that famous theme tune 'The Gremlin Rag', a demented circus fanfare of anarchy and mayhem. It's crazy to think that we had to wait 27 years to get released on CD. It's one of the first movie themes I even began humming as a young child, and I still do to this day.<br/><br/>Gremlins sparked the rise of Chris Columbus as a creative force in Hollywood. Only 25 at the time of filming his career has been made up of classics, and Christmas classics, such as The Goonies, Young Sherlock Holmes, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Harry Potter, and Bicentennial Man. Joe Dante never scored a bigger hit, but his subsequent career significantly defined 80s and 90s cinema with movies such as Innerspace, The 'burbs, Gremlins 2, and Small Soldiers. Goldsmith scoring every one of them until his death in 2004 (and movie scoring has simply never recovered from this loss).<br/><br/>Neither of them knew the massive franchise and fan-following which Gremlins would provoke, but it certainly deserves it's place in pop culture history."
"MovieAddict2016","9","60","81","21 December 2003"," One of my personal favorites...
","Some films are not what they seem. Take ""Gremlins"" (1984) for example. It is the story of a small-town kid who acquires a strange creature that spawns a pack of menacing green beings that terrorize the inhabitants of the cheery little area.<br/><br/>A silly idea, yes, but surely a fun one, and surely one to be cherished. It isn't technically a great movie, or even a very good one, but it doesn't mean to be. The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see ""Critters""), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.<br/><br/>Thank Joe Dante for this movie. And thank him for providing us with magnificent and imaginative films over the years. He is one of cinema's great underrated directors, the man responsible for bringing other creatures to life very often, whether it is werewolves or small toys or Looney Toons.<br/><br/>The movie is centered around Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), the small-town kid mentioned above who is handed a Mogwai by his father (Hoyt Axton), who picked the puffy furball up in Chinatown during one of his routine salesman trips. Billy's father is a sort of failed inventor, reminding us of the frizzle-haired Doc Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in ""Back to the Future,"" only not quite as eccentric. ""Back to the Future"" came out a year after ""Gremlins,"" and the two are similar in the way they entertain -- silly little ideas that nevertheless become almost genius. Time travel was a myth before ""Back to the Future,"" which turned it into an adventurous notion, a way of being able to transport people back in time to see their own parents. (H.G. Wells himself hadn't even approached these topics, and I can guarantee he would have never sparked a relationship between the sibling and his mother.)<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is milestone movie-making magic, a simple idea like ""Back to the Future,"" stretched out into a bigger picture. I won't kid you -- it's not as complex as ""Future"" is, but it doesn't need to be, and certainly doesn't want to be. It relies on humor and charm, and it has plenty of it.<br/><br/>Billy works at the town bank, hounded by the city grouch (Frances Lee McCain) and threatened by the vice president (Judge Reinhold). His long-time sweetheart (Phoebe Cates) works there, too, and at the local bar, occupied by drunks at night (and on occasion some nasty gremlins). The town loon (Dick Miller) is convinced there are gremlins about, and soon he is right.<br/><br/>""Don't ever get them wet,"" Billy is more or less told by his father. ""And don't feed them after midnight."" (See if you can spot the huge flaw in that rule.) Well, the small little Mogwai, Gizmo (voiced in burps and small cutesy sentences by Howie Mandel), does get wet, and spawns a set of fellow furballs -- all apparently mean-spirited and vile. And after tricking Billy by cutting the power on his clock, they get fed after midnight -- and basically evolve overnight into a bunch of green, nasty little gremlins, all of which continue to spawn throughout the town and cause absolute chaos.<br/><br/>Will Billy defeat the gremlins, get the girl, and save the town? Take a wild guess.<br/><br/>Everything Joe Dante touches is usually magic. Even his live-action/animation film ""Toy Soldiers"" was a load of fun because of its charming disposition. Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of ""Gremlins,"" one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original. It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun. The sequel also introduced the mandatory Goofy Idiot Character. In fact, it had two -- a Donald Trump-like manager and a gremlin that more or less belonged in The Three Stooges, and definitely not in a movie about menacing creatures. In fact, another of the first film's highlights was the way it made its creatures dark, hurtful, and just plain funny. (People complained that the launching of Frances Lee McCain out a window was too much, but come on.)<br/><br/>As a whole, I didn't think that the sequel worked especially well. But it has as big a fan following as the original in some respects, for those who favor goofy, pointless cash-ins over original, hysterical movies.<br/><br/>I wouldn't expect many people to love ""Gremlins"" as much as I do, but its charm is certainly worth commenting on -- and so is its wicked humor. Dark, chaotic and pretty darn infectious, the film's sense of humor quickly kicks into boot even during the campy voice-over narrative. The whole film is campy. And unlike something like ""Critters"" (which I loathe), this film is endearing and fresh and funny and has a bunch of likable characters -- especially Gizmo, the favorite and most infamous little critter ever seen on screen, and Stripe, the lead gremlin whose unfortunate frying incident at the end of the film actually makes you sad. No sequel for that little creep.<br/><br/>5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","Randall Peltzer (the late Hoyt Axton), while going all around town trying to sell his faulty wacky inventions, accidentally stumbles on a cute little Mogwai at an antique china store. The owner refuse to sell it, but the kid sees dollar signs and sells it to Mr. Peltzer, telling him three things never to do to the creature. So back in Kingston Falls, the misguided inventor presents it to his son, Billy (Zach Galligan) telling him the warning that the Chinese boy imparted to him. Needless to say, Billy ignores all three rules and soon evil little Gremlins are all over town causing rampant destruction.<br/><br/>This movie is greatness in every single way. With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from the glorious '80's (Man that decade was GREAT to be a kid or teenager in).Never overtly slapstick comical, this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less and seeing the amazingly great Dick Miller is ALWAYS a treat. By the by, call me dense but I never realized that Howie Mandell did the voice for Gizmo. That's kinda neat. This was followed by a sequel that's just about every bit as good as the original.<br/><br/>My Grade: A <br/><br/>Special Edition DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Joe Dante, Producer Mike Finnell and Gremlins Creator Chris Walas, Second Commentary by Dante and Actors Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller and Howie Mandel; Cast & Crews bios; 8 Additional Scenes (with Optional Commentary; Photo Gallery; short vintage featurette; Theatrical & Re-issue Trailer; and Trailer for ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch"""
"tymooda11","9","9","10","21 January 2017"," What a blast!
","Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" is an absolutely, amazingly fun time. The concept of the Gremlins themselves being so intriguing and fun, and face it, Gizmo is one of the cutest creatures in cinema history. While this movies first 20 minutes are a bit boring, once the story and absolute fun insanity begins you'll be having such a good time that the run time of the film will completely slip by. I have loved this film since a young age, and sure it may be nostalgia, but god do I really love this movie. I highly recommend watching this on a cold winter night, with hot chocolate, and a warm bowl of popcorn. I guarantee that you will have a fun time with this. It's not a thought provoking film, it won't change your life, but it is a fun ride , completely worth it's length"
"Leofwine_draca","6","14","18","27 February 2011"," Perennial favourite
","A perennial Christmas favourite, Joe Dante's monster movie is a kid's film for grown ups, made when children's cinema still had real bite. Watched today, twenty-six years after it was first released, it still holds a great deal of charm for the adult viewer who grew up in the '80s. As with most of Dante's movie, a lot of the fun alone comes from the director's clear affection for the genre, watching for all the gags and references that are surely to come, such as the scene involving the classic Time Machine.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie...the depiction of small town and family life is very well realised. There's a cosy feel to film's first half. Zach Galligan is a charming hero, and Phoebe Cates the fitting object of his affection. Dick Miller, a genre standby since the '50s, has a nice role to sink his teeth into, and it's also great to see Keye Luke in a pivotal role. The supporting characters, particularly Hoyt Axton as the inventor-father, are well drawn. When the gremlins and their brand of anarchy take over, I was less impressed. The film descends into silliness I could have done without, but then picks up for a climax in which Gizmo shows his true colours, so it's not all bad. I found the sequel, GREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH, to be equally fun."
"Aaron1375","8","24","34","7 April 2003"," Best of the small creature attack movies.
","After this movie there were several other movies that tried to capitalize on the success of this movie. For the most part though they failed to live up to the energy and fun of this movie. Heck, not even the sequel of this one had the energy of this movie. Here we have a guy getting a pet as an early xmas gift, a cute creature called a Mogway. It however, does have a few problems, as it needs special care. One thing you can't do to it is get it wet. Well Billy does (that is the guy who got it). This breeds more of the little critters, and they are harmless enough at first as well. Then they are fed after midnight and this turns them into Gremlins. This new form is a beer drinking, candy eating, mischief machine that isn't above killing. Most of the original batch is killed off in a gruesome kitchen scene, but the leader, Stripe, gets away and dives into a ycma swimming pool, so the whole town gets overrun by the little monsters. This movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Even though the Gremlins do kill, this movie never gets as dark as some of the copycats, or too goofy like some of them do. It ends up being a well-made movie that is fun to watch."
"UniqueParticle","10","7","8","8 December 2019"," A wonderful nightmare fueled classic gem!
","I got to see Gremlins in the theater today which was thrilling and very enjoyable especially since I've seen the film a few times. I absolutely love the soundtrack and all the scenes with the gremlins! Phoebe Cates is precious, I love the rest of the cast too. Legendary Joe Dante experience among many others."
"ElMaruecan82","8","6","7","7 March 2016"," Makes the 80's feel as classic and classy as the 50's...
","It's quite fitting that Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" features many scenes of people watching black-and-white classics on mini-TV sets, one is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (of course, it's Christmas time) and another is ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (""they're here already, you're next!). It's fitting because in a way, ""Gremlins"" is like a Christmas movie victim of schizophrenia, trying to swim in waters that couldn't have been more different, a Capra-like Family Christmas film and a Sci-fi/Fantasy monster B-movie, appealing to kids and moms with so many 'ow'-inducing moments and to teens and young adults with gross violence, only redeemed by its wicked sense of humor.<br/><br/>But as twisted as it sounds, the film works and now, it exudes the same classic vibes as these very classics I mentioned, now that the 80's are like the 50's in the 80's. And that's ""Gremlins"" greatest accomplishment in my opinion, it takes me back to a time that will never be again, and it has nothing to do with chronology, but with a sense of innocent fun that I feel has deserted movies and TV programs as well. It's the kind of film that constantly reminds you of the first time you saw it, and your emotions when you discovered this strange big-eyed creature named Gizmo, perhaps the cutest cinematic creation since R2D2, an improved version of the Ewoks with a Disney-eque touch.<br/><br/>I'll never forget that winter morning when I was having my breakfast, my father had just recorded the film the previous night, and before going to school, he was in a hurry to show me the first part, and it started with the gift-moment, which till now, remains one of my favorite Christmas scenes ever. It has everything: a family reunion, the lights being turned off giving it a strangely ominous atmosphere, and the little noise inside the package adding to the suspense, not to mention that haunting whistle tune that will never fail to shed a few tears whenever I hear it. Little Gizmo's entrance is one of the most defining moment of the 80's, and most irresistible too.<br/><br/>And Gizmo didn't need any computer support, looking like a cute puppet with lips and eyes movements, so well done that you were convinced you were watching a living creature, so the film doesn't overplay the special effects on that level. The gift scene goes on as the mother (Frances Lee McCain) takes a picture of the creature but the bright light startles Gizmo who immediately seeks refuge into Billy's arms, which is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. The father (Hoyt Axton) just remembers there are three rules to respect regarding the Mogwai, and I still see my father telling me to pay attention, rising his index finger as if I was the one to take care of Gizmo, so I religiously listened to the rules: no bright lights, no water and of course, no food after midnight.<br/><br/>I was young enough not to tell the 'absurdity' of the midnight clause, but smart enough to guess that each of these rules would be broken sooner or later and things would go out on control, yet I didn't finish the film until the year after. My father told me the movie was creepy and after another viewing, even as an adult, I can tell that the little one I was would have been scared by the film. It's a pity that a story that has so much charm and delight to offer in the first part, gets so hideously violent after, even in a fun way. Yet there is a scene where a kid played by Corey Feldman is first amazed by Gizmo but then he quickly loses interest and starts reading a comic-book, there had to be some horror and the cute material was only the set-up (although it's what I love the most about ""Gremlins""). <br/><br/>All the horrific events are still enjoyable and were cleverly sugarcoated by Chris Columbus' script, but I just love the non-violent parts, starting with this opening scene in the China Antiques store where the father's discovery feels like a moment borrowed from Indiana Jones (not a surprise when you know who produced the film). I love the Capra-esque look of small snow-covered town Kingston Falls and her Mr. Potter-like figure, an old hag who's the only human antagonist. And then you have Zach Galligan as Billy, and that was a perfect casting, there's so much likability conveyed by his wide-eyed naive eyes and his timid smile that his bonding with Gizmo feels genuine and real, and their interactions contribute to the film's best moments.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is full of tenderness and that little piano moment remains my favorite one. There is also a great friendship between Billy and his girlfriend played by Phoebe Cates, and what is more interesting than these two characters (certainly less flashy than the Gremlins) is that they remain as vulnerable and human at the end of the film as when it started. They never turn into some last-minute super heroes, and the last scene takes us back to what makes the film such an endearing classic, it's the perfect emotional reward and it's done in a simple and clever way, letting the final voice-over introducing that ""Gremlins"" so Un-Christmas-like score.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" owes its existence to the monster-premise, no one would have cared about cute little creatures otherwise, but it's for the cute moments that I'm sure the film is still appreciated and beloved. It also reminds of the 80's where even monsters-films could afford to be cute, and special effects could be amazing without CGI, and when we could come up with new inventive creature and amazement to the eyes without rebooting or remaking old stuff. And to twice the nostalgia effect, the film doesn't just remind me of this time, but of that first time I saw it. And both were good."
"nothingbeast","Null","7","9","26 April 2003"," Large numbers of confused parents!!!
","When this movie first came out, a lot of parents made the fatal mistake of thinking it was a cute, children's movie. In fact, it was this movie and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" that prompted the film industry to create the PG-13 rating. This one only got a PG.<br/><br/>My mother was one of the parents who confused the movie as one suitable for children.<br/><br/>Needless to say I was horrified by this movie as I was only 4 years old. This movie caused me to be severely afraid of the dark for many years. Yet, strangely enough, I wanted to watch it every year at my grandmother's house at Christmas time. It was tradition.<br/><br/>I think that if parents knew what they were getting into, this wouldn't have been as big a movie as it was, and would probably have been lost among rummage sales, and good will donations as a movie nobody wanted.<br/><br/>I love this movie, and it takes me back to when I was a frightened little boy, who was too scared to check under the bed when he heard those strange noises in the middle of the night. Almost 20 years later, those old scars still haven't healed completely, and sometimes just seeing ""Stripe"" on the cover will send chills down my spine and prompt me to move to a room with better lighting.<br/><br/>That's damn good film-making. Freddy Krueger didn't even do that to me.<br/><br/>I do get a kick out of the fact that every once in a while, the Disney channel will play this movie around the holidays.<br/><br/>Hoyt Axton's monologue at the begining trys to bring us into the movie by being the ""story-teller"" but during the movie, we trick ourselves with ""it's only a movie.""

"MGPT80","5","3","3","13 April 2020"," The more extreme end of 80s family films
","Gremlins is undoubtedly one of the most bizarre eighties films and appears to be quite polarizing amongst viewers. The concept of the film is imaginative and intriguing, and it arguably could have been a much bigger success with better writing and stronger characters. Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is very uneven and the story just doesn't flow very well. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are quite dull and Corey Feldman is criminally underutilised.<br/><br/>The puppetry looks heavily dated now but for 1984 I guess its acceptable. Mogwai is very cute, bordering on sickly, and the Gremlins are a bit over-the-top but good fun to watch. Things get a bit gory towards the end, enough to make the film unsuitable for many children. And this is where the problem lies, because Gremlins is simply not interesting enough for adults either. It ends up as a kind of tongue-in-cheek indie film which I'm not sure was the intention.<br/><br/>I remember enjoying it as a kid but looking back I'm not sure why. There are many better films from this era that are either just straight up horror movies or endearing fantasies."
"paulclaassen","6","3","3","10 February 2020"," Still a classic!
","Made in a time when they had to make use of practical effects instead of CGI, 'Gremlins' still holds very well by today's standards. It's hard to believe this film was made almost four decades ago!<br/><br/>The film is an interesting mix of comedy and horror. There are some really silly, illogical moments, but 'Gremlins' is not to be taken too seriously. You might sit shaking your head wondering why the creatures would do the silly things they do, but hey, it's all in the name of fun, right? Since these are also fictional creatures, who's to say what they are capable of and what their behavior should be?<br/><br/>Towards the end all hell breaks loose, and some scenes are disgusting (in a comedy-horror good way), and it's wonderful! The film has a good, fairly suspenseful, action-packed final act."
"cherold","7","6","8","10 December 2016"," Great Gremlins make an otherwise forgettable movie fun
","I just watched Gremlins for the first time in maybe 20 years, and while that's admittedly a long time, I'm still surprised by how much I didn't remember. Which is everything except the Gremlins.<br/><br/>Didn't remember the main star was a teen boy, or that there was a nasty rich lady, or Phoebe Cates, but I sure remember those Gremlins.<br/><br/>The movie patterns itself after 50s horror movies, with a pleasant small town overwhelmed by one or more monsters. And like most of those movies, the characters in that small town are bland and generic, with only Hoyt Axton seeming like a character you'd actually want to know better.<br/><br/>So at first the movie is pretty much a watchable, vaguely comedic movie about some kid who works in a bank and gets a weird pet. But once things get crazy, the movie becomes a twisted horror-comedy that is terrific fun.<br/><br/>This movie is very much one of those film-buff-boy films of the eighties. The movie is constantly referencing other movies, both specifically, as when someone is watching Invasion of the Body Snatchers on TV, and implicitly, as with the doesn't-she-seem-like- Margaret-Hamilton-in-the-Wizard-of-Oz character. This is perhaps why it's a bit more of a horror parody than an actual horror movie - more funny than scary.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not the world's greatest movie, but it is an 80s classic of sorts, and a good Christmas movie if you want something a bit non- traditional."
"Quinoa1984","8","9","15","11 December 2016"," seeing it as a kid vs an adult
","Seeing this again in a theater today on 35mm, and it strikes me how much this is a product of the 1980's even as it holds up (that is if you are one of those few brave souls who love the hell out of practical effects and creatures that have to be built - so many of these things have great individual personalities and designs, even as they're all either gremlins or mogwais). Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman, for example, plays the sort of borderline-adorable xenophobe - his one character trait here is that he doesn't trust a single thing that comes from another country - that today in America is not so adorable anymore (a Nixon frame on his wall seems quaint by today's standards). And the gremlins themselves can be seen as the sort of ""other"" or ""outsider"" threat that's coming to get us if we're not careful; it's not that we can't or shouldn't have in these foreign critters, but the responsibility is on us, perhaps, to make sure we don't turn them into hideous terrorists....<br/><br/>I may be reading a bit much into this. But it's still a piece of Spielberg Americana, a small suburban town (maybe less suburban than ET but close enough) where everyone seems to know everyone, but given Joe Dante and Chris Columbus's extra-dose of love for B movies and Loony Tunes. It also is wonderful as an homage to the sort of small town one saw in It's a Wonderful Life (which we see on a TV here) and gets sort of featured with the one cantankerous woman who practically runs the bank (her storyline gets put by the wayside for one reason or another).<br/><br/>Not unlike with the Evil Dead series, the first movie is more of a horror movie than a comedy, and I think it takes a little while for the comedy to find its footing - as a kid I found Billy's dad, played by Hoyt Axton, to be amusing, though now as an adult he doesn't hold up as well with the running gags of his mishap inventions (it's kind of cute, at first, but runs out of steam). But once the bad mogwais and especially the plethora of gremlins take over the town, it is an amazing pop-comedy spectacle. If nothing else it's worthwhile for the set pieces in the second half: that bar scene with Phoebe Cates at the mercy of all these damn creatures (the highlight of this movie for me is the jazzy, Tom Waits-like gremlin accosted by the one with the hand-puppets); all of them watching Snow White; the finale with 'Stripe' and how it's an actually effective suspense sequence, with maybe one too many false endings.<br/><br/>And in the middle is little Gizmo, like the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi built for no other purpose except to be sickeningly cute and... who wouldn't want a Gizmo, long as one is responsible for the little guy? It may take a little while for him to become notable to the plot, but when he does it's also a great deal of fun in that finale. So, there is a lot of nostalgia in this for me, as this was one of the first movies I can remember seeing as a little kid. How I respond to it today isn't too different, though I do recognize some of its flaws. Perfect ending."

","Back in 1984 I was a 11 year old just starting to learn to appreciate movies. In 1984 Gremlins was THE movie. It is the first movie, other than E.T. that had a strong commercial tie-in. I had all kinds of things that were Gremlin, specifically Gizmo related. My favorite was the the little Gizmos and Gremlins that you dropped into water and they grew really big. Man were those things slimy after they grew. No telling what kind of toxic chemicals I was touching with my bare hands. Oh the good old days, I can't help but give Gremlins a 10.

"barnabyrudge","6","6","9","22 August 2007"," Cynical, cleverly-made horror parody, marred by occasional mean spiritedness.
","The master of parody Joe Dante and the master of popular entertainment Steven Spielberg combine their talents (Dante as director, Spielberg as one of the executive producers) for this cleverly assembled comedy-horror. Gremlins is a fun movie that delights in anarchic scenes of destruction and mayhem. But while some films think that destruction and mayhem on their own are automatically funny (e.g It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and 1941), this one remembers that things like characterisation and a build-up are also important. Gremlins still has its share of flaws, including unevenness in the narrative and occasional sequences that boil over into nastiness, but on the whole it is an enjoyable movie. The film's box office success certainly indicates that it caught the public mood at the time of its release.<br/><br/>Wacky inventor Rand Pelzer (Hoyt Axton) searches for a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) in a dingy curiosity shop in Chinatown. He eventually chooses a cuddly creature called a mogwai, with a severe warning from the shop-keeper's grandson that there are three golden rules any mogwai owner must obey. Never expose them to bright lights, never get them wet and, most importantly of all, never feed them after midnight. To begin with Billy is very careful with his new pet - named Gizmo - but one day one of the neighbourhood kids accidentally spills water on Gizmo. The water makes the mogwai multiply, giving birth to a whole bunch of babies.... but the babies are more malicious and devious than their parent and fool around with Billy's clock so that he unwittingly feeds them AFTER midnight. Their late night snack causes them to turn into vicious, nasty monsters bent on the destruction of the town. Wholesale devastation follows as the dangerous gremlins go on their rampage. Billy and his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) are the only ones with the courage and the know-how to fight back, but when one gremlin manages to make it to the local swimming pool - where it throws itself into the pool and gives birth to literally hundreds of little monsters - the town seems doomed.<br/><br/>Gremlins is primarily a monster movie parody, but in a subtler way it also parodies feel-good Christmas movies. The old James Stewart classic It's A Wonderful Life is seen playing in the background on several occasions, but here there's no goodwill and seasonal cheer on display as the titular gremlins start demolishing the town. Even Cates' character has a tragic Christmas story to tell, involving the death of her father whilst trying to ""play"" Santa Claus. It is always reassuring when parodies know where they're coming from, and Gremlins contains many in-jokes for film buffs to enjoy. In particular there are a number of telling cameo roles, among them exploitation director Roger Corman, while Dick Miller (star of several early Corman horror quickies) gets a chance to send himself up delightfully as the grouchy Mr Futterman. The monsters are designed by Chris Walas who successfully creates creatures that simultaneously come across as funny, nasty and fairly real-looking. Rounding things off neatly is Jerry Goldsmith's macabre funhouse-style score. Gremlins doesn't have a great deal of plot, which allows things things to crack along at a brisk pace but afterwards leaves one reflecting how slight the whole film is. Also, the black comedy inherent in the story is soured by touches that are just a little too nasty and mean-spirited. But, generally-speaking, this is a gripping piece of entertainment, worth a look if you're a monster movie buff or a connoisseur of the cynical."

","Billy's dad is an inventor and is always looking for cool presents for this son. So just before Christmas, when he finds a strange creature called a mogwai in a dark shop in Chinatown, he just has to have it despite the refusal of the owner. The rules for looking after the mogwai (who they rename Gizmo) are simple but an accident sees some water spilt on him, causing a handful more to reproduce from this one. Billy notices a difference between Gizmo and these new creatures but the full extent of the difference isn't clear until he mistakenly breaks the rule on feeding times and a whole new creature emerges.<br/><br/>Criminally screened in the middle of the afternoon by Channel 4 recently (they edited out anything unsuitable for a daytime audience) this film is a lot of fun on many levels. At the start the film exists within an all-American small town with snow on the streets, a sense of community and white picket fences everywhere. It is a world that perhaps owes more to Spielberg more than director Dante but it is a world that the latter takes great pleasure in perverting once the film gets going in earnest. The plot is simple and straightforward, mostly relying on the build-to and delivery of the gremlins' antics and the attempts to stop them. In doing so it produces a great fun horror for older teens and adults. It funnier more than scary but it still manages to do the latter well enough to do the job for the younger element of the audience.<br/><br/>The manic humour in the ""horror"" is well done and it produces great energy throughout. For adults there is another element in the usual referencing from Dante. It is occasionally clumsy here but mostly it is unobtrusive and funny Â– Dante never seems to let the film main get away from him and keeps the dark tone going even when his action is a bit silly. The cast are very much secondary to the creatures and their antics (whether it be the cute Gizmo or the much more fun gremlins) and their performances reflect this. Galligan is average while Cates is quite nondescript. Support is OK from the likes of Axton, Feldman and Miller but mostly they are all second fiddle to the creatures.<br/><br/>Overall though this is an enjoyable horror movie for younger audiences. It is very, very slightly scary as instead it is darkly funny during the violence. It is engaging even if it gets silly at times and the material is strong enough for an adult audience while also providing lots of film references for those that get them."
"slokes","5","13","27","31 March 2015"," It Came From The Eighties
","The sort of film where a good idea suffers from a patchy script and a lot of revisions, ""Gremlins"" reflects the time when it was made. The 1980s were a decade of goofy gimmick movies, and ""Gremlins"" offers exactly that.<br/><br/>While scouring Chinatown to sell one of his many inventions, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is introduced to a cute, furry critter called a ""Mogwai."" He names it ""Gizmo"" and brings it home as a pet for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). Gizmo requires special handling: no bright light, no water, and no feeding after midnight. After getting wet, Gizmo produces replicant Mogwai. ""This could really be the big one,"" Randall says happily. He is soon proved tragically correct.<br/><br/>When it was released in the summer of 1984, ""Gremlins"" was a marvel of cinematic wizardry on account of the animatronic puppets that make up the title characters. Much of the talk around the film centered on a sequence in the Peltzer kitchen where Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) has to fend off various attacks from the nasty gremlins, and in doing so contributed to the creation of a new MPAA- rating, PG-13.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant sequence, the one moment in the film where the special effects (designed by future Oscar winner Chris Walas), the story (by Chris Columbus) and a human performance deliver on the payoff ""Gremlins"" promises. McCain is so intense yet so funny you can get as much from watching her face as you do from the carnage on the countertops around her. It's one of the great moments of 1980s cinema.<br/><br/>The rest of the time, ""Gremlins"" is a tonally imbalanced, under- funny concept film that doesn't do much more than flog merchandise in the guise of a story. Conceived as a straight horror film, ""Gremlins"" went through various changes after producer Steven Spielberg took hold of the project, so that when it finally was released, it became a scare comedy without the jokes.<br/><br/>Entire plot lines were dropped, but the film is so ineptly constructed that their beginnings remain. We are introduced to Billy's interest in comics, a local pub under threat of condemnation, a poor mother trying to find a way to feed her children for Christmas, an obnoxious co-worker of Billy's played by Judge Reinhold, and other things, all of which vanish when the gremlins take over the second half. None are addressed again; Reinhold, the biggest male name in the cast, disappears entirely once the gremlins attack.<br/><br/>Director Joe Dante does what he can to make the filler interesting. I like the Reinhold character's come-on to Billy's girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates), inviting her to his apartment with the tagline: ""I'm talking cable."" It's a very 1980s experience in that and other ways, such as when the gremlins don leg warmers and start flashdancing. But for too long a time, ""Gremlins"" seems to be in a holding pattern, doing nothing much at all except presenting these red- herring story lines that never get resolved while the monsters themselves wait in the wings.<br/><br/>It's a very goofy film. One secondary character has a consuming hatred for all foreign things, which he talks about non-stop. A science teacher runs late-night tests on a caged gremlin in a middle-school laboratory. Both father and son Peltzer are walking Murphy's Laws, where anything that can go wrong does. Once they run amok, the gremlins often wear fitted caps and coats, as if they happened upon the little people's section of L. L. Bean.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" kicks into a higher gear with that attack, though it never again achieves anything like the sustained brilliance of the kitchen battle with Mrs. Peltzer. The film posits at one point that the gremlins are subtle creatures who creep into machinery and make the resulting carnage seem like an accident. This would have made for an intriguing idea, but Dante and Spielberg never do anything with it. They are making a gimmick movie, and striving for audience impact in the cheapest way possible.<br/><br/>It's fun for young people, I suppose, and those who first saw it when they were children. Give me the sequel instead, where the comedy is much stronger and the story more engaging."

They don't eat people or kill them in order to survive in any way. They just want to have fun and cause chaos! Their personalities are almost human and seem to represent a side of us that has no morals and just wants to let loose in a world without regulations.

","1984's ""Gremlins"" is really one of the best-known of holiday-themed horror and fantasy films that also double as darkly-humored comedies. That's what ""Gremlins"" is, essentially: a Christmas-themed horror-/fantasy-comedy. In that regard, the film has become a perennial Christmas-holiday classic, along the lines of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (1993) and the more-recent ""Krampus"" (2015).<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is a movie that I grew up watching throughout my childhood, but I don't think that I've ever really sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. But I do know that I've always liked this movie and gotten a real kick out of it.<br/><br/>Executively produced by master cinematic craftsman Steven Spielberg, expertly directed by Joe Dante (""The Howling"") and written by future Hollywood hot-shot Chris Columbus (""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire""), ""Gremlins"" is set a few days before Christmas in the fictional Midwestern town of Kingston Falls. As an early Christmas present, Billy (Zach Galligan) receives a mysterious, cute little creature known only as a ""mogwai"" from his inventor father to keep as a pet; Billy names the adorable critter ""Gizmo."" But taking care of a mogwai is a huge responsibility, we learn, and come with three rules that must be obeyed at all times: keep them away from sunlight, don't let get them wet, and don't let them eat anything after midnight. Seems simple, right?<br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>Gizmo accidentally gets wet, and he spawns five more mogwai creatures, but these are different from Gizmo. These newly-spawned mogwai are curiously more malevolent and voracious than Gizmo is, and a series of plot machinations result in them transforming into the true ""Gremlins"" of the film's title, and soon the small Midwestern town of Kingston Falls is overrun with little, reptilian-looking, mischief-making Gremlins. It's up to Billy and his new crush Kate (Phoebe Cates) to put a stop to these creatures before they have a chance to spread beyond Kingston Falls' borders.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" was one of several films released in 1984 that led the MPAA to revise its rating system because the film may not have been suitable for small children - despite its ""PG"" rating. It might have been too scary for some young tastes, according to parental groups who complained about the film's violent content. This led to the ""PG-13"" rating, which is now the go-to rating for most big-budget Hollywood films released today. If ""Gremlins"" were released in 2016, there's no question it would get a ""PG-13"" rating from the MPAA.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, ""Gremlins"" is a thrilling, cackling funny little holiday-themed fantasy-comedy film. The creatures in the film, designed by future Oscar-winner Chris Walas (who won an Oscar for David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" in 1986), are wonderful special effects creations - brought to life by a combination of state-of-the-art animatronics, puppetry, miniatures, and stop-motion effects. Gizmo, as the only ""good"" Gremlin, is adorable - but we see what he can become, after witnessing the transformation of his brethren and the havoc they're capable of causing around town. They're dangerous and cause a lot of epic property damage, but Dante and Walas are able to get some incredible laughs out of them later on in the film.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is a delightful little holiday hoot that you won't see anything like for a very, very long time.<br/><br/>10/10"

"maraudertheslashnymph","4","19","45","14 April 2009"," Too scary for kids, not clever enough for adults
","""Gremlins"" starts out well enough, as an inventor looking for a Christmas present for his son buys a strange little creature from a Chinese boy, despite the boy's grandfather's warnings that taking care of a ""mogwai"" requires a great amount of responsibility. Gizmo the mogwai goes home with the inventor to a small town where a mean old lady tries to make everyone's life hell and the inventor's son, Billy, has a crush on a girl. There are three rules to taking care of a mogwai: never get one wet, never expose one to sunlight, and never feed one after midnight. Of course, we know that by the end of the movie, all of those rules will have been broken at least once.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" goes downhill once it becomes clear that it's a movie without any kind of intended audience. Gizmo, the only good gremlin, is as adorable as a stuffed toy and the characters are portrayed in a broad way children can easily understand, but shortly after Billy's friend accidentally breaks the ""no water"" rule, the movie turns into something between satire and horror. It's too scary for kids, but not clever enough, scary enough, or sharp enough to hold the interest of adults. Kids will be the ones eager to see the mean old lady get her comeuppance, but the way in which she does will probably give them nightmares. Likewise, Billy's girlfriend's story of why she doesn't like Christmas is completely out of place for a movie geared at children. The movie doesn't know whether it wants us to laugh at the gremlins or to be truly afraid of them. The whole thing might have worked as a campily over-the-top shorter film, but there's not enough substance for a full-length movie, and after a while it grows tiresome waiting for the gremlins to be defeated and the movie to end.<br/><br/>I kept thinking of another 80's movie in which buying something strange from an old Chinese man leads to chaos, ""Little Shop of Horrors."" Unlike ""Gremlins,"" ""Little Shop of Horrors"" knows what it is (a satire) and knows who it was made for (teenagers and adults). Its twists and turns are capable of holding the audience's attention and it's genuinely funny. ""Gremlins"" could have been a children's movie about a cute gremlin named Gizmo, a horror film, or a tongue-in-cheek sendup of horror films. Trying to be all three at once doesn't work."

From the clothes to the cars to the music and movies, my life was pretty decent back then.<br/><br/>I sometimes like to 'relive' my youth and watch some movies that I remember liking as a youngster. Some of the movies still hold up as being great movies...Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Star Wars, Die Hard to name a few. <br/><br/>Others are not so great...Crocodile Dundee, Mannequin and Gremlins fit into this category. <br/><br/>The concept of this film is fairly great, and I give thumbs up to Chris Columbus for writing a decent script...well, half a script.<br/><br/>
The first half of this movie isn't too annoying, but when the Gremlins start their wicked ways, I feel like I'm watching an overblown SNL skit. The amount of juvenile humor is just plain annoying. This is one of those movies that was well talked about back in 1984, but cannot stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The highlight of this movie for me this time around was seeing the Back to the Future set being used.

"NxNWRocks","2","16","41","10 August 2004"," Not Underrated, Just Underdeveloped
","It's strange how some films become not just successful, but hugely successful.  Revisiting this movie recently, it's apparent that not only is it obviously dated two decades later, but it's very much a film which is remembered as being better than it is.<br/><br/>It requires an obvious suspension of disbelief to accept the very arbitrary rules of keeping a Mogwai (WHY does feeding it after midnight turn it into a Gremlin?)  That's par for the course for a blockbuster, and not a problem in itself.  The Mogwai's mechanical movement can't help but make it look fake, but we can overlook that too.  The real disappointment here is that the script, having crawled somewhat in the first half, falls away in the second, almost as if the Gremlins themselves had gotten to it in their chaotic manner.  Sure, we see scenes of havoc, but to what ultimate purpose?  The movie got a PG rating, but the Gremlins display the kind of behavior you wouldn't want kids to associate with, especially in the rowdy bar scene, during which Phobe Cates is behind the bar, inexplicably serving them drinks when most people would have high-tailed it out of there as soon as the little devils showed up.<br/><br/>The film also struggles to maintain a consistent tone.  Yes, it's a comedy foremost, but with some horror thrown in.  The comedy doesn't entirely work, even and especially in the scenes where the monsters run amok, and the film's lack of real tension undermines any attempt at a darker quality.  It is not aided in the least by the totally nondescript Zach Galligan in the leading role.  He is so bland that if he didn't keep moving you would lose him in the wallpaper.  Hoyt Axton is also ineffective in a stiff, monotone performance as the hapless inventor father, whereas Francis Lee McCain gets to add some beef to her role as typical American Housewife with one of the movie's best scenes as she defends her house, most notably the kitchen, from the Gremlins.  Cates and Reinhold are pedestrian in their supporting roles. The writing is such that the characters pretty much sidle up to an underwhelming resolution, putting the cap on a movie that, like one of Peltzer's inventions, promises much but soon goes haywire."

The story is streamlined and focused and the pacing very good. The acting is satisfactory and passable, but nothing splendid except for maybe Hoyt Axton who helps bring some gravity and grounding to the whole cast. Of course the gremlins are the stars of the show. They have their moments and get plenty of screen time. Some of the gags work, while others fizzle. I liked the word-play and vocals done for the gremlins - you can notice some high profile voice actors in the cast like Peter Cullin and Frank Welker.

","A timeless classic! Boy gets pet, pet spawns evil monsters, boy and pet have to save town from monsters.<br/><br/>It's Christmas, it's the 80's, it a small town in America with kooky residents where nothing ever goes wrong. Horror waits around the corner!<br/><br/>Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is given a new pet at Christmas, a Mogwai - a cute little teddy bear of a creature. Looking after a Mogwai is simple as long as you adhere to 3 simple rules; keep it away from bright light, don't get it wet, and don't feed it after midnight. One by one the rules are broken, resulting in the Mogwai multiplying, creating evil copies of itself; which gradually turn from cute fuzzy little creatures, into scaly and slimy monsters with a penchant for chaos and destruction. Before the town knows what's happening it's overrun with Gremlins, and thus the horror is in full swing. Supported by his love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates), Billy and his Mogwai (he's names it Gizmo) have to stop the Gremlins and save the town.<br/><br/>This is a fun film and because it's staged over in the festive period you are likely to encounter it year after year. I originally watched this as a child in the 80's and unless modern children have become really soft this is a film which is likely to entertain and not cause an offense. The scariest part, the pantomime villain, is probably old Mrs Deagle who wants to put Billy's dog 'to sleep'. Some of the effects and animatronics look a little dated now, but they still look a little better than some of the expensive CGI that's pushed on us today. It's simple, charming, entertaining, and much like the people in the film who are watching nostalgic black and white movies in the background as they enjoy Christmas, this film is one day going to be the nostalgic film in the background as you enjoy Christmas.<br/><br/>A typical 80's family comedy horror film, Joe Dante's film is fun for the family. 8 out of 10."

","Don't mind the bad reviews this movie is breathtaking. The use of puppetry and stop motion in this movie is done very well , especially as it was made in the 80s, also the acting ( unlike what some people may say ) is not dull and really adds to the feel of the movie! The comedy and horror is perfectly balanced, scaring you but not so much that they can't fit in a joke!! This movie is great and I solely recommend this movie to everyone."

","Review:
'Gremlins' is a comedy-horror film directed by Joe Dante.
remember watching this on video when I was a kid. I haven't seen it in a very long time. One of the sweetest, funniest and most original films ever made. Even the music is perfect.
The story follows a young man who receives a strange creature called a mogwai as a pet, which then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, evil monsters.
The acting isn't the best, but like I say with most of my review for movie of from the 80's, it's forgivable. It's not bad, and the actors do a good enough job to keep you mentally invested in the story.
This movie is greatness in every single way, with style, charm, and humor to spare. This film was among the top movies from the glorious '80's. It never gets overtly slapstick comical, but this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less
Overall, it's a great movie for adults to watch with kids for their first scary movie. I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot.
4.5/5"

","First off I must say I really enjoy watching Joe Dante movies. In fact I can't think of another director I have more fun with watching his or her movies. This I think was his best film. I was lucky enough that at my local movie theatre they were showing free Christmas movies and this was one of the choices. I jumped at the chance and watched this one. Man, I tell you the sound and the music from Jerry Goldsmith were great listening to while watching this film for like the 50th time on the big screen (where it was meant to be shown).<br/><br/>The basic gist of the story is well as I mentioned earlier its Christmas and inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is out looking for a gift for his son Billy (played by Zach Galligan). He's going through Chinatown and comes across a store owned by Mr. Wing (Keye Luke). Inside he's got exactly what he's looking for; a cute furry, lovable pet named a Mogwai. Thing is Mr. Wing does not want to sell it. Rand works out a deal with his grandson (John Louie) and gets the pet. Thing is there are three rules that you need to follow: 1) Don't get him wet 2) He hates bright light, in fact it will kill him 3) Don't feed him after midnight. As a first time viewer with no understanding of the Mowgai you are shown exactly why each of these steps need to be followed. To make a long story short these rules are not followed and in the end the nice little town of Kingston Falls is being taken over by green, slimy monsters who to say the least are mischievous.<br/><br/>Written by Chris Columbus, who went on to have quite a career directing HOME ALONE, MRS. DOUBTFIRE and a couple HARRY POTTER movies and produced by Steven Spielberg. Also starring Phoebe Cates, Dick Miller, Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold. Howie Mandel did the voice for Gizmo and both Frank Welker and Michael Winslow used their voices for some of the gremlins.<br/><br/>The music by Jerry Goldsmith is awesome and was one of my favourites when I was a kid back in the 80s. Its electronic and very 80s. I was whistling it coming out of the theatre.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I love watching Joe Dante movies is because of the hidden things that are in plain sight. For movie buffs I suppose you could say. Like looking for Robby the Robot, the time machine, Spielberg, Goldsmith, Chuck Jones, a Fangoria magazine to name just a few. Its great and Dante always seems to have a wonderful sense of humour in his films as well.<br/><br/>On a side note this along with I would say INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM were the movies that helped push along the PG-13 rating. This was rated PG, but the violence and gore are way too intense for a simple PG rating. The one scene in particular (and yes, I love it) where Mrs. Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain) is battling gremlins in her kitchen using a knife, a blender and a microwave all with gory results."
"coombsstephen","8","2","3","6 December 2019"," Not as cute and cuddly as I remembered but still a classic
","Just saw the remastered 35th anniversary showing and was a little surprised as the film has a lot more graphic violence than I remember.<br/><br/>The film is still great though and has stood the test of time really wel, although it's still a very 80s film. The funny bits are still hilarious and even the more gruesome boys are funny.<br/><br/>Still well worth a watch just remember if you have young kids is not all about cute and cuddly gremlins."
"Hitchcoc","8","2","3","1 December 2016"," Never Get Him Wet
","This movie really struck a nerve with my son. He watched it numerous times and did impressions of little Gizmo for years. This is really a sendoff of all kinds of horror movies, but with a real sense of humor. The little guy is so darned cute. He is cuddly and actually kind of pretty. Of course, we know from the beginning that things will go haywire. What is neat about this film is that what happens is so darned much fun. Gizmo's offspring are pure evil. They relish every kind of anti-social behavior. They are like a bunch of drunk teenagers who have lost any sense of order, willing to provide hurt to anyone who gets in their way. They have the appearance of bats or mosquitoes or some sort of hybrid. They are Gizmo gone bad. There are lot of pretty good character actors in this film who find themselves bewildered by what happens. I was surprised to see a country singer, Hoyt Axton, playing the father. I just remember a song called ""Bony Fingers."" This works delightfully, but not until incredible mayhem is launched."

","Gremlins is one of my favorite horror comedies in that it boasts some endearing characters, innovative ideas, and excellent execution of story.<br/><br/>While this is definitely not for fans of all ages, the exception being younger children, most everyone else will enjoy this fast-paced, twisted romp into the netherworld of magickal, mystical beasties and their lore.<br/><br/>Set in what was then contemporary America, and peopled with the popular young actors of the day, this work exhibits some of the same teenage appeal as did most 80's movies, but with the added draw of lovingly created monsters and characters.<br/><br/>It is great fun, if somewhat darkling in consideration, although to watch it today, it is rather dated.<br/><br/>It rates a 6.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Everybody has that one movie that they never get tired of seeing.  It's usually the same movie that you can quote line for line.  For me, that movie is ""Gremlins"".  This movie has everything.  Comedy, thrills, and a wonderful cast.  Joe Dante is a genius when it comes to directing and the sequel ""Gremlins 2:  The New Batch"" is a worthy followup and is also a mustsee. If you have never seen this movie or if it's been a while since you have, I would recommend picking up the Gremlins Special Edition DVD.  ***** out of *****"
"Chrissie","5","8","21","25 July 1999"," Nasty.
","It's disturbing that this film is supposed to be fun and amusing -- the poor befuddled snowplow driver's home being destroyed; the tavern being trashed while the girl is being terrorized, the science teacher viciously attacked, the murder of the town meanie. It would have been quite possible to make the gremlins pesky and troublesome without urging the audience to laugh at horrible misfortune.<br/><br/>The characters were all cookie-cutter cliches: wise old oriental, bungling inventor dad, sad-eyed tragic love interest, perky and resourceful kid, and the resurrection of Elvira Gulch, who was a much better character in the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>Sure, Gizmo was cute, and the scene where the monsters all gathered to watch Snow White had its charm, but overall Gremlins lacks anything endearing or enduring."
"marco-47826","7","1","1","10 June 2020"," It's a classic alright.
","One of the movies I used to watch as a kid, paired with the sequel, of course. I wonder if it's next in line to be banned, because the subtext is pretty clear and « offensive ». But who cares, anyway? It's entertaining, the perfect mix of horror and comedy, in 80s little blockbuster fashion. I wouldn't say it's a kids movie, because of the horror aspect that gets pretty intense sometimes. But everyone can enjoy it, and have a different interpretations of it, depending on your age and state of mind. It did age a lot, but it gives the movie a certain charm. It has a lot of similarities with Dante's previous work The Howling, through photography, music and atmosphere, even. But I often see it as one of Spielberg's on the side movie. My only complaint is that they made the movie too family friendly, and after reading the original script, I think it would've been better the way they planned it to be. Or not, we'll never know. All we know is how cult the movie can be, and still enjoyable after all these years. And that the sequel, is pretty good too."
"matthewssilverhammer","6","1","1","24 February 2020"," Dante's direction is the star.
","From the Christmas tree attack to the gremlins caroling to the speeding stair-chair flying out the window, the ""horror"" sequences are perfectly shot and wonderfully silly, striking the odd tone (mostly) well. I just wish the writing were up to the task; when Cates talks about dad dying in the chimney, it was such a weird jolt. Still enjoyed it, but can't help but feel like I would appreciate it more if I grew up with it. Thanks a LOT, mom."

I love the music! The noises that the creatures made were brilliant. Good use of surround too. Quite a cute film with plenty of excitement and humour. The gremlins were so funny and the absolute star of the movie. It is memorable but there is something about it that I wouldn't watch often."

","A furry, cooing mystical creature called a mogwai is adopted by a small town American family with the proviso it must not get wet...or eat after midnight. Turns out water causes the mogwai to multiply trouble-making little duplicates, while late night snacks turn the spawn into terrifying demons with an appetite for murder. Well-produced special-effects package in a Christmas setting was generally thought at the time to be director Joe Dante's wicked variation of E.T. (even with Steven Spielberg as its executive producer); but the film ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" had three-dimensional human characters as well as the adorable alien, while ""Gremlins"" writer Chris Columbus doesn't reach that far (in fact, he hardly reaches at all). Columbus sets up his cut-out characters to be targets, and then unleashes a barrage of nasty pranks on them (staged by Dante to get quick, cheap laughs). It's intended to be a black comedy, but some of the satire is too outrageous (such as with the break-dancing gremlin) and much of the mayhem is more mean-spirited than funny. There's OK work from Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates as the young couple at the center of the story (Cates once again working her cherubic, Lolita-like innocence to her advantage); yet the whole film has a sleepy, lethargic feel, as though it had been overworked at its earliest stages and arrived on the screen exhausted from all the effort. Followed by a sequel in 1990. ** from ****"

It's just fun and exciting to watch. You get your laughs, but at the same time, you get your chills. You do question what age gap this was meant for. I would recommend for pre teens and up. That's for sure. I do have one more question: If the animals can't eat after midnight, then when are they supposed to eat? Even if it's 11:00 P.M., still... isn't that after midnight? <br/><br/>Great movie from the 80's. Have fun with it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've been seeking out some Christmas related films I'd not seen before and wondering why my wife to this day still utters ""Bright lights"" when ever a room is lit up suddenly and talks about ""Gizmo eyes"", I decided to follow her recommendation and watch it with her.<br/><br/>I'm broadly aware of Joe Dante's reputation for spoof monster flicks and to be fair, I'll cut him some slack for mashing up a cutesy Christmas movie supposedly centring on a teenage boy's predilection for unusual and cuddly pets with a vintage monster movie with lots of outlandish and ghoulish deaths along the way. The film just about works by switching between the two modes at will, keeping the viewer on the hop all the time, indeed he serves notice of his intentions by interspersing classic film clips of quite different movies, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Them"" for instance.<br/><br/>Although many of the attack scenes are plain silly, like when Billy's mother takes on four Gremlins in her kitchen and especially the demise of Mrs Deagle which must have set back the sales of chairlifts at the time, Dante generally gets away with mixing up the goofy with the gore, even if to me the Gremlins themselves looked no more dangerous than Animal from ""The Muppets"".<br/><br/>A strange mixture then but perhaps not a movie to play for the very young on Christmas Eve."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","3","7","9 December 2009"," Silly but a very clever and engaging film- succeeds in both comedy and horror
","I will admit some of it is very silly, but all the same it is infectious fun from start to finish. Directed by Joe Dante, produced by Steven Spielburg and written by Chris Columbus, Gremlins has quickly established itself in my opinion as a comedy horror classic. The direction is rock solid throughout, and is super efficient. The script is funny and inventive, and the story growing from a very simple idea is engaging and delightful. Plus all the characters are credible. And I have to say Jerry Goldsmith's music is a treat, that man knows how to compose a good music score I can tell you. Haunting, shocking and exciting are three ways to describe the score here. The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite. But the acting from the human actors is just as good. Zach Galligan is bland at first, but as the film gets going and you know more of his character you warm to him. Hoyt Axton is indeed a hoot as the inept inventor, and Keye Luke is great as the Grandfather(Mr Wing). Also watch out for a young Corey Feldman as Pete Fountaine. Plus the Christmas speech makes it essential Christmas viewing. All in all, silly it is, but it is clever and consistently engaging. Not only that, it succeeds at both comedy and horror, and that isn't easy to do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","Gremlins is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a good cast. I always have fun watching this no matter how many times I've seen it and it normally makes for a great viewing with the family, just make sure they are older than eight at least as it is a dark film and though it isn't necessarily a horror, I wouldn't necessarily call it a family film either. I think the weakest point of the movie was its human characters, I liked Billy and Kate, but the rest of the human cast felt very underdeveloped and the majority were very two dimensional, I certainly would have liked to have seen the mother and especially the father develop more, he certainly had a story to tell that wasn't touched upon enough. The best part of the movie is, of course, the Gremlins themselves, particularly Gizmo, they can be lovable, terrifying, charming and outrageous, they're certainly one of the most memorable characters in film history. Not without its flaws, but Gremlins is a classic that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good horror or comedy, it's fun for the family as well depending on the ages. <br/><br/>A man buys his son an usual creature for Christmas which comes with some important rules, when these rules aren't followed, catastrophe ensues. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Zach Galligan Worst Performance: Polly Holiday"
"showtrmp","8","2","4","25 March 2012"," Entertaining mess
","""Gremlins"" is one of the wildest, most incoherent films ever to become a hit, but the style that sometimes makes the movie difficult to follow fits the subject--we in the audience literally don't know what to expect once the title gremlins are spawned and get loose (as we know they will). The beginning of the film cleverly sets up a super-bland Typical American Town out of Frank Capra; we get to know the local eccentrics (Hopeless Inventor, Spunky Housewife, Dense Sheriff, Miserable Old Rich Bitch) and the generic teenage dreamer Billy, who is presented on his birthday with Gizmo, an ultra-cute Furby-like creature who communicates in monosyllabic squeaks. Gizmo has a dark side, though; he accidentally spawns a breed of evil lizard-like monsters who invade the town on Christmas Eve and subject it to a destructive jamboree, like a miniature street gang on a sugar high. They're cartoon characters run wild--the movie shows how nightmarish it would be if animated cartoons turned evil and invaded the real world. Classic sequences abound; Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) battling the demons in her kitchen with the aid of a blender and a microwave; town harpy Mrs. Deagle (Polly Holliday) getting hers via a malfunctioning stair climber; Phoebe Cates' anti-Santa speech (I wonder if actresses ever used that monologue in auditions?) and a climactic battle scene set in a movie theatre playing ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" The movie gives the impression of a brainstorm, or a jazz session--not all of the ideas work, but there's so much going on it is impossible to be bored for a second."
"gizmomogwai","10","2","4","24 August 2007"," My favourite guilty pleasure
","Gremlins benefits a little from the fact that I grew up with it, but mostly I liked the sequel and since then I've realized the original is better. It's a guilty pleasure, but a well-shot, well-told one, owing partly to a classic setting and effective narration by Hoyt Axton.<br/><br/>Gremlins is a black comedy and scores some laughs. However, its story is an inspired mythology in its own right. A young man (Zach Galligan) receives a cute but unknown creature named Gizmo who multiplies, and after the new creatures (mogwai) eat after midnight, they become monsters. Lively, entertaining monsters- connected to the legendary gremlins in the mind of a veteran of World War II (Dick Miller). In one memorable sequence, they are also connected with the urban legend of pets being blown up in microwaves- this movie definitely struck a chord by borrowing from popular mythology. While the gremlins are shown enjoying the destruction they cause, with a bar scene being a highlight of the movie, the original manages to be a simpler product than its sequel, and less is more. Additionally, the original has the paradox of horror on Christmas, which the sequel misses. With cute and passable puppetry and passable performances, Gremlins remains a nice distraction."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","2","4","4 January 2005"," After seeing this popular 80's horror-comedy, I just have one question: That's it?
","After finally seeing Gremlins, after hearing so much about how much better it is than the second(which I've seen two or three times, as my favorite Danish TV network seems to be crazy about it), I can't help but think: That's it? That's what I've been hearing so much positive stuff about? The only horror lies in the horrible out-dated effects, and the humor, or lack thereof, is typical for 80's comedies. Really, what does this film have to offer that any other film doesn't? It's got all of the typical monster-film clichés just to show exactly how uncreative and unoriginal the writer and director is. The main cliché being; no one believing that there is such a creature, until they see it with their own eyes... and even then, they're doubting the hero. The jokes are tired and dull, and repeated into endlessness... the father-character's inventions not working, the Gremlins acting senselessly, noisy and destructively(strangely reminiscent of bratty children or the typical guy who's a jock and/or drunk)... not to mention them acting like humans(""look, it thinks it's people!""). What's funny about dressed up obviously fake puppets smashing things, anyway? I can't imagine why this would be funny to anyone but the kids. The really small kids. The infants. The plot is lame. The pacing is off(I was bored throughout most of the film and was half-asleep when it was done) and uneven. The characters are mostly poorly written clichés not to mention terribly unimaginative... the old lady who's basically a Mrs. Scrooge, the old wise Asian guy(Japanese, Chinese, whatever... he's got those Asian eyes and he's old, so he must be very intelligent, reserved, and spouting nonsensical fortune cookie slogans), the old guy who complains a lot... come on, I mean... did Joe Dante and Chris Columbus just want the paycheck really, really bad, and didn't feel like bothering with giving us viewers a decent product? The acting is nothing special. The special effects are instantly see-through and awfully outdated. The humor is dull and repetitive. Well, I suppose if you like seeing stuff blow up(which the father-character's inventions always do, eventually) and poorly designed puppets destroying pricey items, you might like it. Otherwise, I don't really recommend this to anyone... unless they're die-hard fans of 80's films. One last thing; what the heck was up with the supposedly depressing black comedy-like story Phoebe Cates' character gives towards the ending of the film, to explain her not celebrating Christmas? I mean, I understand her and all, but was that really necessary? It felt very out of place. I don't mind a depressing story about Christmas, not at all, but it just seems like they were originally making a much darker film, and then decided to redo some scenes, but forgot that one. OK, one last thing(I promise): why am I not surprised that the US is one of the few countries to give this film a rating that says that children can watch it? It's got plenty of violence and disgusting imagery, so I can't see why... oh, that's right... there's no sex in it. Silly me. Because, as we all know, sex is the very worst thing in the world and children may not, under any circumstances, be subjected to it(or even a hint of it) on screen. Please. The MPAA are ridiculous in their ratings. This is a childish film, no doubt about that, but hardly a children's film. I recommend it to fans of 80's films and not really anyone else, as I doubt anyone else will enjoy it. My rating is only above 5 to acknowledge the effort put into it. 6/10"

I watched it again today, and it was simply a pleasure. The movie is so jam-packed with symbolism it's amazing.<br/><br/>The movie starts off as Billy's dad (A failing inventor, that only creates havoc in Billy's house, by forcing his family to be Guinea pigs for his..""Gizmos"") brings home a seemingly harmless little furry creature, from a species called ""Mogwai""(Chinese for ""Monster"", cute huh?). The old Chinese guy(Not Asian-American, it's the 80's ;) doesn't want to sell him the Mogwai, claiming that it requires responsibility. His grandson(?) sneaks it out and sells it to Billy's dad, telling him the 3 rules he must keep to prevent things from going bad with the Mogwai. Billy's dad drops it on Billy like a hot potato, and drives off, in Christmas, mind you, to pursue yet another convention to market his gizmos.<br/><br/>Billy doesn't do much to keep the rules, and one cute gizmo suddenly creates a few other Mogwais. Ones that are not very cute anymore. Those evil Mogwais like technology. They especially like to use it to do bad stuff, which first means cutting off the power to Billy's digital clock, making him break the worst rule of all, and they grow into full-fledged Gremlins(A word describing a malfunction in a technological device. Etymology unknown, at least not to Webster).<br/><br/>The Gremlins start wreaking havoc, but almost never directly. Most of the times they are genuine Gremlins in the Machine, that cause traffic lights to go out, disable car breaks, and so on. Billy proceeds to eliminate them all when they gather in a cinema, except the big bad one, which then leads to the movie's climax: One of the irresponsible ones, trying to regain control of something that now controls him.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie's general message is ""Your technology might one day wake up and bite you in the ass, so be vigilant"". Of course, that's a very old argument, but hey, that's pretty much all the philosophical depth behind the much-celebrated sci-fi ""masterpiece"", The Matrix(That, along with the ""What is real?"" notion). Gremlins simply presented it 15 years earlier, with no Carrie-Ann Moss in tight latex.<br/><br/>Technically speaking the movie is well-made, with cute camera work, and the acting is perfectly fine(Not good, but I think that's due to the rather flat characters).<br/><br/>All in all, a good watch for those who have watched it as a kid. I hope there are no Gremlins in my ADSL modem - I'm clicking SUBMIT now :)"

","""Gremlins"" is one of those guilty pleasures.  It is not a very good film, but there is just something about this film that makes it watchable and enjoyable.  Young Zach Galligan gets a pet for Christmas, but everything goes terribly wrong when the pet gets wet.  Now there are several of these cute creatures, but the new ones are evil and after eating a bucket of chicken after midnight, they become the title ""Gremlins"".  Chaos follows and the small mid-western town is torn apart piece by piece.  The film is fun, but pretty short on direction, screenplay, and characterization.

","Gremlins comes from a time in film when, in order to accomplish desired effects, hard work was required instead of computers digitally performing all the magic.
The special effects in this movie are nothing short of fantastic. GIzmo is one of the most adorable creatures in all of film history, and his mechanics are second to none for the time. His evil Mogwai counterparts are surprisingly well performed technically. This isn't a film that went cheap on special effects and it really shows. It's extremely well dated.
The film itself, despite being an absolute classic, starts to drag somewhere in the middle, making the movie feel like it's just a little bit too long with a little too much going on. The first act was fantastic, with its introduction to Gizmo and multiple shots establishing that precious little creature, and the final act was exciting, but it really started to get tedious toward the middle.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant concept with a unique kind of evil that can be, without convenient circumstances, practically impossible to stop. The writing and acting were great as well.
This movie really embodies what made the 80s such a fantastic time for film. It's a movie that's worth multiple rewatches and will undoubtedly be on my watchlist for both Halloween and Christmas.<br/><br/>
Also, young Corey Feldman. You can't get any more 80s than that."

","Gremlins (1988) Review
Directed by: Joe Dante
Review by: Mr. Anderson & Mr. Anderson<br/><br/>
This movie attempts to put many different genres of film together, in a way that both fails in its never fully-realized tone, but triumphs as a delightful jumble of a mess that entertains anyone who lays eyes on it. As a film, it doesn't seem to be able to be critiqued as a certain type of movie. Gremlins in itself is an ""interesting"" work of art to say the least. Its near-perfect pacing allows the change from comedy to horror to effectively surprise its audience, however when it does go full horror mode, it's still clinging onto comedy at its roots, therefore never feeling like it never has its own tone. Every character in this movie is exactly the same, each and every one of them is flat and uninteresting. Nonetheless, the film tries to make up for its shallow character and oftentimes silly dialogue with the charming Mogwai the film presents to us. The puppetry in the film is very well-done and every Mogwai's emotional expression feels authentic and convincing. With its many flaws and messy execution, Gremlins still pulls off a unique and offbeat family film that will entertain for years to come, making it an instant classic."

","This certainly isn't your typical Christmas movie. Obviously it's nowhere near as dark as ""Black Christmas,"" but it sure ain't ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" either. It's horror, it's comedy, it's Christmas, it's even philosophical at times. ""Gizmo"" is a mogwai - a cute and intelligent little pet of sorts, found by inventor Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) in a basement shop run by a little old Chinese man (Keye Luke). Randall buys (well, acquires really) Gizmo as a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan.) But there are rules that go along with having a mogwai: don't expose them to bright light, don't give them water, and don't ever feed them after midnight. Well, poor Gizmo gets water spilled on him, and the chaos begins. Water causes Gizmo to reproduce in some way, and Gizmo's offspring aren't the cute little creatures Gizmo is. They start out as more or less mischievous, then become destructive and ultimately violent. They pretty much take over the little town of Kingston Falls on Christmas Eve, wreaking havoc everywhere.<br/><br/>It's hard to figure out who the intended audience is for this. It's too dark to be a kids movie, but the basic story isn't mature enough to be looked at as an adult comedy. And yet - in a strange sort of way - it works. It's a fun movie, with a great musical score and even as the town is wrecked and even as people die you find yourself laughing about it. How can you not laugh when Mrs. Deagle (Polly Holliday) goes flying out the upper floor window of her house!<br/><br/>It pays tribute to a few other movies. There's a touch of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" here, and Mrs. Deagle was clearly patterned after Miss Gulch (aka the Wicked Witch of the West) from ""The Wizard Of Oz."" And in the midst of the laughs, the mayhem and the violence there's a philosophical basis to this: we should try to avoid messing with things we don't understand. Randall was told that he couldn't have the mogwai. But the Chinese man's grandson manages to secretly sell him to Randall anyway, apparently not really understanding the potential consequences, and Randall and Billy are clearly unprepared for dealing with this cute little creature.<br/><br/>I thought the performances in this were average. Nobody was outstanding, but the story was certainly a creative fantasy, and watching this 30 years later I was struck by some of Randall's inventions. He invented a sort of Keurig machine. He invented a sort of cordless phone. He invented a sort of smokeless ash tray. None of them worked very well - but they all came to pass! Give writer Chris Columbus some points for predicting some of the future. (6/10)"

","Cute furry creatures who talk in nonsense language and never shut up. Furby? Nope, it's a Mogwai, a thing that a man, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), buys from a Chinese man to give his son Billy (Zach Galligan) for Christmas. Billy firstly enjoys it, after hearing the three rules of taking care of them: don't put them in bright light, don't let them get water on them, and don't feed them after midnight. Bright light kills them, water makes them reproduce, and feeding them after midnight makes them into monsters. So, of course, Zach breaks the rules and wrecks havoc on his small town.<br/><br/>Cheesy but fun, Gremlins is a film that seems to just let go and play along. The gremlins were very well made and didn't seem that mechanical (and they do look like giant Furbies). People behind me were talking about how they wanted one. Of course, until they turn evil.<br/><br/>This is definately not a thinker's movie. If you just put your mind on hold, it's a fun 100 minutes. If you over-analyze, it can get confusing. Since this is a perfect description of a popcorn movie, the characters leave something to be desired. Who is who? I don't know. But in movies like this, you shouldn't care.<br/><br/>The main actors were all good, but it wasn't as funny as movies like this should be. These should be laugh-during-their-adventures, not a-few-laughs-let's-call-this-a-comedy. The stupidity of the characters made most of the laughs.<br/><br/>Gremlins (and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) are the two movies that caused the PG-13 rating to come into play, since the MPAA decided that they were too violent for PG but not enough for R. I understand what they mean (although most of the blood in this movie is green and are the gremlins).<br/><br/>Cheesy and fun, but not very funny, Gremlins is a good time waster.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for language, creature violence, and scary situations."

",""" So the next time your refrigerator goes on the fritz, don't call a repairman.  You just never know, there might be a gremlin in the house. ""<br/><br/>These are the words to end Gremlins.  And after the rollercoaster ride that the film has just put us through, they are the perfect way to end the film. These creatures are perhaps the funniest and most entertaining little ghouls I have ever seen.  They act like spoiled rotten little rich kids.  These gremlins could be human characters in books by Steven King.  They are not just mischeivious, they are down right mean, hilarious, awful, cruel and carefree.  Their idea of a good time is to spit up nasty loogies, flash people, swing from light fixtures, play poker, drink to annebriation, bite, claw, scratch and kill.  If you haven't seen this film, you have no idea what you are missing.  I think this is one of the most original films, on par with Star Wars in terms of originality.  Neither film has been imitated. You just can't do it.  <br/><br/>Not only is this film entertaining and a little scary, but it is unbelievably funny.  And I think the hilarity stems from watching these varments act crazy.  They don't give a rat's ass about anything or anyone. They do what they please when they please and they are oblivious to the consequences of their actions.  There is one scene where they are attacking a Santa Clause and they are just hanging off him like he is a toy.  They are just terrorizing him.  They probably won't kill him, but they sure will scare the hell out of him.  They are also incredibly juvenile in their speech.  They seem to have a firm grasp of the English language but they speak like babies.  ""Deagle, YUM YUM!""  or when they see Gizmo at one point, they whisper, ""Gizmo, Caca"" <br/><br/>Gremlins has one of the most amazing production teams assembled.  It was directed by Joe Dante, produced by the Amblin people ( Kennedy, Marshall and Spielberg ) and written by Chris Columbus.  No wonder this is a top notch production.  With people like this that have the propensity for success, I'm sure great pains were taken to get everything right.  And it shows.<br/><br/>Gremlins is a film that I don't think can be imitated and that is because any attempt to make a film like this again and you would be accused of duplicating it.  So this may actually go down in history as one of the only films out there that doesn't have a clone.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 One of the best film to come out of the 80's.  Watch for a funny line in Goonies when Chunk is calling the cops to report the Fratelli's and the cop says to him, ""Sure, sure, just like the time you called and told us about the little green monsters that were attacking you.""  Same production team and also Corey Feldman was in both films.  That is a great connection. <br/><br/>
This is just pure fun."

","I remember that Gremlins took the country by storm back in the 1980s, but I was not allowed to watch it until I was much older. When I did get to watch it in my teens, I did enjoy the film. In fact, I enjoyed it more then than I do now after re-watching it. I think it was able to captivate an audience of the 1980s in the same way that E.T. did, but in today's world of CGI and a higher level of action, it falls short. Either that, or you have to be young to really enjoy this film. (I've just had to re-rate it a point lower than I had previously rated it.) 'Gremlins' is a cute film, and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. The main problem with the film is the acting. The characters were a little boring, despite some of their quirks. I guess Gizmo and the Gremlins are meant to take the spotlight anyway, but whenever the main male or female characters come on the screen, there is an unhealthy dishing of dialogue. The love story is a little silly, but I do think it is done well. However, the serious dialog is often ridiculed as funny -- in part, it's down to some bad acting. The horrible story about the female lead's father is an example of this. It's a horrible story, but the manner in which it is told is almost amusing. It's difficult to take that seriously.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll stop criticizing it now. It's a pretty good film, and it is a film that I enjoyed much more when I was younger."

","I saw this movie in the cinema when it came out, and my friends and I thought it was uproarious fun. So locked in quarantine I suggested to the family we watch this, and 36 years later it really comes across as a B-movie, and a bad one at that. The exposition, the time during which nothing of note happens, is at close to an hour far too long, and the acting is bad and none of the characters are particularly engaging or interesting, so it truly is boring. When mayhem breaks loose the movie gets funnier, but actually, the action is very undeveloped and uninvolving, and by this stage is fully played for laughs, losing some of the menace that could have made the movie more interesting. Our 2020 teenagers were not impressed."

What strikes me the most about Gremlins is the blend of tones, the comedy mixes brilliantly with the cute factor, and then all the serenity is destroyed by the carnage unleashed. With some scenes fit to grace any horror movie. Playing heavily on the old urban legends of little Gremlins messing with machines to unsurp humans, director Joe Dante creates a ""Spielbergian"" (the beard on producing duty here) parody that delivers royally on the entertainment front. There's fun to be had with some of the in jokes and the social references that the writers throw in at frequent moments. Nods to films like The Wizard of Oz, It's A Wonderful Life and Invasion of the Body Snatchers are well placed, while the pre CGI creatures themselves are brilliant in their reactions to things around them. Be it a gremlin attacking something or Gizmo watching the television aghast, these sprites are a delight.<br/><br/>Some of the humour is very pitch black, so much so it would have gone over many a child's head back when the film was first released. You can imagine many an adult parent sitting there with the children cringing as they laugh to moments like flasher and mugger gremlin, while metaphors and wry side-swipes at small town Americana are bountiful for the observant. Is it, as some critics called it on release, mean spirited? No, not at all, yes it's a complete flip-flop from the homely comforts provided by ET era Spielberg or Disney on full tilt family friendly fodder mode, but director Joe Dante and writer Chris Columbus aren't fly pitching in that particular market. This is a wonderful horror comedy with dark narrative tints around the jagged edges, the cast may well be standing up purely as extras to the gremlins and the carnage they create, but it's devilishly funny all the same. Besides, if you can't go Aww at the sight of Gizmo, or laugh heartily as a theatre full of gremlins rejoice in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, then clearly, before delving into the thematics of it, it's not the movie for you anyway. 9/10"

Nothing gives me greater pleasure in life than rediscovering my old childhood favorites, only now nearly 30 years later and in the company of my own 10-year-old son, who's also developing an enthusiasm for bizarre cinema! I literally get tears in my eyes when I notice my offspring cheering over the same highlight-sequences in the same movies that I used to love so much myself. I felt this joy during ""Escape from Witch Mountain"" and ""The Dark Crystal"", but never experienced it so intensively as during ""Gremlins"".<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is ideally representative of the creative and highly original fantasy cinema of the early 80s. With Steven Spielberg as producer and, even more importantly, the eternal inner child embracing Joe Dante as director, the film is a gleeful mixture of delightful special effects, classic cinematic tributes, an engaging plot, colorful characters and just the right balance between slapstick and action. The narrative starts in Chinatown, a couple of days before Christmas. Eccentric inventor Randall Peltzer seeks a unique gift for his son, and finds an adorable little Mogwai they name Gizmo. The fluffy critter is awesome, but he comes with a few responsibilities. He cannot be exposed to bright light, should never be sprinkled with water and must never ever be fed after midnight. This turns out to be a lot more difficult than it sounds, and pretty soon the picturesque town of Kingston Falls is overrun with Gizmo's malignant and monstrous offspring. ""Gremlins"" contains far too many highlights to mention, including every word spoken by Dick Miller and every smallest shot of the unearthly cute Phoebe Cates, and it's even more amazing if you can watch it with the entire family... around Christmas."

All of it works in favor of the movie as it plows along with its entertaining tale of pesky and petulant creatures running amok on Christmas Eve across a small American town, displaying a surprisingly grisly and gleefully mean-spirited edge along the way that keeps the stakes high.

It's scary and funny at different times and actually scary and funny at the same time as well. It also benefits from the lovable little 'Gizmo', the Mogwai who has rules attached to his keeping. Unfortunately, an accident with some water soon reveals that 'Gizmo' can produce some horrible offspring if the rules aren't observed.<br/><br/>Whether it was meant or not, there's an underlying message about the danger of not adhering to rules as the monstrous Gremlins wreak havoc upon a small town at Christmastide. However, it's also the case that some of the Gremlins' bad behaviour mirrors that of some of the less well behaved people that we all may know; I'm pretty sure that sitting in a bar, getting drunk and tormenting the bar girl isn't something that's restricted to Gremlins, though they make it all very amusing.<br/><br/>This film is fun though whether today's children would enjoy it is debatable.

What began with ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"" really exploded that year as the newest blockbusters in the theaters were these spectacular special effect dominated crowd pleasers that weren't obsessively overloaded with computer generated distractions from a decent story.<br/><br/>While Zach Galligan is obviously a young man who should be out on his own, he's a family devoted adult whose unsuccessful inventor father (a very funny Hoyt Axton) wants to get him the best present possible. Visiting New York's Chinatown isn't the best idea with what he brings home, because instead of buying a priceless antique at bargain prices, he comes home with Gizmo, an adorable Mogwai who shouldn't get wet, see bright light or be fed after midnight. The nasty little balls of fur which pop out of them will bring more than just figgy pudding to the small town where they love.<br/><br/>This is a Christmas movie that can still be enjoyed anytime during the year, and is filled with the type of film magic that younger filmmakers of today seem determined to surpass...and destroy. There's a Miss Gulch like character, an old battleaxe played by Polly Holliday, who would certainly be murdered had the gremlins not got her first. There's Galligan's boss (Edward Andrews in his last film) who kisses up to her, and Galligan's devoted girlfriend (Phoebe Cates) who stands by him. There's also a fantastic musical score you won't soon forget. But most of all, there is sweet little Gizmo, so loving and smart, and the wretched offspring that pop out from the strangest places. Axton's delightful inventor/father is quite likable, sort of a modern day version of Dick Van Dyke's eccentric inventor/father in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"". The biggest surprise of all? A sequel that was actually better than the original! So when/if ""Gremlins 3"" does come out, don't count me as part of its box office intake, because it will be a pale imitation of the first two, only minus the creativity."

","Gremlins falls into this latter category, and I wondered if it would still hold up after all of these years. In a nutshell, it does... kind of. I love the late 80's Spielbergesque feel to the movie, the quality and tone which I can't ever quite describe but has me thinking of all the films from this era. I love the premise behind the film, Gizmo and yes, the Gremlins themselves. The memorable kitchen sequence still stands up today, and most of the film is carried off to good effect. If you think there's a but in there you'd be right, and this time round I thought the whole bar scene and the finale were too slapstick, but honestly I'm being churlish. This is still great fun, and it's the humor which carries this as much as anything.<br/><br/>I do have a couple of problems with the film though. One of them being the casting of Zach Galligan as the son and the main character. When you hear that the father is going to buy a present for his son you automatically assume that the son will be a lot younger than he actually is. I don't know how old he actually is and is supposed to be, but he looked about 19. I just felt that the role was written for a younger character. Saying that there is a love interest in the film (Phoebe Cates) which I suppose couldn't have played if the character was a lot younger. There is another thing I've always wondered. If you can't feed the gremlins after midnight, when can you start feeding them again?! There are also some small roles for future stars Corey Feldman and Judge Reinhold. The soundtrack is classic eighties cheesiness in all its glory and splendor. Howie Mandel did a good job as the voice of Gizmo, even if it didn't consist of much. Chris Columbus, Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg prove themselves an excellent team, combining a humorous and witty script with some extremely good movie-making. This movie has become, and will live on as, a cult classic adored by fans of monster and horror films and should not be missed.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."

But it's all in good dark fun, especially when Mrs. Deagle gets her comeuppance. It's a good time watching the gremlins wreak havoc; those ugly bastards are surprisingly entertaining (the bar scene in particular).

","With its inane mix of genres, attitudes and inspirations, there's really no good reason for this movie to work as well as it does. Like the ubiquitous creatures at the heart of the plot, Gremlins delights in mayhem. The proud owner of a restless spirit and a tendency to rattle the gearbox at the slightest hint of a lull, the film can be splendidly unpredictable, charmingly sweet and morbidly profane, sometimes all within the same scene. It's vividly violent, often shockingly so, but still touts a wild sense of humor and an unexpected knack for sentimentality. I was pleasantly surprised at the lengths it was willing to go to, considering no member of the cast indispensable, and that left me hooked right up until the closing showdown. It's not the perfect picture - there are holes in the plot large enough to roll a bulldozer through - but as a sharp, silly change of pace in the holiday season, one could do far worse."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","17 January 2012"," Anarchic, vicious, mean-spirited and hilarious Christmas fun!
","If you are fed up of saccharine sweet Christmas films then this is the perfect antidote! It all starts well enough when Billy's father buys him a cute little pet for Christmas. This isn't an ordinary pet however; it is a Mogwai and there are three rules for looking after them; keep them out of bright light, don't get them wet and above all don't feed them after midnight! The rules aren't explained but we learn them soon enough; light harms them, getting them wet causes them to multiply and feeding them after midnight causes them to turn into vicious gremlins! Billy names his Mogwai Gizmo and all goes well until it gets wet and makes five more; the new ones aren't gentle like Gizmo however; they have a mean streak and are devious; devious enough to trick Billy into feeding them after midnight which causes all hell to break out in the town of Kingston Falls. The gremlins are determined to wreak havoc and after one gets to the town pool there are thousands to contend with! Out in the town they entertain themselves attacking Father Christmas, turbo-charging a horrid old woman's stair-lift, going to a bar and finally going to the cinema to watch Snow White! <br/><br/>This film is great anarchic fun; while the gremlins are clearly meant to be the 'bad guys' the viewer will cheer them on as they do one malevolent thing after another; all the while cackling manically. The Gremlins certainly upstage the human cast; Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are good enough as Billy and his girl friend Kate but they aren't what the film will be remembered for. There are a lot of laughs to lighten the tone but it will still be scary for younger viewers; especially in the final scene where Billy must confront the meanest of the gremlins who is wielding a chainsaw... not to mention an earlier scene when a gremlin gets microwaved! The special effects may look a bit dated now but I'd take them over the excessively slick CGI a film would get today; also worthy of note is the delightful score by Jerry Goldsmith; it really fits the anarchic nature of the film. I'd certainly recommend this film but don't show it to younger children unless you are sure they can handle it."
"Toronto85","Null","1","2","9 March 2011"," Gremlins
","Gremlins is a interesting little film about small little monsters terrorizing a small town. The movie starts with a man who buys a little mogwai pet named Gizmo from an older gentleman in Chinatown for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). There are three rules when it comes to Gizmo. You can't feed it after midnight, it can't be exposed to bright light/sunlight, and most importantly do not let it get wet. If Gizmo gets wet, many little ""gremlins"" will pop out of it's back. Of course Billy doesn't follow the rules at all. All hell breaks loose in the town right on Christmas Eve of all nights. Billy and his girlfriend Kate (Pheobe Cates) must stop the little creatures before they destroy everything and everyone.<br/><br/>The movie is well done with it's effects. The little gremlins looks and seem like real live monsters. And Gizmo is the cutest thing on film I've ever seen. The scenes where the Gremlins are watching Snow White in the movie theatre is pure comedic gold! They even sing along to ""hi ho hi ho, it's off to work we go"". But, that's near the end of the film. There are many slow parts throughout. The police don't believe Billy when he tells them monsters are attacking the town. And it gets annoying watching him break all of the rules that must be followed with a pet mogwai.<br/><br/>Zach Galligan and Pheobe Cates are two of my all time favourite ""80's"" younger actors. They both play the lead characters. I think that at times Gremlins takes itself way to serious and that's a difference from this one and the sequel. It's a movie about little monsters terrorizing a town. The second one pokes fun at the plot. I haven't seen 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch' in years, but I remember preferring that one to this.<br/><br/>Still it's a must see movie for all.<br/><br/>7/10"
"BaronBl00d","9","1","2","26 December 2010"," Home for the Holidays Gremlin-Style
","This movie made a big impact on me as a younger man for I really had not seen anything like it beforehand. Hoyt Axton plays a father who is an inventor cruising through Chinatown in search of just that special gift for his son. He is taken to a small, out-of-the-way ""junk"" shop where Axton sees this adorable creature who sings, smiles, and is just damned cute. The proprietor, an elderly Chinese man, tells Axton that this creature is not for sale, but the young boy who brought him there sells Axton the creature unbeknownst to Grandpa. Axton is given three rules that must be observed with the creature: 1). No bright light 2). no water 3). never feed the creature after midnight(okay, this rule is loopy). This takes place in the first five minutes or so of the film. The rest of the film is the son getting what he will call Gizmo and what happens when these rules are inevitably broken. The scenic backdrops to the small town are quaint, surrealistic, and nostalgic. Director Joe Dante always infuses his pictures with nostalgic qualities whether it is a scene we may have seen over and over again, character types, and my favorite are the actors of older films that older(or more rehearsed audience members) will quickly identify which will undoubtedly be lost on younger viewers and certainly viewers of today by large part. We get Key Luke as the Chinese shop owner. He was most famous for his roles as Number 1 Son in the old Charlie Chan films. How about Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman - a staple in Roger Corman films. Miller's costar in Little Shop of Horrors Jackie Joseph plays his wife in this. Edward Andrews - the old, reliable character actor - plays a bank manager. William Schallert plays a minister. You can also see Polly Holliday(Flo from Alice) play a devilishly wicked Mr. Potter-type. Kenneth Tobey has a cameo as does Chuck Jones and several others. The lead actors are young but entertaining. Zach Galligan was 19 when he made this - his first feature. He does a decent job. Phoebe Cates is also rather good and very lovely. The real star though is the puppet Gizmo and the gremlins themselves. Dante did all this in an old-school manner. No CGI here - thankfully. This is real filmmaking the way real filmmaking used be done. It was labor and time intensive and rather costly but Dante does a lot here with a spartan budget. Produced by Steven Spielberg Gremlins shows what some intelligent-minded people can put together with creativity and vision. There are so many scenes that stick out with me: the movie theater, the battle with the Christmas tree, the microwave scene, and many others including Mrs. Deagle's spiraling exit. All are outstanding. In the end, however; it is the little moments that I like best like the small character parts, Dick Miller going on about foreign products, and Gizmo playing a small piano-like instrument. Gremlins is now 20 years old - I saw it in the movie theater when it came out - and it has withstood the test of time rather well. I believe in another 20 years it will still be able to say the same thing. By the way who doesn't love that music?"
"bkoganbing","9","1","2","22 October 2010"," No Water, No Sunlight, No Feeding After Midnight, Or Else
","During the year that Gremlins came out I remember watching the World Series that year and at a certain point when a number of bad plays were ruining the San Diego Padres against the Detroit Tigers, Joe Garagiola remarked that Gremlins were cursing the Padres. Garagiola gave a nice plug to what was one of the best films of that year and horribly neglected by the Academy.<br/><br/>Hoyt Axton wants to get an unusual pet from merchant Keye Luke called a Mogwai, but he won't sell. Nevertheless his grandson John Louie does sell the cute little Mogwai to him with three conditions that have to be met in their keeping. No water, no sunlight, and no feeding after midnight or terrible consequences will result.<br/><br/>Of course the family is delighted with the new pet especially twenty something son Zach Galligan who is the really responsible one in the family. But things do happen and on that Christmas Eve all three conditions are broken and as a result a horde of ugly little Gremlins start running amuck.<br/><br/>I do love this film so because it strikes so many emotions at the same time. You love the little Mogwais, but you are terrified at what they've become. The Gremlins are horrifying, but at the same time you will laugh hysterically at what they do to some people. Polly Holliday, fresh from the Alice series on television plays a mean woman in the grand tradition of Margaret Hamilton. What the Gremlins have in store for her is priceless.<br/><br/>Gremlins marked the farewell performances of both Scott Brady and Edward Andrews both of whom graced many a film and unlike some character actors from the studio days never stopped working. It's because both of these guys were memorable on the screen.<br/><br/>Director Joe Dante, writer Chris Columbus and most of all producer Steven Spielberg who imparted his always imaginative vision to this film have given us a great one, especially around the time of Halloween. Gremlins is one timeless classic for the big and small screen."
"brownish33","6","1","2","7 October 2010"," Silly, funny, but a little too dark at times
","firstly, i just bought this on bluray last night and haven't seen this film in a very long time. but after seeing it after so many years in full, i must say its darker then i remembered it. the gizmo is cute in the beginning, and i half expected this movie to be not so dark because gizmo was so fluffy and cute. however once the other gremlins come it gets a bit dark. perhaps too dark. first thing that made me gasp in horror was when its implied the spike mogwi (not yet turned into a gremlin) tied up the dog outside with Christmas lights. that was just so wrong. i didn't find it funny, but i don't think it was supposed to be. I'm sure it was meant to show how bad and sadistic the gremlins can be, and it sure did, but as an owner of 4 lovable dogs and a big animal lover myself i found this part to be in bad taste. thankfully the dog wasn't hurt in the film or anything, but still, it looked painful and i felt very bad after seeing this, and i had to go hug my own dogs, lol. later in the film you see gremlins with GUNS trying to shoot people, injecting a needle into a teacher, scratching up a moms face while in a Christmas tree before trying to strangle her, nearly bulldozing a man to his death (thankfully later was confirmed that he survived that somehow). from memory, the gremlins of film 2 were not nearly as sadistic or murderous. sometimes scary or creepy but not like the first film where they were killers. anyone who says this is a ""family"" movie should be warned. its a strange movie to be sure, its got moments where the kids would definitely enjoy it (as i did when i was a child) and parts where adults are going to think ""wow this is pretty twisted"". phoebe Cate's character's speech about why she doesn't like Christmas was pretty bizarre as many have stated and just doesn't fit anywhere in the movie. maybe this was why they added it on there, the ridiculous randomness of it, but still, it would have been fine without it.<br/><br/>another thing that people don't seem to give credit for is jerry goldsmiths very memorable film score which really suits the movie and is both scary at times, and funny/silly at others, especially with his very funny, memorable ""gremlins theme"" tune. you can almost hear the gremlins singing along with it! overall, however, the creature gremlin effects are fantastic and very well done. it reminds us that CGI can never replace the pure magic and creepy realism of puppetry and animatronics that were so wonderful back in the day. this film also reminded me why so many of my favorite films are from the 80's. movies then seemed to have a childlike fun quality to them that seems lost in todays cinema. they were fun, over the top and magical, from the kid movies to the macho action flicks, 80's movies had that magic of cinema that todays films are sorely missing. the film's got plenty of scares and silliness, as well as some good suspense, to entertain just about anyone who likes movies. my only major criticism is that there are some moments that i think are just too dark for a movie like this. i actually prefer the sequel, where i think they got a good balance of silliness and creep out scenes, without being too serious or too dark. on the whole, the 2 gremlins films are very good scary fun movies but do be warned, the first film does get dark at times and may not be great for younger viewers. i wouldn't really call this a ""family"" film, more like a horror comedy."

","An inventor father (Hoyt Axton) wants to get his son (Zach Galligan) something special while traveling on the road. Just in time for Christmas, he returns with a mogwai (unknown to him, ""mogwai"" is Cantonese Chinese for ""demon""). A few rules are broken, and soon the town is overwhelmed with reptilian, green-blooded monsters.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" ranks as one of the classic horror films of the 1980s, dark enough to satisfy the horror people and light enough to be funny and almost a family film. The special effects and puppetry, even twenty-five years later, look as good as we can possibly expect. Followed by an equally great sequel, ""Gremlins"" has secured itself as a memorable and must-see film.<br/><br/>The cast is crucial to the plot: notably, Dick Miller. Miller appeared in many B-movies in his day (such as ""A Bucket of Blood"") and casting him was brilliant. Howie Mandel provides the voice of Gizmo, before Mandel was the big name he is today. And Phoebe Cates? Oh my! The darling of the 1980s, and she even appears on screen with Judge Reinhold without taking off her shirt.<br/><br/>The action, horror, comedy and cast are held together by Joe Dante, still a fresh face at the time. Steven Spielberg hand picked Dante after seeing ""The Howling"" and he could not have made a better choice. Dante will always be connected with ""Howling"", but I think it would not be out of line to say this film eclipsed his previous work and may be his masterpiece.<br/><br/>I do not know why someone would not have seen ""Gremlins"", but if not, you really must. Great for fans of all genres. And I personally suggest purchasing the film on DVD. It is loaded with featurettes, deleted scenes and commentary. The Blu-ray offers no additional bonuses, so unless you're adamant about having up-to-the-minute sound quality, the DVD should be fine and affordable. (This was written in 2010; a new Blu-ray may have come out since then.)"

","I never cared for this as much as most, even in 1984 I thought the special effects were a little cheesy and that the gremlins looked like stuffed animals, not real living things. It's a good thing that it doesn't take itself seriously. It is so predictable, the minute you hear the warnings of gremlins not liking light, not to feed them after midnight and never ever expose them to water, you just KNOW all those things are going to happen. Also, you know the something is going to happen to the evil Polly Holliday character, so it is rather clichéd in that way. On the plus side, there is some originality and creativity. There are some very funny scenes as well."
"crowrobot","10","1","2","4 August 2005"," Joe Dante RULES!
","Joe Dante is one of my favorite modern-day schlock filmmakers. When you think about it, that's what he makes. 'Gremlins' is the jewel in his crown, a wickedly funny horror/comedy that still charms me every Christmas.<br/><br/>Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is a nice young man with a loving family. His inventor father (Hoyt Axton) gets him a little creature called Gizmo (voice of Howie Mandel) that looks like a cross between a teddy bear and Yoda for Christmas. There are three rules to keep in mind when taking care of Gizmo: 1. Keep him away from bright lights, they hurt him. 2. Don't get him wet, he'll multiply. And most importantly, never, ever feed him after midnight. As you can imagine, all three rules are broken, Gizmo spawns a bunch of nasty ugly Gremlins, and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The movie is very funny in it's mean-spirited way. My favorite scene is where the Gremlins, after wreaking havoc, go to a movie theater and watch 'Snow White'. They love it, and they start singing along to ""Heigh-Ho"" (to Billy's amazement). The payoff shot is Gremlin heads bobbing in tune to the song. That always gets a laugh out of me. The gremlin effects are good, and little Gizmo is like a less-annoying Furby. The script by Chris Columbus is dark and menacing without being an R-rated outing (although apparently the original script is even worse), and I wonder how Columbus ended up making 'Home Alone' and 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. No matter; 'Gremlins' is a high-energy B movie that spawned a hilarious sequel. It's one of my favorite movies."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","2","1 January 2004"," Daft, but enjoyable.
","When it comes to the weird and bizarre, only two directors spring to mind. Tim Burton and Joe Dante. Dante is more underrated than Burton which is a shame. His unique brand of horror laced with traces of dark humour is the perfect formula for a film like Gremlins. Has it really been 20 years since it was made? Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen it?<br/><br/>This interesting Christmas tale begins when Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is in Chinatown looking for a Christmas present for his son, Billy. He comes across a junk shop, where he encounters a furry creature called a Mogwai. But the owner of the shop is reluctant to sell him, as taking care of a Mogwai entails great responsibility.<br/><br/>Rand still acquires the Mogwai (or Gizmo as he names him) from the shop owners grandson. Before he hands Gizmo over, he tells Rand there are three rules he must follow to take care of Gizmo properly:<br/><br/>1. Keep him away from bright light. Especially sunlight, or it will kill Gizmo.<br/><br/>2. Keep him away from water. Don't get him wet.<br/><br/>3. The most important rule of all. The rule you can never forget. Never, ever feed him after midnight.<br/><br/>We switch then to Kingston Falls, one of those sleepy Disney/Capraesque towns. Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) is a mild mannered bank clerk who's got the hots for his co-worker Kate Berringer (Phoebe Cates). This is an interesting little town, full of quirky characters, some played by actors Joe Dante loves to have in his films. Mr Futterman (Dick Miller) is a bit of an oddball who believes Gremlins are real, and then there is Mrs Deagle, an old bat who has seriously got it in for Billy's family.<br/><br/>When Billy finally receives Gizmo, he is overjoyed but puzzled by the vague rules he has to follow. Of course, the audience just knows they're going to be broken. And the second rule is broken courtesy of Billy's friend Pete (Corey Feldman before his career took a nosedive). After accidentally splashing Gizmo with water, five new Mogwai appear. But these Mogwai are different from Gizmo. They are more mischievous and devious (Wait until you see what they do to Billy's dog).<br/><br/>They're led by one called Stripe, which Billy dubs because of a Mohawk of hair on his head. They later trick Billy into feeding them after midnight, and when he does, they go into cocoons. A teacher friend of Billy's who studies one of the Mogwai explains they will be going through lots of changes. He doesn't know the half of it!<br/><br/>When they hatch, they have turned into little monsters. Green, scaly, razor sharp teeth and claws. They are now Gremlins. They proceed to multiply into an army, and begin the process of tearing Kingston Falls to shreds. This is all under the leadership of Stripe. It is now up to Billy and Kate to stop the Gremlins before they destroy their town.<br/><br/>Although it has a very silly premise, there is something compelling about Gremlins. Joe Dante has enormous fun with the way he gleefully trashes and satirises the small-town Middle-American image Frank Capra and Norman Rockwell created. <br/><br/>The Gremlins are the real stars of the film, and despite being produced by Steven Spielberg, Dante has incredible latitude and freedom. It is certainly clear he is on the Gremlins side, and there are many memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) defending her kitchen is a definite highlight. The different methods she has of killing the Gremlins are quite sadistic (in particular the microwave). What happens to the Futtermans is both funny and scary. Mrs Deagle's encounter with the Gremlins is shockingly original. You might say they come to her in the middle of the night and teach her the true meaning of Christmas!<br/><br/>Probably the most memorable scene is when they storm the local cinema and catch a screening of Snow White. I wonder what a group of malicious monsters could find of interest in that film? The ending inevitably has the showdown between Billy and Stripe, which becomes a gripping fight for survival in a department store.<br/><br/>Gremlins is not only hilarious, but occasionally frightening. The content is of a shockingly dark tone at times. For all those parents out there, you may not want your children to watch this unless you're with them. Having a Gremlin trying to strangle Billy's mother with Christmas lights is a good indication why.<br/><br/>The scene where Kate tells Billy about her father is unusual. Somehow, it comes across as padding. I'm not sure what it has to contribute to the film really. But overall, Gremlins is extremely entertaining. It's quite refreshing to see a dark Christmas tale. The FX are still superb even after 20 years. It is also packed to the rafters with Dante's trademark in-jokes and film references (The Howling, Invasion of the Body Snatchers) which only adds to the film's charm.<br/><br/>One thing I especially liked is the way we don't actually see the Gremlins at first. We only hear them. It builds up anticipation to when we finally do see them. You are not disappointed.<br/><br/>The ending is quite sad, when Billy has to say goodbye to Gizmo. It's not quite as soppy as you might think. Gremlins 2 was also a good film, although it was a great deal more satirical than the first. The original had more style and subtlety. The theme music by the late Jerry Goldsmith is very memorable too. It was one of the best theme tunes he ever composed. Small Soldiers was also along the same lines, and was another of Dante's good ones. But it still doesn't match up to the great film that is Gremlins."

(Dang, I couldn't believe it when I found out ""Jaws"" had a PG rating! I was really wondering how a movie like that didn't cause the MPAA raters to make a PG-13 rating) Anyway, I rented this movie out right after I turned 13(so it's probably the first PG-13 movie I saw alone) and it was as good as I had thought!<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't see how people should complain it's too scary. I mean, if YOU want to see a movie you thought was for little kids, but was scary, rent ""The Secret Of NIMH"". Gizmo is a very cute little fellow, and I always kind of went for furry little creatures. The gremlins were very cool, and it was interesting how clever they were to wreck all that havoc (i.e. cutting off the power of a traffic light). Yes, the effects could have better, but this is just one of those movies you just wanna have fun with, and not really take seriously. The part where the gremlins were at the bar was very funny! I'll always remember the gremlins attacking the Santa Claus guy, or the gremlins watching Snow White. It was a kind of sci-fi/horror/comedy crossover.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the Leonard Maltin review. He gave the sequel a good rating, and that sequel was just as volient as the first one(I'll bet he did that just because he himself had a cameo in the movie). Anyway, a 8.5/10."

","I was lucky enough to see Gremlins on the big screen a few days ago after a 10 year or so stint without seeing this masterpiece. I was reminded on what a fantastic peice of filmmaking that Gremlins is, it stands head and shoulders above all eighties monster flicks and as a eighties horror it also fares very well. Comparing to it's peers, The Goolies, Critters etc seems a little unfair, the story is sharp, fast paced and is carried by all the actors.<br/><br/> It has the distinct feel of a B movie but the dialouge at the end reminds us that we have seen a film which dares to be corny and comes out trumps. On top of all this it is the best peice of anti-CGI work since the Jason and the Argonauts Skellington fight. The models show real character from the unquestionably adorable mogwi puppet to the humerous yet somehow frightening gremlins. Had this film been made in the last 8 or 9 years the character of the film would have been lost and along with that half the fun. Take the scene where Spike is followed by thousands of Gremlins all stomping their tiny legs, to the audience this isn't perfect animation by any means but the movement gives them real character. When I read reviews that state this movie is predictable and one dimensional I remind myself that idiots that make comments like this must've forgotten that from start to finish the movie is presented as a ghost story. The essence of any good ghost story is telling you a moral. However predictable it is. When the moral is as well presented as this anyone who doesn't enjoy the film should check their pulse."
"fedor8","Null","2","7","3 January 2013"," Dante and Spielberg just couldn't resist the urge.
","A big hit when it came out, ""Gremlins"" has stood the test of time quite well. There's a visual quality and mood to the movie that makes it a cut above many such fantasy-based 80s films, some of which look decidedly dated by now. The creatures look real and behave in an interesting/amusing rather than predictable way.<br/><br/>Those of us who enjoyed it as kids back then can now ""appreciate"" its subversive nature – at least people that are clueless naive liberals in search of the millionth movie to feature an anti-Capitalist message. (Actually, 1,000,000 might be more of a low estimate. Check out my ""Left-Wing Propaganda in TV & Cinema"" list for more on this.) This anti-American message is so subliminal, so obscured by the thick layers of the movie's Disney-wise cartoon-like shenanigans, that it can only be detected by those who pay attention to such things, i.e. viewers who are fully aware of how rampant left-wing propaganda was/is/always-will-be in American (but also European) movies. The fact that Joe Dante and Stevie Spielberg were director and producer, respectively, makes perfect sense inasmuch that they're both flaming closet Marxists. <br/><br/>What doesn't make sense at all is that those two joined up and actually gave us a quality product. Spielberg had said ""au revoir"" to quality after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), whereas Dante had only ever made one very good movie – this one. ""The Howling"" and ""Gremlins 2"" are merely solid, the rest of his filmography ranges from mediocre to utterly commercial pap.<br/><br/>What's left-wing about it? <br/><br/>1) The town's witch/ogre is also its richest person (rich people are evil, unless they happen to be Communist dictators or Beverly Hills leftists, in which case they are noble and perfect); a woman more than happy to render as many people homeless in her town as she can, plus she's the widow of a stock-market millionaire – and we know how very evil Wall Street and anything even remotely associated with profit-making is (unless of course a Hollywood film-maker is making millions of profit: that doesn't count). (Btw, her character is a shameless rip-off (or ""tribute"", ha ha) of the evil witch from ""Wizard of Oz"".) <br/><br/>2) The Chinaman (whose own country is Communist; I don't know whether this was intentional or whether it was the ""exotic bonus"" they were after) scolds the all-American family, giving them a brief but stern lecture as to why they do not deserve to have a wonderful creature such as the ""mogwai"", because, in the Chinaman's words: ""your society isn't ready for it"". In other words, American society is too evil, what with its free democratic society and a successful Capitalist system that had enabled it to become among the wealthiest countries in the world (a fact that far-Left liberals like Spielberg and other like-minded Hollywood chums of his simply can't stomach – in spite of the fact that HIS career is as Capitalist in nature as Henry Ford's!). <br/><br/>3) When the sheriff makes a comment about how patriotic Gizmo is, he misses out on the way in which the little critter was playing with the American flag – namely with a touch of disgust. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the laughable political messages of the three deranged men involved with the movie's script, direction and production is too hidden to ruin the entertainment value."

","Having seen Gremlins a long time ago as a child and liking the film, it was probably best to revisit it to see if it holds up today. The story (mystical creature bought in Chinatown, dad making clunky inventions) and silly dialogue are typical for the time period, it's a total 80s cheese fest. The biggest mistake that the Gremlins filmmakers made was the lead casting of Zach Galligan, who had stiff acting throughout, and Phoebe Cates who hadn't yet blossomed into the actress she would later become. The movie gets good when the Gremlins action picks up and they start causing havoc in town. The little creature's mannerisms and scheming antics are the most memorable aspects of the film. Aside from the fact it's still a fun Christmas movie, Gremlins has slightly too much hype as a classic. Can't deny though, Gremlins is by far the most impactful small creature film to date."

","One of my favorite childhood movies. Easy going horror-comedy, one of the very few that succeeds in mixing those two genres and not ending up as complete crap. The story is smart and nicely told, with good acting and directing. It's entertaining and slightly scary, especially if you are a kid. And Gizmo is one of the cutest things ever shown on the big screen. True family movie from the '80s.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Randall Peltzer is a traveling salesman for his poorly-conceived gadgets looking for a Christmas gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). While in Chinatown, he finds an adorable creature called mogwai. The old man refuses to sell but the little boy said they need the money. There are 3 rules to owning a mogwai. There can be no bright light, no water and no feeding after midnight. They live in the small town of Kingston Falls. Pete Fountaine (Corey Feldman) is a neighborhood kid. Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates) is the nice girl. Gerald Hopkins (Judge Reinhold) is the ambitious climber. There's a wicked rich old Mrs. Deagle looking to put Billy's dog down. When Pete spills water on mogwai, he multiplies and five more pop out.<br/><br/>This starts as a great children's horror at an idyllic small town with a cuddly teddy bear. The movie builds tension as Billy cluelessly break the rules. It builds to a fun ride that is actually very scary. For the younger kids, this is probably a little too much. People do die and the Gremlins get killed in splattery ways. The tension gets very high at times while at other times, it is very comedic."

"oneguyrambling","7","1","3","27 January 2012"," Follow 'the rules' to PG horror-lite fun.
","Gremlins came out at the right time. In another decade this low key flick could've sunk without trace even with the Spielberg name prominently associated. But once people realised it wasn't that scary and that it was pretty much all just harmless fun Gremlins took off, even inspiring a same-old sequel that I'll get to soon.<br/><br/>A good natured inventor of 'amazing machines that do not work' stumbles across a bizarre, unique and yes; cute pint sized creature in an out of the way Chinatown curio shop. He promptly shills out a couple hundred bucks to the owner's grandson and takes said creature home to the sleepy town of Kingston Falls for his son – who at 20 odd years of age should really be too old for pets, but that's another story.<br/><br/>The son is named Billy (Zach Gilligan) and the creature is dubbed Gizmo, the pair bond almost immediately and it seems that aside from 'the rules' it appears that Gizmo is low maintenance and an ideal companion.<br/><br/>Aaaaah, but the Rules! Gizmo is a Mogwai, a small fuzzy likable bundle of fur and wing-like ears that hums, gurgles and whistles pure happiness. He appears to be part-ewok with the facial structure of Yoda and the coat of a zu-zu pet. He can eat almost anything, is perfectly happy with only a TV for company and remains cute regardless of the situation.<br/><br/>But he happens to be extremely susceptible to bright light (sunlight kills him), has no need for water and in fact the preference is that he steer well clear of it, and in a quite strange twist cannot eat after 12 PM (which leads to many 'what about' logic issues that are acknowledged in the sequel).<br/><br/>You'll never guess what happens! It turns out that being exposed to water makes Gizmo reproduce instantly, ping-pong sized fuzzballs that in mere seconds grow to full sized – which still means very small – Mogwais. Only these are a little different to the perpetually cheerful and innocent Gizmo. These ones have a mean streak.<br/><br/>Now as it makes no sense to explain three different rules and then not utilise them, that night our furry friends – sans Gizmo – manage to order some late night tucker. This results in a quickfire pupal stage in which they are cocooned in some slimy scaly glowing casings as they trans-Mogwai-fy, followed by a similarly swift re-birth where they emerge as slightly larger, almost hairless, infinitely less cute and more menacing Gremlins.<br/><br/>And at this point the film starts earning every bit of its PG rating. The Gremlins immediately set about making mischief, which starts as knocking things over and making a mess, and ends with multiple deaths. As the numbers grow quick the expanded numbers begin to wreak havoc on the formerly quiet little town, and the local residents wonder just what to do with this menace so close to Christmas (it's nearly Christmas, I didn't mention it because it has squat to do with the plot. Neither does the fact that Billy has a pair of pants that burn for his fellow bank employee Kate (Phoebe Cates), that also is a meaningless sub-plot that only means the two have someone to hold onto as they flee the Gremlins).<br/><br/>Nothing is taken seriously – nor should it be when you are dealing with a film involving small scaly mischief makers. Billy's Mum has a memorable scene in which she dispatches a small group of Gremlins in her own kitchen, and a bar scene with a large group of Gremlins letting off steam is quite elaborate later in the film.<br/><br/>The characters are basically caricatures charged only with maintaining shocked expressions once the fun starts, although Billy's Dad steals the show with his positive outlook in the face of his own failings as an inventor. There is also a bitchy local rich woman and a US proud paranoid xenophobe who blames everything on foreigners.<br/><br/>The reason though that the human cast are so bland is that any personality would detract from the real stars of the show: the Gremlins, who remain front and centre and tongue in cheek for the last hour of the film. There are dumb ones, sorta cute ones, slightly scary ones and one downright menacing one with a mo(gwai?)-hawk named Stripe who appears more dastardly than the rest.<br/><br/>The pace moves along with breakneck speed after the Gremlins are introduced and some of the Gremlin death scenes are perhaps a little OTT gross and gory (which reflects Director Joe Dante's background in B movie horror).<br/><br/>All in all though Gremlins is but a good natured kiddie flick with some funny moments and a simple but effective premise, and even though it is now over 25 years old Gremlins remains as effective and as amusing as it was when I first saw it in the 80s.<br/><br/>The sequel on the other hand <br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Like night-club pick-ups in the wee hours of the morning, they start small, cute and fuzzy, and often end up big, ugly and scaly. Maybe they too shouldn't eat after midnight."

","Gremlins belongs to a category of movies which has very few members - it is funny, it is full of action and suspense (and some mild scares) and it is a great movie for family viewing.<br/><br/>The story is simple but effective - the Peltzer family acquire a mogwai called Gizmo, a rare oriental creature which comes with but two rules - don't get it wet (because this causes it to bud off new creatures) and don't feed it after midnight (because this causes mogwais to turn into gremlins). Of course, the warnings are provided without explanation, so no-one attaches any importance to them and, in due course Gizmo buds off new mogwais which end up in a swimming pool - hordes of gremlins emerge and proceed to lay waste to the small town, and only Billy Pelzer (with the help of Gizmo) can stop them.<br/><br/>Zach Galligan is an engaging Billy, and it's a shame that he never really went on to bigger and better things: his co-star, Phoebe Cates, had a run of moderate success before marrying Kevin Kline and becoming a full-time mother.<br/><br/>But the real stars of the movie are the puppet gremlins and the physical effects. They fit well with the light tone, and director Joe Dante manages the difficult trick of generating a genuine sense of jeopardy with the malicious little puppets, yet a reassuring sense that no-one comes to any real harm.<br/><br/>One wonders what it would be like to see a remake with CGI gremlins and some of the dark doings which were envisaged in the original script..."
"Hey_Sweden","9","1","3","5 December 2011"," Memorable 80's product still packs a mean punch.
","I would consider this my favourite Christmas movie of all time. And if your tastes tend towards the dark, twisted, and subversive, and you enjoy a healthy amount of humour with your horror, I'm sure you consider this essential Christmas viewing as well.<br/><br/>It was the brainchild of Chris Columbus, whose screenplay caught the attention of Steven Spielberg who then suggested Joe Dante as director. Spielberg had enjoyed both Dantes' ""Jaws"" send-up ""Piranha"", as well as ""The Howling"", and the two had also directed segments of the previous years' notorious ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". The story centres around bank teller and aspiring artist Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), whose travelling salesman / inventor father Rand (singer / songwriter / actor Hoyt Axton) picked up an unusual Christmas present for Billy during a visit to Chinatown: a cute little fuzzy animal identified as a Mogwai, whom Rand christens Gizmo. Gizmo comes with a set of insane rules, which of course must be followed and which, naturally, are meant to be broken soon enough: he must not be exposed to bright light, *especially* sunlight, he must not come into contact with water, and he must not eat after midnight. Rule # 2 is broken, and Gizmo spawns a quintet of new Mogwai that prove to be absolutely incorrigible. When rule # 3 is broken (unknowingly), the new Mogwai become Gremlins (the name coming from WWII, when any machinery experiencing problems would be said to have 'gremlins' in it), little reptilian monsters that proceed to tear an idyllic small town to pieces.<br/><br/>This continues to hold up on repeat viewings. Even if there are firmly dated aspects to the presentation at times (Mega madness!), it's still as fun as it ever was, with an endearing human cast in addition to the diminutive ""stars"". Galligan and sexy Phoebe Cates are an appealing lead couple, Axton and Frances Lee McCain are a delight as the parents, Polly Holliday is just a riot as the crabby, greedy local busybody Mrs. Deagle (a perfect '80s stand in for Mr. Potter from ""It's a Wonderful Life""), and Judge Reinhold a hoot as smarmy and ambitious bank vice-president Gerald. Superb supporting players include the *always* welcome Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman (who's reunited with his co-star from ""The Little Shop of Horrors"", Jackie Joseph), Scott Brady, Edward Andrews, Glynn Turman, Keye Luke, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks, Harry Carey, Jr., Belinda Balaski, and The Real Don Steele, the real life D.J. who will be familiar to fans of New World productions from the '70s. Appearing uncredited are veterans Kenneth Tobey and William Schallert. Spielberg and composer Jerry Goldsmith make fleeting appearances which the viewer will want to watch for. The voice artists are all fun, including Howie Mandel as Gizmo, and ultra ubiquitous Frank Welker as Stripe; ""Police Academy"" series sound effects guy Michael Winslow is also among this bunch.<br/><br/>Excellent and highly enjoyable effects by Chris Walas and his team, Goldsmiths' irresistible score including that ""Gremlin Rag"" main theme, and numerous in-jokes and visual gags add to the fun. The title characters are never less than entertaining - sometimes frightening, sometimes extremely funny - and one can't help but like these guys - after all, they can't be *all* bad when they like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" so much. They kind of have the personalities of children, albeit children whose pranks have a decidedly sadistic nature. And when they raise Hell in a tavern, they're just as obnoxious and destructive as any human drunks. The scene with McCain dispatching three of the monsters in her kitchen justifiably gave the movie its reputation. It's show stopping stuff, although the business with the microwave (not to mention Cates' priceless story of why she dislikes the Christmas season) did rub a fair amount of people the wrong way. And when all is said and done with this movie, there is a very blatant yet effective message about learning to be responsible.<br/><br/>Followed by a sequel six years later, ""Gremlins"" would prove to be so successful - and merchandise friendly, no doubt - that it would get a theatrical re-release, and lead to a number of other imitative comedy / horror movies about little monsters - ""Critters"", ""Troll"", ""Ghoulies"", ""Hobgoblins"", and their sequels - but leads the pack by far.<br/><br/>Nine out of 10."

","It's Christmas in American picture-postcard town Kingston Falls. Billy Peltzer is given an unusual present; a cute little furry creature called a Mogwai. He is delighted with the gift until he accidentally gets it wet and it quickly multiplies. Worse still is to come when the new creatures are fed after midnight and transform into horribly mischievous Gremlins ...<br/><br/>Most people's favourite Christmas movie is It's A Wonderful Life. My favourite is Gremlins. It's a fabulous flick, because it somehow manages to be both a sentimental good-natured modern-day fairytale, and an uproariously riotous comic horror film that stomps all over the nice wholesome image of Christmas and small-town America. The script by Chris Columbus is simply fantastic - all the characters are beautifully drawn, the Three Rules Of Gremlins are brilliant, and there are whole scenes which are simply priceless - the evocative Chinatown opening, the Sam Peckinpah kitchen massacre sequence, Kate's phenomenal Why I Hate Christmas speech, Mrs Deagle's grisly demise and the Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs spectacle, to name but a few. This is one of those rare examples of a film where everything just gels together beautifully - Dante's gleefully insane direction, Jerry Goldsmith's alternately soothing and teeth-grating score, wonderful camera-work by John Hora and eye-popping special effects puppetry by Chris Walas - Gizmo and Stripe are not just props in this movie, they are real characters who give performances with more depth than a lot of A-list actors I could name. The rest of the cast are equally wonderful; Galligan and Cates (for my money the best and cutest young actress of the eighties) are extremely appealing, Axton is terrific as the hapless inventor dad, Miller hilarious as the xenophobic neighbour Mr Futterman, and Luke is unforgettable as the wise old grandfather. Look out also for an unbilled bit by Dante alumni Kenneth Tobey and executive producer Steven Spielberg in a rare cameo appearance. This is a brilliantly made, wonderfully wicked horror comedy, in equal parts intriguing, funny, gross, touching and scary."

","From executive producer Steven Spielberg, writer Chris Columbus and director Joe Dante (The Howling, Small Soldiers), this was released in cinemas as a family comedy horror. It turned out however to have too many scenes which scared young children, so they changed it to a 15 certificate, which in a way is fair enough. Basically Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is looking for Christmas present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan), and after secretly paying for it, despite the owner Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) saying no, he finds a Mogwai. There are rules to owning the Mogwai, which Billy names Gizmo, he must be kept away from bright lights, especially sunlight which will kill him, he must stay away from water, and most important, he must never eat after midnight. Trying to have fun with and take care of Gizmo, it is not long before the first rule is broken when water is spilt, causing his body to spit out more Mogwais. While the school scientist does some tests on one of the Mogwais, Billy unintentionally breaks the big one by feeding them after midnight, causing all but Gizmo to be in cocoons transforming. As soon as they hatch, that is when the chaos starts, the leader Stripe jumps in a swimming pool causing multiplication, and these larger monsters, called Gremlins according to Murray Futterman (Dick Miller), wreak havoc in the town while it is dark. Billy and his love interest Kate Beringer (Phoebe Cates), who has had a horrible incident happen at Christmas before, are now trying to find a way to kill them all. They find all of them cooped up in the cinema watching Snow White and turn the gas on the blow them up, but the leader Stripe manages to get away, but don't worry, he is stopped before multiplying and melted with sunlight. Also starring Frances Lee McCain as Lynn Peltzer, Polly Holliday as Ruby Deagle, Jackie Joseph as Sheila Futterman, Scott Brady as Sheriff Frank, Harry Carey Jr. as Mr. Anderson, Corey Feldman as Pete Fountaine, Judge Reinhold as Gerald Hopkins, Frank Welker as Stripe / Mogwai / Gremlins, Howie Mandel as Gizmo, Chuck Jones as Mr. Jones, Jerry Goldsmith as Man in Telephone Booth Glancing at Camera and Steven Spielberg as Man in Electric Wheelchair. The cute and cuddly Mogwai is fun, the nasty and ugly Gremlins are entertaining, and the spoofs and in-jokes in amongst the sometimes scary moments make this a great alternative to the feel-good Christmas specials, a great black comedy fantasy. It was number 34 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!"

","For me personally, Gremlins is pure youth sentiment. I was only 6 years old when the movie first appeared, but I had a great time watching it then. Of course I wondered what would be left of it now. I'm 20 years older, my taste for movies has developed and I'm used to see a lot of movies (some of them enhanced with the latest technologies and special effects). Would Gremlins still be a good movie or would it all look very dated? <br/><br/>Well, I can assure you that overall this movie is still more than OK. The Gremlins still look cool and slimy and the fact that they create a lot of chaos and mayhem is still fun to watch. Another positive thing about the movie is that it doesn't really seem dated. Of course there are always details that remind you of the fact that this isn't a recent movie, but it never really bothered me. If there is one negative thing that I could mention about ""Gremlins"" than it must be the fact that this is still called a horror movie. The Gremlins aren't scary at all, never have been in my opinion. Perhaps to some people they looked scary more than 20 years ago, but today we are used to a lot worse, so calling this a horror movie isn't exactly right anymore.<br/><br/>As you probably already know there are three rules that have to be taken into account when dealing with a Mogwai. Never feed it after midnight (otherwise they become monsters), make sure it doesn't get too much light or it will die and never get it wet or it will reproduce. Of course the Mogwai does get some water over him and immediately some furry balls start coming out of his back, which rapidly change into new Mogwai's. The original one is cute and sweet, but his ""children"" aren't that nice. Especially not Stripe, their leader. Soon they turn into little green monsters and start a lot of mayhem.<br/><br/>Maybe today it all seems a bit silly, but it still is a very fun movie. And no, it isn't a technological miracle, but that doesn't bother me. The fact that I see it more as a parody on other horror movies and that it still stands after all these years is the main reason why I still cherish this movie. I'm sure that the younger generation doesn't like it anymore because it isn't spectacular enough, but for me this movie still works. I give it a 7/10."

When he wakes up the next morning they are in a nasty looking cocoon.  All hell breaks loose when the mowagi, now gremlins, hatch and the town goes into haywire.

","From the opening sequence to the end credits, Gremlins has a certain charm to it. Perhaps it was the directing style of Joe Dante, or the screenplay by Chris Columbus. Whichever, it is a fun, entertaining and imaginative film.<br/><br/>  Gizmo (voiced by a young Howie Mandel) is a true creature effect, as are the Gremlins. This is one film that would have lost its charm if it were made today. The fact that we barely ever see Gizmo's feet when he runs, or the Gremlins lower bodies is wonderful. It is part of the charm that this film carries. I wouldn't want to see Gizmo looking like Yoda from the newest Star Wars films, cheap and unrealistic. It's great to have little creature creations, with real, fake fur (I know that sounds dumb but think about it).<br/><br/>
 The cast is not extra ordinary, which makes it also feel so fun to watch, but nevertheless, the cast is still great, though the character of Billy wasn't the best they could have chosen, but like I said, that's part of the fun of it all.<br/><br/> Gremlins has to be one of the most chaotic, entertaining, mesmerizing, adventurous, revolutionary, charming, fun-filled films of the past twenty years. 4/4 stars-<br/><br/>John"

B-movie monster flick updated with a tongue-in-cheek 80s approach with great results: hack inventor Axton picks up a cute, fuzzy Mogwai as an exotic pet for his teenage son for Christmas with only three catches: don't expose it to bright light, don't get it wet with water, and never, ever, feed it after midnight with naturally no one paying attention to these, resulting in mayhem with reptillian Gremlins taking over the small town they inhabit. Great special effects by Chris Walas and pop culture-influenced screenplay by budding filmmaker Chris Columbus.  Neat blend of horror and comedy, and yes that is Howie Mandel as the voice of cuddly Gizmo (The Giz!)  Look quick for Steven Spielberg (in the inventors' convention sequence with sci-fi icon Robby the Robot) and Bugs Bunny animating genius Chuck Jones.  ***Trivia note: this was the first film to receive a PG-13 rating by the MPAA for its surprisingly effective cartoon violence.

","""Don't feed them after Midnight!"" The movie Gremlins will keep your eyes glued to the Television set. Rand Peltzer purchases Gizmo in China Town. Two rules are broken in this movie 1. Never put water on Gizmo (that made Gizmo multiply) and 2. Never feed the Gremlins after midnight (that created the Gremlins). Gizmo did not get fed after midnight so he remained the same. Because these rules are broken the Gremlins are terrorizing the town (and at Christmas too). One night all of the Gremlins decide to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and that's when Billy sets the Theater on fire. Every Gremlin was killed except for the leader (who is later killed after looking at Sunlight). I liked this film because it combines computer animation with real life.

The performances range from very good (Polly Holliday, Frances Lee McCain) to OK (everybody else). The special effects are superb, Gizmo is soooooo cute, the movie is never dull and there are tons of references for film buffs (like me). BUT it is NOT for children. I remember seeing it on opening night back in 1984, and when the evil gremlins attacked and the violence got real extreme (the mother killing three of them in a blender, microwave and knife), I still remember mothers dragging screaming, terrified children out of the theatre. There's also an extremely morbid Christmas tragedy that Phoebe Cates relates and people are killed--on screen! If they had toned down the violence and avoided killing people (injuring would have been fine) this would be a great film for everybody. As it is, it is a great film...for junior high on up. Also, when the gremlins invade the bar would someone explain where they got all those little clothes and how they knew how to play cards, drink beer, break dance, etc etc. Also there's a gremlin in the school that kills a teacher, slashes Zach Galligan...and then is forgotten! There are plenty of logic lapses in the script, but it's still worth seeing. Deserves an R rating, not a PG."

","This is another one of those films that I remember from the 80s, and it is also one that I haven't seen for quite a while so I thought that I might watch it again, if only to see if I remember all that much about it. Honestly, after watching it so long after it was released all I have to say is that this film is basically brain mush, nothing more, nothing less. Actually, to be more specific, in many ways it really doesn't seem to know what it really wants to be.<br/><br/>That is this problem with this film, and that is that it is trying to be two types of films that just contrast with each other too much - that is a horror, and a comedy. The reason I say that is that in comedies, characters aren't really supposed to die, and if they do die, they are supposed to die in absolutely absurd ways. This isn't the case with this film - the characters that die, die in a way as they would die in any old horror movie.<br/><br/>However, the antagonists, the Gremlins, make this film feel like a comedy, especially all of the antics that they get up to. Then there is the final confrontation with Spike, and that really seems to come down as if it was a serious confrontation with a serious villain from a serious film, not some film that basically has a bunch of puppets running around causing mayhem and chaos.<br/><br/>This brings me to another problem that I have with this film, and that is whether it is the question of whether it is a kid's movie or not - in part it feels like it is, particularly with the cute looking Mogwai, and another with the gremlins, who are pretty comical in their antics. However, the other issue is that, well, characters die, and that isn't something that I feel belongs in a kid's movie. Sure, characters do die in kid's movie - see Bambi for instance - but they tend to be quite emotional, which is not the case here, since they simply die as if it were a horror film.<br/><br/>What the film does well though is with the Gremlins. As they flag at the beginning of the film, Gremlins are basically creatures that get into devices and cause all sorts of problems. This is what they do, and what they do rather well. Yet, as I mentioned, there does seem to be some really dark aspects to this film that doesn't sit all that well with the craziness of the Gremlins. Oh, I could also mention the completely unscientific means of how they reproduce and transform, but that is being just a little bit too picky, and sometimes we simply need to let movies be movies, no matter how silly the premise."
"filipemanuelneto","5","1","4","26 March 2016"," Horror comedy or didactic comedy?
","""Gremlins"" is a film that marked the imagination of the youth of the eighties and nineties. In this film, the young Billy (Zach Galligan) bought a strange creature, apparently Eastern and property of an old Chinese, who warned him to the grave danger that could come if the creature, Gizmo, was not treated properly. The young man didn't understand the message: unable to see that Gizmo wasn't a toy or a pet, he did everything he couldn't and eventually gave rise to a plague of wild monsters, the Gremlins, capable of causing chaos and destruction wherever they go.<br/><br/>Directed by Joe Dante, the script was done by Chris Columbus, a producer who specializes himself in teen films ( ""The Goonies"" or the early films of ""Harry Potter"" franchise) or containing relevant and pedagogical messages (""Bicentennial Man"", ""Jingle All the Way"", ""the Help"" etc.) and with the participation of Steven Spielberg as executive producer, something who helped to sell the film. After all, at that time, he was the most famous among the film's producers.<br/><br/>This film is usually classified as a horror comedy but I don't see it from that perspective. For me, it's an educational comedy, a film that uses comedy and soft-horror to teach an important message that we can consider almost ecological: certain things, in particular animals, should be treated with respect and care, because the consequences that can come from our negligence are rarely good. It's a family film, dedicated to young people but that will easily please the adult audience."

","'Gremlins' is a monster film which we can always remember and love. But is it really good? Well, here's the thing. This movie has a great idea of finally using gremlins as the monster. They also use them so well that the gremlins are the most likable character (except the leader who's a total pain in the neck). It's also a film which kids and adults can watch with no problem because it's a children's Christmas film and at the same time it's also monster horror movie. Like 'Home Alone', this movie becomes one of those films that becomes a must see on'Christmas' too. It's one hell of a film.<br/><br/>The problem of the movie is that it has no originality. It's all about people not believing that there was a monster and they get the monster destroying the whole town. Wait! Where have I seen that idea before? Hmmm... Oh wait a minute! 'Frankenstien'!

This impossibly cute bundle of fur comes with a strict set of rules which are inevitably broken. The result is a horde of vicious foot high monsters that set out to cause trouble wherever they can.<br/><br/>With the help of Gizmo, and gorgeous workmate Kate (the always stunning Phoebe Cates), Billy sets out to destroy the gremlins.<br/><br/>Although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters (the kitchen attack scene, in particular is quite frightening), Gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages. My kidsaged four and sixlove this film (although I admit that I have been gradually conditioning them: one of the toys they have had from birth is a bendy Gremlin!). It really is hard to resist the movie's non-stop manic and zany comedy (the Gremlins are a hoot as they break-dance, get drunk, play poker, and sing Christmas carols!).<br/><br/>Sure, some moments are perhaps a little too daft (personally, I don't understand that rule about not feeding a mogwai after midnight, and I can't fully accept the scene where Gizmo drives a fully functioning Barbie car) but excellent animatronics courtesy of Chris Walas, a nifty script from Chris Columbus, loads of in-jokes for fans of fantasy films (look out for blink-and-you'll-miss-them appearances from Gremlins producer Steven Spielberg and animator Chuck Jones, an appearance from Forbidden Planet's Robbie the Robot, a stuffed ET toy sat between a cuddly Sylvester and Bugs Bunny, and the Time Machine from the 60s George Pal movie) all go to make Gremlins an unmissable treat.<br/><br/>And its got Phoebe Cates in it too!

The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead Two, Army Of Darkness, and this. As you can see, not many films can do that.

Can you believe that? It is so bizarre! I'm definitely overreacting, it is not that exciting that they turn green.<br/><br/>A man buys a strange little creature for his teenage boy, Billy. It is called a Mogwai, or Gremlin. The only problem is that there are three important rules for taking care of a Mogwai. Never splash water on it, never expose it to sunlight, and never, never, never, never feed it after midnight. Billy loves the Mogwai, but water is splashed onto it. It multiplies to more Mogwai. They are more meaner than the first Mogwai, or it is called in this film Gizmo. Then all of the Mogwai except for Gizmo eat after midnight. They suddenly turn green, scaly, and murderous. There is a leader Mogwai called Stripe. Anyway, the kill humans and drink and smoke. Then Stripe goes into a pool and multiplies. There are a lot of Mogwai now. Eventually after deaths after deaths every Mogwai are killed in an explosion, except Stripe. Billy and Gizmo go to a store and Stripe is exposed to sunlight, thus melting him. When Billy goes home the original owner of Gizmo takes him away. Yes, it has a kind of sad ending.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun journey of excitement from beginning to end. There is also an awesome death in it. Mrs. Deagle, someone who has a grudge against Billy because of his dog, goes on a lift chair. Unfortunaley, the Mogwai had fixed it just for her. She goes on it, it goes really fast, and she flies out a window, where she falls to her death.

","I'm a child of the 80s and saw this movie when I was a kid. Like every kid from the 80s I was head over heels in love with it. It's a ""cartoonish"" movie - this is why children like it.<br/><br/>Since I still love 80s movies I thought I'd rewatch it this week. It was unbearable. I couldn't stomach more than about half an hour before I had to turn it off. It was so annoying, so cringe-y, I just couldn't stand it.<br/><br/>Not sure how other adults feel but that's why I have given it a 5/10: I would have given it a 10/10 as a child and a 1/10 as an adult, so I just split the difference. Totally unwatchable as an adult, painfully annoying."
"harryplinkett14","5","1","8","9 February 2019"," Lots of nostalgia, but not much of a film
","This film is utter nonsense from beginning to end. It fails in terms of having a moral message, it fails in terms of storytelling, it fails in terms of characters, and it fails in terms of logic.<br/><br/>First off, what is the moral message here? That stupid white people can't be trusted to act responsibly? Well, does the old Chinese man act responsibly, when he shows the Mogwai to random people, then leaves it unguarded so his grandson, who is even more irresponsible can sell it? At the end the Chinese man says that American society has done to the Mogwai what it does to all of nature's gifts. That's rich considering China is the nr. 1 destroyer of nature.<br/><br/>Now, what about the story itself? Well, it's just a bunch of ugly creatures terrorizing the town in a series of scenes that might have been funny in the 80s, but pack no punch today. That's all it is.<br/><br/>What about the characters? There is this nasty rich woman, who ends up doing nothing, other than being another victim of the gremlins. There is a crazy inventor, who invents coffee makers, juicers, and other things that have already been invented. Only his versions don't actually work. His sole role in the film is to buy the Mogwai and then be away on some conference. Then there's his wife, who seems to be suffering from severe depression. She gets to kill a few gremlins, and has no other role either. There are only three real characters here: Billy, the son, his girlfriend, and the Mogwai. These three are all likeable, but they are not given much to do. Also, Billy ends up being completely useless.<br/><br/>Indeed, Billy is a bit of a loser, like his father. He is incompetent and weak, and hangs out with kids. His father also seems to treat him like a child. He buys him toy robots as Christmas presents, as we learn later in the film. His girlfriend has no qualities other than being pretty, yet depressed because her father died on Christmas. And then there's the Mogwai, or Gizmo, as Billy calls him. His job is to look cute.<br/><br/>Now, Billy ends up being a total failure. The gremlin kicks his ass, and he spends most of the time crawling on the floor, moaning, being passive, and getting pounded by a tiny puppet. It's the Mogwai that saves his ass, by driving a tiny electric car, which for some reason has an operational steering wheel, gas pedal, breaks, gearbox, and so on. All puppet size. That brings us to the utter lack of logic.<br/><br/>Why does the Chinese boy sell the Mogwai for 200 dollars, when a unique species like that could be sold for millions? Is that street-smart boy really that dumb? Why does no one ask any questions about the weird rules for handling the Mogwai? Why does no one even ask what the hell it's supposed to be? Why does Billy's dad think anyone would need his 'bathroom buddy' invention? It's just a bunch of stuff for personal hygiene people normally put in little travel bags. Then he says he can get loads of them for anyone who wants to buy them. How? Who is going to produce them? Why does the schoolteacher also ask no questions about the Mogwai? He's a biologist, apparently. He receives an unknown creature that multiplies by water, instantly, defying laws of physics, let alone known biology. But when the thing cocoons and is about to hatch, he is not one bit scared what might come out. He is excited. No need to tell anyone. In fact, everyone in this film ignores the fact that the little thing is some kind of really weird creature. Even the police. And where do the gremlins find miniature clothes, accessories, and even functioning guns that can fit into their hands? What do they even want? No one knows. Now, the only reason these things get to invade the town is because Billy allows one of them to escape. It jumps out the window, and instead of chasing after him, Billy just stands like an idiot. He does this time and again. His inaction is the source of all the problems. He's not exactly a hero, is he?<br/><br/>This is where I end my review, because I think I have brought up the major points that bother me. There is plenty more, and I have to say that watching this film again really ruined the fond memories I had of it from childhood. There is still plenty of nostalgia here, which accounts for most of the 5 stars I gave this film."

","1984's Gremlins is one messed up movie...and I am all down for it. The movie came out at a time where it was acceptable to blend the genres of horror and comedy. In fact, it came out the same weekend as the very popular Ghostbusters. Which did the same exact thing, but perhaps a little less scary than Gremlins. The film itself infuses a nice mixture of comedy and horror and it really is a fun movie. There are several grotesque moments, but this film is my childhood and it might be the one film to show your child when introducing the genre of horror.<br/><br/>Can you believe that Joe Dante's film is rated PG? Creatures being blown up in a microwave, these gremlins looking like the monster from Alien, a really sad story about why Kate, one of the characters despises Christmas, and so forth. Along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, this movie inspired the PG-13 rating which we would see in a few months. There have been stories where parents walked out of the theater with their 4-year-old child because the film was marketed as a cute, cuddly movie in the vein of E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. Despite the involvement of Steven Spielberg in both projects (he executive-produced this film), this movie is NO E.T.<br/><br/>I was very surprised to see the movie get a June release date considering the film is set at Christmas. It could have been a factor in the film's success, but it ultimately was the fourth-highest film of 1984. This movie was widely accepted by the audiences, and Joe Dante did a great job combining different genres. I laughed often, but I was also terrified at times. The movie is really scary in certain parts. The creatures themselves added to the scariness. Gizmo himself is a mixture of Yoda and a kitten and is super cuddly, but Stripes and his gang make the creature from Alien seem like a super cute puppy. The creature designs are excellent. Practical effects are good modern-day films, huh?<br/><br/>Inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is in New York and he wanted to buy a gift for his son Billy (Zach Galligan) before he leaves. He stops is a mysterious Chinatown shop where he encounters a Mogwai, that very cute creature. He is told of three rules: avoid bright light, do not give him water, and never, ever feed him after midnight no matter how much he begs. Billy falls in love with his new pet, named Gizmo. Over time, Billy breaks these rules, which causes the birth of the mean-spirited Stripes. Stripes and his mischievous, evil gremlin pals are ready to show the Norman Rockwell lookalike town some very crazy moments.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say the acting is the best part of the film, but the performances are good enough. Zach Galligan, who was unknown at the time, had some good chemistry with Phoebe Cates who plays his girlfriend, Kate. Spielberg wasn't sure about Cates because she was known for playing risquÃ© roles such as that in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but she was impressive. The supporting cast were well-known veteran actors all who gave respectful performances; Dick Miller, Polly Holliday, Hoyt Axton, and Judge Reinhold. Then there is young Corey Feldman. Feldman mainly acted in commercials at the time, so this role boosted his child star status and he did a great job.<br/><br/>Gremlin's music was composed by Jerry Goldsmith who is familiar with the world of horror/sci-fi. The music is instantly recognizable, especially the Gremlins March. His music sounded so playful, but at the same time sounded tense. The film has the looks of a Norman Rockwell painting. The beautiful small-town look...that was destroyed by the gremlins. John Hora did a good job giving us the looks of the town before and after the destruction. Dante did a great job directing the film. He preferred the film's sequel, but I think he still did a great job. Spielberg was originally going to direct the script, which was written by Chris Columbus, but he ultimately gave the directing duties to Dante.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that there are some really dark scenes. The Christmas explanation by Kate was based on an urban legend and was quite controversial. Warner Brothers actually wanted that scene cut, but Dante wanted to keep that scene in. Of course, the second half of the film is based on the destruction by the Gremlins and there is A LOT of it. Also, children, please do not microwave your pets. While not the greatest horror-comedy, the film is a minor classic. I think this is a Christmas film despite its June release date, so give this film a watch...if you dare!<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"

","A bunch of grotesque reptilian monsters wreak all kinds of crazy and destructive havoc in a heretofore sleepy small town around Christmastime. Director Joe Dante and screenwriter Chris Columbus use the premise to poke wickedly nasty, yet still hilarious and positively infectious fun at such worthy targets as schmaltzy Spielbergian/Disneyesque family fare, small town American life, the film medium and the way people watch movies (the definite gut-busting highlight with this particular aspect occurs with a gloriously raucous screening of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves""), traditional notions of heroism (the cops prove to be completely ineffectual in a crisis situation, so it's up to some ordinary working class guy to ultimately save the day), and the hokey sappiness of the yuletide season. Moreover, since we're talking Joe Dante here, naturally there are knowing winks and homages to many classic movies sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>Zach Galligan makes for a likeable hero as average schmoe Billy, Phoebe Cates looks absolutely radiant and gets to relate an uproariously appalling story on why her character Kate hates Christmas, Polly Holiday has a field day as mean and greedy old bat Mrs. Deagle, Frances Lee McCain as Billy's feisty mom has a great sequence in which she fights back against the gremlins in her kitchen, and Dick Miller has one of his best roles as crusty Mr. Futterman. In addition, amongst the familiar faces in colorful small parts are Scotty Brady, Keye Luke, Harry Carey Jr., William Schallert, Belinda Balaski, Edward Andrews, and Kenneth Tobey. The practical special effects hold up remarkably well while Gizmo is simply adorable. Jerry Goldsmith's robust'n'wacky score hits the rousing spot. Nice polished cinematography by John Hora, too.

","When this movie came out, it competed against not only Ghostbusters, but Top Secret, a box office farce that was more of a failure during the second weekend of June 1984, a few months before the 1984 Summer Olympics brought box office down a bit in the states. It was also the first movie to feature the return of the WB Shield, which would remain in that form for 14 years until a CGI version debuted to celebrate Warner Bros' 75th anniversary and has remained unchanged ever since. As for the movie, it was this movie, as well as temple of doom, that forced the MPAA to create a new rating: PG-13, which nowadays kids can go see anyways unlike the R rating. The first movie to be released with the rating was Red Dawn, which became a cult hit and spawned a bad remake, but the first movie made was The Flamingo Kid, which failed at the box office. six years later, gremlins would make a comeback in Gremlins 2: The New Batch, which didn't do well at first but has become a cult classic on its own and makes fun of pop culture."

","When a father gives his son a Mogwai for Christmas, even after the store owner refuses to sell it, it seems like a good Christmas. However, the cute little critter, Gizmo, soon creates a problem as the three rules get broken, leading to a crazy Christmas that the town of Kingston Falls would never forget.<br/><br/>Gremlins is a great 80's film, but it's not for everyone. As one of the two films that would lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating, it can be scary for younger children, and it does have some moments that indeed push it (like the infamous Gremlin in the microwave). But thankfully, nothing goes too far, as even the gory scenes are tame enough for a PG rating, and the movie does have some comedy to give balance. The movie also has some good characters, from Billy to mean old Mrs. Deagle (who wants to put Billy's dog down, but ends up falling victim to the gremlins), this film is a good watch for older kids and teenagers."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","1","1 June 2019"," A pretty good kid-friendly monster movie
","To many who grew up in the 1980's (like I did), Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" was (and perhaps still is) a particular favourite. It was produced by Steven Spielberg at a time when he was practically the King Midas of Hollywood. Although ""Gremlins"" may not have quite the polish of Spielberg's own directorial efforts, it remains an entertaining movie more than 30 years later.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is this: A young man is given a strange, exotic pet by his father, along with three rules to be strictly adhered to. Predictably, those rules aren't followed and mayhem ensues. In a broad sense, the movie takes some of its cues from the monster movies of a bygone era but the titular creatures are actually pretty unique. Sure, some elements of the plot don't really make a lot of sense but this isn't really a movie that's meant to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The movie's approach is definitely more comedic than horrific but the creatures are still fairly menacing, particularly for younger viewers. Naturally, the special effects are starting to show their age but they're not too bad overall. Although I'm not in the target demographic for this type of movie anymore I'd have to say that it's a very good example of its type. I mean, how many successful family friendly horror movies can you think of?<br/><br/>The cast is pretty decent, considering. Zach Galligan is just fine as our hero, Billy. He's likable and we can relate to him, much like how we can relate to his failed inventor father, played by Hoyt Axton. The gorgeous Phoebe Cates is also here as the requisite love interest, not to mention giving the movie's single most memorable line reading. Lastly, a couple of standouts in support are Dick Miller & Judge Reinhold.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the movie is nicely assembled but not really exceptional. Joe Dante's direction is competent and the movie generally looks decent, including the aforementioned special effects. Jerry Goldsmith's score has some memorable themes but the sound is very much of the 80's, which isn't really to my liking.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Gremlins"" isn't exactly a masterpiece but it is a worthwhile piece of fantasy/horror that delivers where it counts most: entertainment value. It will probably help if you're viewing this movie through nostalgic eyes but it's hard to deny that there's just something special about this movie. In short, ""Gremlins"" still captures the imagination."

","This film is actually one I'm not overly nostalgic for. I had the sequel recorded on VHS and I used to watch that one all of the time. This one I actually saw later and have subsequently watched it quite a few times since then. My last viewing I thankfully got to see in the theater and decided to write up this review for it. The official synopsis is a boy inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet and unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town.<br/><br/>This film kicks us off with Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton). He's a struggling inventor who we get voice-over narration about how the events of the film begin. He is taken by a young boy to his grandfather's shop in Chinatown. Mr. Wing (Keye Luke) is the one who owns the shop. Randall finds the Mogwai and wants to buy it. He is denied, but the boy sneaks it out of the shop.<br/><br/>He takes this as a gift to his son, Billy (Zach Galligan). He also tells him the three rules: 1. Don't get it wet, 2. Keep it out of bright light, 3. Don't feed it after midnight. He of course violates all of these rules at different times, creating not only more Mogwai, but some destructive monsters in gremlins.<br/><br/>To get back into it, I really like this film. This is one is a borderline family friendly, Christmas horror film. I will admit the rules are a little bit far fetched, but if you can get past that, I think it is fun film. This one has a cute creature in the Mogwai, but if the rules aren't followed they can become a deadly monster. I think that is quite interesting and actually does create problems when Billy tries to convince the police of what is happening.<br/><br/>The story isn't too deep, but it is enough to move the film along. It is pretty fast paced. I have to say that I love the comedy this film has. The gremlins parody a lot of different things which makes this film great for adults who get the references. I also don't think the film is too scary for older children. As alluded to, it has issues with following its own rules, like Gizmo being licked by a dog and not multiplying or a gremlin hanging out in the snow and not either. Neither of these ruins the film, but after a few viewings I picked up on this.<br/><br/>My really only big problem with this film is Kate Beringer's (Phoebe Cates) back-story. I felt like it really doesn't do a whole lot to the film, aside from giving it a darker feel. It just felt out of place. I have read that there was quite a bit that was cut from this film, so that might have something to do with it. Another thing is Reinhold really has 3 minutes of screen time and we don't see him again. He is a pretty solid actor, especially when this film came out, but he was under utilized. I didn't see much in the reason for him being introduced other than being shot down by Kate and showing who she really has feelings for. These were just a couple things that hurt this film's rating. I will say I was very impressed to see all of the people that did voices for the gremlins though including Howie Mandel, Frank Welker, Michael Winslow and Peter Cullen.<br/><br/>The acting though in general I thought was good. Galligan is solid as our hero. I don't really think we get much of a character arch for him, other than he is kind of a push-over in the beginning. Cates was solid as the female lead, even though what I touched on about the darkness of her character. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of Christmas, I can see where she's coming from. There are a lot of cameos in the film as well that are pretty fun like Dick Miller, Harry Carey Jr., Corey Feldman and Jonathan Banks. In a film like this, the acting doesn't have to be great, but I think what we got was solid.<br/><br/>The effects of this film I love. None of it was done with computers and it was all practical. Most of it was done with animatronics and it looks to be a little bit clay-mation as well. I think that was a good touch. The score of the film is amazing as well. I love the theme song for this film and we get a few different variations that are used throughout the film. I was a big fan of it. It definitely helps the tension of the film for sure.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I really like this film. I think you have a horror film placed during a joyous time, which is interesting. I think the creatures look good, the Mogwai are cute and makes for an enjoyable film. The story moves fast and doesn't have a lot of down time. The rules are little bit outrageous, but if you can get past that it is worth a viewing. I personally feel that this is a pretty family friendly horror film as well. I would recommend giving this film a viewing. This is a great film in my opinion."

","How have I never watched Gremlins before?<br/><br/>Gremlins was such an interesting film, because having never watched it before, I was expecting a very cute movie about a furry creature that interacts with humans. I was expecting a really amazing family film, especially because Stephen Spielberg's name was attached to this as a producer. However (but not unfortunately), Gremlins was actually a really goofy and oddly acted film that has elements of comedy, family, romance, and even horror.<br/><br/>I would compare my experience watching this film to watching From Dusk Till Dawn, because the first half (or first quarter in Gremlins) is so radically different than the rest of the film. We have cute little Gizmo (a mogwai) getting introduced to the family in the first part of the film, and it was so adorable, sweet, and amazing. But then, gremlins (evil version of mogwai's) come about, and the film because straight up horror comedy. For example, there was literally a shocking (but hilarious) sequence where the mother uses the father's inventions to radically murder the evil gremlins in her kitchen. The audience was dying of laughter, and so was I.<br/><br/>But while the first part of the film is heavily involved with the sweet interactions between Gizmo and his family, the rest of the movie is dedicated to showing the gremlins and their absolute destruction of the city. Given, it is really well done and I laughed a ton, but I found that it was more or less lacking in story, and was more focused on giving the audience tons of spectacle. And sure, the spectacle is fantastic. The visuals of the creatures are all either stop motion or hand crafted via animatronics, and it looked amazing. Watching this makes me think that CGI is absolutely awful in most cases, and the practical effects here really added to my experience.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the visuals were a little too praised in some cases, and I was slightly annoyed. What I mean is that the film tried to be a little too style over substance with their practical effects, that there were two direct sequences with the gremlins that just showed them screwing around for over five minutes at a time. Think of their segment in the bar, where they were imitating gangsters; it was funny, but it went on a little too long.<br/><br/>Also, I have a little bit more issues. The glaring issue was that everybody accepted these creatures. Nobody questions these things or even gets scared at all, and I am just thinking about films like ET or Ghostbusters, which had people in the film be genuinely terrified of the alien/ghosts. I just wish people would act a little more scared, to add some element of realism, which the film obviously wasn't going for. But even if Gremlins isn't going for realism and is trying to be more goofy, you can still have the audience express real reactions yet still have comedy, like in Killer Klowns from Outer Space.<br/><br/>The other glaring issue was the bad acting from our main lead, Zach Galligan. He was just terrible, I am sorry. He wasn't in the film much, because the film is really about the creatures, but when he occupied the screen with his girlfriend, I was kind of cringing a little bit. Just a little bit though.<br/><br/>Finally, what makes this film so great is that fact that I thought little Gizmo was so adorable and sweet at the beginning of the film, but when his alter ego came out by way of the gremlins, I was grossed out. It makes me think of humans; sweet on the outside, but cruel jerks once you get to know most of them. But hey, Gizmo is such a cutie. I want a poster of him.<br/><br/>Will be watching the film again with my brother (who hasn't seen it) before school starts again. Perhaps it will be a 4/5 by then."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","Null","0","1","29 December 2017"," A Christmas creature feature classic
","I'd forgotten that Joe Dante's Gremlins balances creature feature, slapstick comedy, charming holiday movie and outright horror flick so expertly, but it's a delicious mix that makes for one of the most timeless fantasy films out there. Director Dante is an expert on all things 80', gooey and larger than life, this being his flagship film of sorts, the one gemstone in a career full of mischievous monsters and supernatural moonshines. Gremlins is an 'inmates running the asylum' formula, distilled into the simple premise of little renegade monsters loose about a small town during Christmas. After a wacky inventor (Hoyt Axton, like John Goodman by way of John Candy) buys an adorable Furby looking thing from the back end of Chinatown, things get nuts when he gives it to his son (Zach Galligan). The rules are don't get the little tyke wet or feed him after midnight, which of course are promptly disobeyed, causing a full on invasion of little green scaly caffeinated crackhead monsters. It's funny because as playful and charming as most of the film's vibe is, these creatures are actually straight up down to kill people and cause maximum destruction, a violent atmosphere that hilariously clashes with the benign, Fisher Price motifs also on display. The special effects are gloriously 80's, tactile and practical to their bones, every grisly gremlin death a symphony of slime and projectile ooze to be savoured, if that's your thing. The Yuletide setting is perfect for such mayhem, the increasingly dastardly antics of these little fuckers acting as a sly metaphor for the feverish, stressful hoops and hangups we all deal with over the Christmas season, whether it be bustling through a crowded mall last minute or shredding a midget goblin in a whirring magic bullet blender, anyone would be hard pressed to decide which would be more intense. The score from Jerry Goldsmith is cheeky, catchy and has an off kilter Danny Elfman vibe, perfect for the madcap, demented story onscreen. A holiday classic and then some, fuel for anyone who gets a few drinks in them over Christmas and gets bitten by the rowdy big until they're swinging from the chandeliers throwing plates at people. The sequel, also helmed by Dante, is a lot of fun in it's own high tech way, but nothing beats the first high flying outing, and plus it's a Christmas movie to."
"Foreverisacastironmess123","10","0","1","27 December 2017"," One evergreen 80s horror comedy classic that will always be good as gold!
","I believe I must have loved this right from the first time I ever saw it, how could I not - it's simply a magical movie that greatly captures the imagination, and to me is still perfectly great and special today. I loved the character of Gizmo so much that I once had a dog who I named after him because they had the exact same adorable fox ears! So anyway, something that I love about this movie is that as well as being a damn good thrilling and occasionally mystifying horror comedy with some very effective dark comedic moments and some lightly scary but effective horror thrown in, it's also a very solid Christmas movie at the same time, and the two genres kind of gradually converge over the course of the story, it amazingly blurs the line between family friendly and dark and edgy like no other picture I've ever seen. At the beginning it's so positively aglow with all of the classic cosy surroundings of the season and is so visually heartwarming, and then they start to toy around with that ambiance and atmosphere as things subtly start to become more darker and chaotic, it's practically a Christmas tree itself that attacks and almost strangles a woman with its lights, Santa is swarmed by vicious little toothy monsters, what should be a beautifully decorated snowy Main Street lies devastated and eerily abandoned... It's also a bit of an anti-Christmas movie, the sweetness of the holiday is turned on its head and made into something ugly and violent, like the mischievous corruption that spawns from the innocence of Gizmo, it goes from happy to dark to silly and comedic as the gremlins multiply, and them scary again when it gets to the final act. The music is fantastic, I love how it so perfectly sets the tone of every different kind of situation, be it sad spooky or even the odd goofy theme that accompanies mean old Mrs. Deagle as she stomps her way through town carrying that ornamental snowman head! They set up Polly Holiday so perfectly as an utterly heartless old cat-loving battleaxe that by the time she's sent flying to her doom on a rocket-powered stairlift, you can't help but laugh your head off! I like the way that she's actually aware of what a horrible person she is, as she thinks the gremlin carollers are demons from hell come to get her at last! There are some sequences that are legit tense like when the mother goes upstairs to investigate the strange noises, but I'm the most creeped-out by the twisted more devious-looking mogwai that pop out of Gizmo, they hang the poor dog and leave him outside to freeze! That dog was so awesome, he really came across as a character more than just an animal, and I also loved him in Pumpkinhead! The puppetry is still pretty terrific, particularly in the climactic showdown between Billy and the chainsaw-wielding, then gun-toting Stripe in the department store. There are moments where you do see the age of the techniques, but so what? Some things are more important than perfect special effects, it's good old-fashioned animatronics and puppetry, you can't beat that, the magic of the practical effect can't ever be replicated! The gremlins are so cool and entertaining to watch, all they want to do is live it up like crazy and consume and wreck everything in sight all at the cost of sweet humanity, and lord help you if you get in the way of or become a part of their warped concept of fun! They may presumably kill a lot of people offscreen, but the deaths of the gremlins themselves are by far the most gruesome, especially how Stripe ends up! The movie was such an incredible hit that it spawned it's own horror subgenre, with my favourites of the bunch being Critters, Ghoulies, and Puppet Master, although that one could be debatable.. Gremlins is still such a wonderful movie and to me is undoubtably Dante's best work, there ain't no other movie like it, Gremlins is always very welcome in my house! X"
"Samuel-Shovel","7","0","1","26 December 2017"," A Fun, Campy, Family-Friendly? Horror Movie
","Gremlins has all the characteristics of a cheesy, campy B-horror movie from the 80's. In theory it shouldn't work but it just does. It perfectly balances the amount of humor to horror, never tipping the scales too much in either direction as this movie flies by, an enjoyable 90-some odd minutes.<br/><br/>Everything about this plot is fun, from the quirky father who invents the odd contraptions in an attempt to support his family, to the innocent, angel-like young lead who works at a bank to support his family and his adorable sidekick of a dog, to the villainous bank owner and all her cats named after money (who plays far less of a role than I anticipated), it all works.<br/><br/>The gremlins themselves are an impressive feat of animatronics for the time period. Gizmo is the adorable little hero that you hate yourself for finding so cute and the gremlins themselves are just scary enough to pose an actual threat to the characters in this movie. I love how quickly we go from Chinatown to these Gremlins tearing the town apart. This movie flies by at a good clip. Besides the scene of them and their antics inside the bar, I don't think there were any scenes I thought dragged on too long.<br/><br/>This movie is also littered with fun little trivia facts. The inclusion of Howie Mandel as a voice actor, a young Corey Feldman in a bit role, the use of the Back to the Future set, all of this adds to the enjoyment you get out of watching this odd little horror film.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something a little out of the norm to watch on Christmas day, look no further than this gem."
"andrew-repko","10","0","1","25 December 2017"," A Christmas Classic for everyone!
","There is no better way to spend the Christmas season, then enjoying one of the greatest seasonal movies, the Gremlins. The movie really gets it when it comes to understanding the Christmas season. It takes you through how most people view Christmas as a happy time of year full of joy and happiness, but it also shows how the holiday season can be a very depressing time for others. No one hammers this home better in the movie then Phoebe Cates,.You know her from her role in Fast Times at Ridgemont, in the iconic scene where she jumps in the pool and ol Judge Reinhold gets his mind wondering and imagines her take off her top off (she takes it off in the film for real, but you knew that) but while Judge was busy dreamin, she catches him in ""the act"" in the bathroom. V embarrassing for Judge, who is also in Gremlins. Must have been pretty weird to have to work together again just 2 years after the ""incident"". Anyway, Phoebe, who's name in the movie is Kate, tells Billy Peltzer why she hates Christmas. She first hints at it earlier in the movie when she says ""a lot of people get really depressed....While everybody else is opening up their presents, they're opening up their wrists."" Pretty damn dark. But eventually she sheds more light as to why she hates Christmas. It turns out her genius dad tried to surprise his daughter on Christmas but dressing like Santa and climbing down the chimney and didn't even tell his wife he did that. Anyway, when he goes to attempt this ridiculous and probably not possible stunt, he falls down the chimney and instantly breaks his neck and dies, like an idiot. His body got stuck there and his family couldn't find him for days until his daughter smelled a terrible odor from the chimney. That's a dark story and you can understand why she has such a dark outlook on Christmas.<br/><br/>While everyone knows this movie is mostly about Christmas and celebrating with family and friends, it does veer into a different direction with a subplot involving little furry creatures call Mogwai's. Con-man, sleazy salesman and all around terrible father Rand Peltzer stumbles upon Mogwai's in an underground chinatown shop. He refused to listen to the old wise man who lived there and made a backdoor deal with the young kid to purchase a Mogwai as a Christmas Present for his Adult Son. Also, Rand is an inventor of crappy products such as the Bathroom Buddy, trust me.. its a bad invention. He's know around town as a joke and a weasel and everyone knows his adult son supports his parents with his job as a bank teller.<br/><br/>Upon purchasing this Mogwai, the young man warns Rand that to care for the Mogwai he must follow 3 simple rules: 1. They hate bright lights and you need to keep them out of the sunlight, it will kill them (fair and very straight forward rule) 2. Keep them away from water and 3. Don't ever feed them after midnight. It turns out that if they touch water, they multiply pretty cool but more trouble for the owner. If you feed them after midnight, they become these sweet creatures called Gremlins. I have a lot of questions on why ""midnight"" is a time they can't be fed and how these creatures are timezone centric. So obviously Billy Peltzer f's up when him and his pal Corey Feldman accidentally spill water on the Mogwai they call Gizmo, which immediately spawns off 5 more Mogwai. Now Mogwai are kind of whack, they are pretty much Bootleg Furby's, the popular children's toy from the Late 90s early 2000's. They add no real value and are more of a burden then anything. The 5 Mogwai's spurned from gizmo are kind of badasses. They plays a prank on the dog and hang him by the Christmas lights. They also chew threw the power chord on Billy's clock which stopped his clock at like 11:40pm. And Billy is a total weenie and didn't realize his clock his wrong and fed the 5 BA Mogwai's some fried chicken after midnight.<br/><br/>This led to the Mogwai transforming into Gremlins which the movie tries to tell you they are ""bad guys"" but i'd disagree. They were however very ugly. These maniacs just wanted to drink booze, smoke cigs and shoot some guns, like most americans. There's a great montage when they are at the local pub holding Phoebe's character hostage as they all raged! Seemed like the type of bar I'd like to go to. The lead Gremlin, who they called Strip got loose after Billy's mom stabbed and microwaved his 4 other Gremlin friends. He went down to the local Y and jumped into the pool and multiplied the Gremlins by about 1,000. After a night out on the town causing some light mischief and some partying with their homies, they settled down for a screening of Snow White at the local theater. Billy, Gizmo and Kate (Phoebe) were jealous of how much fun the Gremlins were having and ambushed them by blowing up the theater and killing them all but Stripe. They eventually tortured spike by slowly melting him to death in sunlight. Extremely violent and unfair!.<br/><br/>One Random thought, how come if the Mogwai/Gremlins touch water, they multiple but they can walk around in snow and not multiply? Also, I laughed every time Stripe shot a gun, So great!"

"JamesMovieGuy_117","10","0","1","22 December 2017"," Quite possibly the best horror comedy of all time
","Gremlins is one of my favourite movies that seamlessly blends comedy and horror or as some might label it a horror comedy. Gremlins takes the innocent time of Christmas and takes a satirical yet dark spin on the holiday, highlighting societal issues of consumerism, patriotism and greed.<br/><br/>The film paints a pessimistic view on Christmas and how these issues can inevitably lead to chaos. It's a great metaphor for how the holiday is swept in ideas of consumerism, yet it's painted to be a time of joy and innocence. <br/><br/>What's funny about this movie is how it depicts these issues. The Gremlins are mischievous creatures who embody everything wrong with consumerism, once you break the rules everything can go wrong. It's a great satire on how American culture can't always take responsibility for commercial items. Mrs Deagle represents greed and her unlikeable character is hysterical because it epitomises the essence of greed.<br/><br/>Joe Dante alludes his premise to 1950's horror movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which are directly referenced in the film. It takes these concepts and takes a satirical spin, using the monsters as a metaphor not as a gimmick.<br/><br/>Gremlins is simply brilliant and I notice something new every time I watch the movie. It's not just a great movie to watch around Christmas, it's a great movie to watch all around."

"classicsoncall","7","0","1","24 July 2017"," ""This could really be the big one.""
","It's always cool to revisit a movie that was seen when it first came out and not again until the present day. This time it's my turn for ""Gremlins"", a gem that made it's mark in the comedy/horror genre way back in 1984. Being a classic movie fan, it was a treat to catch clips from even earlier films like ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". I enjoy those little bits of nostalgia whenever they pop up in something I'm watching.<br/><br/>Once the furry little fuzzball Gizmo pops out a handful more of his look-alikes, the fun begins until things get out of control during the metamorphosis stage when mogwais turn into gremlins. I don't think I have to go into the whole back story to explain things, there are enough reviews here if you haven't seen the movie, and most likely if you're reading this you already have.<br/><br/>The one caveat I would offer here is that for real young kids, this might be too intense, what with the ugliness of the gremlin creatures and the nasty violence they bring to the story. Not to mention the highly creative ways Mom Peltzer (Frances Lee McCain) deals with her home invaders. The blender deal was pretty dicey, but she really outdid herself with the microwave treatment, never considering who was going to clean up the mess afterward. That's what I liked about her.<br/><br/>There's only two questions I have after catching this flick the other night, the first one being kind of facetious. Isn't it always 'after midnight' once the clock strikes twelve? But maybe even more importantly for this fan of classic movies and TV programs - where was William Shatner for this one?"
"paul_haakonsen","7","0","1","3 May 2017"," With mogwai, comes much responsibility...
","The 1984 ""Gremlins"" movie is a classic in the horror comedy genre, and it actually still is capable of standing its ground today. So it is definitely a movie that is quite worth watching if you haven't already seen it. ""Gremlins"" is a movie that I have watched countless times, and will continue to watch every now and then with some years in between each viewing. If you haven't already seen ""Gremlins"", then you are definitely missing out on a great classic horror comedy.<br/><br/>I feel that it is redundant to summarize the storyline, especially because ""Gremlins"" is the type of movie that everyone should already be familiar with. But in the off chance that you aren't familiar with the movie, then let's just quickly summarize the storyline.<br/><br/>The story told in ""Gremlins"" is about a young man whose father gives him a most unique creature named Gizmo for a pet, a creature known as a 'mogwai'. There are three simple rules to keeping the furry, cuddly little creature. 1) Don't expose it to water. 2) Never feed it after midnight. 3) No direct sunlight. When the rules are accidentally broken, the creature reproduce, but these creatures do not share Gizmo's friendly and peaceful demeanor. And the small township is soon overrun with green, nasty gremlins wrecking havoc and terrorizing the Citizens.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is a good combination of story elements and genres, which makes for a very memorable movie that you can watch again and again, because the story never gets old.<br/><br/>And while the movie is from 1984, then the special effects are actually quite good, even by today's standards. And the movie does stand its ground still, and it is still quite watchable.<br/><br/>The creature design, both for the mogwai and the gremlins is quite good, and very memorable. Once you have seen ""Gremlins"" for the first time, you will never forget the mogwai or the gremlins, trust me. Yes, it is that memorable.<br/><br/>There are also some memorable acting performances in ""Gremlins"". Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates really carried the movie quite nicely. But there were also some very memorable appearances by Hoyt Axton and Dick Miller. Furthermore, it was also fun to watch a young Corey Feldman make a small appearance here.<br/><br/>""Gremlins"" is a movie that can be watched by adults and kids alike, because there is something for just about everyone here, whether you like comedy or little green monsters and everything in between.<br/><br/>This is indeed a wholehearted movie that will never become obsolete. And as of 2017, the movie has luckily not yet gone through a reboot of older movies, as Hollywood has been making heaps of within the last couple of years. And I hope this classic doesn't go through the butchery of a remake or reboot, because it is great as it already is."

","Just about the same time, there was a lot of Ghostbusting going around, out came this other cute little blockbuster, that holds it's own, if comparing it to Ghostbusters, where there would of been silent competition going with these two flicks. When salesman who sucks (Axton) buys a really unique present, Gizmo, a cute little gremlin, for his son (likeable Galligan) bedlam happens, when the three vital rules, to taking responsibility for it, are ignored thanks to the neighbor's son, Feldman, who gets kind of too enthused. Soon we have many other angry and vicious Gremlins, unlike the cute Gizmo, and the majority of the blame falls on Galligan's stopped clock, as you're not spose' to feed these suckers after midnight. The little buggers really cause so much strife, in such an original fun movie, where first seeing it at 14, I found the film a little scary and unnerving, where reading the film was too violent, whatever, where at the time it's PG rating was a bit of a worry. You really didn't know where these little buggers would take it. Standouts in the film are of course Polly Holiday as a real nasty pasty and little Feldman who always impresses, whether small role or big role. Corman favorite, Dick Miller was fun to watch too, where personally I felt Galligan wasn't strong enough here, to steer a lead role. Sadly this movie paved the way for some real stinkers, Ghoulies, Troll, and Critters, and there's more. Again Axton's character really ought to get a new line of work. Well formulated movie."
"hellraiser7","10","0","1","14 December 2015"," Monster Christmas Party
","As much as like the cheerful kind of Christmas films, personally I'm more fascinated with those bizarre ones that really put the yang in the holiday. This film though is what started that trend for me, I've seen this film when I was 7, I loved it then and I love it now it's not just one of my favorite Chirstmas films but one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>I really love the story which I'll admit is a very unusual and really daring idea for a Christmas film but it really worked and I loved it because it was just a change of pace for me. For it's time mixing horror and Christmas was really unheard of (it's still rarely done to this day), but it turned out to be a great combo where it not just delivers some frights but also smiles and managed to still emit that warm Christmas feel if you can believe that. <br/><br/>Production value is excellent done on a big budget but used correctly, The creature effects are fantastic because their all practical, there is no CGI bull crap. The designs of both the Mogwai and Gremlins are great, they look like animals they could exist in our modern world. And the animatronics and pupetering is perfect, from their facial expressions giving each of them a persona and their movements.<br/><br/>The voice acting for the creatures is amazing. From comedian Howie Mandel for Gizmo which is just spot on because each sound just sprouts cuteness, of course he used some of those same tones for his voice acting role for Bobby in the animated show ""Booby's World"" (another cute little guy). And of course Frank Wekler as the Gremlin Stripe is just fantastic, Frank Wekler is my favorite voice actor this guy is just a chameleon of voices, let alone the fact that I'm a ""Transformers"" fan and on a side note Peter Culen another ""Transformers"" alumi also does voice work as one of the Gremlins so that's cool. But Frank's voice also fits like a glove for this character as it just emits menace, mischievousness, and nastiness.<br/><br/>I really like the small town they use because it just has that sense of familiarity, I myself have lived and grew up in places like Kingston Falls. And the music is great as it's by one of my favorite movie composers Jerry Goldsmith, that theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time.<br/><br/>The characters are great from the creatures like Gizmo whom is just cute both physically but mainly in personality, you just want to hug and keep the little guy close. His character is a bit mischievous but has just this unending innocence as he just wants to have fun. Really love how he is fascinated and slightly influence by pop culture which makes the creature relatable because that's like with any of us: as we see him watch some racing film staring Clark Gable that really gets Gizmo interested in driving a car of his own which he of course does near the end.<br/><br/>Stripe and the Gremlins, their one of my favorite fictional villains and monsters. Their just fun villains because despite how much trouble and chaos they cause which is what they practically thrive on they just love to have fun. From scarfing down food and candy, playing video games, to watching Snow White. This sort of gives the Gremlins a bit of relatablity because these are the kind of things we love doing the most with our lives.<br/><br/>However what also drives the movie are the human characters, their actually well rounded and a bit three dimensional which makes us care for them and feel like what they do and go though in this ordeal matters.<br/><br/>Billy's dad is great, his character may have been a partial influence for Steve Urkel as he is an inventor but unfortunately not a very successful one because despite how creative his inventions are they don't work. But that never gets him down, he keeps trying because he passionate about his role it's one of the things he does best in life.<br/><br/>Kate is also great, I'll admit I had a crush on actress Pheobe Cates when I was a kid. She's that girl next door kind of person, whom is sweet but also really sympathetic because she isn't having the easiest time as she is struggling both professionally and personally.<br/><br/>But of course my favorite human character is Billy, I really like this protagonist because I can really relate to the guy. We see he's doesn't really have all the breaks but he has big dreams, as he is an artist he is constantly drawing and he's a fan of graphic novels/comic books, it's like with me I'm into comic books/graphic novels also and I constantly write. So he's hopping to be a comic book artist or in some profession where he can do one of the things he does best in life to be somebody, all he needs is a chance to find a way to step up. You can say the predicament he's in is that chance in one hell of a way, because we see him actually stepping up becoming somebody a hero.<br/><br/>There are lots of great scenes, one favorite scene of mine which is Billy's mom confortation with the Gremlins which I thought was suspenseful fun and of course it had my favorite Gremlin kill which was death by Microwave, it was gross but cool seeing the Gremlin just explode like bad leftovers. That bar room scene which is hilarious because it plays out like a giant Mad Magazine or Where's Waldo comic illustration.<br/><br/>So if your a horror fan and love Christmas then this is your party, and happy holidays.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","A small cinema nearby showed this last night, it was the first time I have watched this since I was a kid, and the first time ever in a cinema, and enjoyed it a bit more now than I did then. <br/><br/>Playing off the idea of gremlins wreaking havoc on unsuspecting people (like that old Bugs Bunny cartoon did, and the Terror At 40.000 Feet episode of The Twilight Zone) this shows a sickeningly cute little creature multiplying and mutating into a mischievous little grotesqueries, who, well, wreak havoc on unsuspecting people in a Wonderful Life-like suburb on Christmas Eve. <br/><br/>The town and its people are straight out of a Hallmark greeting card, quite a contrast to the gooey, slimy effects. As naive, childlike Billy, Zach Galligan is good, but also an odd character, old enough to work at a bank and go to a bar, yet he lives in his parents' attic and read comic books with 12 years old Corey Feldman. The mother has a great confrontation with a couple of the little freaks in her kitchen, and manages to use the moronic appliances built by her well meaning, yet dim, inventor-husband to kill them. Also, early in the film, a sign outside the bank reads something to the effect of ""Plan for the future"", which is most amusing because Back To The Future was partly filmed at the same locations as this, and even features that small supporting character, Frances Lee McCain ."

","Gremlins (1984): Dir: Joe Dante / Cast: William Ragsdale, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, Dick Miller, Polly Holiday: Creative little monster comedy about small brown and white furry creatures with bat ears called Mogwai. It regards failure of technology and opens with Hoyt Axton playing a struggling inventor roaming Chinatown for a Christmas gift for his son. The store keeper refuses the sale but the owner's son sell the Mogwai Gizmo with three rules. First, do not expose them to bright light because it will kill them. Second, do not get them wet because they will multiply. Third, do not feed them after midnight because they will cocoon and become nasty slimy green monsters. Director Joe Dante brings the same humour and horror that he applied successfully to The Howling. Unfortunately the violence should not be subject to children whom it seems to appeal to. William Ragsdale plays Billy, Gizmo's new owner. He is an artist and works at the bank where he is sighted with ridicule by the ruthless Mrs. Deagle. Phoebe Cates plays his girlfriend who gives reasons for disliking Christmas. Axton is hilarious as the loving father yet failed inventor including his Bathroom Buddy. Dick Miller steals scenes as the drunken Mr. Futterman. Polly Holiday plays the ruthless Mrs. Deagle. Creature effects are inventive with a nifty community that envisions prosperity despite the mess.

","Judging by its horror comedy reputation, I didn't expect to like it at all. Mostly it is not much of a horror. Yes, there are some horror elements, but mostly it is a light hearted and funny movie about some cute monsters with a frenetic pace.<br/><br/>That is maybe one of my complaints. Maybe it could have gone a darker route. I guess Spielberg's involvement eliminates any chance of there being a darker edge to the movie. Instead it is a somewhat funny movie. I did like one thing though. It starts out as a very corny movie with really sickly sweet characters. Then it finally stops messing around with all the cuteness and gets going with the action.<br/><br/>Once it starts with the action, then anything goes. Woman in wheelchair being thrown out, explosions and so on. There is never a boring moment with all the comedy that is going on. Especially the gremlin smoking three cigarettes and another one collapsing after drinking so much alcohol! Obviously with all this stuff, any of the remaining horror elements are gone. I didn't complain since it was so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>The water reproduction aspect was not a strong point of the movie. Frankly this could easily get out of hand. I am not sure how anybody could have prevented the gremlins from multiplying. The gremlins that cut wires and did other intelligent things were not able to multiply enough to beat Billy and his family. That is not exactly believable. Maybe they should have had another reason.<br/><br/>But overall these absurdities don't matter since it is so much fun to watch! I liked it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I saw this back when I was eight, on Christmas Eve, and I loved it immediately, and just recently watched it a second time. I'm not one to buy into all that ""jolly Christmas cheer"" crud but this movie surprised me with its comedy, originality, soundtrack and acting.<br/><br/>Billy Peltzer is a student (not sure whether college or high school), who works at a bank and likes his colleague, Kate. They work at a strict bank and Billy is always being harassed by a dumpy old crone, Mrs. Deagle, although she makes it look like Billy's dog is to blame. During the holidays, Deagle is twice as nasty, from refusing to give money to a mom with two hungry kids to telling Billy that she'll put his dog in a spin dryer on high heat.<br/><br/>A few days before Christmas, Billy is given a strange otherworldly pet from his inventor father, something he got in Chinatown called a mogwai. Billy names the mogwai Gizmo (no idea why), and things are looking up for him. He even asks Kate out on a date and she accepts. However, Gizmo gets water on him, and somehow it makes him reproduce instantly with a gang of evil mogwais. After they are fed after midnight, they soon become gremlins, monsters that wreak havoc on the entire town.<br/><br/>Just pointing out because I'm tired of hearing about how cute and adorable Gizmo is, I hated Gizmo, thought it looked like a messed up anthropomorphic Furby puppet. It was more the story I really enjoyed, and the dangerous but comedic little pranks the gremlins come up with. I also really loved the soundtrack, it was pretty catchy but not too dorky. The acting was great, although I mistook Billy Peltzer as being acted by the actor of Mario from The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane instead of the real actor, Zach Galligan.<br/><br/>I think it's an appropriate film for kids, no worse than anything on TV today. But IF YOU'RE A PARENT I SUGGEST WATCHING IT YOURSELF FIRST TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR KID. I think it was originally intended to be a film for adults. Kate's story about how she lost her father on Christmas was also very disturbing, not scary, just incredibly disturbing.<br/><br/>My only complaint was that the ""mischievously cute"" portrayal of the gremlins, especially in the bar scene, was a little too much, and very cheesy to the point where it wasn't even funny anymore, just annoying. Aside from that, Gremlins is a great movie, hilarious, adventurous, strange and creepy. If you want to celebrate Christmas with a movie but you hate the trash like Prancer or All Dogs Christmas Carol, check this one out!"

","I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. It's a film that fails to take advantage of its cool premise, that makes you wish they had done better rather than spoiling a good idea. A boy inadvertently breaks three important rules concerning his new pet and unleashes a horde of malevolently mischievous monsters on a small town. This is well worth seeing. With a little more life this would have been a great movie. There isn't much else to say besides, go see it for yourself! I thought this film was fantastic in some ways and terrible in others. The flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are pretty unpredictable. I was lucky enough to see this film for free on television."

","There are so many types of monsters around in the film industry. Godzilla and King Kong are the type of monsters that are massively big and known to cause terror to large cities. You can also say a monster is something like Dracula, Freddy Krueger or just a murdering villain. In my mind, you can't always put a type of monster into a certain genre and this is a type of discussion that could last for a while. <br/><br/>Fitting into that long discussion should be the 1984 film Gremlins, a monster film in many ways. Inventor Randy Pultzer (Hoyt Axton) while in Chinatown gets an animal known as a mogwai as a early Christmas present for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). A mogwai could be described as very small and fury creature who's owner must observe strict rules regarding their handling or negative consequences will occur. For example, they can't be fed after midnight, can't be exposed to bright lights nor can they come into contact with water. If these rules are not observed basically you get ""monster terror"".<br/><br/>To say a mogwai is one certain type of creature would wrong. A mogwai is a type of creature that could appear in a Saturday morning cartoon or a family film but once those mogwai handling rules are broken, he turns into the exact opposite who could be something very R rated. It is then a type of creature wanting to cause harm to the town and also a very ugly looking thing. The actions scenes involving them interestingly combine horror and comedy. The scenes involving them are quite fun and also ahead of it's time with some great special effects.<br/><br/>That said, there are some plot holes in these scenes. Being set at Christmas time, many of the action scenes are set in the snow. So how can the gremlins run through snow as they do when you know snow is filled with water which is against the mogwai rules? You can't feed a mogwai past a certain time but the film gives us no clue to what time zone we are in and if you think about it, anywhere in the world it's past midnight somewhere?<br/><br/>As any good film should do, this film give the cast many things to do. Billy is our leader and main fighter for the town. Phoebe Cates playing Kate Beringer is the Billy's love interest. She is very likable and also very sexy as always. Randall Peltzer is the father who I'm sure feels some sort of blame towards the creatures creating havoc in his town and his character does have some funny moments with his strange and worthless inventions. Even Corey Feldman shows up as the character Pete who is like your little brother in that he is highly annoying and just seems to roam around without direction but you like him though.<br/><br/>Gremlins apparently was one of the movies which introduced the PG-13 rating. It is a film that in some respects defines 1980's era films. It is a film that I enjoyed more when I was a little boy but the teenager in me still found something in it that I liked. Gremlins would surely work for a modern family audience today. This is a film that is as powerful then as it is now. Monster film joy."

","The star of ''Gremlins'' is none other than the ""mogwai"", a small, furry, fictitious creature that looks something like a cuddly teddy bear with the ears of a rabbit, a Bambilike nose, eyes as round and deep and dark as glass buttons, a sweet disposition and a physical nature more unstable than hydrogen gas.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, when the ""mogwai"" is introduced, there are the three warnings that come with it: keep the creature away from direct light, never to allow it to have contact with water and, above all, never feed it after midnight.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is the best. That's when we meet the little gremlins, which are unbearably cute. They have impossibly big eyes, they're cuddly and friendly, and they would make ideal pets except for the fact that they hate bright lights, should not be allowed to get wet, and must never be fed after midnight. And in the second half of the movie, after the gremlins have gotten wet, been fed after midnight, etc., they turn into truly hateful creatures that look like the monster.<br/><br/>This is just like a fable: a lesson for kids to learn about responsibility and the issues that comes with owning a new pet, especially one that is uncommon in household society. <br/><br/>The movie exploits every trick in the monster-movie book. We have scenes where monsters pop up in the foreground, and others where they stalk us in the background, and others when they drop into the frame and scare the Shinola out of everybody. And the movie itself turns nasty, especially in a scene involving a monster that gets slammed in a microwave oven.<br/><br/>It's a clever twist in the following aspects of movie-going clichés: Christmas, families, monsters, retail stores, movies, boogeymen. Highly recommendable and fun to enjoy!"
"Red-Barracuda","7","0","1","27 December 2013"," One of the best Christmas movies
","Gremlins is essentially a kids movie for adults. This factor has probably got a lot to do with its producer, Steven Spielberg, who pulled a very similar trick with the earlier Poltergeist. Where that movie was directed by The Texas Chain Saw Massacre director Tobe Hooper, Gremlins was helmed by Joe Dante director of The Howling. But both Poltergeist and Gremlins feel like Spielberg movies and the influence of the horror directors is very watered down. I don't think Spielberg was a passive influence as producer; he seems to have been more like the actual director.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, Gremlins focuses on an everyman suburban family in a fantastical situation, something Spielberg seems to have had an affinity with. While it is a horror movie, it's never exactly disturbing or frightening. Having said that, it is an odd combination that is occasionally jarring, such as a kitchen sequence where three Gremlins are dispatched of quickly and gorily – one is stabbed to death, another is chopped up in a blender and a third is frazzled in a microwave oven. Moments like that, along with scenes of the Gremlins drinking, smoking, killing and flashing – led to it being problematic with some parents back in the day who thought it was going to be like E.T., which is hardly surprising seeing as the cute and cuddly Mogwai is pretty much in Ewok territory. But really, it's the evil Gremlins who make this movie entertaining. They constantly laugh along to their evil deeds and generally act bad just for the hell of it. What helps matters a lot is that the creature effects are very impressive. Despite these monsters being more or less puppets, they are very well rendered indeed.<br/><br/>The family that the film is based around are typical enough. The father is an inventor, or more truthfully a very bad inventor. His long suffering family are forced to try out his proto-type inventions around the house. This leads to a few funny scenes where the devices function disastrously. Early on its made abundantly clear that there are three hugely important rules connected to owning Mogwais – don't expose them to bright lights, don't get them wet and don't feed them after midnight (I always wondered even as a kid that that last rule was a little disconcertingly vague, I mean it's never exactly specified when you can actually start feeding them again!). Anyway the son, alongside his sidekick Corey Feldman, manages to break these rules in about twenty-five minutes. They don't hose the Mogwai down after feeding him pizza at 1am in the morning with a strobe light operating in the background but their idiotic actions really aren't a million miles away from this. But, hey, moronic behaviour is a very useful plot device for a horror film and it does allow for the mayhem to kick into full gear.<br/><br/>Gremlins is certainly one of the most consistently entertaining Christmas movies. The holiday season backdrop actually adds quite a lot to the feel of the film to be fair. It's a pretty dumb movie but made with a lot of skill, which is quite a good combination in the final analysis."

","Back when I was a little tyke, I was never allowed to see Gremlins because the little critters were deemed ""satanic"" and it wasn't until I was in my 20s, or a decade or more past the movie's release, I finally saw it the first time.<br/><br/>This re-viewing is only my second time and I have to say, I wasn't/am not the biggest fan, but I sure did like and admire the attention to detail, creativity, humor and the fact it's an roundabout remake (or, homage?) to one of my favorite monster movies, The Blob.<br/><br/>The odd thing about this flick was that it started off as a comedy with tons of sight gags, cute and imaginative scenes and nods to multiple of movies, including producer Steven Spielberg's own movies. Butthen it turned dark, disturbing, actually gruesome and I'm shocked it only got slapped with a PG-Rating. Granted, in 1984, the PG-13 was just coming about, and though Rated-R would've been harsh and a box-office kill, PG was really generous.<br/><br/>A little Mogwai creature is brought home by a comically horrible inventor father and given to his way-older-looking-than-he-was son (the actor was 20, but looked 30,) but with three simple rules: it cannot touch water, it doesn't like bright lights or the deathly sunlight and don't feed it after midnight. Naturally, the (supposedly) teen son breaks all of these rules and after the water multiples the Mogwai, or the better and cuter name for him: Gizmo and they're all fed after midnight, with the exception of Gizmo, they metamorphose into what my mother referred to as little Satan demons, and attack the town. It's up to man-boy, his equally older-looking teen girlfriend and Gizmo to stop the madness.<br/><br/>Oh, those rules. While simple and a fun addition to this well-written script, the restrictions/instructions made no sense, with the exception of the bright light. Water is everywhere and in almost every – if not every, food and liquid. So what would you ever feed it? If they elaborated, like: Don't get water on or in it, but you can feed him dehydrated foods And about this midnight rule<br/><br/>Which midnight? (They actually bring this flaw up in the sequel, but for this movie's sake...) Is this a curse and is only good for the time zone the Mogwai's in? And it's never, ever, brought up ""UNTIL WHEN."" Again, elaborate: Don't feed it after midnight, to say, six in the morning.<br/><br/>I might be looking in too deep in a movie that was supposed to be half light/half horror, all entertainment, but I seriously couldn't get past those open-ended and vague rules.<br/><br/>Okay, fine, I could get past them – eventually, and I did have a good time in this totally 80s movie. Overall, it's not a bad flick, and the invention of both Gizmo and the eventual Satan's little evil fiends, was worth the watch. Especially, cute little Gizmo. Recommended if you haven't seen it, or if you want to experience 80s nostalgia. (That is, if you were alive thenOh, I'll shut up now.)<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Many years following, and equally since, my only other viewing of this movie, I was with someone in a dark room and he flicked on the lights. Since my eyes needed and didn't get split second adjustment, without thought and only on instinct, I shouted out, but with a tiny voice: ""Bright lights! Bright lights!"" He couldn't stop laughing and though he remembered it, I couldn't even recall where I got that line. Now, I appreciate it more after seeing it a second time."

The comedy really works the way so many other movies have tried to work (and failed). Its squadron of knock-offs are entertaining but not as good, My favorite being Critters. Critters also works but still, it was not as good a movie. The others being: Ghoulies, Ghoulies II, Ghoulies III, Ghoulies IV, Munchies, and I guess Troll. Gremlins also had a sequel, which declined in quality. I think it could have a 3rd installment as long as it didn't go computer animation.

","Gremlins is considered a classic film from the 80s with fans from many generations and loved for its violence and humour and helped forced the creation of the PG-13 rating in America. But it a film that has not aged as well as some people think it has, having a jarring tone between the cutey humour to the dark humour and horror elements. For a film of the time it had great special effects, using animatronics and stop-motion animation and the sequence when we see the Gremlins get killed is gory fun (it was the best in the film). But Gremlins was not funny enough, either relying on slapstick and physical humour to misjudged dark comedy which made me more concerned about how many people died or were injured.

Peltzer is a putz who sells gizmos, hence when he stumbles onto the furry ball of fun that is a Mogwai, he sees it fit to classify it as another little doohickey that does more harm than good. And therein lies your theme. Gremlins is essentially about man vs. nature and when nature is done destroying technology, it goes after the man and it strikes him right where he lives ...at the bar and the department store. Putzler brings Giz home to his son Billy who immediately gets to breaking all the rules. When Gizmo gets wet, he gives birth to a mischievous group of Mogsters, among them, Stripe. Stripe is a sadistic stalwart who rules over the quartet of Moggies and immediately makes it known to Gizmo that he rejects any familial obligation. Whether Gizmo qualifies as Stripe's father or brother is not quite clear. Billy decides that it's a good idea to give one of Gizmo's siblings to a science teacher so he can poke it, prod it and keep it locked in a cage. Time to break another rule as Billy feeds the Moggles after midnight. After that, Xmas trees attack, a Gremlin goes goo in the microwave and it's a grim grempocalypse for Kingston Falls. The Gremlins multiply and once they get tired of reeking merry mayhem and turning electric chairlifts into catapults, it's off to the cinema to sing along to Snow White. Unfortunately, Billy and girlfriend Kate decide they're gonna poop on the party and ruin the movie (the Snow White movie). Can't give away anymore. Watch it! Love it! Follow the rules!"

","Zach Galligan, Hoyt Axton, Phoebe Cates, Frances Lee McCain, Polly Holliday, Judge Reinhold, Corey Feldman and Dick Miller star in Joe Dante's 1984 horror comedy. This begins with inventor, Rand Peltzer (Axton) buying his son, Billy (Galligan) a cute creature called a Mogwai for Christmas. He learns the important rules of not getting it wet, keeping it out of sunlight and never feeding it after midnight. The rest of the film takes place in his town, Kingston Falls where we meet Billy who works as a bank teller and Cates (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) plays his co-worker & love-interest, Kate. Soon, Rand gives Billy the Mogwai named, Gizmo and explains the 3 rules to him. The rules are broken when Gizmo accidentally gets wet multiplying mischievous monsters led by their leader, Stripe that begin wreaking havoc. Billy, Kate and Gizmo try to stop them before they destroy the whole town. McCain (Back to the Future) plays Billy's mother, Holliday (Alice) plays ruthless, rich woman, Ruby Deagle, Reinhold (Beverly Hills Cop) plays Billy's obnoxious co-worker, Gerald, Feldman (The Goonies) plays Billy's young friend, Pete and Miller (The Howling) plays Billy's Neighbor, Murray Futterman. I've liked this since I was a kid, the cast is great, Chris Walas did a terrific job creating the Gremlins, Howie Mandel (Little Monsters) is great as the voice of Gizmo and who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. I recommend this 80's classic that's one of Dante's best."

","The early 1980's were an furtive time for American genre cinema. Of course Steven Spielberg had his hand in most of those pies, with his name emblazoned above all the film titles. Whilst this is particularly annoying, the fact of the matter is, he did get some great projects made, such as Poltergeist (1982) and Back to the Future (1985) et al; plus a little gem of a horror-comedy written by then unknown, Chris Columbus and directed by Roger Corman luminary Joe Dante: Gremlins. As with many of the genre films made at the time, their influence of 1950's science fiction was obvious (and of course the film makers of the time would have grown up in the first decade of the popularisation of television). And Gremlins is no different, with a range of references, blinding obvious. In two scenes for example, we see on television screens, two iconic movies from the past, It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956): The former film is represented by the picture postcard image of wholesome Americana - a Norman Rockwell painting showing a quaint little ""village"" square. Kingston Falls is the setting, and the time of year is Christmas.<br/><br/>The story is a simple tale of a father, Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) purchasing something ""different"" for his son, Billy (Zach Galligan). On his travels as an inventor and salesman, Rand stumbles across a small basement shop in Chinatown, where he buys an unknown species of animal, the overwhelmingly cute Mogwai. However, the ""pet"" comes with three very important rules: Never expose him to light, especially sunlight; never get him wet; and never feed him after midnight. Unfortunately, two of these rules are broken in a series of misdemeanours, and eventually unleash the anarchistic monsters of the films title. Of course the idea of a gremlin is no new thing, as is stated by Mr Futterman (played by Dante regular, and always brilliant, Dick Miller), the gremlin was a creature that had a fetish for interrupting the workings of technology during World War II. In fact the first recorded use of Gremlin was in a 1929 poem written for the men of the Royal Air Force stationed in Malta. But I digress.<br/><br/>Needless to say, once the gremlins are unleashed - led by Stripe - the quiet town is turned into chaos, disrupted beyond belief of Christmas Eve. The scaly green monsters cause car accidents by tampering with traffic lights; the local property owner and general icon of evil, Mrs Deagle (Polly Holliday), the seasons Scrooge in female form, is sent flying out of her window on a chair lift. You get the idea. The job of thwarting the monstrous tykes is left to Billy, Gizmo (the Mogwai - as if you didn't know!), and Kate, Billy's new girlfriend (played by the stunning Phoebe Cates).<br/><br/>Released on the same weekend as another '80's comedy classic, Ghostbusters, the film became a bit of an issue. Here was a Christmas film, like Ghostbusters, that mixed comedy with horror, but was packaged as a kids film. The massive campaign of merchandising was everywhere. From cuddly toys to Pez dispensers, every kid was able to participate in the ideas of the film. In America, the film was released in the equivalent PG rating, causing problems when young children saw it. This film eventually led to the MPAA (The Motion Picture Association of America) created the PG-13 rating. In the UK the film was released as a 15; therefore, I was unable to see the film at the cinema (you can't imagine how badly I wanted to see it, after all as an 8 year old, seeing the trailers on TV, there were little monsters in it!). And of course the BBFC (British Board of Film Certification) didn't act on this (despite a huge media frenzy), and would not create the 12 certificate until 1989's Batman.<br/><br/>The film could be read as American fear of ""foreign"" technology. The Mogwai/Gremlin do originate form China (how ironic they are soon to be the worlds super power), but the duality of a cute creature manifesting itself as a anarchic monster, is representative of that view of the orient: A seemingly traditional continent complete with archaic practises, that also produce some of the most advance technology around. Maybe too hard a pill to swallow from the land that brought us Hollywood!<br/><br/>I genuinely loved this film when I was a kid (I did manage to see it before the video release on a very bad VHS pirate video - shhh!), and I have to say that it has not lost any of it's charm, humour, and fun. The film holds so many iconic images probably for most of my generation. Well, we did collect the stickers to complete the Panini album. And the sweets; the dolls; the T-Shirts etc, etc etc..... Excellent Christmas fare!<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","4","3 October 2011"," Cute Creatures Make the Movie
","Gremlins (1984) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Cute Steven Spielberg-produced horror-comedy about a teen (Zach Galligan) whose given a ""creature"" for Christmas but there are three rules that you must follow. He breaks one of the rule by putting water on it, which makes more of the creatures pop up. He breaks the most important rule by feeding them after midnight and soon some ugly, green and slimy gremlins come to cause trouble. As with many of Joe Dante's early pictures, this one here is not only an homage to earlier monster movies but it's also quite clever in how it shows this affection towards older movies while at the same time trying to take the material to the next level. With a screenplay by Chris Columbus, direction by Dante and someone like Spielberg as a producer I must admit that I was expecting a lot more out of this blockbuster. There's no question that there are many good things going in this film but I thought that way too much detail was paid to the human characters and this meant that whenever the monsters weren't on the screen then things just slowed down to the point where the entire film crashes. There's no doubt that the main attraction are going to be the cute hairy creatures and the ugly monsters. You can tell that the screenplay really wanted to build up these creatures and especially when you consider how much screen time the furry guys get in the first half of the movie. The best moments of the movie happen early on as we're introduced to small town America and get to witness a part of their lives, which I'm sure most viewers can relate to. This includes the always suspicious neighbor (played by Dick Miller) and the rich old woman who hates everyone but herself. Some of the best moments happen early on when we see a few of the directions these two characters take. The problem is that our main guy, his girl (Phoebe Cates) and everyone are rather underwritten and don't come off nearly as charming as the creatures. The screenplay is also rather basic in terms of any type of story as we meet the creatures, they grow, they attack and then its over. The story mainly goes for silly jokes that really weren't that well-written and this includes a rather silly sequence where the gremlins take over a bar and go crazy. I'm still curious where the gremlins got their clothes and weapons but that's another story. I thought Galligan was pretty good in his role and there's no question that Cates can bring some energy to the screen. Seeing Miller is always fun and we also get other familiar faces like Corey Feldman, Harry Carey, Jr. and Keye Luke. GREMLINS is certainly cute enough for what it is but I'd stop a little short of calling it an actual good movie."
"jerekra","8","0","1","6 January 2011"," Never feed them after midnight.
","Gremlins is a highly entertaining film from the eighties. It is one of a kind as far as comedy/horror films go.<br/><br/>A boy named Billy receives a Mogwai(little furry big eared creature) for Christmas that he names Gizmo. There are three rules for Mogwai, don't feed them after midnight, don't expose to bright lights, and don't get them wet. Gizmo accidentally does get wet and this results in more Mogwai being created. When the new Mogwai eat after midnight they turn into a larger reptilian like state that goes on a rampage and start to wreck havoc.<br/><br/>Overall this film has a great overall story. It flows somewhat as a family film, then becomes a sort of horror and comedy film. Very unique in that it has some many genres with it.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good. Phoebe Cates and Zack Galligan play great lead human protagonists. Both are characters that you cheer for and can relate to. Howie Mandel is great as the voice for Gizmo and legendary voice actor Frank Welker is outstanding as he provides for the voice of the villain Stripe.<br/><br/>The Gremlins themselves are what makes the film. They are just troublesome creatures that want to have a good time. However I do feel that Stripe and Gizmo are the only mogwai that stand out. But those two are the two that make this film enjoyable. Stripe is one of the better non human villains from a film ever.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film. I recommend it."

","Throughout the 80's cinema goers experienced some incredible movies and were treated to some very special moments and Gremlins firmly cements itself into the top draw of the era.<br/><br/>While Gremlins is a ""Very"" black comedy it still appeals to most people. Whether it's the scary side, or the cute side (provided by Gizmo) the film delights and scares people still to this day.<br/><br/>After viewing both of the films again very recently with my girlfriend, who has never seen either before, it was great to see the reaction of a new viewer watching 25 years after its release.<br/><br/>Very well directed, shame about some of the acting and some of the music pieces are haunting.<br/><br/>Now what makes it so special?

Having both Gremlins and Gremlins 2 in your DVD/Blu-ray collection is a must, if not i urge you to pick them up! Especially if you have never seen them!

","there have been many movie of comedy and horror combined. such as ghoustbusters or the gingerbread man. But only one film takes the ability to scare and do insane stuff ant the same time. Thats why i am completely bonkers for gremlins. The gremlins may be monsters, but they are monsters of the most important ingredient for movie that we hardly see...CHAOS! That is what a monster movie needs. Not some crappy story about a guy who goes into your dreams, or was dead and some how came back. I have a word for that....overused OvErUsEd OVERUSED!!!! And gremlins really take the cake when it comes to chaos. The story is very ORIGINAL the characters are lovable as they are hateable. I don't care much for all sudden deaths but gremlins are BARBARIC! the real lucky death for everyone is Mrs.deagles death. The gremlins shoot her through a window.....no they didn't shoot her THEY LAUNCHED HER!!!!!<br/><br/>Also the thing that entourage's me is the theme song. It has a circusy scary and crazy feeling that no movie composer can do anymore because of audience demands. Also the fact they got voice acting legend FRANK WELLKER to do some gremlins and stripe. Frank does many voices but none is creepier than stripe.<br/><br/>overall(s) in short: i haven't seen a movie like this and hopefully i will in the future....."
"pantaallou","7","0","2","1 August 2009"," Some ""serious"" movies don't last in time. Some fun movies do.
","I recently re-watched Gremlins and loved it! I have no idea why this isn't considered a masterpiece of the horror/comedy genre. It is a pleasure to watch in 2009 so it should have been seen as groundbreaking back in 1984. Perhaps that is an overstatement but this movie is great entertainment.<br/><br/>The structure is very smart. First, we observe the life in this small town where everyone and everything is so nice and innocent. Except an old lady but she is a caricature so she is not really scary.<br/><br/>The central family is as sweet and nice as you would expect. The father is an ambitious inventor (In the ""some day I will be successful"" kind of way) and he decides to buy a little creature as a Christmas present for his son. There is probably no biologist in the world who is aware of this species' existence but who cares? The town is sweet and innocent, the family is sweet and innocent and guess what? The little creature is even more sweet and innocent. The reason I called the structure smart is because there is a gradual change in the mood and things start becoming slowly darker and creepier. There are some rules concerning the little creature (Alright, they call it Gizmo) which must be followed but do you really think everything goes according to plan? The rules are broken one by one and here we are. The Gremlins are finally in the picture. You want me to describe them? Analogy: Gremlins are to Gizmo what Cain is to Abel.<br/><br/>The great thing about the Gremlins is that they are not just bad. They are not pure evil. Their habits bare a resemblance to those of regular people. They are evil alright. But they are like the evil in all of us. Our dark side. They like to drink, smoke and make a mess. Alright they also kill people as well as one another but there wouldn't be a movie without that.<br/><br/>It is so much fun to watch these creatures laugh hysterically at everything. Their sole purpose in life is to enjoy themselves especially in expense of others. Not very extraterrestrial, wouldn't you think? The acting is great but only by the Gremlins. I'm kidding. But not so much. The girl is good but the boy is not very charismatic. The others, well, not important.<br/><br/>The music is very effective. Innocence alternates with creepiness in a way that fits the film perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie certainly deserves not to be forgotten. All people between 12 and 30 will have a great time watching it."

The deaths are actually humorous (such as when a mean lady gets launched out her window by the Gremlins.) and so is the movie.

Billy does what he can but accidentally gets Gizmo wet which makes it multiply other Mogwais and also accidentally fed the other Mogwaii except Gizmo after midnight. It somehow transforms the cuddly creatures into vicious and intelligent reptilian ghouls that start attacking the town of Kingston Falls.<br/><br/>An original and brilliant horror fantasy from Joe Dante and producer Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest movies of the 80's! the film became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1984 and of all time thanks to the magic of it's original screenplay by Chris Columbus, great acting and excellent creature effects. It also incorporates satire and dark humor with gruesomeness, the film co-stars Dick Miller, Corey Feldman, and Phoebe Cates with appearance by Chuck Jones. Along with ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" the following year, it drew big time controversy among parents who thought the film was too violent for kids and the MPAA created PG-13 that year. Chris Walas's special effects are just outstanding with the lovable fur-balls and the not-so-lovable monsters that made them memorable.<br/><br/>The film has been imitated throughout the years until the early 90's with films like ""Ghoulies"", ""Munchies"", ""Evil Toons"", ""Beasties"", ""Troll"", ""Elves"", ""Spookies"" and the worst one of them all ""Hobgoblins"". Although ""Critters 1 & 2"" were exceptions cause those were fun movies in their own right.

","This was one of my favorite movies since I saw it as a little kid. I'm pretty sure if my Dad had actually seen what happened in the movie, he would have taken it away from me, but it was safely hidden behind a PG rating, so he didn't mind me watching it (my Mom was much cooler and we would always watch it together). Anyway, I thought it was great then, and I think it's great now. I just re-watched it yesterday, and it's still amazing. What's great is how well director Joe Dante combines all sorts of elements; horror, comedy, romance, etc. Really, I'd call this the most twisted Christmas film ever, even worse than Bad Santa. Yes, they're different, and yes, that movie was one of the sickest films ever (but hilarious), but what makes Gremlins so sick is how it starts of so harmless and cutesy. Bad Santa made no denial that it wasn't for children, but Gremlins tricks you. As it starts, the last thing you expect to be is scared. A peaceful, snowy hometown, kind citizens, a loving dad who brings home a REALLY cute little creature named Gizmo. What's scary about that? Then, after you've safely settled in and are comfortable, Dante pulls the carpet out under you feet and the story turns into one about ugly monsters blowing up in microwaves or being killed in a blender. Dante actually did horror/comedy well. It seems like most movies that claim to be horror/comedies are actually just silly comedies with lots of blood and guts which aren't in the least bit scary. Here, the movie is blood-chillingly scary in scenes, and gut bustingly funny in others. For instance, the scene with the Gremlins wreaking havoc at Dorry's tavern is just plain silly and funny, but the scene with Frances Lee McCain searching the house and finding the creatures in her kitchen is just REALLY scary and creepy. Plus, the acting's great and the special effects are amazing. It makes me sad to think that if any other movie like this was made, they'd use bad CGI that's not at all realistic. People mtalk about how much more advanced movies are today, but I disagree. Which is easier to believe is real: the Gremlins in this movie or Yoda in Star Wars Episode Two? This movie was follwed by a terrific sequel that threw the horror out the window and made no denial to being a flat out comedy, and one of the smartest and most entertaining ever. Don't miss that one, either."

GREMLINS, for its time, was truly groundbreaking. It was E.T., except with really rotten friends and relatives. Well-paced and directed Joe Dante, with unique performances by Zach Galligan and the gorgeous Phoebe Cates, GREMLINS deftly treads in and out of suspense/horror and comedy. (Phoebe Cates' explication of how her father died is still outrageous.) And there are plenty of pitched battles between the good guys and the unruly gremlins to keep the plot moving. Just don't show this movie to young kids around Christmastime. This special edition has a lot of goodies that true GREMLINS fans will enjoy, and the quality is top-notch. Just don't get it wet. I've loved Gremlins since I was a wee girl of only about 5 or 6, and previously my only copy of the film was a tattered VHS, worn out and almost grainy from repeated viewings. I purchased Gremlins on DVD and was astonished at how beautiful the transfer from film to DVD was. The details are crystal clear and the sound is impeccable. Certain small visual details of the movie were totally lost on my old VHS, but stand out gorgeously on this DVD. The movie itself doesn't need further praise from me - it's fun and funny, gory and touching at the same time. My personal favorite scene is when all of the Gremlins are in the movie theater, singing ""Hi Ho"" right along with the dwarfs in Snow White. The special effects are amazing for the time, the score was perfect, and Gizmo never ceases to be adorable. A must-buy."

Then, I found the magic of slasher movies.<br/><br/>Well, once I could stomach freddy VS jason, I decided to give It a second chance. I watched it, laughed until I felt like I was going to puke, watched it again, bought the second one and well... I became a gremlins fan. The only problem with this movie is the fact that it is made out to look like a children's film (don't believe me, watch the trailer). It really should be released with a more mature rating (pg-13 maybe...) for those violent scenes.<br/><br/>But if you have a good stomach and get joy from the pain and suffering of fictional characters, you'll love this movie!"

Gizmo was a household name in the 80's and most kids had numerous toys and teddy's of him. Snow White got somewhat revived as it was the creatures' favorite film and that's just funny. Many hilarious moments are here as the Gremlins start chewing up the little town and wrecking more havoc than George W. Bush could with all his arsenal (Mrs. Deegle's fate is, as said before, a classic).<br/><br/>Gremlins was so good when I was a kid but you notice some other things as well when you see it as an adult. The level of violence is surprisingly brutal and the little critters are very, very nasty. This is nasty humor all the way. And my god is Zach Galligan a horrible actor. I thought David Duchovny was the most expressionless actor around but I was wrong. There are also some very downbeat moments thrown in here which could so easily have been edited out (a point which Gremlins 2 actually made fun of).<br/><br/>Overall the film completely deserves the classic stamp though. Gizmo is priceless, the critters even more priceless and it's wickedly funny with many hidden gems (ever noticed that time machine at the convention!).

There's a box, with a extremely adorable creature named a Mogwai, singing an equally as cute song. Although the owner(Keye Luke) refuses to sell Peltzer the Mogwai, his grandson(John Louie), says different. Before he sells the Mogwai, the boy tells Peltzer 3 rules to follow: 1;don't expose him to bright lights(especially sunlight, it kills him), 2;don't get him wet, and the most important one, NEVER feed him after midnight. While Peltzer isn't the one in this movie who winds up breaking the rules, his son does. After getting his new pet, now called Gizmo(and struggling not to break rule #1), he winds up breaking rules #2 & #3, which as a result forces poor Gizmo to... we'll just say, the title creatures are born and wreak havoc on Billy's hometown, Kingston Falls.

The movie ""Gremlins"" is about a boy named Billy Peltzer. For Christmas, he gets three unusual rules, (Don't get him wet, Don't expose him to light, and never, NEVER,feed him after midnight)and a cuter than cute as a button creature called a mogwai. The Peltzer family names the mogwai Gizmo, and instantly, and accidentally, for that matter, break the bright light rule. Gizmo is shocked for a moment, but recovers in seconds.They learn that bright light hurts Mogwais. The next 15-20 minutes are all just packed with extremely cute stuff that Gizmo and Billy do together. then, the water rule is broken, and Gizmo multiples. The new mogwais are nothing like Gizmo. They just seem meaner than Gizmo(and they all ARE meaner). The new mogwais have a leader mogwai named Stripe. (Stripe has a white puffy Mohawk on his head, so you can tell him apart from the other mogwai.) And finally, the new mogwais trick Billy into feeding them after midnight, and become (you guessed it) Gremlins. The Gremlins are as mean-spirited as they were when they were mogwai! They are still even lead by Stripe! And Stripe still has a puffy, white Mohawk! The only differences between the Gremlins and the evil Mogwais are: Gremlins are slimy and evil and can hurt you, and the mogwai are furry and evil and cannot hurt you (yet). The Gremlins reek havoc,(but worse, MUUUUUCH worse) on the town, which is very funny.<br/><br/>The acting is tremendous and the puppetry is amazing and the movie itself is jaw dropping.

","Gremlins was a great movie. It was much better than I expected, in fact the only reason I saw it was because it was Steven Spielberg and I greatly treasure many of his films i.e. Jaws, E.T.. But yeah, It was a very good movie seven stars, very entertaining but after watching it it leaves me with just one question. Family comedy? Don't get me wrong, I myself didn't mind Gremlins at all, but I saw almost no comedy whatsoever in this film. What I saw was light Horror that sometimes became very gruesome and dark. Such as the kitchen seen when Gremlin guts fly, and the seen when a man and his wife are plowed by a Gremlin driving their own plow. This movie I would not recommend for the whole family, it's just too dark, I don't think that parents want their children watching a teenager almost being hacked to bits by a demon with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>In summary this was an amazingly good movie, I loved it, but the gremlins slaughtering humans and the intense suspense are too much for young children. This movie should have a PG-13 slapped on it, and be watched by a more mature audience."

It takes a sophisticated idea of nasty things coming in pretty boxes and shows it in a way that is most certainly impressive.<br/><br/>Gremlins is not the most artistic movie ever made, but it is most definitely entertaining. After re watching it for a third time after five years, I still laugh at the corny PG jokes and watch intensely as those little creatures tear apart that peaceful town.

Back home in the small American town of Kingston Falls & Randall gives Billy the Mogwai who he calls Gizmo, unfortunately one of Billy's friends Pete (Cory Feldman) spills water on Gizmo which make him reproduce as little Mogwai's pop out of his back. These ones are different to Gizmo, they are mischievous & trick Billy into feeding them after midnight. The next morning & Billy's room is full of slimy green cocoons which eventually hatch & let loose green scaly monsters with big ears & sharp teeth. It's not long before one of them has jumped into the local swimming pool for reproduction purposes & before anyone knows it the entire town is overrun with Gremlins intent on death & destruction. It's up to Billy & his girlfriend Kate (Phoebe Cates) to try & save the day as the local authorities have a hard time believing their story...<br/><br/>Directed by Joe Dante Gremlins is a big budget family orientated horror fantasy film with a strong comedy element & for what it is it isn't too bad at all. The script by Chris Columbus takes a little while to get going as there isn't a green slimy Gremlin until past the 45 minute mark which is a bit long really. When they do show up most of what they get up to is of moral questionalbility with beer drinking, smoking cigarette's, attacking people, causing crashes & playing poker rather than all out blood & gore, in fact not that many people actually die in Gremlins. In a way I'm not sure quite what Gremlins set out to be, a scary horror film with monsters on the rampage or a more family fantasy type film with the sentimental Father Son stuff, the lovable inventor whose inventions never quite work, the highly intelligent family dog who can seemingly understand English, the way the Mogwai's are so cute & in the end Gremlins is half & half with neither element particularly dominating. The gore & violence is relatively restrained & mostly aimed at the Gremlins themselves with a one being sliced up in a meat mincer, one explodes in a microwave, one is decapitated & it's head lands on a fire & there is a cool melting Gremlin at the end. The character's are likable even if their a little overblown & overly comical. With a budget of about $11,000,000 Gremlins is technically very good with that Hollywood polish to it. The special effects are generally very good although don't forget that Gremlins was made way before the advent of CGI so expect lots of puppets & animatronics rather than flashy computer effects. The cinematography, music & production values are great & it is well made throughout. The acting is OK but nothing spectacular. Gremlins is one of those somewhat predictable 'feel good' films made by big studios & at what it sets out to be Gremlins succeeds & is a very good film in it's own right. The slightly slow first half & it's indecision on what it wants to be stops it from obtaining classic status in my eyes but Gremlins is still a fine film & well worth a watch."

","Usually, when we think of Christmas movies, we think of flicks like ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Well, here's a new kind: ""Gremlins"". This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made. Joe Dante - always a director with some neat ideas - couldn't have pulled it off better.<br/><br/>It all begins when inventor Rand Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) buys a furry little creature called ""mogwai"" from a Chinese salesman (Keye Luke). There are three rules about mogwai: 1) Never expose him to bright light (the sun could kill him). 2) Never expose him to water (certainly don't give him a bath). 3) The most important rule of all is never, ever, EVER, under any circumstances, feed him after midnight. So, Rand gives mogwai to his son Billy (Zach Galligan). But, as you might have guessed, the rules get broken, and before long, the little town of Kingston Falls is overrun by mean, green gremlins.<br/><br/>Everything that you love about movies, you're likely to find in ""Gremlins"". Whether it's the inside jokes (a cinema is showing ""A Boy's Life"" and ""Watch the Skies"", the working titles for ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", respectively), the indictment of vicious landlady Ruby Deagle (Polly Holliday), Lynn Peltzer's (Frances Lee McCain) battles with the gremlins, or the overall jab at a ""wholesome American small town"", this is a top-notch thriller/comedy. I'm sure that Phoebe Cates is proud to have gotten an early role in this (she plays Billy's girlfriend Kate Beringer). And since this is a Joe Dante movie, B-movie actor Dick Miller of course gets a role: he plays sour neighbor Murray Futterman.<br/><br/>Maybe this is just me, but I've noticed some similarities between ""Gremlins"" and ""Ghostbusters"". The obvious one is that they're both about things that nobody wants around town, but there's more. They're both plural nouns beginning with ""G"". ""Gremlins"" has 8 letters, ""Ghostbusters"" has 12; 8 and 12 are both divisible by 4. Both movies were released on 8 June 1984 (a year ending with 4, a day divisible by 4).<br/><br/>Oh well, maybe I'm the only one who would even notice that. The point is that this is one great movie, and everyone should see it. 10/10."

When Billy's dad, a struggling inventor, wanders off to Chinatown to get his son a gift, he has no idea what he's in for when he finds a box with a furry little creature named Gizmo. There are some rules surrounding Gizmo: Don't expose him to sunlight, don't feed him after midnight, and don't EVER get him wet. Of course, rules were meant to be broken...<br/><br/>The madness that ensues is, sometimes frightening, sometimes hilarious, and sometimes gross. The violence was enough to help spawn the PG-13 rating. The performances are likable despite a clichéd and a bit silly script, and the film has a nice holiday feel to it that makes it fun to watch around Dec. 25. Its also not a bad children's horror movie, with plenty of funny scenes {carroling gremlins, drinking gremlins, Snow White gremlin fans}.<br/><br/>Gremlins is by no means a flawless film, but its just what the doctor ordered. It gives you a nice, fun story, and some likable characters {and creatures}.

","I saw this movie for the first time in theaters when I was in like 2nd grade. I remember thinking how scary it seemed up front, but all in all this was a entertaining film. The bar scene still makes me laugh to this day, especially the gremlin that is playing with the puppets. It was kind of great to have them all in the theater at the end of the show watching Snow White. Corey Feldman did an okay turn in this one. Phoebe Cates is hot!! All in all, the makers of the film did a great job with the effects and the robotic and puppet work for the gremlins and mogwai. The old Chinese man is scary with those weird looking eyeballs. The scene in the house is pretty funny, too. The mean old lady with all those cats. Great movie!"

He purchases it, but is told three rules by the grandson of the Chinese shop owner: Rule #1: Keep it(him) away from bright light, especially sunlight, which kills him.<br/><br/>Rule #2: Don't get him wet...or he multiplies.<br/><br/>Rule #3: Don't ever feed him after midnight.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he does get wet, his copies turn out to be less than well-behaved(particularly one with a stripe), and they trick Billy into feeding them(except for Gizmo, the original)... which results in hundreds of scaly, ugly reptilian monsters dubbed Gremlins who destroy the town he lives in, along with a few residents.<br/><br/>If Joe Dante meant it to be aimed at kids, it wasn't the best idea, but for everyone else, it's a fast-paced, nifty little ride(if you miss the theater sequence, you've missed the best scene), which managed to become a big hit.

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Every once in a while a film is made which will become a cult classic. These films are often not the greatest of quality regarding production and they never appeal to everyone, but that's often their beauty. These films are little affairs which you can either watch alone or watch with a few friends and which a small group of you can have little in-jokes about. Whilst it was relatively successful when first released, ""Gremlins"" is now one of those movies.<br/><br/>When Billy Peltzer receives a christmas present from his dad, he's intrigued and overjoyed when it turns out to be a Mogwai called Gizmo. The Mogwai are an unknown species and the reason behind this is that after exposure to water and food after midnight, they metamorph into ""Gremlins"".<br/><br/>With some beautiful scenes in it, both this first encounter and the 1990 sequel are films worth watching. This original film is inparticular worthy of praise for it's links to classic films. One film staring Clark Gable is featured (which personally I confess to not being sure of the title for), as is Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"". They liked Capra's film to such an extent that Kingston Falls where ""Gremlins"" is set appears to based in design exactly on Capra's Bedford Falls. This delicious nod to Capra is shown by Billy's mother watching the film whilst baking.<br/><br/>On a minor note, another nice little link to other films is the inventions show where Billy's father spends the majority of his time. Not just is Robbie The Robot featured as someones invention, but when the father is on the phone, if the background is watched, a man is shown using ""The Time Machine"" (1960) and disappearing through time. Chris Columbus (Writer), Joe Dante (Director) and Steven Spielberg (executive Producer) obviously have a love for classic movies as their tributes are scattered throughout this film.<br/><br/>The one point about the ""Gremlins"" films are that nobody would suggest the acting is brilliant. With young appearances from Phoebe Cates and Judge Reinhold, the first film is not short of known actors. Ultimately though, the stars were always going to be the creatures themselves. To expect otherwise is perhaps to expect decent acting performances in 1997's ""Anaconda"", a film which everyone watched for the snake and not for Jennifer Lopez's awful performance.<br/><br/>Finally, one point worth bringing up is just how brilliant the late Jerry Goldsmith was when making the ""Gremlins"" soundtrack. As well as creating all the Star Trek music from the films and series, and also doing ""Alien"", one or two cartoons and countless other amazing films, Goldsmith's beautiful little ditty for this film is catchy and lasts in the mind hours after the film has finished.<br/><br/>To summarise, ""Gremlins"" and it's sequel were never going to be life changing films which everyone adored. They are however, wonderful little films which groups might gather around and relax whilst watching. With tributes to countless different films, often it's fun just to sit and try to spot as many tributes as possible. The scene where White Stripe (head Gremlin) is playing poker and a Gremlin is next to him dressed in the same old woman outfit as E.T. in the film of the same name from 1982, is yet another example. Basically, they're just daft, cult films which some love and some hate. Personally I think they're brilliant."

Getting them wet only makes it worse because they multiply from water. Sunlight, actually any extreme light, causes pain and eventual death.

","Who'd of thought mayhem would be so much fun?  A ridiculous plot line with an almost laughable premises presents itself, and despite the far-fetched idea I found myself surrendering to the film's incredibly charm, kicking back and enjoying the onscreen mayhem.  Joe Dante brings an oddball twist of horror and loony toons-inspired comedy by making little demonic creatures have interestingly violent, yet quirky, personalities.  The gremlins hold a place as my favorite movie monsters of all time.  <br/><br/>The real stars of the movie are Gizmo and the Gremlins (sorry Zack, Phoebe) compliments of Chris Wallas and his creature effects crew who did a spectacular job bringing the puppets to life especially in the pre-CGI age. Watching Gremlins for the first time in years, now in the middle of the CGI age, I can honestly say I miss the days of puppets.  CGI is great for a lot of things, and CGI makes many tasks easier . . . but characters entirely done with CGI lacks the concreteness of the Gremlins puppets.  Sometimes the work is much more difficult, but I think it's worth it. <br/><br/>
I love it when the Gremlins mimic the human characters around them in speech and actions, when they perform some act of cruelty and top it off with their silly and over-the-top maniacal laughter, somehow these little demons, while terrible and viscous, take on a lovable quality to them.  They have a nice satirical edge to their personality that makes the Gremlins surpass so many creatures born into the horror genre and quickly forgotten.  And who can forget the bouncy Gremlins theme music compliments of the immensely talented Jerry Goldsmith.    <br/><br/>Another thing I love about Gremlins is the surreal nature to everything. The characters never quite seem real, the sets never quite look like a real place, the narration, the whole atmosphere of the town has a weird goofball fairy tale quality to it . . . but in no way is that a complaint or criticism.  Gremlins never really sets out to take place in your home town and happen to the guy next door to you, and I'm glad it doesn't.  Joe Dante set the tone and pacing for the film just perfectly and our little destructive Â‘friends' feel right at home at this nicely painted surreal world.<br/><br/>And everyone on the cast fits well into this surreal world, from more believable `realistic' characters to over-the-top caricatures - somehow they all seem right in their places."

","The hidden subtext of the Gremlins being a nuisance from World War Two and now being in everything shipped into America is both a true statement of US xenophobia and typical right-wing baloney (coming from a battle-scarred WW2 vet no less).  This is most likely a Spielberg influence rubbing off into the script.<br/><br/>Joe Dante is an underachiever.  He never has made anything better and has only made things worse for himself by repeating the formula of this movie over and over.  Character depth is nonexistant, leaving us with either stereotypes or cardboard prop-ups.  You can tell she's an evil old lady because she has wrinkles and talks in a grim voice all the time.  No Hannibal Lecter subtly here.<br/><br/>Jerry Goldsmith does kiddy music here and, while it is different to hear him go from Patton and The Omen to this, it still leaves a nagging feeling that he'd been smoking too many joints with Danny Elfman.  The first half of the film suffers from poor editing, but the second half marginally makes up for it.<br/><br/>Overall, required viewing for children of the 80s.  It's amazing how something so horrifically gruesome could be passed off as a PG movie back then.  Yes, I count decapitations and microwave explosions to be gruesome.

I'm sure the parents who brought their kids to see this thought it would be a fun family night out. That's when angry parents started walking out of test screenings... 'Gremlins' features Gremlin blending, Gremlin microwaving, blood, guts, dog hanging by tree lights, weird bubbles on the Gremlin's backs with baby Gremlins hatching in them, fathers getting stuck in the family chimney and dying, a few somewhat grizzly human deaths and, oh, of course, the cutest creature on the Earth... being tortured. Yes, 'Gremlins' is not your average Christmas movie but for the sickest of minds, it's a must see! Mr. Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) is a scientist who creates less than perfect inventions. When away from home, he gets his son Billy (Zach Galligan) an early Christmas present: A cute furry creature named Gizmo (Voice of Howie Mandel) who seems to be the perfect pet but he has three important rules not to break: Don't expose him to bright light or sunlight which would kill him, don't get him wet in which case he would multiply and, most importantly, don't let him eat after midnight or else all hell will break loose. Yes, before we know it, slimy green creatures are invading the cosy town of Kingston Falls with their eyes set on Billy and Gizmo. It's up to Billy to stop the creatures, save the town and get the girl he loves (Phoebe Cates).

It has a cast at it's best including Dick Miller and Judge Reinhold, a very dark humoured and mean yet hilarious script by Chris Columbus and expert fantasy directing by Joe Dante which sets you right in the mood from the opening credits then about 30 minutes into the film he throws it all in your film. Yes, 'Gremlins' is an almost flawless film let down by only a few over long sequences (The Gremlin Bar scene starts out great but descends into boredom) but that's all made up for with the hilariously dark Christmas Story from Phoebe Cates about her father's Christmas Eve surprise that didn't turn out as planned. The scene really caused a lot of controversy as did the now infamous kitchen scene which features Gremlins meeting their demise by butcher's knife, blender and, of course, microwave.

And even if I did, I wouldn't admit to it!!!<br/><br/>This film is great. Spielberg had a hand in this film somewhere, you can feel it. Yep, this one appeals to both kids and adults.<br/><br/>A nice plot, some great SFX and animatronics, and some good acting make this a film for nearly everyone.<br/><br/>The initial story, about a boy who gets a cute, fluffy pet for Christmas, is known to everyone. The Mogwai itself is sooooooo cute, and the way it speaks and sings furthers it's cute appeal. So it comes as a shock when the boy who owns him ends up breaking the three important rules that he must abide by, and all hell breaks loose!!!<br/><br/>Don't feed them after midnight. Don't get water on them. Don't ever expose them to sunlight!<br/><br/>All of these rules are broken, and what ensues is comic/horror chaos.<br/><br/>The Gremlins themselves are nasty little things. Grrrrrr!!! They can either be out-and-out menacing, funny and stupid, or both at the same time. It was nice to see the mixture of comedy and horror in this film, and it works all the better for it.<br/><br/>The music plays a pivotal role in letting us know when we should be scared or when we should laugh. It's a weird kinda sound that is made and works well enough to suit the mood of the film.<br/><br/>The one-on-one between Billy and the Stripe, is actually very tense, and violent.

","i completely agree with nerveboy, it has to be one of the best films around. i enjoyed it so much that for the past months I've been looking for the film on video which is rather hard to find when you consider the film came out 17 years ago.<br/><br/>the story starts as a man telling a story. it goes that the mogwai (known as gizmo) was brought for a present for his son (william, or billy for short) the man is told by the sellers grandson that there are three important rules never to be broken. a)he doesnt like bright lights and sunlight will kill him. b)keep him away from water, dont get him wet. and c) probably the most important rule never to forget, no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs, never, never feed him after midnight. As it goes these rules are accidentally broken and the result is the funniest group of evil monsters you can imagine(gremlins), my favourite three scenes are the cinema scene(same as nerveboy), dary's pub scene where there getting drunk and playing poker doing keep-fit, (its really funny), and the snowplow( i really like the music)<br/><br/>So if theres any film you're going to rent from yur local video shop, this is the one-'gremlins'<br/><br/>As it goes though i feel the follow up movie 'gremlins2-the new batch' left much to be desired for<br/><br/>So remember, next time something breaks down in yur house ""before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights, check every cupboard and under every bed, cos who knows there may be a gremlin in your house""- quote taken from the film said by Rand Peltzer"

"Howlin Wolf","9","0","1","23 March 2001"," Original premise supports the movie until the ""Gremlins"" arrive... then it's a riot! (SPOILERS)
","The atmospheric opening sequence in 'Chinatown'... the father who is a klutz of an inventor... the local harridan... the Mogwai. All of these elements will keep you entertained during the first portion of the movie, ""Gizmo"" especially, but it's when the Gremlins arrive that the real fun starts! Ever heard of the phrase 'Build it up, tear it down'? Well that's exactly the technique that Dante and Spielberg use here, building up the aura of quintessential small-town America and then gleefully allowing their malevolent little protégés to tear down that image by running amok!<br/><br/>As mentioned, the first segment is still entertaining. Mrs Deagle, the harridan, is wonderfully evil and still scares me to this day (As does ""The Wicked Witch of the West"" in ""The Wizard of Oz""!), Gizmo is cute enough to have kids all over the world screaming petulantly at their parents ""I want one!"", and there is constant delight at seeing such inventiveness being practised. Once Gizmo gets wet, however, the movie cranks up several notches and never slows down. There are several great set-pieces, which I won't spoil here.<br/><br/>Particularly satisfying is the sense that Spielberg is poking fun at the schmaltzy nature of some of the previous projects he's been behind. There is a wicked sense of humour on display here, from both director and producer, and several scenes might scare sensitive kids. However, I used to love getting scared and thrilled at the same time, and that's what this movie does so well for youngsters. Part of its attraction when I was growing up, I think... To give the impression that only kids will enjoy it is false though. This is a fun movie for all the family that continues the tradition of great 80's flicks with something for everyone, a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Back to the Future"". A real treat."
"Old Joe","9","0","1","13 March 2001"," Gremlins is a little bit different to your ordinary movie!
","I was young when I hired this movie classic and admit I was scared out of my wits! But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.<br/><br/>Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget!  <br/><br/>The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.<br/><br/>The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.<br/><br/>It's now time to talk about the real stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? <br/><br/>Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.<br/><br/>Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins. <br/><br/>To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!<br/><br/>Rating: 4 Stars or 9/10."
"Gislef","8","0","1","15 April 1999"," Another Great Dante Flick
","Joe Dante seems to have some connection directly into my head, as his films never fail to entertain me.  Gremlins is no exception, as it basically parodies the old Universal horror flicks, monster movies in general, small town movies and plays like Our Town, and throws in a whole lot in-jokes and sight gags as well (see Trivia).  The Gremlins remain to this day the most grotesquely loveable ""monsters"" in screen history."

Why? (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER!) Because the three rules that were supposed to be followed are accidentally broken, and more fuzzy creatures pop up and then later turn into despicable and gruesome monsters.<br/><br/>You'll get more laughs than you expected were in such a violent movie.

"BigJedi-2","9","0","1","29 August 2000"," One of the greats...
","Many great films have a half a dozen (or more) copy-cats.  This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures.  Gremlins, along with it's sequal are part of the ""Greats"", like ""Jaws"", ""Star Wars"", ""Ghostbusters"", among many many others. Some people don't get this dark comedy, and that's understandable.  It is a mean spirited, fantasy film at times, but sometimes you laugh harder after you've been scared nearly to death.  It would be wrong to deny this film it's just do.  It showed, along with ""Jaws"", that thrillers can be fun and profitable, if you do it right. A loveable Creature named Gizmo, is brought home to Billy Peltzer, by his father, Rand.  The new gift came with 3 rules.  All of which Billy must abide by,and was forwarned.  Billy does his best, but fails as he brakes the most important rule and lets loose hundreds of green monsters, that love to break things, and hurt people.  It is a zany film, and if you haven't seen it, I don't want to give to much away.  Enjoy the film, and it's sequel, which is one of the few arguably worthy sequels in film history.

","Possibly one of the greatest movies of the 80's, if not the last forty years.  Classic and influential, and what's best, it's still entertaining to watch even after all these years.<br/><br/>The story concerns Billy (Zach Galligan), a young bank teller/free lance cartoonist whose father brings him home a rare creature as a Christmas present.  Gizmo, the creature in question, soon multiplies when he's splashed with water, and spawns a group of evil clones, led by Stripe. These creatures then transform into monsters and escape into town, causing all categories of chaos on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>Joe Dante successfully copies the same style he employed for his earlier film THE HOWLING and packs this movie with enough in-jokes for four movies. For all their grotesque physiques, the gremlins are somewhat cute, particularly when they watch SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS, easily the film's most famous scene.<br/><br/>But the movie's finest moment concerns the fate of Ruby Deagle, the town's evil old landowner.  Much like Aunt Edna in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION, you'll laugh rather then be appalled when the old nag gets her just desserts.<br/><br/>All in all, if you've never scene this movie, you're missing out on one of the greatest motion pictures of our time.  Alternately scary and funny, sometimes in the same minute, it stands alone among all the horror/comedies of it's time, second only to GHOSTBUSTERS.

But ""Gremlins"" was my favorite of the bunch, and it still is today. One of the first films to come from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, this horror/comedy directed by Joe Dante and written by Chris Columbus is great fun.

","I had to wait 2 years and see this on cable after it came out, but I found out why my friends were hyping it so much.  Late teens Billy gets a gift from dad at Christmastime, an adorable little ""mogwai,"" a furry, barely bigger than you're hand creature.  But oops Billy gets him wet and out pops several new mogwais, all just as cute.  This new group is a bit more mischievious and coax Billy into feeding them after midnight.  The dudes unaware that if you do that the little guys turn into ugly, destructive monsters.  They get loose from the house and run amok downtown, thrashing a club, a movie theater, and many homes.  Writer Chris Columbus interjects enough humor though to make them lovable villains, having them breakdance, sing Christams carols, and attend a screening of ""Snow White.""  Its all a lot of fun, with a very memorable score, and even time to tug at your heart. And if you dont at least smile from Gizmos ""bye, Billy,"" youre made of stone, man.  You may as well be related to Mrs. Deagle.  ""Deagle, Deagle, Deagle!"""
