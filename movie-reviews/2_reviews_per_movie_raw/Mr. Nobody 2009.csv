"cetaylor3","8","48","52","20 October 2014"," The quest for mutuality in love
","As Nemo looks back (from age 118, yearningly, and forward from age 9, predictively, drawing on a 9-year-old's storybook-even-horror-story-based clichéd imaginings of adolescent/adult life and sci-fi future worlds), he sees his life's choices and their envisioned consequences pivotally stemming from one crucial choice at age 9, each path ""typed up"" as a draft of an alternate life. It's an existential tale of the power of choice to create the environments that reshape the persons who then choose from what life presents in their consequent environments, ad infinitum. It's a romantic tale in both the historic sense of quixotic, picaresque adventure multiply envisioned (including into distant time and space) and the modern sense of a quest for the idealized romance of heart and soul.<br/><br/>The alternate lives Nemo envisions ultimately hinge on a quest for one thing: mutuality of love in marriage. No cliché in that; rather a truth of human want and need borne out of the anguishing pain of a 9-year-old caught in rupturous divorce. Desperate to make the choice no 9-year-old should be asked to make, in such a way that it will be ""the right choice"" for his future, especially to find rapturous, enduring love, not re-creating his parents' fate, he engages a daunting will to prediction and a time-travel suspension and projection that allow him to see three futures before making the fateful choice.<br/><br/>So, to me, Nemo's three ""lives"" – represented by three girls and the wives they become in his predictive imaginings and rememberings – depict three points on the continuum of mutuality in love:<br/><br/> loving more than being loved (with Elise, who marries him on the 'rebound', keeping the torch alive for the old flame)<br/><br/> being loved more than loving (with Jean, who he marries as fated by a dance, thus a kind of 'arranged marriage')<br/><br/>These two reflect shoe-on-the-other-foot variations on the torturous ""I love you but I'm not in love"" dynamic where Nemo thinks a marriage can work, but discovers it cannot. <br/><br/> and mutually impassioned loving (with Anna)<br/><br/>Across scenarios, we see his one mutual love, Anna, as someone he'd meet in various contexts (as if destined, as if his scriptwriting mind is trying to relieve him of the paralyzing thought that any one choice could preclude finding his true love yet also revealing that some timings for crossing paths with Anna could be inopportune, that perhaps only one timing might lead to the sustainable love life he craves):<br/><br/>first as children at the beach (who we wind back to in the final shot, sitting in innocent harmony on the dock), an age seen in first draft as too awkward for Nemo's self-consciousness that makes him hide his truth and blurt relationship-killing statements;<br/><br/>second as adolescents, brought together by parental merger, a merger that eventually reinforces his 9-year-old-self's pain about the fragility of imperfect love while exiling his and Anna's mutual pledges of soul-mate-like-passion;<br/><br/>third as adults, passing in a crowd - train depot, city street, funeral - where timings are off, where too much accumulated adult pain, caution, and distrust interfere, making all but the final draft of such adult encounters – the miracle in the chalk circle – come to a dead end; <br/><br/>and last as aged fellow travelers to Mars (i.e., destined to meet even if Nemo initially married Elise, upon honoring Elise's wish for her ashes).<br/><br/>Old Nemo claiming that these depicted lives are equally ""meaningful"" doesn't mean equally nurturing or vital; his emotion betrays where his truth lies - with a mutual love that's ""to die for"" (among all the traumatic deaths - by water, fire, or firearm – that he envisions) - and at age 118 worth living for – long enough to see Time reverse and be able to wind his way back - back to the chalk circle when ""chance"" or fate or miracle rescues an all-but-lost hope of reconnection, or back further to childhood on the dock as playmate–sweethearts who might never have lost each other, perhaps the maximal dream of the 9–year–old's quest for a love that endures all change.<br/><br/>When old Nemo lives long enough to reach time's reversal, he laughs a victory laugh for having found the scenario that miraculously returns his one mutual love to him in the nick of time, now presumably together (in some time and space) ""for as long as both shall live.""<br/><br/>Some suggest the ""moral of the story"" carries a (negative) verdict about wealth or career. But I think it was not wealth-boredom that made the Nemo who married Jean seek an alternate identity that got him assassinated; rather it was the restless boredom of never truly loving, reflected in Jean's questioning whether he even liked or knew her (even whether she took sugar in her coffee), missing the passion of two lovers who mutually attune to their beloved's every desire. <br/><br/>Nor is marrying 'trouble' (Elise grappling with mental instability) what undoes love – Nemo stays committed to the most trial-by-fire of marriages - as long as the love is mutual, but Elise's romantic fantasy is elsewhere. <br/><br/>It's asymmetric, unrequited love that smothers marriage with Jean or Elise, not the fact of an easy life or a hard one.<br/><br/>This message points back to the tale's beginnings, for the very 'die' the 9-year-old Nemo must cast and that traumatizes him is the result of a broken marriage, a love that was not mutually ""for better or worse."" Whichever of the 9-year-old's Hobson's choices he makes, what he scripts enough drafts to realize is what matters most to sustainable (""eternal"") love and how to make his heart recognize, treasure, and hold it when he finds it. His last gasping word, ""Anna,"" evokes Citizen Kane's dying, cryptic ""Rosebud,"" but the latter portrays a self- pitying sense of boyhood loss, whereas Nemo's ""Anna"" portrays a transparent self-realizing sense of a boyhood dream found."

","Mr Nobody, Nemo Nobody, is now 100 years old, the last mortal on earth in 2092, and he is about to die. Questioned about his life on his death bed by a journalist that sneaked in the hospital, he tells the stories of his lives. Yes, lives, his three lives, his three destinies between which he was unable to choose from. Three love stories, three very different existences conditioned by apparently meaningless decisions. Three paths, three wives, three families, three fates.<br/><br/>This genuinely mind blowing movie is an experience revolving around the notion of choice, the importance or futility of decisions, a complex story that questions randomness, and what our lives are made of. Illustrated by bribes of a science documentary enlightening us about concepts like time before and after the big bang, the extremely interesting superstition of the pigeon, the eventuality of the big crunch, the complexity of quantum mechanics and string theory. This is a journey into the human psyche and the ability to create and explore in our imagination all the possible moves, like a chess player, that would lead to different paths, different existences. Exceptionally imaginative, acutely funny and startling, this production reeks of intelligence and craftsmanship, breaks down linear storytelling into bits, only to shuffle the whole thing in a brilliantly orchestrated masterpiece. It reminded me of so many great experiences, from David Lynch movies to Jorge Luis Borges books, it's an exquisite bundle of intellect and emotion.<br/><br/>Choices, their meaning, why we choose this or that road through our lives, their consequences, whether we are aware of them of not. How many different lives could we be living ? Through the infinite possibilities facing each and every one of us, the good and the bad choices, every turn taken creates a new life, the most interesting of all is being alive. Chaos theory and butterfly effect to remind us how small we are in the randomness of the universe and yet so able to actively manifest the reality we desire. Nemo Nobody has to choose between leaving with his mother or stay with his father, the starting point of the exploration his available destinies. Unable to decide, he chooses both and takes us for a ride through an immensity of possible.<br/><br/>The filming is smooth and sequences linked in a flow of event that jumps back and forth through time, brilliantly edited with great attention for rhythm. The music score is so adequately put together that it adds to the already stunning staging efficiency of the directing by Jaco Van Dormael. I dare to say this is the very best movie of 2009 and will most likely go see it a second time next week, one can never get enough of these absolutely mind blowing experiences. Confusing and dazzling at the same time, it manages to spark the most interesting discussions about the meaning of life, in an attempt to pinpoint why we live it. Whatever you got planned for this week end, just drop it and go see that movie, you will not regret it.<br/><br/>There is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others. I refer not to Evil, whose limited realm is that of ethics; I refer to the infinite.<br/><br/>Jorge Luis Borges<br/><br/>(www.radiostationexp.blogspot.com)"

","Just caught the north American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. This is my first IMDb comment, doing it cause i saw no one else has written anything yet.<br/><br/>Jaco is an absolutely brilliant writer/director. I haven't seen too many art-house films, but I was pleasantly surprised by the tone which wasn't too serious, or pretentious. There were laugh out loud moments during a movie with themes concerning choice, destiny, and metaphysics.<br/><br/>I was enamoured by the love story, it was feel good without being Hollywood.<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing. I believe that Jaco explained that he used different DP's to film the different possible lives of Mr. Nobody. There were scenes set in the year 2092 that were absolutely stunning on the big screen.<br/><br/>I found the soundtrack to be awesome. Any movie with ""Mr. Sandman"" and ""Where is my mind?"" is alright by me.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely imaginative, original, funny, and will probably have me thinking about it and my own life for days after viewing."

","There's one thing about this film that makes me overlook the flaws:it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Some people walked out 20 minutes before the movie ended. I can't really explain to myself why ANYONE would do that (it was really tempting to ask but I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen). It's really pointless to describe the plot because this movie is so much more then any summary could say. This film has so many stylistic, tonal and narrative changes that it seems absolutely mad for the first half hour. It's easily the most unique and worthy cinema experience in the last year, its feels very current. I could go on and on about the things I loved about this film but there's nothing right now that I would recommend seeing more to a person of any age, sex or taste in cinema. It's everything I could ask for in a film:funny, touching, thrilling, surreal, beautiful..."
"cstrac21","10","399","500","3 June 2010"," Astonishing and profoundly moving!!
","This is the first time I have felt the need to post a review of a film, but the experience that this movie provided was so unique and profoundly moving that I feel compelled to post something of my thoughts.<br/><br/>I have just finished watching Mr Nobody after knowing nothing about the movie beforehand (perhaps a good thing as I may have avoided it otherwise), but was simply astonished by the originality, cinematography, acting, script, soundtrack and profoundly thought provoking ideas.<br/><br/>I realise that this film will not be to everyones taste, certainly I think it will not be fully comprehended by the younger generation as it does require a certain lifetime of experiences to relate, such as birth, love, marriage, children, separation, divorce, death, life changing choices etc.., but nevertheless it does make you deeply consider your own past decisions and future choices, and everyone of all ages will have made and will make these decisions.<br/><br/>The production values are very high and would not look out of place in a 'hollywood blockbuster' but it is the mix of cinematography and music mingled with the dramatic scenarios that make it truly memorable.<br/><br/>It is a difficult film to describe as it does not follow a traditional narrative structure, but that is what makes it so unique and truly memorable. An experience that will hopefully stay with you long after you have seen it. It certainly made for a hugely memorable experience for me. Others may differ in opinion, but I don't think anyone can argue that it is not intelligent, fresh, original and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Well done to all involved in providing something original, intelligent and very entertaining."
"Quebec_Dragon","10","193","240","28 July 2010"," Awesome but not for everyone
","How to review this film without giving too much away? Throughout the film, I was constantly surprised and amazed. I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply, it's a philosophical sci-fi film, but it's so much more than that. It's about choices, destinies, astrophysics, dreams and memories, just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest, it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man, 118 years old, on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either, things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess, but it's surprisingly cohesive, gripping and even quite touching. I'm sure some will find it confusing, but that's part of the point: Mr. Nobody's memories seem confused and appearances might be deceiving. <br/><br/>I found it extremely romantic despite the fact there are 3 very different love interests. One might say that sometimes the dialogue in romantic parts was corny, but I think that the most beautiful declarations of love can be the simplest as long as they are sincere. They felt that way here. The acting was top-notch all over the board with no weak performance in sight. Mr. Nobody's makeup and voice as an old man were perhaps a little distracting but nothing major. It's not a special effects extravaganza, but what was seen was quite imaginative and beautiful to behold. I think the contrast with the more mundane stuff going on makes them even more impressive. Visually, it has an incredible number of different angles and viewpoints all extremely well shot. What's amazing is that the (often) brilliant transitions flow so well from one to another without being jarring.<br/><br/>There are so many story threads (most fascinating), so many changes of tones (whimsical to tragic) and so much range (from intimate to grandiose). I think people who like to analyze films would have a field day with this one although it's possible they would nitpick on the borrowed elements. There's also lots of food for thought and should provoke very interesting discussions afterwards especially on what might have happened if choices in your life had been different. Contrary to most films where I tend to think of what I will write in my review as the film is going on, it did not really happen here. I was totally absorbed and that's rare. The choice of songs and musics, mostly known, was excellent and added a lot especially in romantic parts. I'm even considering buying the soundtrack. Mr. Nobody is a challenging but very rewarding film to watch . I don't think it's for everyone, mostly because of its non-linear structure, but those who appreciate unconventional films like Brazil, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Vanilla Sky or Big Fish should be quite pleased. I loved Mr. Nobody and it has become one of my new favorite films. To be quite honest, I wish I could see it again right now... Very highly recommended particularly with someone special. <br/><br/>Rating : 9.5 out of 10 (not full 10 because ending could have been better)"
"alexreynier","10","238","318","27 March 2010"," A Wonderful Film - From Start to Finish
","This is one of the most beautiful cinematographic masterpieces that I have seen in recent years. The photography, music, cinematography, cast, special effects and script creates a highly visually and intellectually stimulating movie.<br/><br/>The film is very complex, between how the movie is fragmented and its time-line, you are left in a state of confusion. A confusion which expands over the length of the movie and much is left to your own interpretations of certain events. <br/><br/>You try to hang on to a fragment telling yourself that this is the right fragment, this is the right time lapse but before you know it, you are introduced to another sequence of fragments which at the time may not necessarily make a lot of a sense and may create more confusion. In time, you start to understand that each fragment becomes a life of its own, each fragment appears to be real, and so each fragment is potentially the correct fragment, there is no right or wrong answer, because there is no reality. Each fragment represents a choice, each choice represents a series of circumstances and each circumstance represent the possibilities which this person is subject to, in his life.<br/><br/>You are introduced to many ideas, and many possibilities, which in themselves are a small selection out of all the possibilities that life may give. The possibilities are the ones given by a 9 year old child, full of ideas, full of freedom, completely and entirely boundless. This creates an enticingly magical combination of possibilities. Boundless and so free in every concept. <br/><br/>This is a journey in our character's imaginative mind, seeing his future being dependant on this one immediate decision, leading to future decisions and potential circumstances that may arise in his future based on his first decision. But the movie also states: If you don't choose, then you don't limit yourself to that one decision therefore the possibilities are endless. The movie encompasses our lives, the life of anyone, and how that life is lead. The circumstances in which you live and how you deal with certain events is represented via our character's perception of the future and circumstances.<br/><br/>This is a very highly intellectual movie which is not only stunning, but also very interesting. Some points about the life and philosophical questions are raised, these points may be easily applied to your own life and so in turn give more of your meaning to the movie.<br/><br/>This movie will not appeal to everyone - because the concept is very complex and the content is very intellectual. Some people will not even understand a little bit of it because it requires the viewer to apply his or her mind to understanding how it all interlinks. This movie would appeal to the more intellectually able people, who enjoy complex films and using their minds to apply meaning to the film. It is not just an enjoyment movie like any blockbuster - it is a content-full movie which required careful analysis of events to comprehend its entire meaning. You do need to be in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>You want a distraction? Go see a blockbuster... You want intellectual and visual stimulation? Go see Mr. Nobody!!<br/><br/>I have to say that it really is a pity that this film has not yet been set a release date in most countries in the world (including the UK) because this movie is truly incredible. I had to travel to Paris, France in order to catch a screening. Please see it in English (Original Language) - translation of films never conveys the meaning of films correctly, so imagine what it would do to this very intellectually demanding film?"

","This is the kind of film you don't see too often. It is truly a visual masterpiece. I haven't heard about this french director, but ""Mr Nobody"" really blew my mind in all its images, dreams, romance and complexity. The movie has similarities to films by Michel Gondry but i think this film was more magical. Dreamlike and existential films. Some might think Mr Nobody is too complex, too demanding. It is not for everyone, but I loved it. Like other surreal movies, Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Synechdohe: New York"" ""Dr. Parnassus"", ""Micmacs""- these dreamlike and ""difficult"" films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions? These flicks never generate big box office money. Im amazed that they still make this kinds of demanding visual movies for cinema. And glad.<br/><br/>I discovered the greatness of Jared Leto as an actor when he played John Lennons Killer in Chapter 23. That was a truly disturbing and amazing acting of a disturbed fanatic loner. Mr Nobody is however the role of his life! If you like this kinds of movies I recommend ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"", ""Synechdohe: New York"" and ""THE FOUNTAIN"". They really make you think!"
"pumpkin-4","10","256","348","26 January 2010"," An experience of a lifetime
","Jaco Van Dormael's third & long awaited movie is a sensation. It is a real shame that this masterpiece didn't won lots of awards at different film festivals. How could they be so blind ? Mr. Nobody is a unique cocktail of drama, love story & science fiction. It's an odyssey about making choices and the effect it has upon our lives. The songs ( Buddy Holly ! Pixies ! Satie ! ) are well chosen and the acting ( Jared Leto ! Rhys Ifans ! ) is outstanding. Some might say that this is a difficult movie and a bit ""arty farty""... I agree that you won't understand everything, that's for sure, but what the heck, just sit back and enjoy the ride ! This breathtaking tale of imagination leaves you astonished in your seat. Not to be missed !"
"isabellealenus","10","151","223","18 January 2010"," Beautiful film. A gem!
","I saw Mr Nobody last night in a jam-packed theatre. I guess that the main reason for this is that I am in Belgium and the writer/director is Belgian. The response of the audience was amazing. I was in Flanders and so the film wasn't dubbed.<br/><br/>The film is magical and surreal. And yet it makes sense. Not many have achieved this, but Jaco Van Dormael seems to have done it with ease. It did take him 13 years however. If you liked Toto Le Héro, you should love this film too. Switching between the UK and Canada works brilliantly and Jared Leto, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple steal the show. Ifans and Little are also fantastic. Diane Kruger's strong German accent is unfortunate as the film needs no unintentional surrealism added to it. I think her role needed a stronger actress (she looks very beautiful though).<br/><br/>In all I recommend everyone to go and see it. The only reason the film gets an 8 (and not a higher score) is because towards the end it seemed to go on a bit. I will go and see it again however. The story really draws you in and I need to go back to search for some answers. I also want to see it again because it is so beautifully filmed. Van Dormael is an artist.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film as much, if not more, than a David Lynch. And that truly is a compliment."

","I've read some of the other reviews and I think not too many of them understand the film. Some are astonished at the film's brilliant staging and fx and think there is a deeper meaning in it, but they don't know what it's about. I think I understand it.<br/><br/>The main key is at the end, when Nemo told the reporter about a child incapable of making a decision without knowing the consequences. That's the case of our existence in space and time. That's life, I mean. But then Nemo says that the child is also incapable of making a decision when he knows all the consequences.<br/><br/>The film develops all the consequences of each decision the child could make. Nemo tells the reporter that they are just imaginary characters of a nine year old child's mind.<br/><br/>And before that, he talks about the Big Bang and the kind of time it brings. With the BB we live in an entropic universe, where all things come into disorder like the ink that spills in Nemo's example on the TV scientific program. When Universe stops -in the Big Crunch- time will go backwards and what was disorder will became order. All the multiple choices and possibilities will be reintegrated in a unity.<br/><br/>In the film we see Nemo laughing at the end when he realized that. He won't have to make any more decisions. All the possibilities will came back to the time when the boy runs after the train. All of his life he was haunted by the impossible decisions he had to make. There'll be no more of that, now in the Big Crunch."
"prohibited-name-2256","5","205","324","8 February 2011"," Great promises gone wrong
","Since this movie got so many positive reviews, I decided to write about it to give potential viewers both sides of the story.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is one of those movies with main plot transcending reality. If you've seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Butterfly Effect, you'll find yourself on similar territory with this one. Without spoiling too much, main character (Jared Leto) tries to regain his lost memory through hypnosis, which uncovers a lot. The only problem is: he re-experiences more than one linear life.<br/><br/>Sounds promising? Unfortunately, people responsible for this movie fail to squeeze any serious quality out of this potential. Jared Leto plays very well all the time, and the movie is shot with interesting style. First problem lies in the script. It just doesn't make much sense. For example: we are introduced to Superstring Theory, which doesn't have any relation to the movie, which is explained like a methhead would explain it after being sober for 36 hours. Throughout the entire movie, we are shown various little science facts and theories, all making no sense in the contexts, and making impression like a late night 2 hours google search put into movie to add to the overall ""credibility"".<br/><br/>There's a great love story in the movie, which resembles Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and really improves the experience, but unfortunately it's just one of many plots. Half of the movie it grows on the viewer, and promises a very unique experience. The other half it fails, fails and fails to deliver again, until a very unsatisfactory finish. <br/><br/>If it would have been more organized in structure, instead of random lazy scene by scene mash up ultimately leading nowhere, it could have been so much more. Still, many people find it entertaining, so it might be worth checking for yourself ;)"

","Take several helpings of philosophical and physics theories and blend these together with some artsy cinematography and sci-fi backdrops to make it appear philosophical and ""highly intellectual"" as some reviews have described it. But if any of these were the goal of the makers of this movie, they failed miserably.<br/><br/>The director and the writer use confusion, chaos and distraction to make this movie appear highly cerebral. However it is a set of dissonant scenes forcefully held together without an underlying unifying idea pretending to be philosophical but offering no ideas, answers or even questions. It is as if someone had the philosophy alphabet cereal for breakfast in the morning and then vomited on a movie script at Noon. The ideas are all over the place, half digested and full of bile. Some people may confuse this for intellectualism but it is nothing more than half-baked flashes of thought. It is the cacophony of ideas that makes the movie appear philosophical, but only in a way similar to how a carnival magician shows a coin and then makes it disappear, leaving you thinking about how he pulled it off and not about the coin itself.<br/><br/>The unnecessarily stretched plot runs into over two hours without really needing to. One could easily cut out many of the scenes without losing much of the meaning of this movie, because there is not much meaning to lose. In fact, one could completely skip the movie and not miss much."

","Recently I had the opportunity of viewing the extended version of Mr. Nobody, and reading some of the reviews of this well hidden science fiction epic, it really seemed like my cup of tea. After watching it in all of its two hour and thirty minute glory, I now feel an inane displeasure, akin to what I can only assume as having my frontal lobe stabbed with an ice pick.<br/><br/>Before I review the things I disliked about this movie, let me tell you about the things it got right. First of all, the set design and cinematography were excellent. Visually, the movie was colorful, vivid and imaginative. Also, it has a wide variety of period music which I thought fitting in the scenes they including it in. The scene with the space elevator, ship and mars colonies were also visually a nice touch.<br/><br/>That's about all the pleasure I took away from this movie. For the acting, writing and directing; I found it extremely tedious. The pacing of the movie was terrible. The alternate realities that Nemo experienced, while varied, did not justify the huge expenditure of time devoted them, nor did I feel like they moved the movie along in any significant way. The storytelling was so fragmented that I was unable to feel any connection between Nemo and his many loves and even less for his children which were so insignificant they just felt like filler and could have been left out of the movie completely. And for the ending, what I guess some people would consider a twist, I saw as just plain stupid if you think deeply into what it suggested. In summary, I found it boring and pretentious, and just not worth it. The movie aimed high trying to captivate the viewer in parallel realities, immortality, quantum mechanics and good old fashioned space exploration, but failed at the basics of storytelling and proper editing."

","In this very long, very beautifully photographed, labyrinthine semi-science fiction epic a very old person remembers his life in a very muddled way and we are presented with alternative stories of what (really?) happened. One gets the feeling from the very beginning of the movie that it wants to say something important. After more than two hours of tedious storytelling with a lot of repetitions, and alternative solutions of the life-story told, I have no idea what that important message is. I was so bored by this movie that I nearly panicked, and I wanted to leave the cinema, and the only reason I stayed was that my friend I was seeing it with wanted to see it through (though she was pretty bored too but she still had the hope of something meaningful at the end). The director and most people involved in this movie are obviously talented, but the problem is the manuscript, or rather, the idea as a whole. This overlong movie is a waste of time and money."

","This is one of those movies that you want to see at least a second time, because even though the first viewing is perfectly satisfying, you just know you'll pick up more the second, and third, time around. I lost track of how many parallel lives the main character was remembering, and as far as I could tell, it was never really explained how he could be aware of so many parallel universes, but those are minor points in a film that seeks to bring up ideas to be pondered. And it does just that. I think this would be a great first date movie, because the potential for it sparking a meaningful conversation/debate is tremendous. The main point, of course, is that every decision we make affects the path that the rest of our life takes, and there are many of these turning points in a lifetime. There are also ideas about the nature of reality, which I found intriguing. I don't think it will be long before I give this a second view. The only criticism I have is that, even though there were some fairly dramatic moments, and the acting was good, I didn't feel particularly connected to the characters. There was much more of a sense of detachment than I would have liked to have seen in a movie like this. But all in all... great film. A must see for anyone who likes to ponder life's imponderables."

","The premise of this film had me from the start. It's a question we all ask ourselves; ""What could of been?"". This film, although hard to grapple initially really does make you think about all the possible alternatives that could of arisen out of a small insignificant decision.<br/><br/>Rarely does a movie have this much impact on me. Nemo is caught between two decisions, go with his mum or stay with his dad. The film explores both. It also explores the possibilities within each of these choice, much like a tree with different branches going in all directions. <br/><br/>I think what effected me the most about this film is that in life we get held up on some of the most insignificant decisions that in the end have very little impact on our existence. Insignificant choices by ourselves or those on the other side of the world like those explored in the movie in the end seem to carry a heavier weight on our lives and where we end up, and who we end up with and what we end up doing. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I have now resolved to never look back and wonder what could of been. Not because I don't like what I see, but because no matter what choices I made, or will make they all end up being important and life-altering. <br/><br/>As the 118 year old Nemo says with resounding truth ""Every path is the right path. Everything could of been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning."" This is crucial when you look back at your own life wondering how things could of potentially been better or worse. What's done is done and the way it has panned out for you and I is the reality. What good is there in worrying about what could of happened? This movie tells us that the whole exercise of asking such a question isn't the right thing to do to begin with. The best question, if there had to be one instead of ""what could of been?"" really is ""what can be?"". We get one shot at life, no matter what path we take, the one that we do take will always be the important one that defines who we are. They all have the same meaning.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you like a challenge. If you do, it may just slightly change the path you take in this life......"

","There are basically two types of art fans. There are those who love art because of the way it makes them feel. It can be a painting of a beautiful landscape, or a series of random colors on a canvas, but they love the feeling they get - the memories or dreams that are envoked - when they look at it. The art can be disturbing, but the emotion it envokes might still be a good one, such as overcoming a personal fear.<br/><br/>The second type of art fan loves art for art's sake. A piece of art that does not evoke emotion is not quality art. It doesn't matter if that emotion is anger, resentment, fear, love, compassion, devotion, etc. As long as the art moves the viewer in some way, it is art. It doesn't matter if the art is ugly and repulsive.<br/><br/>Those that gave the movie a good rating are art lovers of the second type.

","I've seen this film about 4 years ago for the first time, and it's been in my mind ever since. <br/><br/>Now, about the plot itself; the whole concept of not making decisions, and living through all the possibilities that life could offer, and having that one little thing that seems irrelevant completely change the outcome of certain events is just simply brilliant. That one scene where Nemo's father ponders upon that one piece of egg shell in his cookie and ends up causing an unfortunate accident, just seems absurd and maybe even a bit funny, in a dark, twisted way. The film tells you how that egg shell got there, and you keep wondering what would have happened if it wasn't there, and how such a tiny detail could ever have caused such a horrible thing to happen. This film tends to do that a lot; it makes you wonder, it makes you a bit uncomfortable, the thought that you never know what tiny little thing is important and what's just an irrelevant detail, a passing thought in your head. Now, all the other scenes to come just tend to strengthen that sense of discomfort, that intense curiosity, or at least for me, that's what happened. I enjoyed the movie,maybe partly because there was always that strange, unique feeling inside my chest that got me wondering what might happen next and how it'll effect old Nemo Nobody's twisted life. The plot is very intricate, and it'd deserve a whole novel, but this is just a film review, and all I can say is that this masterpiece has effected my life in all kinds of ways. I tend to think about certain scenes, or quotes, from it all the time, in the best way possible... also, whenever I hear Where Is My Mind, by The Pixies (brilliant song by a brilliant band) I always remember that one scene with teen Ana and teen Nemo, running around the balcony and the kitchen. It was such a perfect, young and beautiful scene, just one of so many other amazing scenes from this movie. All I can say is that the cast is excellently chosen, their clothing and makeup is also always adding to the atmosphere of the film (which I can't describe, all I can say is just watch it and you'll get it), the music perfectly fits all the scenes, the plot is just... simply brilliant and way too complicated to be described here (or anywhere else for that matter). <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film yet, you are truly missing out. Three hours of your life, an unforgettable film and beautiful cinematography (!!). I recommend everyone who is into philosophical, deeply emotional, and very heartwarming and exciting stories and films to watch this masterpiece. It will leave you speechless for a while, and you'll look at the world in a whole new way. I absolutely recommend watching Mr. Nobody."

","Howcome nobody recognizes that this movie is so unoriginal. It tries to convince you by throwing in lots of special effects, tricks and (fake) emotions. In total it's a big struggle to be artistic, romantic, science-fiction and a commercially marketable all in one.<br/><br/>I recognized not only story elements of other movies, even literal shots that were stolen from other (and better) movies. For example: there is this scene brother and sister (not related by blood) are having a private moment where he touches the skin of her arm and you see the hairs of her arm stand up. This idea and even the angle of the shot directly relates to one of the key shots in ""The Fountain"" (Darren Aronofsky) but this is just one of many. To name some titles; the movie reminds me too much of ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"", ""Waking Life"", ""Sliding Doors"", ""Jeu d'infant"", ""Being John Melkovich"" ...<br/><br/>Why does the main character only have three choices in his love life: the three girls he sees on a bench when he is a child. In three different dimensions he marries them, while he is only happy with his 'true love' while in these other realities he feels miserable with his fashion-model women. Why if you are unhappy, drag on with it? And he has all these children,and never cares about them. And what about friends?<br/><br/>This film pretends to be open minded, while nothing in the story really is.

","This is a French film in that nothing happens for 2.5 hours but it makes you think. It's filmed in English but the fact that it had a French director probably accounts for the style.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately about happenstance, the choices we make and what they could lead too. There are elements in there about string theory, the beginning and end of the universe and therefore quantum mechanics. However rather than occurring at the particular level the events and interactions making up the film and possibilities take place between human beings. Rather than the few outcomes that could possibly occur from the entanglement of electrons or protons at the subatomic level this film deals with the truly infinite outcomes of what might be.<br/><br/>There is some mention of life before birth and life after death but this is only touched upon and not explained in any fashion. There are also some scenes which appear to involve time travel, or something similar. I thought these elements didn't add much too the film yet didn't detract from them either. Their presence was mildly confusing or perhaps irritating but probably added just a little bit more of the unknown into the whirling mass of possibilities in life that 'Mr Nobody' attempts to present.<br/><br/>I liked this film and will probably watch it again sometime. 8/10"

","Some people maybe confused about the story and the movie itself, in that case your MISSING A LOT.. Having enjoy this movie myself, because I was able to follow and get the gist of it while watching; I decided to make this review so some people can have some guide of some kind. The movie is basically about a boy(Nemo Nobody) who got to a difficult situation of choosing to stay with his mother or father who are separating.. And in that moment in his mind, He deducted all the possibilities that will become his life. Throughout the movie different scenes are played at different settings and circumstances. Each scenes are not played sequentially and different scenarios are made throughout the movie.. So if you have watched the movie already and is a little bit confused of how to piece together the scenes, heres my summary of all the scenarios in proper sequence as I understood it..<br/><br/>2 main path: choose to be with his mother or his father..<br/><br/>1. He is with his mother. At the beach his schoolmate Anna ask him to swim with her friends and he replied ""I don't swim with idiots.."", She turned away angrily. He regretted saying what he said. After few years, he's 30 something years old, he meets Anna again now with kids, they say hello, how are you.. see you around... <br/><br/>2. He is with his mother. At the beach he says ""I can't swim"" and Anna stayed with him at the shore. His mother introduces a man and Anna is his daughter. They all live together and he developed a relationship with Anna. But his mother and her father splits. They don't see each other for some time. They accidentally see each other again, they got together, she gives him her number in a paper but it got erased by a drop of rain. He waits for her everyday at the light house for sometime. Eventually she sees him there waiting and they get married. One day on his way back to home He loose control of his car and drove trough a lake and died.<br/><br/>3. He is with his father. One day he's at a club and he meets Elise. Next day he made a love letter for her and went to her house. He met her in front of her house and confess his love but she rejects him. He decided that he will marry the first girl he dances at the club that day. At the club he danced with Jean(Asian girl) instead of Elise. He and Jean got married, had a great house and a family. But he is bored with this life, so one day he got out to travel and he sees this escort driver with a poster/sign for another person. He pretended that he is the guy this driver was looking for. He got the other person's accommodation etc. Unfortunately at the bath tub some guys killed him thinking he is this other person and dropped him some place.<br/><br/>4. He is with his father. He waits to his motorcycle at front of Elise's house. He sees her go out with her boyfriend and immediately rodes away. He gets into an accident and into a coma.. Eventually after few years, he dies on his hospital bed..<br/><br/>5. He is with his father. He confessed his love to Elise and kissed her. He talk to her and never gave her a chance to reject him. They got married and had a family. She never got over her previous boyfriend so she eventually left him. she is working at some salon. He is left to their house and he decided to write again. At the basement of their house while typing some disaster/ earthquake happens, he gets flooded in the room with water and died..<br/><br/>6. He is with his father. He and Elise just got married. On the way to reception at traffic, an oil truck exploded in front of their car and Elise died.. He got some business making some films. He got to a trip to Mars where he fulfilled his promise to her of bringing her ashes there. On the way back from Mars he meets Anna but a meteor storm pitted their ship and it exploded.<br/><br/>7. He is by himself. He refused to choose so he made a new world. He wakes up on bed wearing black and white checkered shirt. No one knows him, his mother don't recognize him. He get to this house where his 70 years older self tells him to live until Feb 2092? so he did until he is 118 years old where died and right after that the 'Big Crunch' happens..<br/><br/>(7.. remember a part of the movie that explains about dimensions?-- height, width, depth, time and other 6 minuscule dimensions) <br/><br/>At the last part of the movie, you can see the scene where Anna found Nemo waiting for her at a bench. Given this is the last part you see in the movie means this is the path that he chooses being with Anna. And even when the universe returns in time, it ends when they were young at the lake and they are now together...<br/><br/>Now you might want to watch it again and enjoy as you would understand it more now.. Then share what you think of the movie..^^"

","I prefer to think of ""Mr. Nobody"" as a sequel to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Thematically, it seems to follow several of the concepts from that movie, especially that time is not just linear; it consists of an infinite number of possibilities which all exist simultaneously.<br/><br/>Since the film's action is also not linear, it leaves the story open to various interpretations. One could drown in the depths of hypothetical meanings, but it is best not to take it too seriously. The filmmaker would prefer it that way, I think. Note the way he makes the most of every opportunity to fool the viewer (e.g. the two motorcycles that look like a car in the distance).<br/><br/>The film has a strong style, often using primary colors in the design and rather childish, primitive or whimsical symbolism (e.g. the foot crushing the house).<br/><br/>Ostensibly, the main plot line involves a child (Nemo) who, before birth, was passed over by an angel who was supposed to remove all knowledge of the future from the child. When the child is nine, he has to make a choice between living with his father or mother, who are separating. Using his knowledge of the future, he quickly reviews the results of both choices and, finding neither choice leads to happiness (in chess, this is called zugzwang, meaning any possible move will worsen the situation) veers off at a crossroads.<br/><br/>The film's story is recounted by Nemo in his future, at age 118. We see many of the various roads Nemo's life could have taken if various choice were made, or if chance had intervened.<br/><br/>There are many homages or similarities to other films (and other cultural references), including ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe"" and Monty Python.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but I felt it was undercut by the editing, which sometimes feels like the scenes were shuffled randomly.<br/><br/>I have to say ""Mr. Nobody"" was beautifully filmed. Many of the scenes have to do with common life themes, so the older viewer might find himself swept back to scenes from his own life. The beautiful or nostalgic scenes are interspersed with scenes of tedium, however, so it's like a roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Whether you want to see the film as dealing with the simultaneous existence of time paths, or you see it as a contemplation on choice/fate/randomness, this is a film that some will enjoy tremendously. Others, I think, will feel it is the fusion of philosophical ramblings and sci-fi mumbo jumbo."
"LazySod","7","51","98","29 March 2010"," What if...
","This film starts as a guy named Nemo is asked to retell his life story. Who is he? What happened to him to make him the way he is? Does he remember? As he starts telling his story it becomes clear that the story is quite convoluted.<br/><br/>Keeping the line smack in the middle of The Science of Sleep (2006) and Sliding Doors (1998) this film plays out the ""what if"" questions of life in a somewhat quirky artistic way. Following events that happen after making a choice - or having a choice made for you - it retraces the full life of a person through several different paths, at once. A multitude of different stories rolling through each other intertwined like an intricately woven web.<br/><br/>While I can say I really like the idea of toying with ""what if"" questions and depicting the results of each one of them I can't really say I liked the wrapper that was used to capture it all in one film very much. It's acceptable, but I don't think it was the best possible fit.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film though is very good - the different story lines are played out remarkably well and are different enough to stay interesting. It never becomes impossible to track which lifeline is which and the mixing of them is nice. It's just the wrapper that doesn't really fit in and that's a shame.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 choices made"
"minhhuyha","10","29","53","24 September 2010"," An imaginable masterpiece
","When I learned about quantum mechanics, parallel worlds, string theory, black holes and so on , I thought to myself ""If someone can put these ideas to their fullest in a movie, that'd be great . But as an avid reader of scientific books myself feels so hard to understand all the theories and ideas at a normal person's level and not a scientist's level, how can we make a movie without oversimplifying the ideas to the point that they lost their true meanings? "". But I did imagine that something like this exists. Just by total accident, I was dragged out to see Mr. Nobody without reading anything about it before hand and I was glad that I didn't. The movie has everything my imagination asks for and more. Well, I think other comments have all the necessary praises so I don't need to add more, my vote says it all. However when I came across some of the negative comments I did sympathize with them because there were times when I would react like that as well, so I may try to point out some of the things that this movie is not:<br/><br/>1. It's not a movie for people who don't even grasp the basic concepts like spacetime and how it operates in ""A brief history of time"" <br/><br/>2. It's not really for people who don't understand why a particle can be at different places at the same time. Why if we shoot a particle at something, it can both hit the target and not hit the target, why both events can happen in microscopic world but never such 2 contradicting events manifest simultaneously in everyday world. <br/><br/>3. It's worse for people who already understand 1 and 2, but then become ignorant enough to think that that's all there is to it. or to think that this is Butterfly effect + Benjamin , because it's totally not.<br/><br/>Because Professor Leonard Susskind of Stanford has explained that we can have conflicting stories true in macroscopic world (note that this is different from point number 2), for instance ""The postman delivered the mail to the mail box and leave. the home owner then retrieve the mail"" and ""The postman didn't deliver the mail and leave with it"" are both true, as long as the postman and the home owner never gets together to compare their stories. Susskind then used similar idea to explain the Blackhole paradox by Stephen Hawking.<br/><br/>4. And no, it's not 3 possible lives, because it's a much bigger number than 3, but I don't mean infinite because we can certainly prove that the number of choices in what ever duration we're talking here (120 years?) is a finite number. And secondly it's not ""possible"", it's ""already happened"". The lives that the main character have all already happened, not imagined, they were all true, as the old man recalled, some of them lead to his death , but he's certainly not dead, how? Simple, time runs backward for him, so it's not normal causal effect. All that matters is he is there at the time when time runs backward, BIG CRUNCH whatever. The 9 year old boy can make a choice (mom, dad, no choice) but time will run back to him, maybe simultaneously from all the alternate lives or universes for that matter. but whatever he sees have already happened even his multiple deaths , the point is normal people in any universe won't be aware of that, he's special and he's the only one aware of the consequences of the choices he made , but in the end that won't matter either, time will run back to that 9-year old boy decision making point as well. This can be confusing, maybe it's easier using the String theory to explain. <br/><br/>5. As for the 'true love' part, I don't see much point in it. There are a lot better romantic movies with more practical and beautiful love plot so using love as a selling point for this movie may gain understandable negative effects from some reviewers."

This movie, however, had far more dialogue and despite the fractured pieces of reality slicing in and out the clips clicked in my head. It all made sense and by the end I was in awe of what the director put together. It was visually stunning, lyrical and fascinating and humorous. The acting was so good. Leto was great throughout as was Kruger. I will say after a while Polley (whom I normally love) just got on my nerves. Her character was either smiling or crying in the most irritating way. (I just wanted her to slash her wrists already (I know, so cruel)). This film was about choices and exploring each decision to its fullest. It's about the road not taken - taken.

Something a little more haunting along the lines of the violin tugs of the REQUIEM FOR A DREAM score or the subtleties of the BENJAMIN BUTTON score might've done more to reinforce the poignant scenes.<br/><br/>The Belgian director is drawing heavily from films like BENJAMIN BUTTON, DARK CITY, AMELIE POULAIN, ETERNAL SUNSHINE, 2001 and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. To make a film with such diverse influences that still makes the tiniest bit of sense is a feat. If there were an Oscar for best casting, this would deserve it with flying colors. I don't think I've ever seen such striking resemblance between actors portraying the characters from several different ages. Jared Leto is back in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM form, and I like the fellow's daring. Heavily heckled after 2007's risky indie CHAPTER 27, he dives into the deep end again and this time it works out brilliantly. His dreamy, cloudy, confused stare into the camera lens defines the protagonist perfectly. The supporting cast is in ship-shape form as well, Diane Kruger with the brittle ghost of the naive lovesick puppy teenager still in her, Sarah Polley's self-destructive depressive is thoroughly sad and convincing and the actress whose name I can't find on IMDb (the one who played his mother) displays the right degree of life-weariness that comes with being a single mother.<br/><br/>Unlike Nemo Nobody, I claim no ability to see the future but I am adept at educated guesses. Quite easily MR. NOBODY could become a cult classic and hailed more with every passing year by film aficionado's. Quite easily could word-to-mouth be the salvation of a film so poorly marketed. Let's hope so. It'd be a shame to see this fine film disappear from mainstream audience's reaches."
"not_even_one","2","52","104","29 August 2011"," Plot less, pointless mess
","The only thing that's even remotely interesting in this film is the premise, and the synopsis you might read on the back cover. Everything else it throws at you fails miserably. There is no coherent plot to speak of throughout the whole 2something hours of artsy advertising editing and camera focus tricks. After the first half hour, you might be fooled that there is some deeper meaning to the whole thing but you'll get some pop science theories thrown in just for the sake of it. The dialog is completely useless. There is not a single even semi-important bit of information that is carried by dialog here. You'd think the director would then rely on strong images but no. All the storytelling is left to annoying editing and even more annoying musical selection. Sorry, but you're not Basil Poledouris and your cues and tunes cannot carry a poorly thought out film. The underlying idea that this mess is trying to convey is the ramification of choice -- which is really just an excuse to cram in a multitude of superficial main and supporting characters instead of fewer meaningful ones. Contrary to what some might believe, not having a plot and/or solid characterization does not make a film more alternative or intelligent. It just makes it barely watchable. The only thing worth seeing here is the actresses, who are all excellent. Overall, it just feels like the director wanted to say: ""Oh, look what I can do with Final Cut!"""

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I kept waiting for the story to begin but it never did. Watching it was a complete, utter waste of time and left me depressed afterwards. Not even the beautiful Jared Leto could keep me interested. There was no explanations why the characters did what they did or what all the symbolic things meant. It felt like watching some kind of non ending dream sequins that had no tie to reality at all. Don't watch this, even if you are a fan of Sci-Fi/Futuristic films. This is just so far beyond ""arty"" its not even funny. The creators of this film must have thought ""Let's make a movie for people to watch while on drugs!""

","This is an absolutely brilliant movie. I laughed, cried, and sat in awe all the way through this. The story of choice, consequence, love, death, a bit of string theory (where things may be operating on another level of existence at the same time as ours in some parallel universe), the big bang, entropy (entropy describes the tendency for systems to go from a state of higher organisation to a state of lowest organisation on a molecular level) and more. Don't worry, its not too hard to follow. And the conclusion with the ""Big Crunch"" (In physical cosmology, the Big Crunch is one possible scenario for the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the metric expansion of space eventually reverses and the universe re-collapses) is a satisfying end. I know its very easy to shout out ""This is the best movie I've ever seen"" now and again, but for once Im truly biting my lip here not to. Not as complex as some are making out, but maybe a tiny bit of science knowledge may help (though string theory and the big crunch are theoretical ideas only and disputed by some).

","Arguably one of the most ambitious storylines in all of cinema. Jaco Van Dormael is a director known to take fantastical weird storylines, and turn them into thought provoking film. Mr. Nobody is no different. I'm not stating that this film is perfection. With a storyline this ambitious, it's flaws are inevitable. But even with its flaws, it still shines as an intriguing si-fi flick. It's a fun film to analyze and break down because there is various ways to interpret it. It leaves you with a message of longing. It reminds us that our childhoods are our most formative years. And even the smallest of descions could have the biggest of outcomes. For those who have yet to see this life changing film, please do. You'll probably want to read a forum thread or article explaining the ending and themes. Even after seeing it multiple times, there are still new interpretations to take away from it. What I took away from it was the obvious.

"harrisjc-89-645907","3","5","7","6 August 2017"," Ridiculous
","I normally love these kind of movies  the kind where you get some clues along the way that then come together and make sense at the end. I am very patient and enjoy the type of story that unfolds gradually – then at the end comes clarity and understanding. This was that kind of story  but without the clarity and understanding part at the end. Yeah, I get the whole branching decision tree parallel life thread thing. But that primary story line was surrounded with a TON of ridiculous imagery and scenes that seem to have been just randomly thrown in (and repeated) for no real reason at all. Then at the end Van Dormael just punted on putting any kind of real ending on it. If felt ripped off after initially taking this movie seriously, trying to comprehend and pull together all of these strange clues  only to find that these strange clues were mostly a mess of unresolved random crap.<br/><br/>Van Dormael also makes a weak attempt at weaving the butterfly-effect into the story. SPOILER ALERT. It is explained how a man in South America that missed work and boiled an egg caused it to rain half-way around the world and obliterate Anna's phone number. I could buy the first part of that  but why does this mean that Nemo has to hold out the phone number in the palms of his hands and helplessly watch it slowly get obliterated by the rain like an idiot? Wouldn't you take some extreme action to protect the single most valuable phone number of your life? Or maybe just some reasonable action like putting the phone number in your pocket and getting out of the rain? Obvious Van Dormael didn't think so. To Van Dormael it was more reasonable to have Nemo stand there and cry while he watches the number and the future with his true love get slowly destroyed by the rain! (All that didn't matter anyway since Anna was purposely trying to get away from him by giving him an invalid phone number (area code 123)).<br/><br/>On the other hand the acting and character development was excellent  with one huge exception  Nemo the old man. (Still in SPOILER ALERT mode here) Every scene with the old man was painful to watch. The incongruity between the young Nemos and the old man was ridiculous. The teen and adult Nemo were sensitive, loving, kind, nuanced characters while the old man was a stereotypical cranky, opinionated old man. Van Dormael couldn't do any better than that? It's like he Googled ""Stupid Hollywood Stereotypical Characters"" and picked ""cranky old man"" and thought that would work just fine in this movie.<br/><br/>I'll leave it at that. There's a lot more wrong with this movie but I think you get the picture."

If you are a fan of such strutting garbage as Matthew Barney, then you'll gobble this right up and feel bettered for the experience. If you have a reasonably functioning bullshit detector, your skin will start to itch by a half hour in. Individual details are exquisite, and the director's craft is very elegant and refined, but the visibly heaving and straining effort to do something Vast and Poetic knocks the whole thing flat on its face. It's also one of those films that relentlessly quotes scenes from other films, which I find so aggravating, more about wink-winking how clever the director is than adding any useful content. Jared Leto also sports one of the most annoying haircuts I've ever seen on a man, and his inverted androgyny feels like he took the worst from both genders and forgot why he came into the room. When it finally ends, the director's satisfaction with his supposed Grand Reveal is one massive saccharine fart of nothing at all."

Made e feel a bit disgusted by women in general. The movie tries to force you to choose which life is the real one and it would actually work since he gives a number of clues like him regretting messing up his relationship with Ana. Or the fact that the scenes with the Asian girl are so rare so is clear they are not part of reality. It would have been a great puzzle to solve and in the end find out the true path the person took.

"montera_iulian","8","7","11","23 October 2010"," A great story about ""what-ifs"" and the incredible aspect of time..
","Jaco van Dormael surprised me with this non-linear story about the meanings behind the time as an adjuster of life... There is no explanation for the end but more of a question about it: the what if segment of life. What if the end is no near what we think it is? What if the end is reversible and any action we performed in life we could reperform after the so-called end. The point of this movie was, without a doubt, to make yourself think about the different possibilities of this deep question about everything we know. By the look of that, I agree that this director is a big fan of Kubrick's Odyssey since this movie kind of challenges the same system of beliefs. It's a powerful film, emotional I could say since it delivers a lot of messages about love, hate, insanity, about what is sanity, about loneliness and progress. It's a beautiful work and I had to give this movie credit for being not that original but much more interesting and well executed than ninety percent of the movies released in the last years.<br/><br/>The cast was my big problem. I couldn't actually like anyone besides Jared Leto. They all seem dull with their characters and had a flat approach for them. The characters though were developed good and you could always connect pieces from each different story without having a hard time. The best part of this movie I tend to say it was the editing which was simply great, lots of beautiful shots arranged in the proper order... That's what kept me interested in the movie besides the story: what should I expect from this scene? where will the movie head after this scene? and so on... By the way, the soundtrack fitted the movie almost perfectly.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to any person who enjoys smart story lines and interesting characters. This movie could have been executed better, without a doubt considering the decors could have been a little bit better, but it impressed me how much the director did with so little..."

","This movie is, in my opinion, very before its...time. A tale about string theory and the temporal ambiguity that is known as ""time"". At its heart the film is about one man, Mr. Nobody, and the choices he made in life now dying at age 117. The film thrusts us through several scenarios. Three girls that he may marry, but to keep it believable, only two that he loved, and only one true love. Throughout the narrative we see Mr. Nobody working as a narrator himself about space, time, sex, and life as we have come to understand it. Then all of that is deconstructed and brought back to a simpler level which we can understand. Can something simple lead to greatness or perhaps to downfall depending on how you choose? Can a person be sure when they make a choice that it is the right one --when the stakes are so ultimately high? This movie searches through all those choices and all of the ultimate endings and finds something truthful. There is no right choice, everything has meaning, and whatever happened is what was supposed to happen. Perhaps something tragic occurred, but it had meaning--as do all of the things we decide day by day and minute by minute. The references to string theory and the big crunch (as well as the scenes on Mars) make this a fascinating film and will inspire your inner geek. The soundtrack is brilliantly combined with the scenes and brings to mind both angst and an innocence not of this generation. I was impressed with the younger actor Tony Regbo (Nemo-- age 15) and I expect even better things from him in the future. In the end, I would ""choose"" to watch this film again and again, if only to remind me that in life nothing is insignificant. It also makes me believe in unimaginable imagination of a nine year old boy and where the future may lead us."

","People have said that this a film about all the choices that a person can make in their life. It's sort of true but in this case it seems to me that it's about a boy who lives outside of linear time. He can see the future which as we later discover is an aspect of linear time which is the same as the present and past to Nemo. <br/><br/>He, as the old man at the ""end"" of his life, recounts what he did during it. However as someone outside of time as we perceive it , every choice that he could have made he actually did. So stories branch and split again. What happens in each timeline is governed by the Theory of Chaos, so a small change in one place can have a dramatic effect elsewhere, i.e. The Butterfly Effect which is demonstrated in the film by the boiling of an egg in South America and heavy rain as a result in New York which washes away a telephone number of importance to Nemo. So even though Nemo's relationship, in different timelines, with three women is at the heart of a lot of the film different outcomes within each timeline is also shown. Even within his own timelines what happens to him on a personal level can be different depending on various possibilities. So in some he dies or is in a permanent vegetative state. <br/><br/>Complex ideas in astrophysics, chaos theory and the multiverse theory have been translated into a movie of real complexity. Did the director succeed? Well yes and the end, which disappointed some, is actually referred to by Nemo in his cosmology TV programme presenter timeline and as a comment made by Anna, a love interest in many timelines but not in this instance, when she tells him that she's on Mars doing measurements to prove the hypothesis of the Big Crunch which is the reverse of the Big Bang. She also, as a throw away comment, mentions that it'll start at a specific time on a specific day which we know will be the exact time of his death. So the film ends with him laughing as the timeline rewinds and everything goes in reverse; the Big Crunch."

NOT when you do it throughout the whole film. A film, like anything else, needs rhythm: buildup, release, etc; this one was more like one monotonous tone (full of beautiful scenes that have no relation to one another). I suppose the director was totally focused on the scenes on itself, thinking WOW this looks great, but he forgot that a movie is not just about pasting nice scenes after one another.<br/><br/>In Mr Nobody we jump from scene A to C to B to Z and every scene is full of effects and even more jumps in time.

Sarah Polley, an actress who can't seem to break into anything other than supporting roles, shows real talent and brings slap-in-the-face realism to her character, Elise.<br/><br/>While special effects seem to be what makes or breaks a movie these days (hint: if the entire movie is a special effect, it's not very special any more), this film uses them to great advantage. The transitions between scenes of the alternate realities presented are well done, not too overwhelming, and do somewhat mimic the human minds dream process.<br/><br/>That all sounds like positive feedback, and you may be wondering why I give this movie three stars. Where I have an issue is the basic storyline. I used the words boring, cliché, and predictable, which may seem out of place for a movie that, admittedly, breaks a lot of new ground in the cookie-cutter world of American Cinema.<br/><br/>Movies of this type seem to focus, really, on one thing: Such and such a man, trapped in time, going back over the events of his life.... and the women he loved.<br/><br/>I say movies of this type, because Fincher's Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Coppola's Youth Without Youth are almost the exact same movie, albeit with different twists and less dramatic special effects.<br/><br/>The whole ""... and the women he's loved"" aspect seems to be an excuse to throw in gratuitous nudity and longer-than-necessary sex scenes that, when viewed in context of the story being told, add absolutely nothing to the experience at hand. The majority of the storyline concerning Nemo and Anna added little to the overall story beside tits and sex scenes.<br/><br/>It used to be that slasher movies and B-films is where you found all the nudity and simulated sex. Thrusting and panting never used to make it to the big screen, and while it may be just a sign of the times, I find it detracts from the overall experience rather than adds anything to it. It's out of place, seems tacked on for the sake of putting asses into cinema seats, and is just a way to entice men into watching what would, otherwise just be another chick-flick.<br/><br/>That's why this film gets three stars from me. It's a run-of-the-mill chick-flick with snappy ""special"" effects and a healthy dose of T&A."

","I have to say, this was one of the best films I've ever seen in my entire life. Definitely THE most original, by a mile and a half. It's more than 2 and a half hours long and I loved every minute of it, didn't feel draggy OR superfluous at all. Any less and it just wouldn't work, I don't think, in fact, if anything, I think they could have spread out the ending a bit more. It felt just a little rushed for me, but definitely not a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>The dialogue, acting, etc etc was excellent (Tony Regbo I think his name is, Juno Temple and the actress who played Elise were all fantastic), but the cinematography and just the whole concept of it is what makes this film a class above the rest.<br/><br/>Overall, a gem. If you don't watch it, you're missing out."
"OJT","10","9","16","16 September 2012"," Life seen from another angle - the greatness we don't understand
","What have we done to deserve this? That's what this is about! It rises questions, without giving all the answers. This is not for the ones seeking action, Star Wars or those wanting light entertainment together with a six pack of beers. This is for the ones wanting something for the mind to chew on, and who is able to accept a story not following the Hollywood model storyline, maybe with a glass of fine wine. So then you're warned. I love all kinds of movies, but only at the right time. You gotta chose film after what you feel like watching.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is fabulous filmmaking about choices and coincidences in life. The opportunity taken, the opportunity lost. To be able to be there when it counts, to be in time, and to reach the train before it leaves the platform. About seizing the moment. About what we decide we are, and do. About the choices we make, or don't make, all life through. About the choices we should have made, or the choices we don't get to make, or that others do for us. How small choices affect our life's, and natures way, like in the butterfly effect.<br/><br/>It's also about what we remember, or are able to remember or forget. About time, about predictions and sentimentality, the longing for things like they were. Like we remembered them. About love and relationships, how we meet, and how we interact. It's also about different stages in life, aging and age-differences, and about feeling different and sometimes scared. About saying things are different than they really are. Why is it so difficult to know each other? Why do we fall in love? Why do we survive some accidents, and others not. About reality, and losing it, and maybe even regaining it... Too how big extent do we decide what we chose to remember. What did really happen? We're going in and out of life as a dream and a difficult situation.<br/><br/>Nemo is different from the rest of us. He wasn't touched by the angel's finger on his lips before coming to Earth, and remembers what should be forgotten. He understands and remembers more than the rest of us, and is also going to be older. We meet him thinking back, being 118 years old. But on the other hand he is also more confused, and understands less than us. About the reality and the fantasy we're dependent on in life. About what we see, and what we don't. He can also see into the future. He is both a nerd, and a common youngster, growing up. He is incredible.<br/><br/>This film ask questions. What do you see when you are looking at me? Are we what we look like? Why aren't we what we feel we are. Why do we have troubles accepting aging? Well, all this runs through my mind when watching this fabulous movie. It's all right up there where I want a philosophical film to be. A film about the greatness in life, which we don't understand. <br/><br/>What Nemo does in this film, is showing us how life is never just the way you plan it, and that the troubles ahead in life, can have a reason, though maybe one you don't understand. I'll bear this film in mind when I see a tramp or a woman citing insane. It's most certainly not of their own choice, but it ended up this way, anyway...<br/><br/>Belgian Jaco van Dormael has been working for 13 years on this film, and this is truly amazing on all levels. The soundtrack is out of your dreams. All the actors do a great job, and I've never seen Jared Leto better. A perfect cast for this film. His eyes are almost a necessity to this film. Nemo is a allegory for Jules Verne's captain Nemo, trying to find the mysteries of life under water. Nemo is afraid of water, but still under it a lot of time. Ne mo is originally taken from Latin - nobody. You could also perhaps see this backwards as an Omen?<br/><br/>What have the filmmakers done to deserve that not so many more went to see this in the cinemas? Well, make it right. Set off time, without any interruptions. Turn your phone off, turn your life off for a couple of hours, and drift into the world of Mr. Nobody.<br/><br/>The film is better for those who have lived for some years, as it is brutally honest. Still there's much life wisdom for youngsters to get here. But you better not be too young! It's a true gem! Absolutely amazing filmmaking! Thanks for making this! A future classic!"

","Hand in hand with Fifi, my beautiful partner of more than two months, I waited in a very long line at the cinema for the chance to see this much anticipated and buzzed-about masterpiece.

","""Mr. Nobody"" is a movie about the possibilities and the choices we make in our lives. The film is absolutely believable even though most of the plot turns out to be child's fantasy. Different stories are mixed very well. Even though one can predict the wanted effect was to confuse the audience it isn't in a naive way. The viewer feels something strange is going on but doesn't know what exactly until the end. The leading idea that I saw wasn't ""what happens to the characters"" but what would be different in my life if for example 20 years ago i didn't take the train but the bus. ""What if""... what if I woke up 2 hours earlier today, what if I decided to walk to work, would I meet the love of my life? Is that chance lost for good? Or maybe according to the choices we make different people are meant for us? Does our path change it's direction every time we make a choice? Or nevertheless what we decide it leads us to one destination in the end? Am I a person who takes decisions and is responsible for them? Or do my decisions form me as one? Am I somebody or nobody? ""Mr. Nobody"" is one of those movies that doesn't give you the answers, but the questions. It doesn't try to convince you in it's truths it just makes you wanna find yours. Even more it makes you wonder if there is any truth or false or does it all depend on what you choose."

","This movie is absolutely beautiful for the eye and ear. - Especially for the eye. Partly it feels as surrealistic as old Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch or Terry Gilliam movies. I thought this kind of movies died. I am glad to see, that there is a movie from the year 2009 that actually goes into that direction. Don't get me wrong, this movie is still something of it's own, just like Kubrick, Lynch or Gilliam have their own handwriting, so does Jaco Van Dormael. I don't know any other movies by him, but I'll try to find them. If you are a fan of surrealistic cinema, like me, get this movie.<br/><br/>I have 2 gripes about this movie. My first one is, that this movie is a bit of a claptrap. - Just like modern music videos or commercials. Everything is super-clean, over-dimensional and beautiful. And because it's absolutely beautiful, this gripe is obsolete.<br/><br/>My 2nd gripe can barely be excused. The ending gives a totally trivial explanation for... simply everything. The beautiful symbolism and mysticism of the movie has been destroyed along with this explanation. I don't understand why the director did that. If he would have left the movie be, without the last 5 minutes, I would have totally loved it. No real explanation, just alternative realities beside each other. I would have given the movie 10 points! Like this, I am a bit angered and disappointed. All meaning that could have been interpreted into the movie, is ruined.

","MR.NOBODY – CATCH IT ( A- ) Mr. Nobody is like a dream, a fantasy which came into life. Its one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen still it's not as confusing as Memento was. Mr. Nobody is really confusing and starts off with a 118yrs old man on the Mars looking back at his possible 3 lives. Confusing? Once you get the idea that it's about an old man who remembering his 3 possible lives with 3 women based upon his decision to live with his Mom or Daddy after their separation, and then the audiences will understand the whole concept. The editing of the movie is really confusing because we are shuffling between different parts of Nemo's life from Age 9, Age 15 to Age 34. Once we know what life belong to which female lead then its all clear, the audiences have to be active to understand and joint the puzzles back. The cinematography and color scheme of the movie is out of this world, it's simple yet very dreamy and imaginative. Jared Leto plays Mr. Nemo Nobody in Age 34. In all 3lives and in Age 118, he did a pretty fantastic job but I did feel like that Jared Leto is a Pretty man and looks gorgeous on screen with his blue eyes but if the director would have chosen some seasoned actor that movie could have gotten great recognition, actually more then its receiving. The budget of the movies is around $58 Million, which is a great investment on non-bankable actor like Jared Leto. Thomas Byrne (Nemo Age 9), the kid did a fine job with his big blue eyes. Laura Brumagne (Anna Age 9), Léa Thonus (Elise Age9) & Anaïs Van Belle (Jean Age9) looks really cute in the movie. However the Nemo who stole the show was Toby Regbo (Nemo Age 15), he was truly astonishing. His big blue eyes and his incredible acting chops in both three possible lives with Anna, Elise and Jean can be visibly seen. I think if he gets right roles he will be next Big Star in the making. Juno Temple (Anna Age15), she is one of the talented British actresses around who made her name with supporting roles till now. The chemistry between Toby Regbo and Juno Temple is the soul of the movie; all the scenes between them are beautifully shot and are brilliantly acted by them. Diane Kruger (Anna Age 34) looks pretty and acted well. Sara Polly (Age 34) was fantastic as neurotic wife of Nemo. Clare Stone (Elise Age 15) did a decent job and gave a nice characterization to Elise's character. Linh-Dan Pham (Jean Age 34) & Audrey Giacomini (Age 15) didn't have lengthy roles but they did a good job. Natasha Little as Nemo's mother looks really pretty and she acted really well. The only criticism I had was the ambiguous ending, though too me it seemed like Anna's life was Nemo's real life because the shot between Nemo and Anna in Age 34 re-uniting Again is shown in the end. Anyways still its one of the best cinematic experience I ever had, everyone should watch it with an Active mind only. You will love it!"

"xaniver","10","7","12","5 October 2014"," Outstanding in every way!
","This movie took my breath away, and continues to do so every time I watch it. This entire film hinges on an existential concept, that of choice and that in the moment before we make a choice, everything is possible.<br/><br/>Nemo as a child is presented with an impossible choice, and because he is unable to choose, everything is possible. This is where the movie spins out into the tangential and convoluted, dipping into quantum theory and various structuralist and deconstructionist philosophies. If you're looking for an action-orientated sci-fi flick, look elsewhere. This film is higher grade, requiring constant concentration - for about three hours! - and probably a second or third viewing to catch all the subtleties and nuances present not only in the obvious story, but happening in the background thanks to some truly fantastic cinematography.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is incredible in this film. He plays not one, but 12 iterations of adult Nemo, following the various trajectories his life could've taken given choices he could've made all stemming from the one he cannot make as a child. Of course, these various life trajectories becoming increasingly complicated and interwoven, becoming entangled with each other as Nemo's choices continue to change and distort reality.<br/><br/>This movie is at times contemporary romance, YA love story, sci-fi action (which some amazing scenes on Mars!), sci-fi thriller, high drama and family saga. All these threads weave together to create an epic tapestry that is difficult to digest all at once. I strongly suggest multiple viewings of this film, and it's so beautiful and with a stunning soundtrack, and so sincerely acted by Jared Leto who transforms physically and psychologically between the roles so effortlessly that I don't think setting aside three hours for this film more than once is such a tall order.<br/><br/>Mr Nobody is quite easily my favorite film of all time and I strongly recommend it to those who enjoy sophisticated science fiction that delves beyond the superficial aesthetic of a shiny future."

I just thought the movie was completely unoriginal and pretentious; there have been many movies before - The Fountain to name one - that have explored the same themes and executed to greater effect. After many (convoluted and schmaltzy) story lines about what might have happened in Nemo's (even the name is pretentious) life if he had made different decisions, in the end you'll find that the whole thing was absolutely pointless; the story takes you on this long long twisty journey only to lead you back to where you were.

I thought cloud atlas was a masterpiece though, while this goes down as simply amazing. My only real gripes are a few minor continuity errors, mainly the fact that people's accents seemed to change for no reason sometimes, and there were a few ways that I think the story could have been told in a slightly more coherent fashion. And furthermore, one of the realities didn't really make sense to me. I'm sure some of my complaints were intentionally put there because I think the viewer is supposed to be lost throughout this whole movie to some degree. Aside from this though, it was perfect.

","According to string theory, the universe contains nine spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension. Three of the spatial dimensions: length, width, and depth, and the temporal dimension: time, were deployed within our universe while the rest remained wound up together. ""What if one of the other six was temporal?""<br/><br/>Jaco Van Dormael's Mr. Nobody is a science-fiction drama that explores the concept of parallel universes existing for different possibilities for each branching point in our lives. The butterfly effect, so to speak, creates a divergence in universes. Will they ever converge once again? Just ask the second law of thermodynamics: As long as the universe continues to expand, entropy is always increasing (i.e. things can only spontaneously become more random or disordered). However, this never becomes a problem because no one is aware that alternate realities exist. <br/><br/>Yet, one man is. Nemo Nobody. <br/><br/>The entire film plays out almost like a dream. Recurrent images and sounds. Non-linearly spliced scenes. It displays the different ways one man could have lived his life based on the mere probability of a leaf falling one way or the other. The story can be both philosophically challenging and spoon-fed at times. Although it may come off as too pretentious, edgy, or complex, such cerebral stories should be executed in innovative ways and all ideas presented both complement the storyline and serve to enhance our understanding of the underlying philosophy. The film is also rich with subtleties. For example, I found the main character's name to be particularly odd and noticed it spells ""omen"" backwards. But it doesn't stop there. The film is just as emotional and poignant as it is thought-provoking. The viewer is tossed around the emotional spectrum as Nemo's back and forth transitions from being emotionally invested to a soulless bystander begin to make sense. Visually, it's incredibly imaginative and colorful. Perhaps even more enthralling is the music. The late Pierre Van Dormael (the director's brother) composed a sensational score from beginning to end. Not a scene goes by without at least some piano in the background. <br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is a treat for the heart, the mind, and the senses. Van Dormael has constructed one hell of a complete package.

","Having just seen Cloud Atlas, I felt I was well prepared to watch Mr Nobody since there would be multiple time-lines to keep track of.

But what if there was more than one time-dimension and it was possible to move between them, just as it is possible to move in our three well-known spatial dimensions? The plot is set and you wait for it to unravel in all its beauty. Then it falls apart. Miserably.<br/><br/>Apparently, Mr Nobody is born with the memory of past, present and future. This ability doesn't prevent him from making one awful choice after another. Each one of the time-lines he pursues leads to misery and woe. There is no happiness in his future no matter what choices he makes. This is finally revealed in the last 15 minutes of the movie (SPOILER ALERT) when his life is likened to a forced move in chess - where the only possible moves are poor moves. Two and a half hours of pain and anguish and THAT'S the lesson??? Why oh why? What does this movie teach us? (Because it isn't meant to entertain us, that's for sure.) That life is hard and sometimes you're just born to live a horrible life? That even if you can predict the future, you can't change it? <br/><br/>I will not call this the worst movie ever, because it is shot beautifully and the acting is great.

It was so cool to see all the different possible lives Nemo could have lived...made me think about how that would work with my own life. If you haven't seen this movie YOU HAVE TO. (I know I'm gong to beg all my friends to see it.) Just...watch it, even if it seems confusing, you'll grasp onto it very quickly. (Even I did, and I suck at following movie plots)<br/><br/>P.S.

Every single element of this film is amazing: the sets, the sound design, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the special effects, the acting, the plot, the in-universe mythology; everything comes together to make this film AMAZING and I had to watch it twice to catch everything I had missed before. If everyone in the world had to watch this movie I think our whole society as we know it would change. I can literally not recommend this movie enough, I tell everyone I meet to watch it. I watch it at least once a week, even though I wish I could watch it everyday. This is one of those movies that one can watch endless amounts of times before it even get remotely redundant.

","How could I have missed this?<br/><br/>Jaco Van Dormeal is an artist!<br/><br/>You really need to see his 2 previous films, but this is a review of ""Mr.Nobody"".<br/><br/>This is a remarkable film. It is Science Fiction (And the special effects are VERY good). It is a romance. It's hard to label it any one thing.<br/><br/>Put down your ipad, put away your phone and WATCH this movie. If you don't you will miss something. There are few wasted shots, few unnecessary lines. And yes, it's VERY hard to follow. There are three major story lines, but each has their own branches. <br/><br/>Jato Leto is fabulous. This was done just before he was nominated for an Oscar in ""Dallas Buyer's Club"", and you can see why he took a break between these two films. He is so many characters and yet remains the same.<br/><br/>The movie I saw was the standard release on Netflix. I understand the Director's cut is the only one you should watch, so go get the blu-ray so you can get a better understanding of the story Mr. Dormeal intended to tell.<br/><br/>One other note. The music is very nice, appropriate, and memorable. This is the last movie in which the director's brother, Pierre, contributed before his untimely death. As in the two previous efforts, it helps set the stage.<br/><br/>This one is worth the effort. I can not recommend it enough."

","I am a big fan of Christopher Nolan, so no disrespect intended.

The narration is bold and unnatural, so pay attention and don't ridicule it from the beginning.. because at the end, everything fits perfectly. <br/><br/>Another IMPORTANT note... an understanding of quantum probability wave, Schrodinger cat, and the big bang inflation theory (time reversal when universe expansion stops and contraction begins) are required to completely understand the ending.

"jonruff108","10","5","8","6 August 2014"," One Of My Favorite Films of All Time
","Everything about this film amounts to perfection; this is where film making and art start to blend together. The amount of artistic value in this movie is staggering. Special and visual effects are gorgeous, making excellent use of their simplicity. The cinematography... Where do I even start? It's absolutely phenomenal in every sense of the word. Some of the shots are so inventive and smart my jaw was (unknowingly) hanging open at times.<br/><br/>Set design is excellent as is the sound design. Editing is a work of wonder. The film is so perfectly paced that it never gets boring and constantly keeps your attention. This is of course possible due not only to the editing but also the direction and use of a nonlinear plot. Direction is masterful. Jaco Van Dormael uses every resource at his disposal to the maximum and has an eye for the smallest of smallest of details, right down to the colors certain characters wear (he does this in a very specific manner).<br/><br/>Pierre Van Dormael composed one of the best soundtracks of all time for Mr. Nobody. His use of simple string instruments bring an emotional touch but it allows the film to breathe. There's also a wide selection of different songs used throughout the movie and it's all perfectly used. I don't normally like when unoriginal music is used in movies but when it's done with the precision and care that it was here it works out extremely well.<br/><br/>Every character is cast perfectly and each give incredible performances. Jared Leto, Juno Temple, and Toby Regbo are the standouts here. Each of their performances were breathtaking. Again, I don't usually enjoy having child actors in movies because they normally can't hold up to their adult co-starts but, once again, in Mr. Nobody it's different. I really hope Toby Regbo finds more work; he deserves it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the story. I already mentioned how the nonlinear plot is used excellently and keeps the film moving. The only time nonlinear films have worked so well were in Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" and ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>The story is written by Van Dormael with such care and attention it's astonishing. I first saw the film a few months before this review and as of this writing I still think about it nearly everyday. The amount of times I was able to relate to the main characters was something special. This is a very human film with a very human core. Sure, it asks questions about reality and time and space but really it's about the people and how they progress as the story moves on. <br/><br/>The film deals with a lot of heavy topics, some even controversial to certain religions (Christian among many others). This movie makes you think. It asks you questions and you, in turn, naturally start to debate them in your head as you watch. The film does an excellent job of keeping its viewers engaged in the story.<br/><br/>This isn't a film for everyone (hence the 7.9 rating with only 92000 votes). This is a very intellectual, philosophical, and emotional story. I think some could relate it to ""Inception"" because it deals with some similar themes that question reality and just the fact that it can be so incredibly confusing!<br/><br/>The way I perceived myself and reality changed after I watched this movie. Give this film a chance (it's even on Netflix). It amazes me how few people have actually seen this film. Even the late Roger Ebert never posted a review. <br/><br/>This is one of those hidden movie gems. It isn't any one genre for it spans all the way from science fiction to modern day drama to romance. It's impossible to describe to someone for a reason. Overall, it's a very refreshing take on film in this age of Transformers sequels and Avengers mash-ups. It's probably one of the most original and unique movies ever made."

"blanchflower1961","10","5","8","1 April 2014"," Blown away
","""Mr Nobody"", only the third film in around 20 years by writer/director Jaco van Dormael (the Belgian auteur, best known for the fantastic ""Toto the Hero""). This one was released in 2009, shown at festivals, but never properly distributed, and then re-released last year on Blu-Ray and DVD. It may disappear into obscurity, but I hope not as it deserves far wider appreciation. As it stars Jared Leto, perhaps his Oscar success will bring it some attention.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was blown away: 9.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>It doesn't feature a straightforward narrative, but as a result there is a lot of fun to be had piecing things together. I have watched the blu-ray twice in a couple of days, and it rewards repeated viewing. The film is by turns philosophical, funny, scientific, whimsical, romantic, tragic, spectacular, surreal and thought-provoking, with some clever, tricky filming (still trying to work out a mirror shot near the beginning) and a great soundtrack. Though van Dormael is Belgian, the screenplay is in English this time.<br/><br/>The non-linear structure depicts various alternate versions of main character Nemo's life playing out, varied according to both random events and key decisions he takes at different moments. There may be a nod to ""Sliding Doors"" here, but this one juggles a lot more alternatives, is much more surreal and has less rom-com and fewer Monty Python impressions (though there is a Terry Gilliam moment at one point). Each alternate scenario is distinguished by reasonably subtle variations in things like colour scheme and camera work. The overall look and design are fantastic. <br/><br/>Jared Leto plays Nemo in his various adult versions as well as, under ""Little Big Man"" style makeup, ostensibly narrating the film aged 117. But as he declares he is 34, he may be an unreliable narrator! The 117 year old Nemo is the final mortal: he is about to die, although for everyone else, medical advances have eliminated ageing, sickness and death. Naturally he is the subject of 24/7 media coverage, like some geriatric version of ""The Truman Show"". Another of the threads involves space travel, spectacularly realised like parts of ""The Fifth Element"" or ""2001"". I don't want to give the impression that this is some sort of mash-up of loads of other films though, because it is, for me, a real one-off. <br/><br/>And as clever and technically impressive as it is, this isn't just empty cinematic showing off either, because at the heart of things are Nemo's relationships with his parents and with three women in his life/lives, giving the film a real emotional core.<br/><br/>Jared Leto is excellent in his various guises, and there are some great performances in support, from Rhys Ifans and Natasha Little as his parents, Toby Regbo as teenage Nemo, and Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger and Juno Temple as some of the loves of his life at different stages."
"giuliannatdedono","9","5","8","2 January 2014"," A brain storm of concepts, lives and choices that makes you wonder about your own life
","Original Title: Mr. Nobody Title in Portuguese: Sr. Ninguém Directed by Jaco Van Dormael Produced by Phillippe Godeau Screenplay by Jaco van Dormael Cast: Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham Genre: fiction Countries: France and Belgium<br/><br/>This movie tells us the story of Nemo Nobody, the last mortal human on earth, 118 years old and about to die. A reporter enters in his room and interviews him about his life, then he starts to describe three different lives, that he could have if he had made other choices. Simple choices that could change all his path. Three different love stories, three different families, all starting with the decision of staying with his mother or dad, after they divorce. It's a very complex movie, with scenes out of order, mixed and you can't know until the end which path he chose. This movie makes you think about the power of choices, that once you go one way, you can't go back in time; but, for a moment, anything is possible and all ways are there for you. In his life with Elisa, he could be married with a depressive woman or be depressed with her death. Another path made him to marry Jeane, and be so bored that he tries to kill himself in their pool. The last way made him to live a romance with his step sister, Anna, and they are separated by their families, only staying together another time years later. However, he loses Anna in a short time, for consequences of simple choices he had made, like buying the cheaper jeans months before, what made an unemployed Brazilian guy cook an egg and the steam came until the USA, making it rain and erasing her phone number on his hand. But this life was the only one Nemo was a little bit happy with. I loved the idea on the end of the movie, that all this, all those lives, had passed in Nemo's mind in those seconds in which he has to choose between his mother and father, in a line train, a symbol of paths and directions, in his first big choice. We can see that scene of the last human man coming down as the kid realizes that when he didn't knew the future, he couldn't choose, but now he knows, he still can't choose, and runs away. This film made me think a lot about the power he have to change our own path with simple actions and choices, the power we have to transform our reality into another thing, starting with our own thoughts. Is a very good movie for those who want to see something different from the average movies. It's an original theme, with good actors, a story that gets you from the beginning to the end, and even after it ends, you still can't stop thinking about the messages it brings. The actors make you feel that what's happening is real, you buy what they are saying. The photography is really good, even when they are showing us a future that didn't happened yet, it's futuristic and realistic at the same time. The mix with concepts of physics is sensational, and it fits perfectly into the story, bringing that geniality to the plot.<br/><br/>Tagline: You have to make the right choice. As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible."

","it is not often I am impressed by a movie. I have seen it all, from the most thrilling of action films to the most complex of psychological thrillers. I have enjoyed, but I enjoyed, no more.<br/><br/>That was until I decided to watch this film and was plunged head first into a story so deep, so complex that I was left feeling stumped and flat out amazed by the amount of excellent and fulfilling storytelling. The story is complex and will swing you around at will, and will leave you guessing what is real and what is not. Every storyline (4 if memory serves) drags you in and does not let you go. The storyline involving Nemo and Anna had the most effect on me and, at the end of the movie, left me wiping a few tears from my eyes. Every scene is just so well done, and where chaos seems to reign supreme at first, at the end you begin to understand that every scene, every move and every plot point was a thing of logic, a necessity to an action we did not yet understand.<br/><br/>Another thing that caught my attention was the music, and how it complimented each scene. The soundtrack is not just full of artists you know and intended to tap your foot to, it really helps set the mood in every scene. Bravo.<br/><br/>This together with the excellent acting of the cast make this film, to me, an all time favorite that I will make sure to watch as many times as it deserves."

"atheerfouad","1","14","30","30 May 2016"," Philosophy and science fiction poorly examined!
","A very incoherent and unusual experience. Unfortunately interesting visuals and cinematography doesn't make up for a movie which doesn't hold our interest as this was one of the most boring experiences I ever had. I tried my best to focus on the weird events and connect with the characters but this just doesn't happen. There are multiple time lines and life possibilities for the main character which are individually not that interesting. As soon as you somehow get track of what's happening in one time line the director just throws you in another meaningless direction which follows the main character until his death. At the end the message I got was ""Our life is the sum of the choices we make"". There is no problem with the message but the way we got there is totally unappealing. It may also discuss philosophical ideas such as ""What would you make if you knew the outcome of a certain action?"" but in the end it's just not worth the journey. The big bang and crunch were for me the most interesting aspects of the movie but they didn't seem to correlate to the main character in any way other than that he knew when the big crunch was going to happen. Strangely enough ""It will bring order in our messed up ever-expanding life!"". I would rather have these theories examined from a religious point of view. As a consequence of our choices and actions we will be then judged and either rewarded or punished without relating to any religion in particular. In conclusion, the movie had a lot of potential in its basic premise, visuals and cinematography but wasted it all mainly on a boring unfocused love story and mixing elements which does not correlate to each other in any meaningful way."

How about this - if you're searching for someone who lives in the same city, pick up a phone instead of hanging out at the train station. If your wife is obviously disturbed, get her some help instead of just staring into her eyes. How about looking for some meaning OUTSIDE of the object of your affection? Could have been special, but it wasn't. Jared Leto, the boys who played the younger versions of him, and Ana were beautiful to look at - otherwise, a big waste of time for me.<br/><br/>IMDb - if that isn't a long enough review, you need to change you policy on 10 lines."

"cedarhillbreeze","2","3","4","30 January 2018"," Excruciating
","I had to create an account to rant about this movie. In short, it made me very angry. This is because it has such high ratings and everyone is basically in love with it. It's on everyone's list of mind blowing and life changing movies. <br/><br/>I, on the other hand, could not even finish it. It was so, so bad. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. <br/><br/>My biggest problem with it is the romance. The plot line is confusing, yes, but after watching Inception, I knew that confusing can be good, because when it all makes sense, it really is nice. No, this is bad confusing. It starts with talking about dimensions, time, the Big Bang, the String Theory and whatnot, and I, being a physics nerd, know probably more than the average person about those, so I got really excited. I didn't get my multiverse and two-dimensional time (???) speculations. <br/><br/>But that's not the biggest problem. I could have finished the movie if I just had problems with those. The romance in here is absolutely terrible. There are three plot lines basically where the protagonist has a relationship with three women. The protagonist, especially his younger version, has no personality, nada, zero. So, when you start with zero, you can't really do anything with it, so he doesn't progress much from zero throughout the movie. All his relationships start out shallow, and all his women are one dimensional, and where they have dimensions, they aren't flattering. So, during the entire time of viewing, I didn't find a single person with a three dimensional personality, which is funny in a movie that likes to talk about other dimensions so much.<br/><br/>This movie is trying to be innovative and different and jump between different plot points, but doing so it sacrifices character depth and development. And when you don't have those, you don't have a good movie. <br/><br/>I didn't get to the end because I couldn't continue watching 15 years olds ""epic"" shallow romance anymore. It was all such BS! It never explained why Nemo loved all those girls, and why those girls even married him in the first place!? This is what I'm confused about the most! Yes, they were pretty, especially the boy, but the movie seems to assume that that's all you need to marry someone! There was no connection about interests, clicking values, or that they were loners, or liked popping gum, or riding bikes. Not a single person said anything about liking anything. There was that one lady that disliked living and herself apparently, but that wasn't related to why she was with Nemo, and it never explained why he still loved her. Why? I wanna know! I wanna know how she would make your sunshine brighter, Nemo, how the way she laughs makes you forget where you are! Give me those little things that will make it all personal and not robotic fake shallow fondness cuz gosh her face is beautiful. <br/><br/>Terrible, terrible. I'm utterly and crushingly disappointed. I've had such high hopes for this, and it completely destroyed all of them. The guy's name was Nemo, though, right? I remember it was something weird."

","This film is great. I will have to get into the spoilers here so you have been warned. This film follows a man at age 120 at the near end of the 21st century as he reviews parts of his life to see if he made the right choices. Such as when he was nine his parents were separating. He has two choices, go with his mom or father. From there it has several alternate plays. <br/><br/>WITH FATHER: In this one, he has two loves. Both at age 16. His father is also disabled in one of them. For one love, there is the girl named Elsie who he loves dearly but she doesn't love him back. As she is in love with Stefano, a older man who she dated but broke up with. In one version of this, he dies while riding away in anger when she rejects him. A second version shows them married but she dies. Then he goes to Mars to throw away her ashes after death. A third version is where she is so hurt by not being with Stefano that she leaves him due to a terrible marriage. This is when he is 35.<br/><br/>Another reality leads to a second love. One named Jean. He vows to his father he will marry the first woman he dances with at a dance. He gets her and rides away with her. On one end he died from a bee hitting his helmet. On another end they get married and have two sons. But whole Jean loves him, he doesn't lover her. Opposite of Elsie. She feels this and he leaves her and the two boys to live his life out on heads vs tails. Heads being yes tails being no. This being when he is 35. <br/><br/>WITH MOTHER: On this end, he can see the future. His mother dates a new man and falls in love. He meets his girl named Anna one day in class. While during swimming, she asks him to join. On one end he says swimming is for idiots and she leaves angry. Only to see each other twenty years later confused. On the other end he admits his terrible swim techniques and she stays with him. When it is revealed her father is the man his mom is dating. Like their parents, they fall deeply in love and have a strong intimate relationship. The two parents leave each other, ruining all relationship he has with his mother. Five years later they meet again and are still in love. She gives him his number and the rain ruins the future call as it mushes the numbers together. Making it unreadable. He lives his life as a homeless man in pursuit of Anna. Giving up at 35 and sleeping on s bench to prove it but draws one final circle to show them. <br/><br/>It shows that while he experiences more love with the moms side (as Anna is his true love despite the turnout), he has a much better relationship with his father. As they got along on both ends but he almost hates his mother and she obviously hates him. Even more than he does to her. So who would you rather have, a strong love or a strong parent? <br/><br/>All versions of this take makes it very confusing which one is real. But that is the point. You don't know which one is real. Upon later in the film, he meets his older self who tells him to live to a certain time, to which he meets that time by only three seconds before he died. Once he died, everything turns back in time to show what really happened. <br/><br/>He ran away and didn't choose either and ran to the forest. Where he meets Anna for the first time in reality, and that starts their relationship that really did happen and end well. But seeing as he is the only human left, it is obvious she doesn't make it. <br/><br/>Really a great film. Truly makes you think about choices and such and how every choice can make a different reality. Hands down the best movie I seen all year. Please check it out."

","Recently I have watched the movie Mr. Nobody, and probably never had so many feelings and emotions after watching films. If you are bored of watching all these similar and easy predictable movies then this one is for you. From the beginning you understand that the movie is original and unusual. Nemo Nobody wakes up in 2092 as an old man, who became a participant of a TV-Show ""Last Mortal"" that is watched by immortal and already unfeeling people of the future. In his interview he tells the story of his life, well three its variants. On the question which of them was the right one he says ""Every path is the right path"". The film made me think about many things, especially how strong a little thing can change the entire life, and how often we have to make choices. But ""As long as you don't choose, everything remains possible"". The movie might seem to be unclear and strange, but this makes the film so great. However, when you are watching the end, everything becomes more understandable and you start thinking about everything you have just seen.

In fact, I saw the theatrical version as part of the Netflix streaming package; and the director's cut, which addresses all but one of what I consider ""flaws"" is available on Amazon streaming. My only criticism of both versions is the casting of Diane Kruger as the adult ""Anna"". Juno Temple, an adult actress who plays juvenile roles, is, again, world class, with the intensity needed for the pivotal ""Anna"". On the other hand, Diane Kruger, lacks both Ms. Temple's intensity and disproportionately large breasts, which makes it pretty hard to believe she is the same character. Better that Temple be aged with makeup or digitally. Nonetheless, ""Mr. Nobody"" emerges as one my Top 20 all-time favorite films. I give ""Mr. Nobody"" a ""9""."

","You need to watch this film with the right mindset. It's themes are kind of similar to Inception, but they've been delivered in a much better way and the film has a lot more to it. you wouldn't watch inception after a long day at work though.<br/><br/>That being said it's hands down the best film I've seen in years - It feels a little bit like everything inception could have been (in terms of the philosophical questions raised and general screwing with your mind a bit), but wasn't as Inception was designed for a much wider audience. In a similar way, because of the strong philosophical themes it has been left intentionally open to interpretation to an extent. Personally, I find this is part of the charm of the film. If you're expecting an absolute ending that's tied up with a little bow you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>It looks at the way choices can affect your life and follows Nemos thought process at different points of the film."

","""Every path is the right path. Everything could've been anything else. And it would have just as much meaning.""<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is a movie which shows the multiple possibilities a young boy's life could turn out when he is faced with a choice at a critical moment in his life.<br/><br/>The movie shows different timelines/possibilities where the life of the boy could head to depending on certain choices, all with their ups and downs. Some were more joyous than others, some more depressing, some more heartfelt etc. While it is impossible to show all the possibilities, the movie did it best to show as much as possible in the time frame it had without getting too crammed up or rushed.<br/><br/>Jared Leto plays the lead and gives a great performance, not surprisingly. And the accompanying cast also gives an almost universal good performance.<br/><br/>The movie does have this 'Inception confusion' effect where different stuff happening at different times could confuse the viewer and in addition to that, the movie has this thick layer of coat containing philosophical questions, science theories etc that one could delve deep into searching for more meaning or whatever, but in the end, the core of the movie is rather simple.<br/><br/>This movie really gripped me from the start and it didn't felt nearly as long as its 2 and half hour run-time. The cinematography was pretty nice and some illustrations, like the future world shown, was great.<br/><br/>A great watch which I would definitely recommend.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","Everything happened and yet nothing happened. And what exactly happened is what I wonder!!!<br/><br/>The whole story, as it went on, was just marvelous. First of all, I must give credit to Jaco Van Dormael for not only writing this great compilation of stories for the movie but also Directing it so brilliantly. It was just, Wow!<br/><br/>With so much of inter linkages between so many stories with the same characters, it was sometime just beyond imagination as to figure out what's actually going on. The movie has a character from future and his way past youth life, a triangular love story between lead character Nemo and 'Anna, Elise and Jean', not to mention it also portraits the possibility of human life at Mars after so many years.<br/><br/>One of the fascinating futuristic, funny, unbelievable line from the 118 years older Nemo was ""Before sex became obsolete?"". Now, you can immerse yourself in imaginations of human future with no s**.<br/><br/>Well, I hated one character from the movie - Elise, crazy character, what a bore! One more thing to mention from the movie is - it shows a lot of teenage love and adultery too.<br/><br/>Above all, you'll have to keep your eyes fixed on the movie, coz it's very interesting, I truly enjoyed the movie, and I'm sure you will too. <br/><br/>A must watch."

","Though I very rarely give a perfect score on IMDb, this movie deserved it. A stellar performance by Jared Leto drove home this film that left me disoriented, and satisfied. A true tribute to the essence of any psychological thriller in modern cinema. I have watched this with my friends over and over again since it was released, and it is still flawless. My friends even tend to get into arguments about how many different various lives Nemo experiences, and at what point in time this splits. I love this movie with a burning passion, and it is an outrage that it is not on the top 250. All in all, it was well crafted, ambitious, and novel in many ways. Quite honestly, I hope they never make a sequel for fear of tarnishing their work of art. Bravo."
"luzi_825","8","3","4","9 July 2015"," Wow...a difficult movie and a long review
","Before reviewing this film, I have to state that: - I rarely review movies, but I felt like the reviews are way off, either too good or too bad. - I do not care about photography, acting or other technical aspects as long as it is halfway decent and don't affect the plot. In other words, what I think makes a movie good is having a good plot, so I'm not gonna enter the other aspects here. - I really think people that hated it didn't understand the concept at all. And not because of sci-fi stuff, as I myself am but I merely admirer of the genre, and while I do enjoy the theories, I don't discuss physics and all. With that being said, let me explain further: *This movie portrays many different plot options at the same time. While it could be the series of decisions the 9-year-old would make if he were to choose mom or dad, it could just as well not be about that at all. I've seen people saying it could be the 9-year-old's IMAGINATION. Nemo states that he can see the future. If you believe that, his different life options could happen in the future or could just as well be happening as alternate realities. If you do not believe that, however, it could be just what he thinks would happen. There are more extents to which the movie could go, too. Old-Nemo states that he would go back in time when the universe reached that date. So the plot's beginning could be the old man and the decision HE makes would change his destiny into a younger version of himself, as time reverses. I demonstrated only four different possibilities , but there must be a lot more. That is what I think people didn't understand. It is not jut about one certainty, but rather what it COULD be. * There is also a misunderstanding about the different choices. They are not three, divided between the girls. There are a lot of ramifications to those realities. * Some people said that the scientific theories presented are just thrown there and they don't amount to anything. That is completely incorrect. The 9 String Theory is justified by what I explained could be different realities. The Big Bang reversing too. Also, at some point it is explained that people who can see the future can change it and change the past, and that, without time as a dimension, there would be no limits. That is used to hint that maybe Nemo either found a way to do that or could do it from the start because he ""wasn't touched by Oblivion"". That is yet another possibility for the film. All those realities could have been real at some point, but he changes the past as soon as something bad happens to retry again and can go to the future as well to see what his life would turn out to be if he kept that decision. The film is presented in that order for a particular reason that also hints at that. First, he went with his mother. He met Anna for the first time and said her friends were stupid. She got mad and, going to his future self, Nemo saw that Anna married someone else. So he went back to the past and said he couldn't swim. They then fell in love, but were separated at 15. At that point he freaked out and went back to his 9-year-old self. He chose, instead, to be with his father, which then lead to him meeting Elisa. He kissed her, but, the next day, she had that guy over at her house. He fled and had a motorcycle accident. He then changed the past again. And so it goes, generating different results each time he does that, similarly to ""Butterfly Effect"".<br/><br/>As a side note, I don't this movie means to actually portray love or family, but what it could be if he chooses it. I don't see it as a brilliant love story, which is why the kids don't matter - they are not important, because they are a ""what if?"".<br/><br/>Well, with all of that explained, the negative points for me were that the ending was not quite as good as I expected and that the movie was too long. They could've passed the same idea in much less time.<br/><br/>I will leave here a couple of things for other reviewers to think about: - It is also hinted that he could change the future and the past when old Nemo talks about the Architect. He said it was the 9-year- old. Maybe it wasn't just his imagination, but him actually trying that life out for himself before deciding. It could also have been a reference to God or to lucid dreaming. - What happens in the reality he did choose? Not to go with his mother or his father is a choice. Is that perhaps the real life he lead?<br/><br/>There are also a couple of points I didn't understand, and if you did, PLEASE message me: - The first time Nemo realizes maybe he can see the future, his father's car hits his mother. She was with a baby, but we never see it afterwards. Yet, the baby couldn't have died in the accident because the car only runs over her. After that, however, she doesn't even get hurt. How? - Why Anna? All the other realities either ended with him or one of the women being dead. Elise dies, so does Anna. Yet, at the very last ""ending"", he gets to be happy with Anna. Why? Is she his true love? Will that be what life leads him to if he is a runaway? <br/><br/>PS: The accents changing at times was on purpose to portray Nemo's confusion throughout his memories/ choices."

","Mr. Nobody is the type of movie that sticks with you for a bit after watching it, and a number of factors go into that. Jared Leto's stellar performance, the unique (and at times confusing) premise, and the stories told throughout are just some of the highlights.<br/><br/>The film opens in the year 2092, as 118 year old Nemo Nobody is the last living mortal on earth. As he nears death, he is asked to recall his life, and what follows is a jumbled recollection of seemingly contradicting accounts of what may or may not have happened in his life, focusing largely on Nemo at ages 9, 15, and 34. At first, the contradictions can be extremely confusing to the viewers (as well as those interviewing 118 year old Nemo), but before long you learn to accept it as a part of the movie's commentary on the impact the choices we make can have on our lives, and by the end of the movie, one can make sense of the contradictions.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Mr. Nobody is anchored by outstanding performances by Jared Leto, Toby Regbo, and Juno Temple, while the rest of the cast contributes performances that range from good to great. Clocking in at a little under two and a half hours, this film demands your attention with multiple gripping story lines involving drama, romance, coming of age themes, and some subtle science fiction. I would not recommend this movie to those who need to understand exactly what is going on at every point in a movie, but I would highly recommend it to everybody else (keeping the R rating in mind), especially those who enjoy a good mind bender."

","Mr. Nobody is a story about love. However, the film is surrounded with ideas. The ideas presented in the film are extremely complex and convoluted (if I may say so myself).<br/><br/>I believe, in order for someone to truly understand Mr. Nobody's story than, you really have to pay attention to all of the details.<br/><br/>Big bang, string theory, 9 spatial dimensions 1 temporal, choice, multiple life paths, time reversal, quasi immortality, human body endorphins, depression, and love are just parts of the ideas that are presented in Mr. Nobody's story. Personally, I became frustrated and lost just thinking about all of the ideas that where presented to me in this film.<br/><br/>Choice. Choice plays a huge part in this film. ""It's hard to choose. You have to make the right choice."" - Nemo Nobody: Age 9<br/><br/>Multiple life paths. Multiple life paths has the utmost importance in the film. ""Each of these lives is the right one! Every path is the right path. Everything could have been anything else and it would have just as much meaning."" - Nemo Nobody: Age 118.<br/><br/>Depression. Depression is scattered throughout the film. Depression is involved with every character. ""Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps."" - Google.com ""I often have this dream. In prehistoric times, (a bear is threatening one of Nemos alternate time line wives). I can hear you screaming (Nemo is trying to intimidate this bear while protecting his wife). I chase the bear away and you're not afraid anymore (after a while, the bear finally backs down and walks away). When I wake up, there's no bear, and you're still afraid; and I'm not a bear hunter. I'm an executive at a plant that manufactures photocopying machines that just quit his job. I don't dare to move, I don't live, and whatever I do is a disaster. I would love to chase the bear away and for you not to be afraid anymore."" - Nemo Nobody: Age 34<br/><br/>Love. Love is ultimately the basis for Mr. Nobody. ""Forever (Nemo is talking to his main love). There is no life without you."" - Nemo Nobody: Age 16<br/><br/>The film and Mr. Nobody himself are filled with ideas. In my opinion, I believe that some ideas work and some don't. Some ideas in the film are confusing to me. I really didn't know anything about string theory, 9 spatial dimensions 1 temporal, and human body endorphins. The film did explain itself but, I felt like some things where left up to interpretation (everything that was mentioned in the film I did check into).<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody (in my opinion) is a great movie. However, I do believe that Mr. Nobody suffers from an exhausting, extremely complex, complicated, and convoluted story. Mr. Nobody definitely has to be viewed more than once."

","I'm learning English so probably some sentences are not going to make sense but I'll try it anyway. A lot of people say sh*t about this movie but the true is that they didn't comprehend the story, because it tell more than just one normal story as other movies do, it tell all the possibilities that Nemo Nobody ( main character) could live. All his different lives are made by his decisions over the years of his life.<br/><br/>When you see it for the first time you'll be like ""what is going on?"" but see it again, and the scenes will make more sense but you""ll still be lost, so I recommend stop and think which Nemo is he, the one that is rich or the one that is happy or could be the poor one.

By the end I was left with compelling and contradictory ideas that left me perplexed but I can honestly say it was worth every minute and for this simple reason ..at its core ""Mr Nobody"" is about love and the almost impossible choices that we have to make. It is existentialist to its core and touches on string theory, quantum theory, (but in an easy to understand way) and the consequences of the choices we make. And yet after thinking on the movie as a whole, it is about intense pain ..being torn between two loves and having to choose.

","Wow, this movie kept me at the edge of the seat the entire 141 minutes. It's been a while since I wrote a review here, but this movie really deserves it.<br/><br/>First I have to admit that I'm a fan of original movies which explores philosophical and psychological dilemmas/issues (Cube, Donnie Darko, Memento, Matrix to name a few). This movie really takes it a notch further with it's constant switching between numerous alternative chain of events so that you never know what to expect next. But the cutting is always done with finesse so somehow the scenes always fits together in a logical (or emotional) way (which may not be apparent until after wards). The cinematography is beautiful and really helps strengthen the story telling. The acting is top notch, especially Jared is great.<br/><br/>I won't spoil to much of the story, but I recommend that you see this movie with an open mind, and don't try to make sense of everything that happens. After a while the pieces will start to fall into place (although I admit I don't fully grasp everything after the first viewing). If you can do that, you're in for a hell of a ride!"

","I am an avid Jared Leto fan and have seen almost every movie he's been in from Basil to Lord of War and I have to say Mr. Nobody is probably my favorite. The movie shows that one decision can change your entire life and that no matter what you do there will be a consequence. Jared was the perfect fit for Nemo Nobody and I can't wait to see it in theaters on September 26th! It all begins with the divorce of Nemo's parents. Soon it escalates to the woman he will marry. Will it be Jeanne, Elise, or Anna? Then it becomes how he will live his life and how it will end. The results may kill him or help him find out who he really was. The story is difficult to understand because it is told by Nemo when he is 118 years old and the last human alive. He has a hard time remembering what happened when he was younger. But the moral of the story is thought provoking and may just make you think harder about your life along with how you're living it. This is a must see movie that I believe children over 10 will love and enjoy."

","The film Mr.Nobody was very confusing in the beginning, skipping from one frame to another, one possibility of reality to another and you don't really see what's happening. However it is all done very beautifully and elegant. It focuses on this boy torn between his parents and has to make an important decision, go with his mother, or stay with his father. <br/><br/>There was no set storyline as it is kind of the point, but a very powerful message that the film on a whole does manage to send is the repercussions of any decision. As you watch this film you sort of watch all of his decisions play out and what different versions of life he could have as a result of his decision at any given moment at any given time in his life. However I feel that this side is only just scratching the surface off what the true meaning is behind this film and there is in fact more depth to it than the importance of making decisions. <br/><br/>However behind just the importance of decision making there is an idea presented by the film that these alterations and versions of his life is all as real as the other. It isn't necessarily how decision making can be very problematic but more of how all of the alternations already exist. When we see Nemo as an old man looking back at his life he remembers all of the different alterations and not just one set path, he even had the ability to talk to his younger self and alter his course of life. Nemo could affect what happens and will things to happen and that is a very important thing to think about.<br/><br/>So what exactly does that mean, well I think it tears down what we see as time and space completely. Time is not a constant forward moving motion and what has happened can be reverted.There is not one moment but instead infinite moments in time which are happening at the same time with infinite possibilities. What is even more interesting is that we control that, we can decide for what we want and we don't live by the will of destiny or something. Not at all, but instead we will those things and happenings into existence, whether it's the fortunate moments or the misfortunes. Just as Nemo had the ability to change the course of his life, we too could create our own reality."

I would love to see it on the big screen with surround sound. This is the kind of movie you can get lost in. I was amazed at how many people were involved in making this film. I was also surprised at the number of locations. I stopped the credits several times to read the details. I really think you should consider a new release here in the states. It should include enough pre reviews with the media so people are aware of how terrific this movie is. Even though it is available to purchase, I would pay to see it in a theater.

Then the story begins; its about a man called Nemo Nobody and the life he has or might have if he makes a certain decision. Should he choose his mother and run to catch the train? Should he choose his father and stay? As long as he doesn't make a choice there are many possible lives he can have. Another question is: Which is the right one?<br/><br/>In this theme director Jaco van Dormael presents the butterfly effect, the paradox of theory and the chaos theory more than perfectly. We see a man go with his father meet the love of his life and push her away by saying something stupid and meet her accidentally in a train station, and on the other hand he says the right thing, they fall in love when their parents get together, lose each other because their parents split up, and meet again after 20 years of searching for one another without thinking about career and success. If he goes with his dad there is another sequence of events. He meets Elise, and they marry each other; She might die on an accident and he ends up going to mars to carry out his promise or they have 3 children but he is not happy because his wife is depressed. Else he doesn't go with Elise but he marries Jean without any love but becomes powerful and rich, he ""reaches the top"". So Nemo is in an impossible dilemma which life to choose. This dilemma he overcomes with the opinion that ""every path is the right path"".<br/><br/>Mr Nobody is a film that can make you talk about it for days. Its meaning, its ending, the choices he can make. It makes you wonder about all the decisions you made in your life and puts a lot of ifs in your mind. It's surreal in a very beautiful way, dramatic and breath- taking when it should be and not excessively touching.

","It's amazing how Jaco utilizes a lot of science theories into a larger than life movie that is a masterpiece, not just thought provoking, but truly a masterpiece. This movie is the modern day 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br/><br/>Jared Leto proves the fine actor he is as playing Nemo young and old. So many concepts and theories this movie talks about. <br/><br/>With the String Theory, think of guitar strings. If the strings are loose there is no music to be made, but when the strings are tight as can be, music will be made. String Theory is the same concept, when the strings are tight as can be, the theory is parallel universes can be created or something can be made. The spatial dimensions run in length, width, height. The supposed 4th dimension that Leto's character talks about in the movie is Temporal which is time. <br/><br/>So all this ties together when Nemo as a boy has to make a choice by either going with his father or mother. Since the boy was never given the mark by the Angel of Oblivion, he can remember everything, he forgets nothing and he can see into the future. During that point of the boy having to make the decision to go with his mother or father, he sees so quick into the future in both directions, what life would be with his father, and what life would be with his mother, he sees it all in that moment of having to choose which one to go with. His seeing into the future both directions are so tight(the strings are so tight), that within his 4th dimension of time, he creates the supposed 5th dimension, the parallel universes. Nemo creates a bunch of different multi-verses and they're real within they're universe. <br/><br/>So Now Leto lives a bunch of lives in alternate universes. Who knows if we all as human beings create many parallel universes within a dream that is so intense or a fantasy in our day dreams. Perhaps in our moments when the strings are so tight, we create parallel universes and perhaps there are many versions of ourselves living in multi-verses like Nemo in Mr. Nobody. <br/><br/>So with Nemo seeing which way to go, with father or mother, he finds out through his search that in order to be truly happy, he needs to end up with Diane Kruger's character, Anna, because he loves her so(in order to do that, not go with either parent). Nemo finds out if he goes with Polley's character, even though he loves her whether she lives or dies, it will ultimately be doomed, and Nemo himself will ultimately be doomed physically and emotionally if he goes with Jean. <br/><br/>But in the end, Nemo loves Polley's character,Elise, but through everything, Nemo ultimately, is truly in love with Anna. Through the Butterfly Effect, Nemo makes little tweaks and changes in order to be with Anna, but he is ultimately doomed whether it be from his innate fear of water or from her ending up with someone else. With any innate fear, it is said what you put in the universe will ultimately come back to get you which is sometimes your worst fears. Just the slightest little things done or said determines whether Nemo will ever see Anna again or whether he will marry Elise or be with Jean. <br/><br/>Nemo comes to the conclusion that the only way for him to truly live a long and wonderful life with Anna, he has to have her end up in the chalk line circle that he makes. Through Chaos theory that nothing ever happens the same way, Nemo is not 100% certain that she will end up in the circle, but that is the only way he can truly be with her after his many different multi-verse journeys. As when Nemo is in the purgatory moment where he is watching a video of his older self, he realizes what he needs to do and that it is real, but yet it's not, it's not the reality he wants to be in. <br/><br/>So Nemo has to live his life as a wanderer, a homeless vagrant perhaps and when he awakes, Anna is in the chalk circle. All love prevails. Schrodinger's Cat comes into play here, with everything that came into play, Nemo made the probability that Anna would end up in the circle through this and that err lifting the box to see if the cat was there so to say. <br/><br/>With Quasi Immortality it has been found that cloned pigs can reproduce human organs, this part is a fact, but not highly sufficient yet.<br/><br/>Finally, with the Big Bang theory, in simplest terms it was the expansion of the universe to expand to where we are now. So with The Big Crunch, it is in simplest terms the reverse of the big bang, where everything goes back into a black hole whether it just goes back or whether humans go back in reverse with it according to the Arrow of Time.<br/><br/>If one was to go in reverse in the Big Crunch, one would have to be living, as one would have to have neurons in order to do this. If one is dead, there are no neurons anymore, hence, you couldn't go in reverse. So when Nemo dies, he still has neurons in his body as he has 'just' died, so when the big crunch begins, Nemo goes in reverse. One of the best endings, in my opinion, ever, as far as when Nemo starts laughing as he's going in reverse. Truly epic ending to an epic film. <br/><br/>Since our multi-verses would produce neurons as well, perhaps all those multi-verses would go in reverse as well in the Big Crunch. But again this is all in theory. But not to Mr. Nobody, he lived it!!"

","When I first heard of Mr. Nobody I had no idea what to think. The poster just intrigued me. So looking at the trailer I quickly gained more interest into the film Then I saw it. I LOVED it. I loved it so much I watched it about 4 more times. I just love the movie. And usually I don't want to review movies on IMDb unless I want to talk about them. Mr. Nobody is a film I want to talk about now. <br/><br/>STORY LINE: The story is kinda confusing here. Anyways, Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is 118 years old. This is the world of quasi-immortality. NO ONE can die. But he is the last mortal. So he will be the last to die. During the course of his life, he tells many tales. He then at age 9. Is given a decision go with his mom (Natasha Little) or his dad (Rhys Ifans) And with this decision he meets 3 lovers. Anna (Diane Kruger) Elise (Sarah Polley) and Jeanne (Linh-Dan Pham) My only problem with the story line is that. There are some things that need to be explained. Like why at the end of the film, they have him going backwards through time? Why in the begging of the film when he is living with Elise he gets a picture of him and Jeanne and the mailman is walking backwards. However I think the story is completely brilliant and great. So see the film for the story aspect. <br/><br/>CHARACTERS & ACTING: Going into Mr. Nobody I wasn't expecting any great acting. But it was good. Kinda underused though. Jared Leto is good. He doesn't look lost at all and he seems like he is trying to guide the audience along perfectly. They underused Sarah Polley, Linh-Dan Pham and Rhys Ifans in my opinion. Sarah is probably the best but she has like 30 minutes of screen time. Rhys is like maybe 15 minutes. And Linh gets around 10-15 minutes. the characters are great and well memorable. Especially Elise. And Nemo predicting the future idea was kinda cool also. <br/><br/>ETC: Jaco Van Dormael is the director. He is very good at visual effects and storytelling. And it SHOWS in this. He obviously is very talented. I also like Pierre Van Dormael's OST to the movie. The visuals just POP out onto the screen and the meanings of the film make a lot of sense. Other then that I love the movie and you should to."

","I finally had the opportunity to watch this incredible film where Jared Leto, once again, amazed me with his great acting abilities. Though I'm not usually one for the sci-fi genre, this movie was different in that it was exciting, sad, romantic, and REAL. The word ""real"" is very relative, but I feel it's appropriate here: Every individual character had a purpose, no matter how much they actually showed up in the movie. Leto's character development was absolutely beautiful and, as usual, his emotional connection was spot-on. The artistic aspect—both in the script and scene editing—is phenomenal as well. I would suggest this to people who like strange and inspirational plot lines with many unexpected twists and turns. To sum it up, it was great."

","A man close to death ponders the many lives he might have led in this fantasy from director and screenwriter Jaco van Dormael. Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is 117-years-old, ill and facing his last days as he looks back on his past and a particular crucial moment -- at the age of nine, Nemo's parents divorced, and as his mother (Natasha Little) and father (Rhys Ifans) stood on a train platform, he had to choose who he would go with, and whether he would live in the United States or Great Britain. Either choice would bring with it a wide variety of possibilities regarding the sort of life he would lead, and Nemo imagines nearly all of them, including two different wives -- sweet but emotionally blank Jeanne (Linh-Dan Pham) and lovely but troubled Elise (Sarah Polley) -- and another woman, Anna (Diane Kruger), who he loves but can not marry. But as Nemo considers the many different paths his life could have taken, his memory begins to fail him, and he finds it increasingly difficult to be certain which was his real life and which is a product of his imagination. Mr. Nobody also stars Thomas Byrne as nine-year-old Nemo and Toby Regbo as Nemo in his teenage years. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"

"karimmusallem","Null","4","6","6 January 2014"," what if?!
","I watched this movie over and over again and each time I tried to understand it It became harder to grasp, just like a maze...I actually failed to understand the complicated dynamics, mechanics of the movie. In fact the movie is a compilation of three different lives (each with sub stories if I might add) occurring at parallel times all because of one impossible choice that a boy had to make. Then it hit me, maybe this movie doesn't want to be understood on a superficial, material, 3 dimensional level, so from an intrinsic approach I took a second look and here is what came to mind: The movie deals with the concept of entropy. That each choice we make results in different sets of outcomes. It becomes exponential and infinite scenarios can happen. All begins with the boy running after the train to be with his mother or stay with his father and from there on choices and outcomes stack up. This concept makes us powerless and powerful at the same. Powerless because every choice we make no matter how minor it is Will Dominate us and it will define our future life, even if we try to change or have regrets we will not be able to. Powerful because that choice we make no matter how small or minor it is, causes a butterfly effect and cataclysmic results over a period of time. Some of the choices are imposed on us due to external factors also due to the butterfly effect, rendering us prisoners of our ""imposed"" choices but also shows us the connectivity of this universe we live in. It's like the infinite and the tangible are intertwined...how can that be? The movie tried to reconcile these two contradicting states and tried to resolve this paradox. This can be really intricate so I guess the only way was to revert to fiction, by making the boy a clairvoyant in the future or even a time traveler for all I know, and in some scenes he's pictured as omnipotent, all in the purpose to make accessible to the viewer all these different cause and effect scenarios while what actually occurred remains a mystery, at least for me, which is irrelevant in my opinion to the topic of discussion. This movie made me feel helpless and strong at the same time. Made me sad that I could not actually engineer my own destiny and will be forever captive of the ""what if"" concept. but on the other hand it also made me happy because no matter how infinite the universe is along with its parameters, we have a life and should make the best out of it. Let's just hope we make the right choices to get the maximum happiness we wish for."

","This is a delightfully creative and original film which is much more immediately satisfying (that is, scene by scene) than it is satisfying as a whole. The end is likely to leave you feeling flat and unrewarded for the time you have invested in the film. Not to say that it is unpleasant at all, but the sheer seriousness of the piece demands it to be thought about, and if thinking about films is not your cup of tea, then do not watch this!<br/><br/>Many films have a nice little innovative moment which is typically the bit you look forward to even though you may have watched it a hundred times. This film is composed almost entirely of those interesting innovative moments which perhaps do not work entirely as a whole, but they are still novel to watch. <br/><br/>Mr Nobody suffers from a serious lack of humour. It's wistful and playful approach to the whole film-making process almost makes up for this, but I think not entirely. It's pure earnestness is admirable, brave and typical of much lower budget art-house movies, but it is a little wearing to watch the whole two and a half hours without any genuine light relief. <br/><br/>There are breathtaking moments or artistry, lovely philosophical points and a joyful almost juvenile approach to the story which is fun and profound at the same time. But you do find yourself expecting a big pay-out at the end... a big 'reveal' or twist... but I would say it doesn't come. Others will surely think it does. That alone makes it worth watching."

The characters have such vitality and are so tangible I feel like I know them. The film is visually beautiful but uses a number of techniques to keep the viewer off balance; Worlds contrast violently, sequences are purposely disjointed, vista shots suddenly become closeups, dreams become reality.

There are so many mistakes that could have been made; so many ways this movie could have gone bad. <br/><br/>But somehow Jaco Van Dormael has pulled it off, and perfectly! It's mind blowing! It's one of those films you have to see twice before you can really put all the threads together and fully appreciate the explosion of genius that you just witnessed.<br/><br/>Not many directors, if any, could pull it off like Jaco has done here. I think he was able to succeed because he was the writer too; it was his baby through and through. Directing something like this would otherwise be impossible without that kind of intimate knowledge and passion for the material.<br/><br/>The writing is incredible. The directing is incredible.

It might make your head hurt a bit at first, but hang in there - and see it twice."

"pomeroy-nick","9","4","6","5 July 2011"," Mr. Nobody, a film about memories, origins and relationships.
","Mr. Nobody, a film about memories, origins and relationships. Mr Nobody arises from slumber in a hospital with a tattooed doctor enquiring about the life of the last surviving mortal on Earth. Little is explained about this future civilisation except that a medical breakthrough has emerged to give humans everlasting life.<br/><br/>Mr Nobody is held in the hospital and it is planned that his death is to be broadcast to the world; after all he is a mortal in an immortal world. It's a big deal. The majority of the film is dedicated to looking back at this mysterious gentleman's past. We meet him before he was born where unborn children are touched by angels. These unborn children choose their own parents, an interesting concept on creation.<br/><br/>The young protagonist has an unusual gift; he can see parts of the future. Those around him pass this off as déjà vu but he knows otherwise, predicting a car crash and various other events. The cinematography is artistically done, with a human approach, using close ups of faces whenever possible. The world is wonderfully colourful with eccentric characters and intense personal connections.<br/><br/>Mr Nobody is remarkably philosophical, bringing up questions of existence, consequence, time, love and choices to name a few. This is what I got from the Jaco Van Dormael drama, a sense that we should question everything while accepting what comes as fate. A lot of the choices Jared Leto's Mr Nobody makes are cinematographically depicted in colours; the film progresses seeing three loves in his life, all childhood acquaintances which are assigned a different colour almost without fail throughout.<br/><br/>Anybody that has read my other reviews knows I love a good soundtrack. Mr Nobody has an excellent score, and any film with ""Where Is My Mind"" and ""Everyday"" gets the thumbs up.<br/><br/>I advise everybody to watch Mr Nobody at some point in their life, there is a lot to take in but this is special. It is laugh out loud funny at times, philosophical without getting bogged down in metaphysics and is masterfully written. Don't miss out."
"Prometheus-Unbound","9","4","6","27 April 2011"," There is no right way, just a way.
","From the get go you will realize that Mr.Nobody won't be just like the other movies you've come across. It emphatically poses deep questions about the concepts of time, space, choice (or illusion there of), destiny and consequence. In a way, Mr.Nobody attempts to give order and meaning to things which throughout the movie it continually shows to have no order and meaning at all. It attempts to show you that time moves in sequence even if you aren't ready to move along with it, it attempts to show you that your choices make a difference when in the end they make no difference at all.<br/><br/>Does it really matter if you stop to tie your laces at the lights or once you cross them? Nemo Nobody is a figure outside of space and time, he is neither here nor there, in this time or the next. The visual beauty that Van Dormael presents on the screen emphasizes the beauty which can be enjoyed in our lives, each choice we make will lead us down a path, one that has its own beauties which can be enjoyed in their own ways. Nemo is one character shown across three different life paths, but we can see throughout that he is one in the same. It is not the person who changes with the decisions they make, it is only elements of their character which are forced into submission in some ways more than others.<br/><br/>Although it may sound complex, three different lives in one, the film flows beautifully from scene to scene with metaphorical scene compositions and transitions. Van Dormael has managed to create a modern masterpiece by drawing on the ageless human contentions, do the decisions we make today really impact upon our final fate? Nemo Nobody is an empty shell in which the mind, the soul and the choices of each one of us can be inserted. Each one of has an Elise, an Anna, a Jean in our lives. Each one of us has an A, B or C moment that has lingered at our forethought's for years.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Mr. Nobody questions whether living life has purpose at all. Much like the ultimate importance of the decisions we make, this question isn't answered, but merely felt through the eyes of the one hundred eighteen year old man, sitting and staring at the life which to him at least, never was."

","Jaco Van Dormael has never met a cliché setup he wouldn't try to shoe horn into this movie. lots of setups we've seen before this time done exactly the same but choreographed to perfection, lit and shot beautifully like a car commercial, but still a cliché, and I kind of expect more from my cinema. Guy trapped in a sinking car, boy chasing a train with mother holding out hand, cryo life support pods, proms and dying wishes, every movie cliché there is all crow-bared into this film. All that money you can see on the screen, but it came across as something less than meaningful.<br/><br/>I'm not sure who was responsible for the music choices in this movie but they were hardly enlightened either. Tracks we've heard in a hundred other movies here to make you wince at the obviousness of their presence.<br/><br/>Jared Leto was also particularly bad. He wasn't once convincing. wearing a set of dark rimmed glasses doesn't make you older, he just looked like a youth with glasses and not a father of 3 with a career and wife. He's also under the miles of make up for the old guy but the thrill of that was truly killed by Brad Pitts similar exploits in Benjamin Button.<br/><br/>There were good performances in this. The three wives were great as were the teen actors.<br/><br/>I just feel disappointed after watching this. So much talent and money went into it yet it rang hollow. It did have some great ideas but they were watered down with the clichés, It had some wonderful technically brilliant camera and staging work but without the cohesive story and the average acting and cliché elements it was all weakened.<br/><br/>This looks like a movie where director Jaco van Dormael pulled in every favor he had owning to him, his big break movie with a ton of cash thrown at it, and he dropped the ball."

There's no real substance at all to this movie. It's just a bunch of music videos stuck together.<br/><br/>A good movie should be able to stand up on its own two feet without an hour's worth of pop music. I'm sick and tired of movies that are basically just an excuse to sell soundtracks, instead of the reverse.

"targa9","1","14","32","29 November 2014"," Wes Anderson meets Vanilla Sky
","Mr.Nobody is not really a movie, in any true, dramatic, storytelling sense, because the characters are (a) not grounded in a convincing reality; (b)not developed and sympathetic; and (c) do not undergo real transformations or heroic character arcs worth seeing. In fact, the entire movie seems to be merely a sequence of tenderly-shot close-ups of pretty white young kids in love and sci-fi scenes, combined with a steady stream of musical hits from classical Satie to the retro-classic Mr. Sandman (overplayed to a cloying effect). The direction and cinematography of Wes Anderson meets the conceptual mindscrew of Vanilla Sky, but at least Anderson can tell a story.<br/><br/>First of all, it was a mistake not to score the movie with actual mood music to enhance the drama, and instead sprinkle in a bunch of isolated paid-for scores every time the writer wanted us to feel the scene was profound, yet play them every few minutes to a baffling gratuity. This immediately distracts from any story-telling elements, and tells the viewer, ""Look how beautiful or precious this moment is,"" except that when used every few minutes, the viewer quickly has to decide whether each successive scene is worth such profundity, or whether the filmmaker is trying to manipulate us into believing so. I chose the latter, as soon as I heard Otis Redding's ""For Your Precious Love"". It seems lazy and a bit pretentious to expect the viewer to conjoin each successive classic musical hit with the unrelated substandard and terribly glacial drama that is happening on screen.<br/><br/>Secondly, the gorgeous color, slow-mo, and hyper-unreality of the film, which is apparently supposed to woo us with Wes Anderson-ish charm, makes it even more important that the characters, at least, have some grounding in a reality we can identify with. Yet, what sort of parents would choose a train station as the location to ask their child to choose whom they want to live with? This incredibly cruel act, itself a traumatic story in itself, is simply used as a device to progress the idea of ""choice"", and since train stations are more dramatic, clichéd places where people run to those they love, why not have the choice made there? This not realistic, and worse, kills viewer sympathy for the parents. Secondly, why do three pretty young girls throw themselves at this socially awkward boy? Just because he's cute? This is not realistic, and it's hard to feel sympathy for such a teenage kid who doesn't have the actual real shortcomings and alienation most teenage boys feel, among both girls and boys. A pretty boy with pretty girls; how droll.<br/><br/>Thirdly, a good story needs sympathetic characters. The old Nemo sounds like any old wise-ass codger, not someone who has lived a profound, long life filled with the gift of prognostication. He speaks of screwing, drinking, smoking like your typical nostalgic geriatric; I had immediate contempt for him, and felt that, no matter what choices or non-choices this man made, he turned out pretty sour. Also, what has Nemo really suffered? The horrible dilemma between choosing which pretty girl from the neighborhood to be with? If the filmmaker wanted to make a film about choice, instead of simply boiling it down to three pubescent girls, why not have the choices be more varied, such as choosing to enlist in the army, or choosing a particular career? Instead, we are to believe that a 114-year old man believes that his most important choices happened at age 14. What about the intervening 100 years? What about a choice he made at age 50, or 75? It seems that only a male filmmaker would reduce the profundity of life choices down to which teenage girl's panties come off. The fact that he had different children with them didn't even seem to matter; he confused their names, so why was it that profound that he chose one girl over the other? How would it have really changed his life? All three girls came from the exact same neighborhood, too. How different could they be, actually? What about meeting women throughout his life and travels, such as a woman he met at age 45 in Peru, or a black man at age 70? No, it's just these three teenage girls from the same neighborhood, around the same time. How convenient and shallow. Do we get a sense of this man's life, as a husband, father, worker, or citizen? No, his entire story is a self-indulgent solipsistic world where even the planets freeze when something happens to him. <br/><br/>Finally, close-ups were heavily abused. The filmmakers of yesterday knew how to compose scenes and shots, and used closeups judiciously, when it counted. But this film is essentially a long continuous stream of closeups of pretty, white young faces. Not only that, we are somehow supposed to glean profound feelings and thoughts from staring at the blue eyes of the characters, without any other dramatic cues. This seems to be a trend in many dramatic American films, as if a silent, long, continuous shot of someone's face passes for dramatic development. Worse, this film was heavily bedroom-oriented, which further betrays that it was written by a male who has not yet reconciled his junior-high and high-school coming of age days.<br/><br/>The film is almost completely unwatchable as a sympathetic drama, and is too flaccid in the sci-fi department to rest on that, either. It seems to appeal to viewers who have no problem with two hours of close-ups and disjointed, yet great music, who are able to slap these two elements together in their mind and believe they are watching a profound bit of filmmaking."

Truly horrible implementation of a great idea, what a waste of great ambition.<br/><br/>It's clear to me that this movie is done by a rookie with too little experience to pull off a monster project like this. It looks like he compensated this with a lot of willpower and a vision most likely written in stone. First I thought that it was the acting that was bad, but thinking about it, it's more likely that it's the awful dialog and lack of acting space limited by the director. It surely doesn't help the case that the guy shouldered both scriptwriter and director and he does this in a project he's been working on for something like 13 years (read that somewhere). I'm just saying that it's probably not that easy to ""kill your darlings"" at this point and it's pretty clear that this guys likes to micro mange. This is not a good combination. If an actor clearly can't say a line naturally, let him/her try it their way. This is basic stuff.<br/><br/>The biggest reason this movie fails to me is because it's all stolen. Every good filmmaker is allowed to borrow, but this guy steals without shame, everything is just pure rip-offs. For this reason almost every scene looks like it tries to mimic good story telling, as seen in other movies, rather than actually creating something original. Instead he's basically cutting and pasting from other movies to build around his own idea and the amount of different movies you could reference felt almost endless to the point of becoming ridiculous. To make matters worse there are literally hundreds of clichés and naturally this makes it even more stiff and unnatural.<br/><br/>Here's some examples of clichés in no particular order: the future vision, the 70's vision and the presentation of households, the cry-and- scream running after the departing train, the extremely cheesy slow motion name shouting, the tattooed future-man (but with a slight lisp, original but surely coincidental), the classic over-the-top TV host with a pet pig (come on - really?). The sad montage with holding and scrubbing in the shower, the usual ""chasing-each-other-around-because- we're-so-in-love"" crap and I thinks he probably used all possible love scenes that is out there and crammed them all into this one. The classic ""under-the-blanket""-""love-you-forever-dialog"" is of course not left out. Stay with me here, I'm just scraping the surface: ...The train station time lapse, the overly dramatic voice over accompanied by a type writer. Last but surely not least the oh so totally predictable soundtrack consisting of everything from opera to Pixies, probably a dozen of pop songs(this is cheating and everybody knows it) and on top of that various oldies for that retro feeling that always works. I'm not saying it horrible, the music is awesome, it's just that it's used in a way that's without finesse.<br/><br/>The end result is sadly a poorly cut drama that is sprawling everywhere without any constancy - both visually and dramaturgical. I'm not even focusing on the really bad stuff like the old mans make up, his fake laugh, the fake tears, the mediocre greenscreen scenes and special effects. There is also a lot of little details that someone really should've looked at, like the guy with Downs disease who growled and attacked. Wtf."

","Technically, visually and cinematographically, Mr Nobody is a masterpiece. The visual stunts are amazing, the colours are wonderful and the camera-work is extremely imaginative.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I had a few problems with this film. First of all, there are too many ideas, which is why the film lacks focus. The story of Nemo's different possible lives is a great concept, enough to make a fantastic film. Why add Mars-travels, immortality, scientific babble, tattooed doctors and time going backwards to it? Secondly, the film is all about visuals. The viewer never gets the chance to connect emotionally with the characters. Why does Nemo do what he does? What are his feelings? Does he love Jeanne? We don't know. Before Nemo gets a chance to develop his character, he is being swept away by yet another visual effect or a twist in the storyline.<br/><br/>If you love a visual spectacle that is a feast for the eye, this is a great movie. Some scenes are really masterfully crafted. But this could have been a better movie if it contained less stunts and story elements."

"p-stepien","9","5","9","31 December 2010"," Repeated watching
","Nemo Nobody is the last mortal in a world of immortals. At the age of 118 he is on his deathbed and his memory has faded. Nonetheless journalists and academics are interested in his story. But this story is muddled mess of reality, wrong choices, corrected choices, tragedy and dreams. With three loves which one of them did he marry? When their parents divorced did he stay with his father or leave with his mother? Did he die in a car crash? But if yes than how is he still alive? Maybe he is in a coma and everything is but an illusion? Did I give away too much? Not really, since the reality of what really transpired is muddled, confusing and necessitates repetitive rewatches. Even the above storyline does not seem to fit what really transpiring in this thought invoking philosophical movie.<br/><br/>""Mr Nobody"" is a cinematographic feat that overtakes any other sci-fi/fantasy outing that 2010 had to offer. In many ways the dreamlike story of Jaco van Dormael is very similar to the breakthrough ""Inception"", but unlike the more renowned blockbuster it succeeded in every department Nolan failed, while kept up the bar with his American counterpart. This is the absolute cinematographic triumph of film that so many people believe ""Inception"" was, but just can not help but feel Nolan's movie was inferior on so many levels. In the two that matter the most: 1. ""Mr. Nobody"" conveys a multi-layered complex message about human existence, something that ""Inception"" in reality doesn't even attempt. 2. ""Mr. Nobody"" has a depth of human emotion that was nonexistent in Nolan's work.<br/><br/>At the same time ""Mr. Nobody"" conveys it's complex story in a way that is enjoyable to watch and surprisingly understandable. As with life it changes from laughter to tragedy from the ordinary to the extraordinary. And everything exposed with such clarity, that confusion is non-existent about the proceedings. That is until the film unfolds in the final act and you are left bewildered as to what actually happened. I must however stress, that this is not a fault, as the complexity, unpredictability and faith in human intelligence that the ending conveyed where a highlight of the movie, as before that I was expecting to be severely disappointed by the straightforward ending, that seemed to be suggested. Nonetheless I fully understanding if the final 5 minutes turn out to be severely disappointing to most and also make the movie not suitable for the wider audience.<br/><br/>The only fault I could find in this movie, which flirts successfully with greatness, concerns the overly romantic, almost childlike love stories concerning Mr. Nobody's life. That said if you accept the most likely version of events (in my opinion) it actually makes a lot of sense...<br/><br/>Any movie auteur will also probably appreciate the clear hommages made in this movie and will recognize scenes from ""Harold and Maude"", ""Space Odyssey 2001"" or ""The Double Life of Veronica"", just to name a few.<br/><br/>A real treat that rekindles my love for cinema and instills admiration for Jaco Van Dormael. Quite possibly the best and most intellectual movie I have seen in 2010 (and I have seen over 500)."
"pssn","8","5","9","12 September 2010"," Mr. Nobody - A Review from Cyrius
","When I heard about Mr. Nobody, read the synopsis and read a few reviews on IMDb I was intrigued and hoped the hype was for real. It was a relatively unknown film in the UK when I first watched it and since then I still think about it and felt like it was an injustice to not write my own review.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is like a beautiful dream that you wish you could conjure up in your own sub-conscious mind. If you know about String Theory then you may start to understand why the film shows multiple possible realities through the life of one man from birth till death. Switching from each possible reality based upon split second decisions, you are transported into what is, what was and what could have been, but for this one man (played by Jared Leto) all is incredibly real as he has been given the gift of somehow knowing each life scenario in his own conscious mind.<br/><br/>If it sounds confusing, well it is at times, but the best movie-making usually leaves you on the edge of your seat waiting for the ending to do one of two things, blow your mind with a crazy twist or make your own conclusions. Mr. Nobody does the latter, and I encourage you to think about everything you have experienced while watching this movie and then go to the discussion boards to read some interesting opinions on what the ending means.<br/><br/>For me this movie encapsulates 'true love', our search for 'the one', and the beauty of unconditional love. The ending is a metaphor of all of these ideas of love and also draws on the idea of fate. As you may have experienced in your own lives, some things seem like they are just meant to be.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is an original and artistic piece of filmmaking. A thought-provoking film full of emotion and inspiration, and I honestly encourage you to watch it.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of 10 but it probably deserves more.<br/><br/>Cyrius"
"JRmf","2","14","35","26 July 2010"," Mr. Nobody not for everybody
","I didn't understand or enjoy this movie, and I am both a geek and a SF fan, but the glowing reviews of those who did tell me there's something there which apparently touched others.<br/><br/>What were the writers and director smoking.. sorry, thinking, when they created this material? The non-linear, multiple-pasts doesn't make for a film which can be grasped in the conventional sense of following a coherent storyline through. Reason fails in the unreality of the presentation, it's all so surreal..<br/><br/>An Art-House film mainly screened at film festivals, which by end May 2010 had only grossed 5% of its production cost, it's not hard to understand why Mr. Nobody wasn't promoted as a blockbuster.. <br/><br/>Sumptuous visuals, I loved the Mars arrival and departure, but such eye-candy is meaningless in the absence of a correspondingly strong storyline.<br/><br/>Just as Mr. Nobody departs the earth, the point of the film's penchant for running backwards comes into play: Time flows backward and he reverts out of death. Impossible in any sense of our normal experience, but then why not? It makes about as much sense as the rest of the film."
"nospam-14","3","28","80","9 June 2010"," To be avoided!
","If you saw the preview of this film and enjoyed it: don't go. If you read the highly rated reviews on this web site and believe this is a film you should see: don't go. If intellectual thoughts blessed you out of teenage unpopularity and you are in serious need of incoherence fuel, unexploited interesting ideas and 2 ½ hours of loose ends to feel better about your artistic instincts: go! <br/><br/>Here are three reasons why this film is a failure and should only be considered as such: <br/><br/>1) The preview, summary and storyline make you believe this is a novel idea for a science fiction movie: a super centenarian lost in a futuristic society trying to figure out his reality. Oups, you get a film about a lame 30 years old guy conflicted about his love - linked to an absurd school boy story line fantasying on different ways to die and have sexual encounters (yes, and he's 9 years old...). The film should have been 80% in the future, 20% in the past. Unfortunately it's the reverse <br/><br/>2) Casting makes no sense. Since when do smashing teenage girls pay any attention to lame, skinny tormented boys? Get real. Ugly boys go out with ugly girls. And this goes on for the whole film. The primary schoolboy is fat and still gets the attention of three beautiful girls? The teenager looks like he should be sent to a boot camp and instead, he gets three smashing girls fall in love with him... And that mail-order-for-men's- clothing-model gets to marry the A-list top models? N'importe quoi. Did I forget to mention the ongoing sex scenes all over the place do get extremely exhausting? <br/><br/>3) Nice images and film scenes gets you going for 30 minutes but no more. It's like driving through death valley; it's fascinating for 20 minutes and then you get desperate to get out of it.<br/><br/>I can only see that I am passionately flabbergasted at people who say they enjoy this film. Ever heard of the emperor's new clothes fairy tale?"

A very surreal movie with such a deep but simple message. A message fortunately I haven't wronged. I give this movie a 10/10 such a cleansing experience. Leave it to the French to create a masterpiece out of convoluted pieces. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. But beware not all can enjoy this movie as much as I did as you have to be able to keep track and discern the different timelines very fast.

"john32935","2","4","7","20 January 2015"," Total pretentiousness
","After having watched the disaster that is the disaster film ""Noah"" earlier this week, I thought that I had my selection for worst movie I had watched this year. Well, lo and behold, we have a new contender with Mr. Nobody. This is pretentiousness posing as art. The sad thing is that way too many people have bought into it.<br/><br/>While at times visually stunning, the ""story"" centers on Nemo who as a pre-teen had to choose with whom he would live after his parents divorced. The movie then goes on to show several possible lives that he could have lived all the while juxtaposing the various story lines, as well as jumping back and forth in time, all to advance the ""deep"" theory that choices have consequences. And it takes the movie over 2 1/2 hours to say that. Sadly, I cannot jump back in time and stop myself from putting this DVD in the player.<br/><br/>This movie is a collaboration among many international organizations including French backers, which probably should have been a clue to me about the movie's potential for being watchable. Here is a very telling quote from the movie as the main character Nemo is being interviewed:<br/><br/>Young journalist: Do you remember what the world was like before telemerization? Quasi-immortality? What was it like when humans were mortals?<br/><br/>Nemo Nobody aged 118: There were cars that polluted. We smoked cigarettes. We ate meat. We did everything we can't do in this dump and it was wonderful! Most of the time nothing happened like a French movie.<br/><br/>And that pretty much sums up this movie. Nothing happens."

","This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a true piece of art, with a story that drips with moving intense emotion, stellar acting, and visuals that hit hard just like the story. This is one of those films that during/long after will have you looking at your own life, existence, mortality, and choices in life. If there is one movie anyone has to see this year then this is it. Apparently this was one of the most expensive films in Belgium's history (60 million or so). This fact makes me think about how many current films spend far more, and are absolute garbage (A point I obviously don't have to point out, however nevertheless feel compelled to do so.). Ultimately I just hope that this amazing director (Jaco Van Dormael) has another chance, hopefully sometime very soon, to get another opportunity to let his true creative genius shine."

It tackles life's most important issues and furthermore - it magically portrays life like no other film ever made. The acting is stunning - especially Jared Leto and Diane Krueger do a great job - but we must not forget the actors that played teenage Nemo and Ana.

I know there's some things about it that I can't fully understand (like marriage, birth, parenthood, etc.), but I loved the film so much that it has been stuck in my head for a long time. This movie is absolutely a gem, it's beautifully filmed, the cast is perfect, the screenplay is thoughtful and, in my opinion, the whole film is a masterpiece. The pictures are just plain gorgeous and I can't get enough of the close captures of Nemo's eyes throughout the years. I'm a movie addict since I'm about 6 years old and I've seen more than 10 000 movie in my short life, but this one is my very favorite and I think it'll haunt me until I die.

The use of colors, music, camera angles and other audiovisual aspects are amazing, innovative and harmonious to say the least.<br/><br/>Emotionally, I can't think of a movie to have touched me since Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and Craig Brewer's ""Black Snake Moan""... yet it remains fairly lighthearted most of the time.<br/><br/>Storywise, this movie takes elements from those same movies and mixes it with the parallel storytelling of Peter Howitt's ""Sliding Doors"". The themes are diverse, compelling, deep and imaginative.<br/><br/>All these elements combined leads to a wonderfully confusing surreal movie that feels warm and touching, inspiring and nostalgic. The only problem I have with the movie is that it's a bit too confusing in some areas and that it tries to take on so many different themes it seems a bit too much for a single movie... but I can't deduct more than a single point from a maximum rating because IMO everything else about this movie is simply perfect....<br/><br/>This movie should have gotten numerous awards....."

","Before I review this movie, there is one thing I must explain in order for you to understand what I am about to say about the movie.<br/><br/>I collect movies and have watched a number which is beyond counting. You could almost call me a ""professional movie watcher"". All these movies I watched were good and bad. Therefore, I thought it was impossible for me to have ONE FAVORITE MOVIE. <br/><br/>Well, ladies and gentlemen, after watching Mr. Nobody - I realized I found the best movie I have ever watched so far. THIS MOVIE goes beyond the adjective ""perfect"". Saying that this movie is perfect would be an serious offense!<br/><br/>The story is amazing. From the moment you turn on the movie, to the moment you turn off the movie, you will be glued to the screen - literally. You won't even be able to blink while you watch it. This story is the ideal food for your brain. It will set your brain cells on fire and it will torment you for days and days. Then, you won't be able to stand the torment anymore and you will have to watch the movie again and again. I watched it 17 times and I am still in longing for it.<br/><br/>Jared Leto's acting is wonderful. He really ""nailed it"". The other actors are absolutely great and deserve my compliments too. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is beyond perfection. The selection of the tracks is sophisticated: every song is perfectly incorporated into the movie.<br/><br/>The camera is unbelievable. I was unable to believe that a movie could have such a brilliant style of filming. I am flabbergasted. <br/><br/>The entire movie is a masterpiece and everything fits perfectly together. It's highly addictive and deals with two very vague and humanly obsessive subjects: time and choice. <br/><br/>I am going to stop here, because I want to force you to watch this movie. However, the movie might not be suitable for people who don't want movies to force them to think for days about the story or who don't want movies to influence their opinions and general life ideas. Also, if you are tired: do not watch this movie. This is a motion picture that requires your complete concentration because everything is important here.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

Firstly, I'd just like to say, I'm not going to sit and take this movie apart piece-by-piece, I have better things to do than that. I'm merely going to give it my own judgment and let you make your own.<br/><br/>So this wasn't the greatest movie ever made, far from it, and the ending (don't worry, I'm giving nothing away) was for me, a little disappointing. However, what it IS, is original. You certainly haven't seen a movie like this before. Many other reviews claim this is copying other certain titles, this isn't the case. The way this movie is shot and the storyline unfolds is quite unique, if not somewhat difficult to keep up with at times.<br/><br/>A lot of other reviewers claim this movie is 10/10 purely because it is difficult to understand. If being difficult to understand makes a movie a great movie, then I've gone seriously wrong somewhere in the years I've been enjoying films. This movie isn't ""great"". BUT, it is thoroughly entertaining and had me glued to the screen for about two and a half hours, which isn't something many movies can do (partly because few movies now are over an hour and a half, but that's beside the point).<br/><br/>If you like something that actually makes you think (and may also leave you wanting to know more) then give this movie a watch. It makes for a very interesting two and a half hours and at the very least has a little bit of nipple.<br/><br/>Who cares what other people think of a movie? Why should someone else's opinion (that you've probably never met) affect your decision to watch said movie?<br/><br/>Go watch 'Mr Nobody' and enjoy it for what it is; an original piece of cinema."

I think the only reason this film didn't make a bigger buzz was because of completely absent marketing. Here's to hoping that more people will give it a chance and come to love it, or at least appreciate the scope of imagination it lends to the sad state of modern cinema.<br/><br/>As far as the lead actors go- all were exceptional.

","This is a n excellent film. As we first started watching it, I must admit, I was somewhat skeptical given the title. I thought this would be another ""artsy"" mambo-jumbo where a self-indulgent indie director who just happened to finish a book by Hugo has taken upon him/herself to educate the masses on their pathetic, meaningless everyday lives (preferably set in suburbia). Boy, was I wrong! And so glad I was. 20 minutes into it, having watched the early life sequence, I was fully submerged. It wasn't just the story - the set, colors, music, camera, scene pacing - all came together beautifully to convey the deep philosophical and artistic vision of the director. This is undoubtedly the ""director's film"". It is one of those films, which is hard, if not impossible to retell, and once watched, makes the viewer to watch it again, and again, enjoying every single scene. This is a director's film and of a capable one. Bravo! <br/><br/>The only downside (and given the nature of the story a minor one) is weak acting by Leto. I've never been a big fan of this actor, and maybe unjustly so, but his youthful innocence sprayed all over the screen really doesn't fit the story well. This is a minor bump though."
"karin-furlan","10","4","7","28 January 2011"," Even the smallest drop bends the leaf. That's why it's hard to choose.
","Mr. Nobody is a film about a man's life (lives) and what they've taught him. As a child, Nemo Nobody is faced with an impossible decision so he decides not to move. Not to make a decision. In the movie, we then see many different possible lives he could have had with taking a certain decision. These lifestyles are based on which women he's with and at the end he realizes that there are no wrong decisions. Everything is good and bad at the same time, after the rain comes the sun. At his 118 years he finally figures out which of them lives suits him best. One thing that is highlighted in the movie is the fact that a small change is a chain reaction (every decision changes the path of our life).<br/><br/>I absolutely love this piece of art because I always find something new in it, no matter how many times I watch it. It includes deeper meaning, philosophical thoughts, various emotions, human blindness and life lessons. The actors are performing brilliantly, the scenes are well filmed and film music is awesome and totally fitting the situations."
"ken_bethell","6","7","15","3 January 2012"," A visual experience. Let's leave it there.
","I came across this film quite by chance and as an avid film fan I was puzzled as to how I had missed such a big-budgeted production back in 2009. Well, after sitting through the extended version, all two hours and thirty seven minutes some questions were answered. It was an art film. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing but it did at least explain the anonymity. What I do find inexplicable however, particularly during such austere times, is that nearly $50M can be raised for a project which had no realistic prospect of ever bringing a return. Extraordinary - a labour of love perhaps? Anyway to the film itself. I sat, without fidgeting or clock-watching, through the entire film without being able to explain to anybody at its conclusion what had in fact happened. You kind of felt you knew but didn't feel confident enough to make your thoughts public. The film had sufficient visual impact to keep you attentive while mentally you were in a complete flux! What has been interesting is reading the comments of others. One said that there was humour and LOL scenes, really? I don't recall any. Many used the year 2092 as a reference point as if it were the only solid foundation on which to hang the story but as we see at the conclusion even the year is a facade which comes crashing down. Somebody even said that any production that included 'Mr.Sandman' in its soundtrack was good enough for him. Clearly some people are easily pleased. Overall the film could be said to be an experience but then again 'experience' is often used as an euphemism for a mistake."
"Safetylight","9","8","18","9 June 2010"," Really liked this! An exercise in 4-D thinking.
","This wasn't your standard Flashback / Sliding Doors film.<br/><br/>No way. This was far more interesting.<br/><br/>Mister Nobody was a deliberate exercise in seeing reality from multiple perspectives in a non-linear way all at the same time. --And knowing that it was ALL real at the same time.<br/><br/>That was the strong point.<br/><br/>The weak point was that the director himself didn't seem to realize that this was what he was doing. And the ending was backwards in more ways than one! (He presented the Big Crunch as a sort of victory prize. As if the vaporizing of knowledge and experience and retreating into the galactic womb, going back to sleep, was a desirable thing. Yuck! Only losers think that way.) Also, his understanding of love was presented in an over-the-top manner; pretty girls loving the empty and rather uninspiring Nemo? It looks nice on the screen, but it's pure fantasy. But then, the Nemo reference to the old ""Little Nemo in Slumberland"" comics by Winsor McCay was true to form, (Little Nemo was also a dreamy tool loved by princesses), so this was almost certainly a deliberate action on the part of the director. I found it a bit annoying, though. I would have been happier if the main character was a lot less vague.<br/><br/>But this was a sci-fi film at its heart, and hard sci-fi at that, (well, if you allow for the existence of the soul and fanciful elements like unicorns and angels. . , if you can forgive that, then this was strictly by-the-book metaphysics). Stories which exist primarily in order for the writer/director to explore the science of reality, things like strong characters and realistic emotions are usually given short shrift. You want to know how the rocket propulsion system works, not how to realistically date a girl. This was definitely a geek film.<br/><br/>Which explains how Mister Nobody's portrayal of the character with manic-depressive disorder was spot on. Disorders are interesting and thus well-examined, while normal conditions are boring and thus left unexplored beyond the most broad-stroke definitions.<br/><br/>But don't let that put you off the film. It has a LOT of great things to offer. The visuals are endlessly astonishing, and the exercise in non-linear multi-dimensional story-telling is a wonderful and exciting treat for the mind. And best of all, every shot was there for a logical reason! I can't stand arty films which are blurry around the edges. This one made sense. Definitely made for engineers and sci-fi geeks who aren't stumped by the idea of the soul.<br/><br/>We don't get films like this very often, and this was one of the best!<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you're up for that kind of thing. If you're looking for standard Star Trek, or for a great love story, look elsewhere. This is about exploring 4th Density!"

","This is one of the very few cases lately, having an excellent execution in terms of direction, photography, production, and even acting, but the story lacking in being very shallow or/and simplistic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the quality of scenes and acting on emotion but the story gives to the viewer an effectively repetitive sequence of romantic emotion. It does not reveal much more emotion than the erotic love between certain protagonist making it a very emotional movie, but also simplistic and repetitive in a considerable part.<br/><br/>In short, you will love it if you are into emotion, you will find it good if you're an all-around viewer but you will loathe it if you're not looking for emotion at all in a movie."
"IAN-Cinemaniac","5","28","86","4 January 2010"," I Want To Love This Film, But I Can't
","Ever since seeing Jaco Van Dormael's Le Huitième Jour (The Eighth Day) I had been highly looking forward to his latest work....MR NOBODY. Last night I caught an early screening of it in Liege, Belgium with special guest, director Jaco Van Dormael in attendance. <br/><br/>I tried so hard to get into Mr Van Dormael's brilliant, yet fatally flawed vision of love, life and the choices we make. My first problem of the film is its structure (flashforwards, flashbacks..). The film rarely gave me the opportunity to sit back and immerse myself in its world without constantly jolting, and distracting with its fractured structure. I understand this was to show how every choice has its consequence, every choice leads down a different life path. It often reminded me of the more mainstream and simple chick-flick SLIDING DOORS, which my wife adored. I loved the film for its ideas and questions it posed on who and what we are. MR NOBODY certainly can't be criticized for being empty or shallow. If anything, the problem with the film is that there is too much to consider. It's overblown and bloated which ended up numbing me to the point of not even caring. <br/><br/>Van Dormael clearly loves the use of color in his films. In THE EIGHTH DAY his use of color was beautiful and poignant in the way it illuminated its troubled young hero's fantastic world, in contrast to the gray realities of the true world around him. That is another one of my major problems with MR NOBODY. This film had so much to say about who and what we are. It dealt with such real issues of abandonment, loss and loneliness, but his Tim Burtonesque use of colors and over-the-top jests didn't slightly resemble anything real or believable. If only he had given the film some sense of the real world from time to time, like with The Eighth Day it would have strengthened the film tremendously. Something has to look and feel real in order to feel any emotion or anything at all.<br/><br/>I just wish Jaco Van Dormael had simplified things a bit. I don't mean dumb down his vision, but give it some space to breath and room to move the viewer. As I said before, I really wanted to love this film, but now I can say I really didn't like it. MR NOBODY was a bold effort with a lot of good in it, including the fine cast, but in the end unfortunately it falls rather flat."

","Yes, this was a blatant attempt to define the religion of our Godless friends in Hollywood; those rich fools who believe that their wealth and fame were the result of their ""genius"", when in reality it was merely luck. The result (not totally unexpected) is an undefined mess of pseudo-mystical ideas (mostly eastern) that have no logical connection with each other. Among the more absurd ""spiritual ideas"" put forth in this movie are <br/><br/>1) The belief that science can solve every human problem (even death) and answer every philosophical question.<br/><br/>2) The uncreated nature of the human soul (it always existed; it was never created).<br/><br/>3) The immortality of the universe (atheists are never going to accept that this universe was created, even though that is exactly what the scientists have discovered).<br/><br/>4) The highest happiness one can achieve in this life is romantic/ sexual love (the highest is union with God/Christ, just in case you were wondering).<br/><br/>5) The worship of the theory of evolution (which I believe in) and the belief that it can explain EVERYTHING about human nature.<br/><br/>6) The world is purely material (there is nothing beyond the material universe) and hence predictable.<br/><br/>I said that the movie was an undefinable mess of pseudo-mystical ideas. That is not entirely correct. There is a common thread that links all these ideas. Everything expressed in this ""movie"" is a reaction to (or an attempt to contradict) some doctrine of Christianity. It is gratifying to me as a Christian because ultimately the ideas presented in this movie are SO disconnected from reality and SO disconnected from everyday life that it cannot possibly be satisfying in any way. Go watch the Expendables 2 - it's way more meaningful and complicated (on a philosophical level) than this piece of nothing."

It gives our rather limited senses a chance to witness a concept that we will never truly understand. But somehow, at the same time, viewers can truly feel the emotional strife in each character according to their timelines. A beautiful rendition on a complex idea, that I really wish directors would explore into more depth. <br/><br/>My only advice to any future viewers is to give the film time. It takes a while for the film to really identify itself and can be difficult to deal with at first. It's a heavy read, so don't expect to pick up all the details without full attention. <br/><br/>A common blend of cinematographic art, relatable human interaction and theory of quantum physics that leaves you with more questions then you had at the start. Not for the faint of heart or mind, but most defiantly a journey worth taking."

","Mr Nobody is the story of Nemo, whose possible two life lines and three love stories are alternatively presented.<br/><br/>The movie is well shot and the cast members convincing, especially Jared Leto (as adult Nemo), who is always perfect in this sort of odd films and roles. Also excellent are Toby Regbo (15y.o. Nemo), Juno Temple (15y.o. Anna) and Sarah Polley (depressive adult Elise). Diana Kruger (as adult Anna), Rhys Ifans (Nemo's father, Natasha Little (Nemo's mother), among many others, are OK in their respective roles.<br/><br/>The visual effects are wonderfully understated, very well blended with and at the service of the story. The theatrical movie sets, the rich colors, the different hues attached to each different life path, the wardrobe, and the lovely music -which mixes some old classic tunes with pieces specifically composed for the movie- create an ensemble that is very easy on the eye.<br/><br/>However, Mr Nobody is a great movie mostly because of its subtle but profound reflection on Human Nature, Human behavior, free will and the meaning of life. The movie reflects on questions like - what makes us what we are? Why we act the way we do? Is free choice a key element to be happier? How does other people's choices affect our choices in life? The philosophical, psychological, and metaphysical questions posed are sometimes explicitly mentioned, while others are hinted and expressed through the story as a whole, each different life line story in particular, and through Nemo and the other characters' behavior. Among others, some of the concepts presented here are: Butterfly effect, Principle of Entropy, Schrodinger's Cat Paradox, String Theory, The Pigeon's Superstition experiment, The Nature of the true self, Free will and fate, The linearity (or lack of) of Time, Quantum Physics and parallel universes.<br/><br/>There are other movies that reflect on the effect that personal choice and randomness, free will and determination, and the butterfly effect have in our lives. Just to mention three, just remember Sliding Doors, Run Lola Run, and Cloud Atlas. However, they do not have the clarity and depth that Mr Nobody does.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is truly intriguing, and some of the discussions in IMDb are really fascinating. My interpretation of the ending, is that the whole movie is a prediction seen by unborn Nemo of what would happen if Nemo chose the parents he chooses, not what happens after choosing them. The choice starts at the beginning of the film, not when his parents separate. There are many elements that would support this, especially the fact that title of the movie is Mr. Nobody should be ringing some bells in your ears! Mr. Nobody is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking film I have watched in a long time. Perfect for Philosophy classes, and for oiling the creases of your brain in those days in which you feel them a bit rusty. Mr. Nobody is one of those movies that linger in the back seat of you mind for days, long after you have watched it. ""No choice is still a choice"" is one of the statements presented in the movie on which I have been pondering for days. Would knowing your fate help you to make a choice? Is one of those questions that made the same to me. The film is full of statements and questions that will keep you thinking, for good."

","What a disappointment. From the opening moments I smelled British influence which for me often means something solely philosophical. Two hours and change later, I knew for sure I had called this one. This movie proves that if you scribble some randomly obscure and pointless dialogue on paper, get a really good film crew together along with a fairly well renowned actor or two, the result will be numerous people raving about it. <br/><br/>I'm not one for pointless movies though I did sit through to the end hoping for some string to tie it together as the camera work, visual effects and editing were pretty good. No way would I ever sit through it again and I really have to wonder how many others actually would."

While gems like this, which is masterpiece by all means is rated at an ordinary 7.8.<br/><br/>This film is all about exploring posibilities. And it succesfully. It touches so subjects without being preachy, it's almost unbelievable. First one hour may feel a little slow and unmoving, after that it's so enjoyable to watch. It's not about if the ending makes sense or not as the purpose is served before that. There are some questions unanswered, but it actually doesn't matter.<br/><br/>There are films like The man from earth made with similar intentions. But unlike that one , Mr. Nobody tells the story visually rather than purely talking.<br/><br/>I can't explain the story here, but can only advice to watch it as well."

",".Mr. Nobody is definitely one of my favorite movies. I had the opportunity to see it again 10 years after his release (in a wonderful director's cut version) and I am convinced that he is aging very well. Initially it was not taken into consideration in my country (Italy); then in 2016 the Italian distributors perceived the enormous success they had decided to take it to Italy. My advice is to watch it in the original language (you can find it on Netflix); dubbing,in my humble opinion, is done in a hurry and doesn't fully make the beauty that the film carries with it. Why did I like this movie so much? First of all, Jared Leto's performance is incredible, he really manages to extricate himself in a myriad of different roles with great skill. The soundtrack and the non-original songs that accompanied the film are perfect (including Where is my Mind by Pixies, great!). The film is complex, opens up a tons of readings and generates many questions, to watch and to review and to comment on. And finally, from a technical point of view, thanks to a very creative montage that creates a nice rhythm and a sensational photography is a pleasure for the eyes. In short, for me it is highly recommended."

","Jaco Van Dormael's ""Mr. Nobody"" is a terrific looking film with image after image appearing in front of us as if in a dream for this is a sci-fi film that isn't really meant to make too much sense. The 'plot', for want of a better word, is simply the story of one man called Nemo, the 'Mr Nobody' of the title but it's not like any 'life story' you might have seen since Mr Nobody doesn't really exist, except perhaps in the imagination of Mr Van Dormael and this is the kind of film that could easily be re-edited without losing its sense or lack of it. You might indeed call it self-indulgent, particularly since it goes on for over two and a half hours and since there are no real 'characters', actors like the talented Jared Leto as Nemo are unable to leave their mark. This is the kind of film that almost wilfully sets out to alienate an audience. It's certainly imaginative and, as I say, it looks fantastic but don't waste your time trying to make too much sense of it; take it as you find it and you might even enjoy it, particularly if you live in Europe
where, apparently, it was something of a hit."

What would have my life been like if I hadn't have said something inappropriate? What would have my life been like if I chose a certain career? <br/><br/>Watch without interruption because following the stories line can be hard but in my personal opinion well worth it. <br/><br/>Remember sometimes not choosing is the right choice. <br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10"

","The first... Well, the ENTIRE movie I wasn't sure where the plot was going or what the director wanted to do with it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing except it ended up not going anywhere. There was no big 'aha' moment or explanation that tied a lot of the random scenes that are scattered in this movie together.
The one redeeming quality this movie had was one point Nemo made at the end of the movie. He said that it doesn't matter which of the storylines was the 'real' one because they all mean just as much. I thought that was kinda beautiful. But I didn't really care about the rest of the movie.
The incoherentness made me check my phone every 2/3 minutes, the incomplete storylines made me lose interest, and the end made me sigh and glad it was over with."

","I have taken a long time to watch this movie. I have only watched it because it appeared in many lists as a movie with a 'mindblowing' ending. If I knew how disappointing this would be, I would have never watched. These were 2 and a half hours that I will never get back. <br/><br/>The movie basically talks about the choices we make in life and the consequences behind every choice. The main character, played by Jared Leto, is different from everybody else for knowing beforehand the consequences of every choice he'd make in life. And this is the plot. The end.<br/><br/>There is nothing, nothing with one slightly deep, philosophical meaning in this movie. This may seem great to those who are not used to watching movies, but anyone who has watched a good amount of movies and is familiarized with philosophy will see how empty and even childish this movie is. <br/><br/>Jared Leto and Diane Kruger give us solid performances, and cinematography and soundtrack are decent. But good cast and cinematography do not a good movie make. The plot is too weak and simplistic to make a meaningful, remarkable movie. Moreover, it is unnecessarily long. 40 minutes would be enough to tell everything. <br/><br/>The director used a non-linear timeline to make the audience THINK this is a good movie. But it isn't.

","First of all wanna say amazing movie.. really incredibly visceral.. but for anyone confused this is what I gathered :P The universe is in flux. It expands, then contracts, replaying and recreating events over and over again. However, certain events can be changed, and depending on the choices Nemo makes his life will turn out different ways. The major turning point in his life being his decision to either go with his mother or his father at age nine, which is why in the end he says its all in the mind of a nine year old boy. He knows the choice he has to make and the myriad of possibilities it could lead to. In a way he's God of his own world at that moment.<br/><br/>But how does this happen? Think back to.when as a child he describes the place where babies are made. Before sent out into the world you know everything, but your mind is erased at birth. His never was, which is why he can predict the future at certain points in the film, why as an old man he remembers his life different ways.<br/><br/>In the end, when everything is reversing thats the universe contracting, resetting everything to be done again. The universe contracts at the exact moment of Old Nemo's death. Since he's lived it multiple times he remembers it and it features in the science fiction story he writes.<br/><br/>As to how he ends up with Anna, the universe is in a perpetual state of fluctuation, repeating itself forever. Depending on the decisions he makes sometimes he ends up with her, sometimes he doesnt. What we saw was the result of a time when he ended up with her."
"trelloskilos-1","10","1","1","8 May 2018"," Overlooked gem!
","Without doubt, one of my most favourite movies of all time. <br/><br/>I love a good movie that screws with your mind (The Game, Primer, Cube, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Mulholland Drive, Identity etc.) where the movie you think you're seeing becomes something else entirely. Mr. Nobody is one of those films. <br/><br/>Part sci-fi, part romance, part thriller, part comedy, the film ruminates on the old multiverse theory, that a single decision by an individual, creates multiple parallel universes where the alternative outcomes are selected. Of course, this idea from quantum physics, has been used before in many other sci-fi movies, but not like this.<br/><br/>Describing the plot is a bit of a challenge, as there are so many threads to this movie, right off the bat. Mr. Nobody is a man who is conscious of the other universes where certain key decisions of his life are all played out, and he seems to jump between them. The main one, however, is set in a future utopia, where he is the oldest human & will be the last human to ever die. - Actually, that description is pretty weak.<br/><br/>How about comparing it with other movies? Well, I guess this would be a bit like a mash-up of Cloud Atlas, the Fifth Element and The Butterfly Effect, but co-directed by Darren Aaronofsky and Michel Gondry with Terry Gilliam and Wes Anderson on hand...<br/><br/>...but even that does not do the movie justice. <br/><br/>The movie will be polarising. It has a lot of great ideas, and is cerebral one minute, goofy the next minute, and tragic the next. - If you enjoy or appreciate any of the movies I've mentioned in this review, you should enjoy Mr. Nobody...and if you still don't think you understand what the movie is about after reading these reviews, I would highly recommend just watching it anyway!"
"asifahsankhan","9","1","1","28 March 2018"," ""As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible. ""
","Mr. Nobody is a movie "" sci-fi"" which I think is not intended to be a sci-fi movie. Well , the film is directed by Jaco van Dormael , a Belgian director who is actually (just like Richard Kelly, director Donnie Darko), in my opinion, can always release a "" one-hit wonder"". In addition, the film is also filled by a unique cast-full of variations and as if random; starting from the 30 Seconds to Mars vocalist Jared Leto, who desperately deserve the main role as Nemo Nobody, and Diane Kruger as Anna, her true love Nemo,. Judging from the cast- it is somewhat random, but apparently there is a purpose behind it all. <br/><br/>Nemo narrates a voyage through several permutations of his life, following alternate paths. He chooses to grow up with each of his divorcing parents (Natasha Little and Rhys Ifans); has three separate and mutually canceling lifelong romances (Juno Temple grows into Diane Kruger; Clare Stone becomes Sarah Polley; Audrey Giacomini becomes Linh Dam Pham); and experiences various brushes with death. As if the Cloud Atlas-level juggling act weren't enough, Belgian writer-director Jaco Van Dormael throws in a hypnosis conceit and, courtesy of Nemo's sometime work as a writer, fiction within the fiction. In one iteration, Nemo appears as a TV scientist who lectures on string theory and entropy. The character's name alludes to both Jules Verne and The Odyssey, but Mr. Nobody's expansive literary ambitions turn out to have a powerful ordering principle: sentimentality.<br/><br/>Well, in outline, Mr. Nobody actually tells about probability and parallel timeline . Wait! The outline was withdrawn by ignoring the final conclusion of the film. The plot in this movie actually does not start at the beginning of the movie, but after entering the teenage. It is said that Nemo Nobody's life was filled with choices, even since he was still not born. Because of "" Butterfly Effect"" , Nemo was finally born in all choices and probabilities. Nemo himself said, "" It's hard to choose, "" but eventually he came to his own conclusion, ""As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible. ""<br/><br/>It's a ""must see"" film for every film lover. Especially the smart ones."

","""Mr. Nobody"" - well, the title is admittedly a little strange, but this movie will appeal to the more open-minded moviegoer, in the first place. This is by far the best film (yes, a piece like this is definitely more than just a movie) I've seen in a long while. It might not be officially classified as an epic, but I personally would disagree. ""Mr. Nobody"" has all the hallmarks of a wonderful film wrapped in a unique package, and yet, it's extremely hard to explain basic plot lines in this story. Therefore, I will go big picture, and just say this: ""Mr. Nobody"" is about life, and time, and all the choices we make, or don't make. Broad? You bet. But it's the only way to properly discuss this film (which also features a great and eclectic soundtrack).<br/><br/>In short, I would say that this is a bit of a mashup between ""Okja"", and the early work of Tim Burton (circa Edward Scissorhands, 1990), but the ideas and concepts it explores are all its own. The colors are vivid, the cinematography is well done, and the character development (though there are many characters and plotlines, included in a mostly non-linear fashion) is absolutely spot-on. Honestly, I don't know if I've ever watched a more original film. I do recommend, however, the following tips when watching:<br/><br/>*This is a film that truly deserves your attention. Keep the distractions to a minimum for the best experience (even though you'll want to watch it over again once you finish) <br/><br/>*Watch this with at least one person, if possible. <br/><br/>This is literally the best movie I've watched so far this year. I only turned it off about 15 minutes ago and I have the urge to turn it back on, AND recommend it to everyone I know. (Including you, IMDB people! :)

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","Null","1","1","29 December 2017"," Indescribable ambition
","Ever see a film that you actually can't really, properly describe to someone? You often hear ""it's hard to describe"", but you know those ones where you really do find yourself short of a five second cocktail party summary, left with nothing to compare it to and no way to impart the contents in quick, succinct jargon? Jaco Van Dormael's Mr. Nobody is exactly that type of film, an experience so dense, disorienting and thought provoking that one needs at least a few months after the initial viewing alone to ruminate, mull it over and meditate on what was seen before even a word of analysis is offered. On surface level it's about a man named Nemo Nobody, played by Jared Leto in a jaw dropping, multifaceted encore of a performance. Nemo is over a hundred years old, the last mortal on an earth of now immortal humans, and he recounts his life, or many lives, rather, to a journalist. That's the diving board that vaults into an intricate narrative full of love, grief, joy, tragedy and the peculiarities of being human. We see Nemo at hundreds of junctures of his life, penultimate crossroads where he could make either choice, but if he makes neither of them, can then see both outcomes, how they carry forward his trajectory into the future towards more crossroads, more lives, more decisions, like the infinitely branching tributaries of an ever flowing river. How would one make a film like this work onscreen, you ask? Well, not easily. The thing runs almost three hours and often gets a little caught up in itself, especially in the midsection, but it's sheer ambition and uniquely structured storytelling carry it on wings of light, spanning through a hundred years and countless events that Nemo sees passing. He has three loves, or at least three the film focuses on: luminous Ana, played by an excellent Juno Temple and then Diane Kruger as she gets older, mentally unstable Elise (Sarah Polley) and Jean (Linh Dan Pham), all of whom help shape him or have key parts to play along the branches of his tree of life. There's a lynchpin event from his youth upon which it all hinges though; faced with the decision to move away with his mother (Natasha Little) as her train leaves, or stay behind with his father (Rhys Ifans), the boy begins to run, but also looks back. This nano-moment is the key to eternity here, the introspective Big Bang that gives way to our story. At times the film lags, and the slack could have been pulled tighter during the development of the three relationships, but the first and third acts that bookend the whole thing move along like the forces unseen around us, using cinematic tools to compose a symphony of motion, music, scientific pondering and emotional resonance. No other film is like this one, and my attempts to describe it above still just don't even scratch the surface of the dreams found within its runtime. There's only a few other ones out there that have aspirations as cosmic as this one, and most, including this, have made it into my personal canon of favourites. Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain, The Wachowski's Cloud Atlas and Terence Malick's Tree Of Life are such films, and Mr. Nobody now sits at their table."

","This is an incredible film in that it portrays different timelines in a coherent fashion. One can follow the alternative pasts despite them having divergent lines.

To understand this film is like trying to follow ""Last Year at Marienbad"" with a compilation of things that happened that didn't happen. Both are love stories that don't require analysis.<br/><br/>On another level it is like ""Little Big Man"" with an ancient man telling of things that maybe happened or perhaps occurred in an imagination.

","This movie might not be perfect, but it is intellectually stimulating, visually stunning, moving and incredibly rich.<br/><br/>In fact, that might be its main problem: there are enough ideas in this movie to make two or three. But if you enjoy complexity, this is a movie you should watch. <br/><br/>It is difficult to summarize it. To start with, it is a movie on chance (the famous ""butterfly effect""), on the impact of decisions on our lives (the old ""what if?"" idea, say, à la Sliding doors, but taken to an entirely different level of complexity), on the fascinating idea that there might be persons, events, which are bound to form part of our lives whichever choices we make, and on the tension between the fear, and the beauty, of not knowing what's coming next. Linked to all this is the fear of making decisions, any decision, since they rule out certain possibilities forever. Is it preferable not to chose (and ultimately, not live) or are all possible lives equally ""right""? <br/><br/>It is an extremely complex work. The sub-plots multiply and there comes an intriguing challenge – is there one logical explanation for all, or are there elements of deliberate irrationality? I am inclined towards for the first option but I might need to watch it a third time (at least) to come to a conclusion. <br/><br/>The images are beautiful. The colors are rich, there is plenty of symbolism and small details which might escape the first time one watches it. The camera dives into the protagonists' eyes with a quasi-hypnotic effect, the depth and emotions that they convey are rarely seen in movies. <br/><br/>I should mention the cast, overall very convincing. The actors who portray the characters at different ages have been exquisitely chosen. Again, it's the eyes – you can really recognize the young Anna in the older one. And the same goes for Nemo. My highest praise goes to Toby Regbo and Juno Temple, and the way the director has shot their teenagers' love scene. I had never seen a movie depicting in such a vivid and loving way the marvel of love at that age. I am still in awe. Sarah Polley was also excellent in portraying the character of a depressive woman (or most probably she's affected by bipolar disorder). She was so convincing that at times she made me shiver. <br/><br/>This is a movie that will make you think for a while. It might all sound very ""heavy"" but you will leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I really recommend watching it."
"soundoflight","2","4","9","8 September 2018"," Pseudo-scientific Pabulum
","There is a concept in food where something if something that is supposed to be sweet is made too sweet, it becomes ""cloyingly sweet"" and is ruined. That is how I would describe ""Mr. Nobody"" - a cloyingly sweet film that abandons any notions of realism, science, or logic in favour of an outpouring of style and sweetness. <br/><br/>It's one of those films that seems high-minded and intellectual, but there is really nothing there behind it, at least nothing that I found. I found it a bit nauseating to watch the overly sappy romances, with overly sappy love music overlaid, and overly stylistic camera angles applied... as I said, ""cloying."" The jump-cut style of the editing is also quite annoying and the jumping around in time grows tiresome extremely quickly. The logic holes in the plot quickly become apparent but the film slaps on more sap to cover them up. <br/><br/>Part of the problem is that I came to this film as a recommended ""science-fiction,"" but I can assure the reader that there is nothing scientific in the slightest about it. I see the IMDB tag does read ""Fantasy Romance"" and that is how I would accurately describe the film."

But the complete mixed way of telling the alternate timelines was an unsuccessful attempt. They should rather have done it like in Run, Lola, Run.<br/><br/>Confusing part (wich maybe someone can explain to me): what was it with this is weird dimension, where everyone wore check shirts, the streets were from a movie set and water was brought in via helicopter into the ocean?

And every choice leads you further and further away form that golden age of childhood innocence.<br/><br/>In Dormael's movies the soundtrack clearly illustrates that notion. Cheerful music for the childhood scenes. <br/><br/>He also implies that the use of fiction as a way of escaping reality and even trying to change it. all of this is, obviously, unfruitful.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews for this movie that are not good come from people that either looked at the big argument of the movie or followed the small episodes, not understanding that both are vital and should be understood as a whole.<br/><br/>For those that like this movie: check out Dormael's great Toto, Le Heros - the story of a guy who lives his whole live with the certainty that he was swapped as a child and he should be living someone else's life instead.

"queerever","8","3","6","2 November 2010"," But which are the 3 primary colours?
","Did anyone feel like they were getting sucked into Aronofsky's 'The Fountain' (which I HATED) but for an incomparably better experience?? <br/><br/>I think that I am not un/consciously doing: Aronofsky : 'Requim . . .' : Jared Leto : Mr. Nobody. <br/><br/>It felt like the pace, texture, colour, aural aesthetic and maybe a 9th other dimension was being engaged, to correct the wrongs of 'The Fountain'. I had waited as much for any film ever for 'The Fountain', after 'PI' and 'Requiem . . .', and it was also the biggest disappointment ever. Clichéd drivel, horribly boring and sentimental but . . . for what. HOWEVER, this felt like the extremely well made, seemingly obscure but not so much, exquisitely beautiful to look at exploration of love and loss that 'The Fountain' wanted to be. <br/><br/>What are the 3 primary colours? <br/><br/>A great, pretty little trick, putting the 3 girls in those colours :) BUT WHICH 3? Thanks to this film I went to learn that there are an ""additive"" and ""subtractive"" 3! Primary colours particularly for video! <br/><br/>It was such a great film in its attention to detail. I don't get off if a Director is showing off. Even ""similar"" films I like seem to be a LITTLE pretentious, ('Synecdoche' for example). But here the Director seemed to want to give us LOTS of little and playful pieces, witty and even WOW transitions, it was SO playful. And in THAT sense I agree with a review that it was like nothing else. (I have already made reference, and otherwise, it felt a LOT like a few other films). For my money, Jeunet/ Caro, 'Amelie' (would be the most famous) was pretty good & I liked it, but it seemed a little obsessed with ""faking the childish wonder"" in things, drivel in many ways, and again, more contrived than Mr. Nobody. (BUT, NO comparisons to 'Delicatessen', no no). Mr. Nobody is the only one of these that didn't need to cut 10 or so minutes, (except, again, how long was 'The Fountain'? :) Time wise, Mr. Nobody comes after all those comparisons, so of course the Director has that in his favour . . . ENOUGH! <br/><br/>Does anyone agree or care that the Asian girl (wife?) was as good as non existent to him? Would that be a parallel to the way Asians have (are) objectified by Europe and the USA as though not even humans? Which I believe is different to the racism with Blacks - IE. unconsciously, anti-black racism comes from inferiority complex/es, including if not particularly, physical ideas of perfection, penis size, etc. Write that off if you will, but you are wrong - once people are not starving, predominantly, sexual impulses will reign supreme in one way or another. Dave's example - what is the most marginalised sexuality? : Bi? Lesbian? Trans? . . . NO! Asexuality, fools. WAY OFF TOPIC, yes :) But I just like to explore any idea, and if anybody goes with me, the more the merrier."

","For large chunks of time the film feels much like a another take on the central idea of ""the butterfly effect"" (which would be alternating reality) while briefly toying with both fairytale like elements and sci-fi redemption fantasies. Which is kinda annoying in retrospective because the film would not lose much of its appeal had that stuff been left out. It would have however kept the playing time at bay. But hey, you get rewarded for your patience for in the movie's final scenes there are some nice shots of decompiling Virtual Reality. Eye candy for sure but I like to think of them as a bow to the ""tuning"" scenes of the quite awesome ""Dark City"".<br/><br/>So in all due shortness what do you get for your money? Well, basically it's what the majority of explosion-free movies has to offer - but all in one. Of course the whole thing resolves around issues like relationships, destiny, contentment and what not. But since the structure of narration turns the film into a sequence of episodic scenes you won't find lingering shots of endless monologue. Instead prepare yourself for tiny appetizers for a marital drama, a teenage love story, a tale of an unfolding midlife crisis, etc. Somebody sure tried to eliminate every potential for boredom and it's hard to blame him/her for it, because it pretty much worked. Solid acting and reasonably tame humor are included.<br/><br/>Should you watch it? Probably yes - even if you had trouble following ""Open your eyes/Vanilla Skies"" for the final conclusion does not offer a change of perspective of any sort. This is ambiguous for it means if you hope to be given an explanation or a surprising twist you end up feeling betrayed. But on the other hand you are spared the task of remembering all the ""WTF was that all about"" moments from early on and reinterpret them. Permission to zoom out granted.<br/><br/>Should you watch it if you're a guy? Yeah, nope."

For people similar to me, I can be direct and to the point. This movie raises some interesting philosophical questions about the choices we make in life, and the possibilities of roads not taken. Sadly he storyline and screenplay are a mess, and far too many ideas are included. Time travel, science fiction, a possibly-semi-dystopia future. The 141 minutes taken to explore all of these ideas were tedious and painful. The moods were inconsistent, and it feels to me as though it was all poorly realized.

Therefore the entire film could be one big dream. Or he indeed retold at least 3 versions of his life story to a journalist. Each life story is plausible, each is substantially different, yet deviated from only the slightest change in destiny, or personal choice. Mr. Nobody said that ALL life choices are ""right"". Are all his life choices equally ""right"" for you? The futuristic parts about immortality, with computer animations, are really not very connected to the core story.

","Listen up. If you want to watch a intellectually stimulating film with a very unorthodox structure, watch Memento. If you want to watch a sad surreal film, watch Synecdoche, New York. If you want to watch a happy surreal film, watch The Grand Budapest hotel.<br/><br/>This is one of the coolest concepts of storytelling ever. Unfortunately, it is executed 
badly.<br/><br/>First let me state the good things about this movie. It has a very cool concept. It has very pretty cinematography. Some of the shots are beautiful and creative. Some of the acting is nice at certain parts. And I have to admit, it is quite unique. A lot of it is just pretentious nothing, but some of it is quite unique.<br/><br/>Now the bad things.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is so much just random stuff that has nothing to do with anything. Why is he explaining the butterfly effect? Why are they talking about pigeon experiments? What's with the angels and the babies? Why the hell can he see into the future? Why does the model version of the world in his room match perfectly with the real world? Why are all the endings of the timelines shown at the beginning? How does any of this change or impact the emotional value of the movie anyway?<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really start until thirty minutes into the movie, when he's running after his mother in the train. It is prefaced with thirty actual minutes of just nonsense that is simply there to confuse you and make you think there is symbolic meaning behind it or some shit. Once it does start, it's....... bad. Nemo has almost zero character at all, in every single timeline. The tiny bit of characterization that they give him makes him very unlikeable. He pretends to kill himself so much that his mother isn't even surprised anymore. This is supposed to make me like him? He ""falls in love"" with people through a montage of slow motion shots of them looking pretty instead of actually having a natural conversation or having any chemistry at all. The plots don't have any direction. You just kind of watch his life happen. There is no goal he is trying to reach or problem he is trying to over come. There isn't really a ""point"" to the story. Sometimes this works fine, like in Forrest Gump. But that was a masterfully written script that is so engaging that it manages to pull it off. This movies does not. For the most part the acting is passable for the adult actors. The same cannot be said about the child actors. They are bad. Very bad.<br/><br/>You know how this film could be fixed? Cut out all the philosophical garbage. Cut out the plot line in the future where he's old. Don't spend so much time explaining to the audience the concept of the movie and just show them the actual movie. Stop explaining how the story had multiple timelines and they are all just as real as one another. Make Nemo a normal kid who doesn't see into the future. Switch between the different branches of the story in a clear and consistent way where the audience knows what timeline they are in at all times. And most importantly of all: Tell the story of a (relatively) normal person that branches out into several wildly different but all (relatively) normal storylines. If you want to tie several timelines together in a cathartic way, do it subtly, through music and editing.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie is very pretentious and squanders a perfectly good concept."

","A very polished and ambitious film, Mr Nobody does in an unnecessarily complicated way what other films have done a lot better. I'm thinking for example of Medem's Lovers of the Arctic Circle (the step-brother / sister arc is more or less the same) or of Lepage's Possible Worlds. <br/><br/>Yes, Van Dormael knows how to charm his audience with beautiful images and profound existential themes that will make spectators feel intelligent, but he will only touch these themes in the most shallow way, to such a point that his film could be perceived as an accumulation of ideas and images that go all over the place without anything among them remotely resembling a thought, and certainly not an original thought. I am reminded of another annoying seemingly- profound filmmaker who's films also lack cohesion: Claude Lelouch.<br/><br/>The choice of Jared Leto as a protagonist doesn't help the film to seem more profound: the pretty actor remains skin-deep and seems to have no idea what a real human with an inner life might look like."
"midas-jacobs","9","2","4","10 April 2016"," A simple story told in a complicated way, but still manages to stay fantastic.
","The hard part of this review is writing the synopsis, but I'll try. We meet Nemo Nobody, who is put into a difficult decision. Leave with his mom, or stay with his dad. He chose both. No we see all different time lines that could've been. (This is the best I could come up with)<br/><br/>The director comes from Belgium, which I didn't know at first, and is called Jaco Van Dormael. He has created probably the only good Belgian movie, that I've seen. I am from Belgium myself, and trust me, we don't make a lot of good movies. Sometimes we get recognized for some movies like the Oscar nomination for ""Broken circle breakdown"", and also for ""Bullhead"". Schoenaarts became popular in Hollywood due to that movie, but I'm drifting away. Van Dormael did a fantastic job at directing the movie. He has a special technique, and I like that. He has put a lot of effort in the movie, which you can clearly see. Van Dormael tried to be experimental at times, and also succeeded at it. But the part that I found really cool is how he handled the focus. Normally they just use it so you know where your attention is supposed to be. In this movie they use it to create a more mysterious look, but it also makes a pretty shot. Of course the directing isn't the only good thing about this movie, so let's move on. The cinematography was done good as well. This was done by Christophe Beaucarne. Another thing that stood out to me was the editing. This was also thanks to the great director. There were a lot of shots (the marriage sequences in example) where this was used to give a nice flow from changing scenes. This can also be see, when Nemo and Anna are making out, and the camera starts to turn around them, where after they lay down on the bed. It's hard to describe in words, but if you've seen the movie, I think you'll understand me.<br/><br/>This movie isn't prefect, but that's just me nitpicking, so let's start with the nitpicking, even though it's just one thing I want to say here. The make-up for old Jared Leto. It looked fine for me, but it looked also like just another layer of a sort of rubber put on him. So I can understand why some people will see this as an issue.<br/><br/>No I'll talk a bit about the acting. Keep in mind that I won't go over everyone, and mostly do the adult actors. Let's start with the main character. The main character is ""cleverly"" called Nemo Nobody. And I said ""Cleverly"" because Nemo is nobody in Latin. This was a fun little easter egg. Nemo was played by Jared Leto, but also by Toby Regbo and Thomas Byrne. They were all good, but like I've said, I'll mainly focus on the adult actors. Leto also played the 100 year old Nemo, and with this part I have an issue. The voice he used. His body language was very good, but the voice just really didn't sound right. Also the laugh at the end of the movie was very weird, I know that it was supposed to be backwards. The next person is one of his wives, well sort of, and also his stepsister... This was Anna, as adult she was played by Diane Kruger. Of course there were again child actresses. She was good, just like the other actresses. One of his other wives is Elise, as an adult she was played by Sarah Polley. She too was good. From her we saw a more emotional side, which she handled very well. The last of his wives was Jean. Linh Dan Pham played her. We didn't get to see a lot of her, but for the parts she had, she was good. I'll stop this part of my review here, because you might have noticed that I've used the word 'good' a lot. That's because everyone in this movie acted good. See there is it again. That's why I'll stop, because It might get a bit repetitive.<br/><br/>Now let's talk a bit about the screenplay. This was written by the director himself. And hats of to him. He did a good job at it. The story is told in a non-linear way. This could have been a disaster of a mess, but he has created a very well crafted movie. He managed to give the movie a deep meaning about choices, and it makes you rethink some things. He uses the butterfly effect too in the movie. This is actually a very big part of the movie, and it was cool to see it handled so well in a movie. The dialogue was good too. But a thing I liked the most on this part of the movie is the character of Nemo. It's written in such a way, that his character changes in every different 'timeline', this is due to the good writing. The only thing that really bothered me was the twist at the end. It all takes place inside of the nine year old boys head. Even though this is a sad moment in the movie, and also heartbreaking, I thought that he could've come up with a better twist.<br/><br/>But in the end ""Mr. Nobody"" is a fantastic movie that everyone should check out.<br/><br/>9.25/10"
"sharky_55","5","2","4","8 March 2016"," Zugzwang
","So the big plot twist in Mr Nobody is that all of these timelines, even the one in the future where an elderly Nemo is being interviewed by a confused British journalist, are all figments of the imagination of a little boy. He is stuck between a choice that will presumably fling his life into two directions: stay with dad, or go with mum. In one of his theorised timelines, he is a television presenter, and this is a convenient way for Van Dormael to introduce all the buzz words and clue the viewer in with a bit of exposition. It's like if someone took pop psychology 101 and read the Wikipedia article on theoretical physics; these interrupting TED talks are a way to broach these complex issues and theories without ever really engaging with them. In another timeline an adult Nemo has devoted himself to photographing and recoding decay, which allows him to reverse footage and, in vain, combat entropy. And as he makes that agonising decision at the train, his shoe slips, and the fates of all the timelines comes up to pure luck. <br/><br/>Time and time again Van Dormael will rob these coincidences of any emotional factor or impact. What does it matter whether he chooses mum or dad? Maybe a tiny, split second decision will render it all in vain anyway. Maybe he will slip and be crushed by the train itself. Van Dormael blows up every little moment and decision as if it was some pivotal, life-changing fork in the road - with agonising slow motion, shallow focus shots and a desperate, wistful score to milk every last drop of profundity and poignancy from the scene. It thinks itself to be a vast and universal treatment, exploring every single possibility, every timeline, every tiny decision, but it's actually remarkably closed off. When Van Dormael doesn't know how to close off a plot line, he will write in incidents of blind or dumb luck, as if that is how life goes - a car crash or two, a gas explosion, a murder. And in the final ending, it collapses on itself and invalidates its own logic by creating an entirely different, implausible scenario by itself, thinking that it has earned that satisfying conclusion. It hasn't at all - it is inexplicable how we end up with the perfect story, having only briefly explored all the other wrong turns. And it presents an illusion on the fate of not choosing at all - to not choose is also a choice. One might wonder if little Nemo had wore a different pair of shoes and slipped and cracked his head on that open field - but the movie does not even concern itself with this bigger problem it has created. It just presents a neat little science-fiction type resolution, and it is unsatisfying. <br/><br/>It doesn't help that the final destination of Anna leaves much to desire. The experiences and scenes of their youth are sweet enough, but this hardly seems to mean they are fated to be together forever. Van Dormael drenches this timeline with unbearably sappy moments as if to loudly signal that this is 'the one': staring at each other in bed, making dramatic lifelong promises of true love, layering flashbacks over each other. And visually he pulls out the all stops - time lapses that create frozen moments of time where they catch each other's eye, seamless edits that link past and present, transitions that use eye and photo motifs. But it's all in vain - it undermines any genuine relationship it creates by telling us exactly which thread of fate is the perfect one. There's no need to be interested if we just patiently wait for the right choices to be made. Kruger's performance is strangely hollow for what is supposed to be the dream girl. <br/><br/>Jeanne is merely an afterthought, while Polley's Elise manages to actually be engaging in the little time she is afforded. It's timeline has the most coherency of them all - despite all the jump in and outs, it maintains a solid emotional tension. Polley's acting, particularly in that forced happiness during the birthday party, is so painfully striking and true. But like all the other timelines, it still descends into that same pitfall. Van Dormael focuses on single little moment - maybe buying a pair of cheap Brazilian jeans, or saying a wrong word, or helping a homeless man, and creates this dramatic, feigned importance around it. But instead of lifting giving it poignancy, all it does it sabotage itself for more and more interruptions. What about 2 minutes ago, when you had milk instead of juice for breakfast? What about when you put on your left shoe first instead of your right? What if Nemo had not been the child of the heterosexual white couple? Mr Nobody tries so desperately to grab onto every little possibility, and ends up giving none of them any real emotional significance at all."

","I happened on this fantastic film yesterday having never heard anything about it in advance. Similarities to my mind: The old film ""Slaughterhouse Five"" from the Kurt Vonnegut story about an individual who's 'come unstuck in time'. The not widely seen Alain Resnais film ""Je t'aime je t'aime"". And the interview/narration by a very old man with which Jack Crabb bookends ""Little Big Man"".<br/><br/>What are the themes? Real and deep (for a movie) and current science, especially about motivations, behavior and habits, and the physics of time. The importance of (fragmented and nonlinear) memory. Ennui once you meet all your life goals (goal too low? too materialistic? too silly and unrealistic? ...?). The obstacles of people and emotions that don't quite fit overcome for now, yet resurfacing in baleful form years later. What if some of the possible freak accidents all around all the time actually happened? How the most trivial incident can determine an entire life: 'how would my life have been different if I'd missed that train?'. So long as one doesn't choose, both possibilities remain open. What we call reality is really just someone's imagination - an author typing away, or a child mapping his future. What's the purpose of time's arrow? Now stir them all together so nothing predominates.<br/><br/>The film is endlessly visually inventive. Sudden close-ups, episodes of slo-mo in the midst of the action, showing things backward. Even a self-referential display of a DVD freezing and skipping was so realistic I was about to summon the theater staff. Sometimes the effects are unobtrusively motivated by the story line, other times they call attention to themselves. Sometimes they're physics stills come to life, as in the rather famous freezes of a drop of water hitting the surface of a pond here shown in full motion. Sometimes they're unique: although I've seen lots of sex scenes, I've never before seen a closeup of skin hairs standing up indicating arousal. Every scale and sensibility is probed: from the mundane smallness of an auto instrument panel to huge structures careening through outer space. Moving displays routinely occupy any large flattish surface -even clear or curved ones; an interior wall becomes a soothing pattern of constantly moving ocean waves. After a while, as an elaborate joke, we see helicopters submerging those wave walls back into the real ocean.<br/><br/>The astounding makeup is much more than the convincing age of the protagonist (including a few long wispy white hairs growing out of the baldness). Television announcers have microphones surgically embedded in their cheeks. We see the protagonist with an injured face immediately after an explosion - later his face carries a slight scar in that same place. Along with traditional tattoos, we see believable 3D ones. A seriously injured hospital patient has a bruise around his trach tube.<br/><br/>Much is very funny, in a cool ironic way that passes right by. Different couples explaining why they wanted a baby had me in stitches. The parody of live news is priceless. Non sequiturs and double entendres abound, making mulling the dialog a delight. A lost sneaker reappears later at giant size.And there's lots of subtle unreality. Accents come and go. Immediately after a pool rescue the pool is covered. <br/><br/>There are special effects galore. But they're unobtrusive to the point of being invisible. A few in service of the storyline are fairly obvious: an auto accident, an explosion, space travel, etc. But most are hidden. Just one example: a couple will be pouring morning coffee in their kitchen, hug, and in one continuous movement fall on the bed in their bedroom. It feels and looks so natural, until you think 'there was a wall there!' and 'that bed headboard was a kitchen table a moment ago!'. Counting all those, this movie has more special effects than any other I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Visual themes recur. A slick leaf on the pavement is responsible for at least three different accidents and life paths. And we see that leaf yet again as a child contemplates it. A bad dream about space travel shows up again much later as reality. A promise between teenage lovers seems hopelessly romantic at the time, yet many years later it's really carried out. Sometimes we see the same event from a different point of view; other times the event starts exactly the same, but then turns out differently, an alternate reality. Locations recur too, again sometimes from a different point of view. An imagined accident happens at a railroad grade crossing, a train station platform is shown several times, and a child trying to decide which way to run on the railroad tracks winds up running down the road instead. Near the end the camera pulls back and we realize they're all the same place.<br/><br/>Although sometimes tongue in cheek and almost never calling attention to itself, the science seems accurate. For example transport from a spaceship to the surface of a planet is shown by 'space elevator'. Yet it's never called out or named or explained, and mostly we only see parts of it. It's just assumed. The animal behavior experiments seem pretty current. The time the characters live in seems consistent with some interpretations of quantum physics. The wildest futures -suspended animation for example- are thrown in with the rest, blurring the line between fiction and reality. Then, just when you think this might be an episode of Mr. Science, something truly goofy appears: when the 'big crunch' happens, clockworks stop, then restart, except backward! <br/><br/>It sounds crazily fragmented, but marvelously it all hangs together emotionally. The film must have been created as much in the editing room as behind the camera. Never before have I seen an end credit thanking all the participants in scenes which were cut and never made it into the final movie."

Then 30 minutes I'm finally understanding a storyline... and here it comes the better: the story becomes so intense and mind-blowing, with some references of Strings Theory and some sci-fi things (it's not really fantasy, for me it's more sci-fi). Jared Leto was perfect in acting...as well Director and other actors.
The kids/boys in the movie acted perfectly as well.<br/><br/>I love how the film ends...cause (I don't have to tell you, u will understand if u watch :D )

I like Thought provoking films like I Origins, Her, Donnie Darko, Get Out, Memento etc.<br/><br/>For me, this film bring me back to a time of my childhood, all of it, the cinematic, the soundtracks, like every aspect of the film, altough I'm asian, the culture is very different, the people looks completely different, but somehow this movie have some sort of relateness to me personally. The imagination of this film is bizzare and somehow remind me being a child, I use to imagine things.<br/><br/>For some films like Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterd, and Hateful Eight, they are great movies that I constantly revisited, because I like the tense, the dialogue, the writing, I always found something new everytime I rewatched.

"brenden33","10","0","0","9 October 2019"," Rainbow romance.
","This movie is many things however romance shines the brightest for me.
Brilliant, outstanding, a contender for inclusion in the top 10 best ever films, however with a but. Can you relate to it?
All films try to take you on a ride. Do you catch the train or drive the car or just run? Choices are the premise of the film that lead to the 3 loves of Nemo. Have you been one of the 3 loves in Nemo's life or his parents or are you a watcher like the reporter or hypnotist?
First loves are the strongest and the hardest to hold. The writer links water to romance and from the swimming pool to the car accident into the river. Being honest and letting yourself be immersed in love is symbolic. Like all romances there are rocky moments to make the final bonding all the more wonderful. The science fiction elements here just obstruct the love beautifully.
This is not an action film. It is a long film so take a break, like the films of old and have an interval. Grab a drink and reflect on your loves."

","This is the most immersive movie ever. When nobody is in love with his 15 year old step sister i really felt in love , I was living it. Of course this isn't the only example, when he had to choose between his parents I felt like I had to choose I felt so bad and torn apart. In every other story I also had such strong feelings these where just the strongest in my opinion.
I felt I was violated I have never felt so involved and present in a movie, I had so much simpathy with each and every character. I am going to think about this movie constantly for the next couple days.

","What a film!!! <br/><br/>People that found this confusing, fear not! I have the answers to your confusions! <br/><br/>(Warning spoilers)<br/><br/>The film isn't listed in order, it is a jumbled collection of time, reality, and fantasy, much like what have dementia is like. A lot of symbolism is used in the film to create meaning, so keep your eyes open.<br/><br/>My Nan is 84 and suffers with stage 9 dementia, it breaks my heart to see how far she has declined . The thing that makes me happy though is the fact i can ask her about her past and she can remember something! The person that is trapped behind the disease comes out again!<br/><br/>The same can be said for the film, you don't really know who he is when you ask him in the present tense, he is Nemo , a confused 118 year old in the year 2092. However, when the psychologist tries to explore his past you get some information, that is more like a puzzle than the answer, but it gives you the resources to build some of the truth behind who Nemo really is.<br/><br/>My Nan talks about past events and they can be jumbled at times, but i see each story as a clue to the whole truth and i have rearranged her stories to make the puzzle fit into the whole picture of what happened! <br/><br/>Firstly Nemo tries to place himself , who am i? , ""how old am i?"" , ""who did i know in my life? , ""who where my parents?"", ""what events can i remember that were significant?"".<br/><br/>Nemo sees himself as a Dad at first, who is wearing an 80's styled jacket, but he eventually realizes that he was born in 1975 and was much to young to be a Dad during this time period. The story changes and he sees himself as a 9 year old boy, which is the foundation of most of his memories into the person that he is.<br/><br/>The 9 year old Nemo remembers pleasant things about his mom and loves his dad, but you can tell he doesn't really know his Dad, because he only focuses on what his dad does and not who he is - ie ""my Dad is a weatherman"".<br/><br/>He remembers three girls from his childhood that liked him, Anna, Blonde girl, and Gene, they wave to him and say ""hi Nemo as he walks passed"". He focuses on Anna first, your first symbolic event that points to the truth. <br/><br/>You later see him looking at Anna as the boys leave the pool and the girls come in, none of the other girls get as much time as Anna does in Nemos memories when he was young.<br/><br/>Nemo says that he can see the future before it has happened, and i believe this is because he is sensitive to events, but also evidence that 2092 is actually real and not just "" the imagination of a 9 year old boy""(stated at the end of the film) . Nemo has to have disbelief about waking up in a strange future with little knowledge about who he is, so he attributes his confusion to pure imagination and fantasy, as a coping mechanism.<br/><br/>The dad leaves the break off his car accidentally and the car rolls down the hill hitting a mother pushing her baby across the street. You don't see whether she was killed, but it is assumed she was, the baby can still be heard crying when the car hits the mother.<br/><br/>The dad is potrayed as a good man, but someone who doesn't have very much stability over his life, the accident and predicting the wrong weather point to this. The lack of stability probably effected Nemos mom and left her to feel powerless, she then started an affair with Anna's dad. Nemo spots his mom in the forest kissing Annas dad on the way home from school, he is seen as being upset and stares at Anna who is sitting on the dock throwing pebbles, symbolic of the butterfly effect, how one small ripple(event) ,creates bigger ripples later on! <br/><br/>Nemo's parents get a divorce and Nemo has to choose at the train station platform who he wants to live with, his mom or his dad. The scene is the most important in the entire film and it is described by Nemo as an earth shattering event in his life.<br/><br/>The quote that characterizes the entire film is said ""Making a choice leaves only one possibility, but making none leaves every possibility!""<br/><br/>Nemo can't remember what choice he made, so his mind creates scenarios and consequences for every possible choice. He views two possibilities of what happened if he stayed in England with his dad and two possibilities if he went to America with his mom.<br/><br/>The situation with his dad didn't happen and there are many little clues to this. Firstly, Nemo can see the future and he saw that the mother pushing the baby was killed by his dads car, he is adamant about the fact and repeats it several times throughout his past memories. <br/><br/>Yet when he stays with his dad in England ,during the possible scenario, his dad is paralyzed and in a wheelchair. The version of Nemos life would have proved his visions incorrect, as in this reality his dad saw the car rolling in time and instead of seeing a mother be killed for his mistake, he jumped in the path of his own car to save her, thus becoming disabled.<br/><br/>The version of Nemos life with his dad didn't happened because it contradicts a strong theme throughout the film ""i can see the future"". He didn't end up with Blonde girl ,or Gene and he wasn't hit off his bike as a teenager. The scifi story that he wrote and is played when he is in hospital seems to be a forgotten account of his adult life between the ages of 34 and 117.<br/><br/>Nemo may have been to Mars and witnessed a tragedy that had a profound effect on him and it can be seen again in his version of life with Gene, he is watching a news story about an oil tanker exploding on a bridge, which directly links to the scifi story.<br/><br/> I believe the version of Nemos life with his dad never happened, but i do believe they are symbolic of the loss Nemo felt for his dad and some traumatic events he had witnessed during his life as an adult.<br/><br/>People can point to the scene with the shoe factory and the manager of the shoe factory considering to buy the inferior shoelaces, that would snap, thus causing Nemo to trip and miss his mothers train, leading him to a life spent in England with his Dad. Yet, watch the scene again, you can see how unimpressed the shoemaker looks with the sheepish looking shoelace sales man, i think this proves he didn't buy inferior materials.<br/><br/>The stories do have purposes and even the ones that didn't happen, but i will get to that after i tell you the true story of Nemos life.<br/><br/>Nemo made it to the train and spent his life with his mom in America.He began living with his moms new husband and his daughter Anna, who he fondly remembered from his childhood. <br/><br/>They fall passionately in love, to the dismay of their parents, but the story takes another fork and the audience must decide whether the parents divorced and Anna and Nemo were separated or they stayed together, thus ensuring the young lovers stayed together as well.<br/><br/>The version of life where Nemo and Anna didn't get separated saw them living a happy life together, but Nemo runs his car off the road after a bird slams into his window, causing him to crash into a river and drown. The moment we can prove that the present day Nemo ,2092, exisist as an old man in the future, the version where Nemo dies isn't possible , because he is actually 117 years old in the future! <br/><br/>Thus the only possibility left and the truth of what happened is the version where Nemo and Annas dad split up. The two young lovers are separated for years , but refuse to love anyone else.<br/><br/>The two lovers become older and bump into each other again, but Anna becomes overwhelmed by finally meeting the only person she has wanted for years, she needs time to think for a few days. However, she hands Nemo her number before she leaves, but a random rain drop falls on it and smudges the number.<br/><br/>Nemo is devastated because he has lost her number, but waits at the bench near the lighthouse and sleeps there for days. The most important clue of the film, Nemo draws a circle on the ground , symbolizing completion (this version of the story will lead to a full circle-the truth) He evens wakes and imagines Anna in the circle, overjoyed to see him, the part of his life that would have completed him.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you can see each version of Nemo recognizing one another and trying figure out which is which, symbolizing the present day Nemos confusion over who he really is.<br/><br/>Nemo never moved form the bench for a long time and eventually became stricken by grief from the loss of Anna from his life. He became a homeless person who lived on the streets and disengaged from society completely, because Anna was his only reason for living or having a life.<br/><br/>He may have gone to mars from the age of 34-117 and witnessed a tragedy in space or he may have seen it reported on tv, while he was living on the streets and had some repressed trauma come back to him, as i said before about the scifi story and Nemos dad.<br/><br/>He may have wandered the streets for decades before being picked up by the authorities after years of being disconnected from society. He had not registered his identity or got any modern procedures done , thus his identity was unknown and he became Mr Nobody. He may have had to see several psychologists when they found him, hence the flashbacks and the reason why he had a psychologists still talking to him at his old age.<br/><br/>The alternative lives surrounding the other girls that Nemo imagines is negative, he sees Gene as someone boring and Blonde girl being the source of immense pain and dulling of his life.<br/><br/>The loss of Anna was no fault of either of them, but a random act of fate, though it caused him a lot of grief. Yet, in the end Nemo was left with a bitter sweet feeling, to have had true love in his life and bitterness for losing that love of his life.<br/><br/>Nemo is on his death bed and he realizes this fact that he and Anna shared true love and said "" this has been a wonderful day"" , he remembered who he truly was and in his dying breath he said "" Anna"".<br/><br/>(i wanted to write about the choices but id don't have room) The films main message is that one choice can have massive effects, the butterfly effect."

","What if your true love never crossed your path because you made a different decision? In essence, this is the film. It is a study in paradoxes and time travel, also encompassing whether reality is real or imagination, and vice versa. <br/><br/>Don't worrry, this review will not spoil it for you. There are no words to describe Nemo Nobody's adolescent love affair, which is so idyllic yet also typical, for the time it is permitted to thrive. There are also no words to describe the betrayal and loss Nemo experiences in the course of his interdimensional travels.<br/><br/>The casting couldn't be better. Furthermore, there are no conflicts of interest between storytelling and moviemaking. The politics of today do not enter, no distractions from Left or Right, meaning you can relax and let the writing, acting, directing, and effects wash over you as pure cinema.<br/><br/>In the 155 minute version I saw, some elements seemed extraneous, but not to excess, and therefore it retains a 10 score in my book."

","At about the one-hour point in the telling of this decidedly tangled, muddled and completely convoluted Sci-Fi, soap opera tale, Nemo Nobody suddenly hollered out ""I'm fugging bored!"" And, let me tell ya - When it came to my general feelings about this particular study of cinematic schizophrenia, I couldn't have agreed more with Mr. Nobody on that one.<br/><br/>Isn't it funny (even ironic) sometimes how just one, simple line of dialogue (like ""I'm fugging bored!""), flippantly uttered by a character, can pretty much sum up the general feelings of the viewer for a movie in a literal nutshell? <br/><br/>I find it quite amusing that the American Film Institute (AFI) actually lists Mr. Nobody as being one of the best European movies of 2010.<br/><br/>To me, that really isn't saying too much. My guess as to why the AFI ranked it in such a lofty position has to do with the fact that Mr. Nobody seems to go well out of its way to emulate many American films included in the same genre.<br/><br/>Though Mr. Nobody did feature some very impressive visuals, I found that it tried, with too much determination, to squeeze the likes of deja vu, alternate realities, and the notorious butterfly effect into its gruelling 155-minute storyline.<br/><br/>And as a final result of this, very little concern seemed to be paid to all of the many, many loose ends that this business was inevitably creating.<br/><br/>If nothing else, this film did introduce me to the word ""zugzwang"".

","Despite an interesting frame narrative for this series of parallel possible lives and some beautiful cinematography, this film ultimately falls flat. The basic idea is great: the only man in the future who hasn't been genetically altered to live forever is telling his story, but he appears to have had a quasi-quantum physics experience in which he was able to relive his life several different ways, so the story of his life moves in multiple directions. Unfortunately, the lives he lived were, at best, pedestrian love stories, and the film makers spent far too much time drawing out the schmaltzy love scenes of each one, so that eventually, you'll find yourself fast forwarding past the countless ""I'll love you forever"" scenes to find out that, once again, things will end tragically. If it were chopped down to about an hour and a half, and the various stories were better than simplistic, predictable romance fare, this film might have been interesting."

"cazimir_middel","8","2","5","10 May 2014"," Mr Nobody vs. The Butterfly Effect: A philosophical journey vs. mere entertainment.
","The philosophical aspect of this film is to me by far the biggest difference with e.g. The Butterfly Effect (a film that this is compared to a lot). These two movies indeed share a lot of thematic similarities, as they are both about determinism, but TBE is pretty shallow and not designed to be much more than (for some) an enjoyable flick which uses determinism to reach those goals. Mr. Nobody on the other hand is a (not so shallow) philosophical study on determinism which rather seems to be made with the idea to get people to think about this rather than to simply entertain them with it.<br/><br/>Besides the philosophical aspects, this film also has some truly beautiful cinematography, good acting, a pretty nice and fitting soundtrack and even some (arguably) dystopian elements, which makes it even better. Needless to say that one cannot compare Jared Leto to Ashton Kutcher, without trying to discredit Ashton Kutcher of course.<br/><br/>Up to yesterday I had no idea that this film even existed, but it's needless to say that it has been a very pleasant surprise."
"tieman64","Null","2","5","4 December 2013"," The Cosmic Orphan
","Directed by Jaco Van Dormael, ""Mr Nobody"" stars Jared Leto as an elderly man who reminisces about his past life. The film's big gimmick, however, is this: Leto's character is able to see what his life would have been like had he made different choices as a child, teenager and adult. Dormael's film thus contains several overlapping narratives, in which we witness as each of Jared's ""lifetimes"" unfold.<br/><br/>Dormael's film pretends to be about chaos, chance, choice and indeterminism, but ultimately does something else. His film, at times overtly, at times covertly, believes in fate, true love, right choices and the comfortable closure afforded by destiny. His film panders to the ego, and bows down to man's ability to choose, make rational decisions and be self-directed. It is a paean to free-agency, and almost every aesthetic and narrative choice either intentionally or unintentionally undermines the more horrific aspects of existentialism. Indeed, though the film pretends to be about a mankind suffocated by the sheer weight of possibility, the actual ""options"" presented to Leto are small-minded, and mostly have to do with sex.<br/><br/>Resolutely postmodern, ""Mr Nobody"" is comprised of a series of self-contained, busily directed vignettes, most of which are evocative of similar and better films. As the film's realities and time-lines shift, so to does Dormael's style. Bizarrely for a film about ""complexity"", each time-line is comprised of a fairly simple, generic story, each with many overly dramatic moments (lots of explosions and deaths). To make matters worse, Leto's character (called Nemo, Latin for ""no man"") is always aware that he is ""experiencing a different time-line"", which leads to our hero looking perpetually confused. Better to have each time-line completely separate from the other, with no ""bleeding"" between each of the film's multiple universes.<br/><br/>Indeterminism, incidentally, is the bedrock of film noir. Influenced by the birth of 20th century existentialism, early noirs traditionally watched as poor schmucks were yanked about by a conspiratorial cosmos, poked and prodded like puppets on string. A noir like Kubrick's ""The Killing"", for example, which utilises a fractured narrative somewhat similar to ""Mr Nobody's"", is exclusively about a character who attempts to control his life, only to see it veer off into surprising and unsuspecting directions. Each of his actions have a billiard-ball effect, each choice inciting a causal chain of reactions. Kubrick's hero, exasperated by the universe's law of derailment, eventually gives up with an ""Eh, what's the point?"". Dormael's climax espouses the opposite.<br/><br/>5/10 – Worth one viewing."

","A poetic embrace of ideas that have percolated in my own consciousness produce a vivid time-traveling adventure for Nemo. I'm sure this character was inspired by the childhood movie, Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland , a favorite of many. If this was the impetus, it sparked a creative entry into modern film-making of self-aware destination. The machinations makes this film entertaining and thought-provoking. The emotional ties to the characters generate enough empathy. Nemo is a likable character that goes through changes because of self-inflicted choices, his emotional struggles split between multiple realities.<br/><br/>Toby Regbo is the best incarnation of Nemo according to his performance, Jared Leto forgettable as always. I'm not sure what compels people to cast Leto, who has a vapidity about him that is amounts to a constant blank stare. Juno Temple gives an palpable emotional performance as younger Anna. This period of time and relationship is probably the strongest throughout the film. Elise is obviously bipolar by the first appearance by Clare Stone, who gives Sarah Polley a great lead in before she even gives the character a go. Give all the credit to Stone for this character. Polley is actually the perfect casting choice for the bi-polar, older Elise. Krueger really can't hide her accent at all and really as the same problem with Leto, which is, pretty faces don't make up for the lack of acting chops.<br/><br/>Stylistically and melodically, the poetry of visual style and musical accompaniment resonate. Mental stimulation is at the top of the Jaco Van Dormael's list. Factoids litter the piece without too much distraction from the story.<br/><br/>The only issue I see with this film is the runtime, which is 2hrs and 18 mins. It starts to lose its emotional power as it delves deeper into the confusion.<br/><br/>""We only exist in the imagination of a child with an impossible choice."" That moment gave me the chills necessary for my 8. I was teetering at a 7, but that moment made this movie work for me.<br/><br/>Another cut can still help this movie, which can make it stronger."

After the movie started, my concerns were deepened when I realized this is a European movie and also a co-production. At that point I knew I had stepped on the doodoo train, but the door had already closed. I endured the whole 2 hours and 35 minutes heroically, but I admit I was checking the clock every five minutes and was making calculations when the torture will end. The only good thing about this movie was Diane Kruger and that's because I find her attractive and want to have sex with her. This also seemed to be the main hero's motivation to live for half the movie. The other half he spent his time with some other women, who seemed too boring. Honestly speaking, this movie is a pretentious mess of half-digested metaphysical concepts, substandard sci-fi elements, horny teenage problems and producers with too much money. The irony of this movie is that at one point the main character says: ""most of the time nothing happened, like a french movie"". The same applies here. People move around, talk something and yet nothing really happens. Complete nonsense. The movie is utterly devoid and sterilized of any message. Avoid this movie at any cost, unless you want to get really depressed."

","The special effects were pretty cool, and overall, the technical elements seemed fairly well done. And the story seemed to flow fairly well. <br/><br/>The big problem for me was in trying to determine what the story was. There seemed to be multiple parallel tracks that the protagonist seemed to have taken simultaneously. So he's married to three different women in three parallel tracks. Confused ? Mystified ? I certainly was.<br/><br/>And then, near the end, we're given an explanation for what happened. But this explanation doesn't make any sense. The sophistication of the worlds we're presented with is way beyond the ability of any child, no matter how precocious. <br/><br/>And herein lies, I believe, the fundamental flaw to this movie. Interesting things happen simultaneously in three parallel tracks, to the protagonist, but by the end, one pivotal scene pretty much negates everything that happened earlier in the movie. <br/><br/>The deeply flawed and nearly incomprehensible story eclipsed the movie's special effects and excellent technical elements."

","Mr Nobody whilst scraping at a genius level caliber could have just as easily been created by a child. The movie is in non-linear fashion and often so disjointed from one scene to another that the viewer's perception of time and reality is challenged. <br/><br/>Without ruining the movie; its premise is based around the idea that there are infinite possibilities in life so as long as the protagonist(Nemo) doesn't make a choice. Once a choice is made however, the viewer is given a snippet of the journey Nemo takes as a result of this one choice. Whilst not in chronological order the movie's pivotal point is when Nemo as a boy has to choose between a life with his Mother or Father who have chosen to separate. <br/><br/>The varying paths shown in the movie as a result of the choice Nemo makes as a child are dramatically creative however it instills a desperation in the viewer to discover the conclusion to the story. I personally found the premise to this movie quite exceptional but was disappointed with how everything was tied up in the end. Since the nature of the movie is non-linear, arty and disjointed it may be inappropriate to desire a well-knit conclusion; however all in all I don't believe the message communicated in this movie should take 2 hours and 30 minutes. <br/><br/>I think when evaluating a movie it is important not to make it more intelligent than it is.

","Mr. Nobody is about cause and effect. It has a child, Nemo, a master of this scheme and he is constantly bombarded with choices which he can not make carelessly.In the movie, Nemo narrates his tale through several permutations of his life, constantly looping back on itself. He chooses to grow up with each of his divorcing parents and has three separate and mutually canceling lifelong romances. If it sounds confusing, that is because it is. A quote from the movie which beautifully sums itself up: ""Every path is the right path. Everything could have been anything else and it would have just as much meaning"".<br/><br/>It was a very ambitious attempt from Van Dormael. He succeeded in presenting stunning visuals and some profound scenes that talk about immortality and fate. It is attention demanding and might try your concentration. Unless you get gripped by it the experience of watching it isn't quite as enjoyable as the description might suggest.The theme is torn between the nihilistic proposition that our choices doesn't matter and an encouraging thought that different paths might lead to different kinds of happiness.<br/><br/>The movie was about the ability or inability of making an important decision. To show this, a hypothetical scenario is created which enables Nemo to predict the future. Inspite of knowing all the possible paths his life can take, he is incapble of making decisions. All the possible paths shown have some downside, in some he dies in childhood, or of being bored, or living his life at a chair waiting for the love of his life(which one?). All subsequent hardships endured at three critical junctions in his life are examined. He eventually encounters his death in some of the scenarios. These deaths he labels as dead ends and moves to any one of the other different outcomes of his life. He realizes it is this child's decision which impacts everything in his life. Throughout the movie Nemo makes contradicting statements; at the end he says none of these paths have existed, the child who had to make a decision was unable to so and he makes a third decision, an unknown one. The old man laughs as his world disintegrates. And the movie ends with the child not making any of the choices that he had been thinking about. <br/><br/>It uses pseudo-scientific and hypothetical concepts to make the whole narration dramatic. The repeated demonstrations of the butterfly effect can get a little exasperating. It is full of stunning shots, weighty concepts, and the incredible acting. Despite its recursive content, it all ties together very nicely and leaves one breathless at the end. I recommend the viewer to watch the movie and form his own theory about the movie, it already has a large fan base on internet which constantly debates about every aspect of the movie."

People usually don't like sad things.<br/><br/>4.Is it just like those quote-unquote actually good movies that play with realities and use unreliable narrators in surreal scenarios like ESOTSM, ""Being John Malkovich"", ""Waking life"" and others? (I also like these three)<br/><br/>Yes, just like ""The illusionist"" and ""Prestige"" are basically the same.<br/><br/>Just because they're similar conceptually (very broadly speaking) doesn't mean they're the same. It's still a completely different story.<br/><br/>The movie is neither a really deep philosophical one nor is it meant to be a hardcore scifi in the generic sense. It wasn't meant to be a study into the problem of choice in a deterministic reality and even if it was supposed to be something like that, i don't think that's the reason why you should watch it.<br/><br/>I think what it is about is the regret of living a single life. We are bound in these decaying bodies for a brief period of consciousness and nothing that we experience we can completely trust to be real, whatever that means, but we just seem to go with it because why not!<br/><br/>""Life for all it's anguish is ours, Miss Ives""(Penny Dreadful Season 3)<br/><br/>If there is free will and our actions truly determine the course of our lives the question that the movie asks is which choice is the right choice? It's asking the question which life is the right one. The answer it gets eventually is way too simple. In a way it's not even an answer at all, which is painfully annoying. But i think i can understand because it is the sort of question that has no right answer. It's something that you can't really do much about except find a way to live with and that it helps us do.<br/><br/>So basically for the majority audience, you are about to be introduced to a sorrow that wasn't there before but they'll also give you a way to live with it so i guess it's all fine in the end.<br/><br/>To watch this movie is a choice just like any other. Whether you willingly make that choice, whether that choice is made for you by a God or the invisible forces of nature, or whether it is a random outcome out of the infinitely many possibilities that could have happened or did happen, the choice is still there. Even if it has already been made for you, it had to be made. <br/><br/>The story is intriguing, the visuals are captivating, the characters are complex and nothing is there just because. It's not perfect at all, but it's a really good movie that deserves a watch."

"DopamineNL","8","1","2","17 December 2013"," Exploration of scientific themes combined with a little love and a good story
","A relatively unknown Belgian director explores some popular (and also some lesser known) issues in modern science: chaos theory, entropy, chance, choice, existence and the nature and direction of time (eg: what happens when the universe reaches its maximum expansion?). It is Schrödinger's cat outside the box, with a little love story intermixed (it's still a film, after all!)<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody starts out confusing, but remains accessible throughout, without doing injustice to the main themes. Good acting, some nice cinematographic gimmicks (restrained yet useful CGI, as it should be) and a good story line. It's Before sunset/sunrise (Linklater) meets Memento (Nolan). <br/><br/>In other words: probably the only film Leonard and Penny (Big Bang Theory) could watch together!"

","Firstly, to see this film you must be in an open mindset. Otherwise you will not understand or receive the topics shown and their meaning.<br/><br/>My first thoughts afterwards were appreciation for covering topics which many people seek guidance for and is usually found through various means, e.g. religion, introspection, or other means. Presenting such a story in a nonlinear narrative does make it difficult to understand however it highlights one common factor in all our lives, i.e. choices. These choices all lead to different paths and the possible causative factors which influence these choices (discussing various theories).<br/><br/>After the credits rolled I had to think for a minute to explain the ending. Discussing with a friend I watched it with lead us to somewhat understand it all. However ultimately we need to do some research online to read the opinions and explanations of others. It became clear the ending is either shows which choice is the right one or leaves us to interpret it how we want. Either way this an enjoyable and thought provoking movie."
"FilmMuscle","7","1","2","30 November 2013"," An Ambitious Film That Succeeds?
","One of the many reasons I attend the movie theater so frequently is to experience what I haven't before and to live through incredibly fresh and memorable journeys as to excitedly recall them in future discussions on cinema. Personally, the greatest cinematic events are remembered due to their remarkably daring approach in one way or another, reluctant to pursue the same old subject matter that appeals to critics and the Academy year in and year out. In that regard, Mr. Nobody is a risk if there ever was any and its ambition, for being such a small independent production, is vastly impressive! In fact, Mr. Nobody holds several similarities with last year's Cloud Atlas in that they explore the concept of decision-making in a massive universe that never calls attention to a being as miniscule as you and I. This film embarks on a study of extremely thought-provoking metaphysics and humanity's very existence in a wholly random and gigantic system of events. <br/><br/>Nemo Nobody is an adolescent who is forced to choose between his father and mother, following their unfortunate separation, one leaving on a train to a distant land and the other watching the memory fade in dismay; Nemo is in the center and whomever he chooses will substantially affect his future- the people he will end up meeting, the locations he will end up visiting, and the condition in which he will find himself as time speedily advances. From that moment on, this extraordinarily peculiar narrative will cast us into these infinite possibilities to which Nemo may one day expose himself, based on the decision he will ultimately make on that fateful day. Vastly differential lives will be led and various love interests will follow under separate destinies- its tagline: ""If you never make a choice, anything is possible."" This feature is essentially an exemplar of the truly bizarre adventures one might take on a trip to the cinema as you are left completely befuddled on the path to the movie's conclusion while numerous situations transpire and the familiar meet their ends. <br/><br/>The editing and visual style exemplified in this picture is simply amazing and is definitely what drives the foundations of such a creative film. You will find yourself astonished by the dozens of clever techniques employed by the cinematography. Again, returning to my initial point, Mr. Nobody is one of those movies you absolutely can't judge in a definitive manner until you reach the credits as the thematic material and substance, overall, decently materializes by its endpoint, testing the moviegoer's patience on its gradual climb to satisfying explanation. Once you've hit the final mark, the confusion that once bothered you somewhat clears and you finally feel like this story was worth your 2+ hours of attention. Drawing parallels to Cloud Atlas, it, too, audaciously attempts to convey a challenging, extensive tale that tours the fascinating nature in which our lives unravel and how one small decision leaves us with an utterly disparate environment. As with Cloud Atlas, what undoubtedly keeps us in our seats instead of barging out of the showing in frustration, are the stunning visuals and the colossal scope partaken. In addition, Mr. Nobody carries a fun soundtrack throughout with the likes of ""Mister Sandman"" and ""Where is my Mind"" that effectively assists the pacing and entertainment factor within a particular scene. Though one can overwhelmingly praise this marvel, another can gripe over how pretentious it seemed; it certainly isn't for everyone. I can appreciate its confidence, but it might not resonate with as many people as it had hoped considering its bloated content, executed in rather vague fashion."

","An interesting watch, a delight to the eyes. I'm not naive to call it a masterpiece or anything, but it's a brave and innovative attempt; the splendid intersection of life's decisions, butterfly effect, string theory, parallel universes, true love and imagination is quite spectacular. <br/><br/>Jaco Van Dormael's ambitious attempt to explore these themes in a non-linear and haphazard fashion is sometimes flawed but mostly fascinating. Maybe it's supposed to be a satire on Life itself; sometimes seemingly good decisions have bad endings (death, unhappiness), and sometimes accidental or bad decisions end up having good futures. The thing is, no matter what decision we take,we can never predict what would eventually happen. (In the movie, by not choosing, he is letting everything happen, side-by-side.) The movie's ambiguous nature maybe a satirical take on decision-making and nature of life, or it maybe a plan gone wrong. It ultimately depends on what you got out of the whole ordeal. <br/><br/>(If anyone is left boggled by the movie's ending, you can read my explanation here: akashsebastian.wordpress.com/2013/09/23 /possible-explanations-for-mr-nobody-movie )<br/><br/>The acting is commendable, especially by Jared Leto, Toby Regbo and Rhys Ifans. Other than the scientific principles it explores, it's the magnificent cinematography and terrific editing which help sustain your interest for two and a half hours. The soundtrack is mesmerizing, and well in tune with the movie.<br/><br/>The movie's complex and non-linear story is certainly not for everyone."

Are the writers afraid that if they produce a film that has a story the coherent, chronological and makes sense that they won't be able to cut it.This genre has become a gimmick rather than an art form.

","Pastiche. Means I can't appreciate the film as an original effort. All the parts of the movie seem borrowed. Well put together, possibly, but borrowed. Had this film been made in the 80's or 90's, I'd give it far more respect.<br/><br/>As is, I'm left feeling a little underwhelmed. We have a clearly well-healed, well-produced film. Film uses alternative realities stories. Film delves into cosmos pop-science. Granted, I like this stuff, however, I've seen this many, many times before; it's not easy to make this feel fresh. Hearing the ""butterfly effect"" term in dialog feels like nails being dragged across a chalkboard. Just please, don't show me a ""butterfly effect"" montage.<br/><br/>Must I describe the romance vehicle within the film? I'd really rather not. Reminded me of Goldilocks and the three porridges.

","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !<br/><br/>I gotta confess that the idea of starting this blog came across to me while watching this flick or piece of hogwash, as I would call it. I felt that there was a need for some medium to distinguish between flicks that claim to be masterpieces (but are actually artsy-farsty trash), and the genuine works of art. Of course we also need to put in some fun (hic) element into the movies as well; hence the name of the blog .<br/><br/>Anyways moving on to the movie (Mr. Nobobody); it came across initially as genuine art-house fare (because of its stunning visual elements), but later rambled on to be a boring waste of time, and almost totally incomprehensible to the human mind. This was actually one of the movies that I stopped watching mid-way, even though I had some time to waste that evening. Now don't blame me if the second half of the movie turned out to dramatically good, or somehow explained all the loss of brain cells that I endured while watching the movie during the first half.<br/><br/>Now don't take me to be a person who hates movies that need you to exercise your intellect. I have enjoyed my share of intellectual or film noir kind of movies (like Mulholland Drive, Memento, Vanilla Sky etc.).

","I can't understand why so many good reviews.<br/><br/>Certainly the movie is visually appealing, but that is about it. The story is all over the place. Now, in a way that is part of the premise, since the movie is about how random details can completely change a life, and shows several of those possible life branches. I get that, but the different branches of Nemo's lives are not particularly interesting. The characters actions are pretty banal or unexplained, and sometimes just plain silly. Also, there is no attempt at somehow contrasting those different branches in an interesting way.<br/><br/>The movie tries to seem deep without being so. It sometimes shows you a long shot of a clock, as if saying to you: ""see, time! Time! Isn't that deep?"". No, not particularly.<br/><br/>At some point it shows how an unemployed Brazilian boiling an egg can cause rain two months later and change Nemo's life. It then goes over the type of overused sequence of trivial details in a chain of events: the egg boiling, the steam going through a pipe and up the sky, etc, etc. This has been done so many times in so many movies... It is not boggling my mind! The movie has many such sequences.<br/><br/>It does not help that it is so long: 2h 20min.

"mrmac-1","Null","1","3","12 March 2014"," About choice
","I haven't viewed this film yet, but it intrigued me enough to purchase it, arriving in the next two weeks. From those reviewing it, one important story element is our ability to choose, and the consequences of our choices.<br/><br/>From my experience, part of the human process is first desire, second fear, third control, and they become mixed up. Before seeing this film, reviews do not speak of existentialism, perhaps the philosophy most relevant to this story. So I give you the following regarding choice and existentialism, with a grain of salt, so to speak, for it is about philosophy, which is only a mirror and not perhaps to your personal taste.<br/><br/>""Perhaps the most prominent theme in existentialist writing is that of choice. Humanity's primary distinction, in the view of most existentialists, is the freedom to choose. Existentialists have held that human beings do not have a fixed nature, or essence, as other animals and plants do; each human being makes choices that create his or her own nature. In the formulation of the 20th-century French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. Choice is therefore central to human existence, and it is inescapable; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails commitment and responsibility. Because individuals are free to choose their own path, existentialists have argued, they must accept the risk and responsibility of following their commitment wherever it leads. --Encarta Encyclopedia"" Why am I writing about a film before I've seen it?

"CUDIU","7","1","3","20 December 2011"," First impressions...
","...before I read any other reviews.<br/><br/>* At the end, the ""story"", or ""plot"", is seemingly made understandable. This is what I understood after one viewing and without reading other reviews or googling anything. All is seen through the eyes of a nine years old boy at the moment when he is faced with the choice whether he wants to stay with his father or mother. All happens in those few seconds he is running after the train that is bringing his mother away. Finally he stays with his dad and, of all the possible lives that could be, one finally materializes as true, i.e. life with Anna, the only one of the three girls that would effectively make him happy. In fact we have seen how the Elise and Jean lives would have made him unhappy. As all the reverie ends, time starts to wheel back through all the possible paths, towards the original moment of the train and then forward from that moment to the only life, the one with Anna. As this happens, centenarian Nemo dies and is reborn in a backwards fashion, all the while saying that this has been the best day of his ""life"", which in fact has been only an imaginary life, made up in the mind of a child.<br/><br/>* There is only one thing that disturbs me, that is: we see Nemo not making it to the train, which would mean he stays with his dad, not his mom. Which would lead to either Jean or Elise, not Anna, whom he would find following his mother. And yet, the final denouement involves Anna. Why? I think there are two possible answers. One: Nemo does not make it to the train, but later decides to join his mother. This would stress the fact that not everything, after all, is left to chance in our life, but we can make effective decisions. Two: Nemo stays with his father, but as things go, this does not prevent him to meet Anna. This would imply that the reverie in Nemo's head is just that, a reverie, and we cannot possibly predict the future. (Note that one of the imagined Nemos says that he can predict the future sometimes).<br/><br/>* This said, it is very possible that I have not got it all and some other things are escaping my interpretation. E.g. a lot is done with colours. Red and blue and yellow (primary colours) are dominant in the different threads. I am not sure how to connect the different colours with the different paths/girls, but Anna seems ""to be"" red and Jean blue. However I am not sure about Elise/yellow (except that Elise is a blonde).<br/><br/>* Formally this is a very good movie. Acting performances are solid. Leto is excellent. Polley and the child/adolescent actors are also good.<br/><br/>* The imagery is astounding. The direction and photography are top notch. So much so that occasionally Van Dormael seems to go a bit over the top with unnecessary camera movements.<br/><br/>* The score is perfect, melancholy and ironic. I especially liked the use of the song ""Mister Sandman"", whose lyrics make it clear in the first place that the movie is based on a dream or, rather, on a daydream.<br/><br/>* The special effects are extremely good although they still leave a light, plastic CGI aftertaste. For example when we see those helicopters building the sea, it looks more like the CGI crew are showing off than a compelling scene. If the child is making it all up, why would he need helicopters? A simple wave filling up the sea would be sufficient, I say. However, of all the heavily CGI-ed movies I can think of, this is amongst those that make the best use of this technology by keeping it understated most of the times. I noticed that Inception uses CGI effects in a very similar way, also to portray dream-like situations and landscapes. Nobody, though, does it better because, with few exceptions, is less of a showing off than Nolan's movie. I.e. the CGI aftertaste is there, but does not ruin the overall flavour like it did in Inception (a heavily overrated one, in my opinion).<br/><br/>All in all, I am satisfied by this movie but a bit overwhelmed by the occasionally excessive camera tricks and CGI. I am also still too puzzled by it and think I need another viewing at least. Mr. Nobody succeeds in this, it summons the viewers to put the pieces together, although at times it also spoon-feeds them a bit too much (see the final resolution revealed by old Nemo in a too blatant verbal explanation).<br/><br/>And now on to see what other people think..."

"StevePulaski","6","1","4","23 February 2016"," Gives us enough to chew on before we choke on it or spit it out
","Mr. Nobody concerns the complex principles of quantum mechanics of time, specifically the often-debated and discussed ""many-worlds theory,"" which basically boils down to the possibility of numerous, external universes existing operating upon the choices you've never made yourself. Consider myself choosing to hang out with a friend of mine today after finishing my classes rather than working on schoolwork or my writing. Had I went home directly after finishing my classes, perhaps I would've gotten more of my schoolwork done, which could've resulted in better grades, which would've made my GPA higher, which would've potentially gotten me better job opportunities, which could've even made my income a bit higher.<br/><br/>Of course, you could ""what if?"" damn-near every circumstance of your life to the point where you can make yourself suicidal over what you could've done and what you wound up doing, but that's not healthy at all. The details of quantum mechanics have been softly examined in film for quite sometime (one film that immediately comes to mind is the opening monologue of Richard Linklater's Slacker delivered by Linklater himself from the back of a taxicab). However, rarely does a film muster up the ambition and conviction to tackle on the often headache-inducing ins and outs of such lofty ideas, which are nothing more than theories in scholarly articles that populate the internet.<br/><br/>Writer/director Jaco Van Dormael apparently had enough confidence to concoct a lengthy screenplay and timeline around the idea and the result is Mr. Nobody, an admirably ambitious film that, like the very basic ideas of quantum mechanics, packs a great deal of ideas into a relatively small box and tries to make us chew on them long enough before we either choke or spit them out. We open in the year 2092, where humans are now immortal thanks to the endless renewal of cells; the last mortal on Earth is the 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto), who is edging ever-so-closely to death as society watches the last soul among them with the capability to die. A psychiatrist named Dr. Feldheim (Allan Corduner) manages to snag one final interview with Nemo before his imminent death, since Nemo also has a rare ability to account the past lives he could've lived had he made a different choice in a crucial situation as a young child.<br/><br/>At the age of nine, Nemo had the choice of which parent he wanted to stay with after their separation. At first, we see him tardily hop aboard a train with his mother, where, in three separate story lines, he becomes smitten with a woman named Anna, in one world insulting her and her friends, at another point conversing with them, and another, marrying and raising children with her. Yet another alternate life shows the multitude of possibilities that could've happened had he stayed home and lived with his father, where Nemo meets an entirely new woman named Elise, who, in one story, is still in love with her boyfriend, but another, is bipolar and manic depressive, making Nemo's life a living hell.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody is anything but a linear experience; at two and a half hours in length, the film plays like a repetitive stageplay, exhausting every potential narrative possibility as it showcases every which way Nemo's life could've gone. We see situations repeat themselves, lines of dialog slightly altered to create a new scene, and through it all, Nemo Nobody, who has lived more lives to the fullest than we'll be lucky to live one. As narratively ambitious as this story is, shortcomings seem to plague or limit the film's greatness on a consistent basis. To begin with, Nemo isn't that engaging of a person, nor is Leto that expressive or interesting as a character actor to sustain a film as lofty or as long as this one. Nemo doesn't grab us in with his personality because, through many of his scenes, he's a passive presence; almost an accessory or a side-character to his own life. He doesn't seem too fazed by the multitude of things occurring in his life at any given moment, with limited facial and vocal expression, which makes it hard for us, the audience, to truly sympathize with him. With that, as stated, Leto doesn't bring a ton to the table as Nemo either; his presence is lacking the kind of engagement that protagonists usually possess, especially with such a liberal amount of runtime/screen time to work with, which results in a part of the film that sags dramatically.<br/><br/>After some contemplation, that element seems to be Mr. Nobody's biggest issue. Other features - such as a narrative that repeats itself quite frequently, an almost inherently exhausting and maddening amount of existentialism to chew on, and a timeline that results in a viewer doing mental hopscotch to try to cogently understand it - are almost to be expected with a film dealing with quantum mechanics, so complaining about them, despite their presence, seems a bit foolish. In addition, overly emphasizing these attributes can greatly make one forget about the commendable ambition and scope Van Dormael possesses for his screenplay. He respects the screenplay enough to deeply consider the limitless possibilities of the many-worlds theory, to the point where I wished he would've focused on a more engaging presence instead of the flatter, less convincing protagonist we got with our titular character.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody has a whirlwind going for it in the conversational/post-credits discussion aspect, as most panels and debates about the many-worlds theory possess; it's getting to that point and enduring what we must endure that gets in the way of the ultimate reward, which is discussing and sharing our deepest, most personal thoughts."

","This has been sitting in my ""must get round to watching"" folder for a while. To be fair it was really only the long run time that has dissuaded me in the past. <br/><br/>So what's it about? Well, the story jumps around a lot, in both chronology and plot(s), held together largely by an old guy reminiscing on the many different timelines that his life has taken and the choices that led to them. <br/><br/>It's a fairly philosophical movie that plays around with the concept of time, its direction and our experience of it. Reminiscent of The Butterfly Effect we are shown the various lives that result from a particular childhood decision along with the many possible branching lines that come from later decisions.<br/><br/>I have a personal bugbear with sci-fi films, particularly those that focus on time. By and large they show little regard for any kind of scientific considerations or even a basic understanding of any relevant physical principles. To give credit here, references are made to concepts such as thermodynamics and the multiple dimensions implied by string theory, (although we are also treated to the generally disregarded Big Crunch hypothesis). They may not have used these in a particularly relevant way but I admire the effort. <br/><br/>Not that it matters too much really, suspension of disbelief is crucial to appreciate a movie like this, with that in mind it is a rewarding experience. Recognising that happiness and pain exist in every possible life, the movie reminds us of our own choices and the often pondered ""what if"" scenario.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, the subject matter seems at times mired by youthful naivety, the philosophy more akin to teenage confusion than contemplative reflection, perhaps that is the point though. Nevertheless for anyone with a genuine interest in the nature of time, this is one of the better movies on that subject."

","Oh I so want to give this piece of work 1 star. It is ONLY for the outstanding cinematography and the really creative science fiction story concepts that allows me to give it 2 whole stars (and not a penny more)!!<br/><br/>PROS: 1. The cinematography was outstanding and very artistic. I am sure award worthy. <br/><br/>2. The story line is very creative and clever. <br/><br/>3. I will even say how good Ledo & some of the other acting skills were as a pro. As they technically did NOT write the script, they only adapted the script for their character. And this goes back to #2.the script.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Although the story line is very clever, the script – and more so the characters, was hard to actually sit through, let alone enjoy. I couldn't stand (to the point of disdain and contempt) MOST of the characters there! <br/><br/>I felt sorry for and liked the father. I felt for the Asian wife who really loved Nemo but he didn't care for her. And the children in the film (including Nemo) were likable and cool. Outside of that, I hated this film. <br/><br/>First off, I detest romance – which is all this film basically was. 2ndly, and more importantly, I couldn't stand most of the characters – which is the fault of the writer not the actors. The characters were extremely unlikable. <br/><br/>The mother was repulsively selfish and EXTREMELY unlikable. The fact that Nemo unfortunately chose his mom (in 1 time line) was a huge mistake from thence on out. She was an extremely selfish horrifically poor mother.<br/><br/>The irritating depressed wife was totally annoying and Nemo's total and completed irresponsibleness and stupidity to refuse to get her the help she needed at the loony bin to allow her the opportunity to be a decent mother (which she wished to be but was unable to do because Nemo allowed his kids to suffer from embarrassment and his wife to suffer in her depression) because he was too incompetent to get her help! For that, Nemo was unlikable in this time line!<br/><br/>AND even more um-likable is his time-line to his marriage to the Asian wife. Even though she was a sloppy second rebound to the blond loony who he really wanted, she truly loved him. She showed him patience and seemingly bends over backwards to work with him. He however totally disregarded her, did not appreciate her, and even had the nerve to become suicidal, leave her and his entire family, and get killed. This is the ultimate form of insult. Nemo is basically saying that he is so unhappy with his successful, beautiful, loving, Asian wife and kids that he not only leaves them but becomes an extreme irresponsible risk taker, totally irrational, and suicidal – in which he succeeds. And this makes Nemo even more ungrateful and thus unlikable. <br/><br/>Even the secondary and background characters were selfish, silly, annoying, or stupid at best. The retarded reporter who sneaked into the hospital room, asked the most ignorant questions (that he obviously never once picked up a book or whatever to research before hand). And he didn't understand much of what old Nemo said. Yes, Nemo's interview was full of contradictions, but even so, the reporter didn't understand the most basic way of life of the people of the past. A way of life he could have easily brushed up on en route to sneak into the hospital for this interview.<br/><br/>And lastly, that super annoying, Hunger Games wanna be clown with the same irritating MC style as Caesar Flickerman. Now am I to assume that this MC is supposed to be just as annoying, goofy, insensitive, inhumane, and annoying as Hunger Games' Caesar Flickerman or is this just another failed attempt at writing and building a likable character - that became unlikeable.<br/><br/>Perhaps if the screen writer made the characters more likable and able and able to be cared about, then the film with it's amazing sci-fi story line and cinematography would be much better. But again, I'm just one person. Maybe others loved these annoying, inconsiderate, selfish characters which annoyed me I couldn't enjoy the film.<br/><br/>After all, the characters make the film."

Things are really meant to be simpler, and we are actually family oriented by nature. You cannot compare a human being to a caveman, because we have evolved far from that. If people started growing up in the wild today, they wouldn't behave anything like cavemen, although I can promise you, that we would go back to our family oriented and community style traits. Those who couldn't comply with it would see their ends one way or another, but all in all, you are more like an Amish person than you realize. Even more so than the Amish. Time itself and the universe are not set to a path of destruction, they were set that way when we started to fight who we are. If man wants to continue to evolve, he needs to get his heart in order first. That feeling you get in the spring time when wondering free in a field of wild flowers isn't to be taken for granted.

","This was a strange film. I got to give the director and cast credit for trying something kinda different. This is a sort attempt at cubist film making. I say that as cubism was originally inspired by the theory of relativity. The non linear quality of the film is broken up into pieces. There are some nice themes of quantum physics in this. I will give the creators of this film credit for trying to bend the rules a bit. Some of the acting is genuinely good (hard to go wrong with Diane Kruger). However, Jared Leto is kind of a tool. He mostly has the same exact expression the entire movie. If he was not in this film, I think I would enjoy it about a thousand times more than I did. The actors who play the younger version of the main character and the parents are pretty good. The parts at the end kind of loose me. Around the 3/4th mark of the film, the story goes from a fractured non linear time piece to a surrealist piece. Thats where the film kind of falls apart and starts to not make much sense. Again I applaud them for trying something different, but the fact that the film really looses structure bothers me.There are times when it seems like a clear concept and metaphor are being formed, and then the whole thing meanders into left field. ultimately I feel the film does not succeed at telling much of a story at that point. This was an interesting and fairly decent film. Pretty good performances, except for Leto, and after a while it gets really confusing."

At first the hyper real proximity of the image is interesting; as if, in Umberto Eco's view the perception of reality may reveal something beneath; but as the movie moves on and the rupture in the narrative becomes more glaring it is obvious that this is very bad writing and has no real sense of narrative logic or how to combine it with characterization.<br/><br/>This film is all surface: the light, the glow and contrast of images and how lovely they look, like a fetishistic advertising campaign.<br/><br/>The simpleness of the construction and the poverty of its ideas are present within the first act and therefore what ensues is not much more than the lame resolution of the basic premise. It has the smug contented appearance of an adverting campaign, as if all the focus group research confirmed that that what was shown has been preapproved.<br/><br/>Play this movie at double speed on a DVD player and it is still perfectly comprehensible because there is absolutely no depth to the writing - it is all superficially obvious from the pictures."

They miss Nemo and he must first choose his parents. They divorce and in one case he lives with his mother and her boyfriend and his daughter, Anna, who invites him for a swim at the beach. He refuses, and years later sees her with her two children. With a second choice, he tells her that he cannot swim and she stays with him on the beach and they become lovers.<br/><br/>With a different choice, he lives with his paralyzed father and must be his caretaker. At a school dance, he meets Elise, but when he sees her with a boyfriend, he rides a motorcycle in anger and crashes and is crippled. <br/><br/>In another scenario, Elise dumps the boyfriend, they marry and have three children, but Elise is severely depressed, and she leaves him. <br/><br/>The last story of Nemo's love life has Elise rejecting him and Nemo telling his father that he will marry the first girl who dances with him. Jean is the lucky gal, and he marries her and they have two kids, a big house with a pool, but in spite of all the material success, Nemo is still unhappy.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody never really connects on any level.

"morkulv_athferion","6","1","7","30 April 2012"," Engaging, but lacking in substance
","From the very beginning, this movie sets out to engage the audience and confront people with philosophical questions about time, and life. While I do like this approach, I cannot praise it too much because it sacrifices the story's coherence for a lot of drama that slows the film down. It is necessary to the story though, but I think the problem lies in the way the script is build up.<br/><br/>Of course, this is still a matter of opinion, but to me whenever the movie got into the whole ""multiple decisions in life"" I thought it was very refreshing and interesting. But when the movie gets into the multiple lovers and marriages it slows down and the movie gets downright boring in some parts. Let me just clarify that I don't have anything against 'slow-paced' movies, or movies that don't focus as much on action, as long as it stays interesting or (in this case) thought-provoking. I told my friend who was watching it with me that it feels like it was directed by multiple people.<br/><br/>As I said, I do like the concept this movie was going for. I just hope that in the future, a movie gets to marry interesting theoretical possibility's with a coherent script a little better. Because of the somewhat fragmented result, the movie seems a bit too pretentious and overall too pleased with itself.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat hesitant to recommend Mr Nobody. Even though its definitely engaging, I don't think this movie will obviously appeal to everybody. Especially not to people who aren't into pseudo-scientific speculation. But if you're open to these sort of things and similar artistic efforts, you will praise this as much as anybody else."

","Webster's definition of a movie is: ""a recording of moving images that tells a story and that people watch on a screen or television.""<br/><br/>Within that definition it states, ""a recording of moving images..."" This movie has those. Beautifully shot and meticulously lighted for maximum effect. Within that same definition it also states, ""... that tells a story..."" Here is what is missing from this ""movie"". There is ZERO story. Just an endless jumble of fabulous images in no particular order with any coherence. It's like having someone hand me a box of museum-quality photographs of some random old man's life whom I've never met, then dumping the entire box on the floor and telling me ""Isn't this a fabulous story of the man's life?"" No structure. No meaning. No sense.<br/><br/>This is a gorgeous movie. I understand it cost over $40 million to create. You can see it all on the screen. That also is why I'm giving this ""movie"" a ""2"" instead of a much-deserved ""1"". Just because you have limitless funds does not a movie make. Hint to the director: Start with a professional, INTERESTING screenplay before you break it into a thousand pieces and never put them back into any sort of order resembling a real story. I think the director was absent the day they taught ""Basic Storyline 101"" at film school. Jumping back and forth in time to further the story is fine and done to wonderful effect with such classics as ""Memento"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""Run Lola Run"", etc. This mess of a film isn't even close. If it was my $40 mill on the line, I'd be asking for somebody's head after watching this garbage.<br/><br/>To be fair, I'm not the best ""art house fare"" reviewer. I like good storytelling and a fun movie experience. I don't expect ""Citizen Kane"" at every sitting of course. However, I do understand story has a linear quality that was completely lacking in this film. The actors are beautiful. The sets are stunning. And it has Rhys Ifans. That's enough to make me watch anything. But when that's ALL in a movie, you'll lose me pretty fast. The most troubling part is there is no end. The guy lives three(?) different lives because he didn't make any choices, but then doesn't finish any of them? What point is there to that ""story""? This is a waste of time. Stunning scenery, pretty cast. Zero point. Please find something else to do with the two+ hours of your life. Whoever gave it the high rating on IMDb needs to either learn what a real story is with plot, basic structure, and quality characters --- or said viewers might want to cut back on the drugs and alcohol before glorifying trash like this.

","There is a scientific hypothesis gaining traction that says physical reality is an illusion and we all live in a computer simulation. That's actually how it felt watching this movie. The film's working proposition is that as long as you don't choose, everything is possible. What it fails to mention apparently, is that failure to choose is itself a choice. As the title character, Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is presented not only the red pill or the blue pill, but apparently a yellow pill as well. He takes none of them, or takes all of them, depending on your persuasion coming out of the story. The Angel of Oblivion who missed Nemo at birth obviously impacted my patience for this picture, for even though I watched it in it's entirety, there is no way to ascertain a coherent narrative from the story. That's OK if you want to be mesmerized by a movie that takes itself way too seriously without being intelligible. The best I can say about the picture is that Jared Leto portrayed his various selves competently and in full control of his faculties, even after he got shot and killed as Daniel Jones."

It was King's English throughout. I've never seen so many beautiful big-eyed human beings together in one place. The story was good, the filming was intriguing, dare I say surrealistic? No, I won't because the point of the film is that all choices in life are the correct ones.

I recommend Mr. Nobody even though I gave it a C+, six stars, because after two or three hours into the film I was ready for it to wrap things up but realized it was only half done.
This film is Billy Pilgrim meets Forrest Gump but that's not a bad thing as long as the director kept showing me interesting things and messing with my head. He got out of the groove an hour or so into the film but I was rooting for him to find it again and he did.
Nemo Nobody had a far better adolescence than I did. Good for him. The girls liked him and his terror of them was manageable, barely an inconvenience.

It is either one of the greatest films of all time, or (if you judge the box office which is lower than any film in history except Heaven's Gate), one of the worst films of all time. The likely truth is that it is somewhere in the middle, so I gave it a 6 (one extra star for originality). The visuals are quite stunning and reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The emotional content is similar to Boyhood, and the sensual aspect of the perfect brother and sister twins is not related to any film I know of. This film is different, if nothing else. I guarantee you that you have seen nothing like it before. I can see why it didn't make any money. Most people are too ignorant to understand what the film is about; don't understand quantum physics and algorithms, and have difficulty in making a leap in imagination. Too bad for them."

","Dear Hollywood, JARED LETO CAN NOT ACT. Seriously, he is a huge reason why people didn't go out and see the new Blade Runner. Anyway, I had this film on my watch-list because I wanted to see if Jared Leto could actually act and if maybe his Joker and his amateur-hour dog and pony show in Blade Runner was just a fluke. After watching, it confirms the guy is being forced down our throats because he must be someone's nephew or something. At least the film does have actual actors in there doing the heavy lifting. But still, between Leto stinking up the screen and a pretentious script, the movie isn't worth your time."
"ThurstonHunger","6","0","2","6 August 2016"," His So-Called Lives
","Do you look at all the possible choices before you, and figure they all have some appeal, but ultimately fatal flaws? Me too, and so I often cannot pass on streaming a video from Netflix and look for a book instead. There's something about the physical DVD's just showing up and then you have a commitment to spend your short life together (well, its short life aka running time.) When you stream you can so easily jump to another entirely different feature.<br/><br/>So it was I chose to stream this movie. And I mostly stuck with it, for its visual lure. There's enough art direction to keep one's eyes fixed, and the story itself shuffles between alternate stream/dream/universes in the main character Nemo's life.<br/><br/>But less is spent on any sci-fi angle, rather it allows triple the romance. Even more so, as some streams have their own branched rivulets in them.<br/><br/>Thinking too much about the film deflates it I feel. Is Nemo == omen backwards or does it tie to a recurring death-by-water tarot card of sorts that pops up in the alterna-universes.<br/><br/>Leto is good again, and helps carry the soul of the film. He's prettier than his three leading ladies. The too easily dismissed model minority model, the wounded bird that wounds others and then the love of his life, who pushes a modern taboo for blended families with benefits.<br/><br/>Eminently watchable but ultimately ephemeral. Like our own lives? Well the voodoo Maori-esque hypnotist might have snuck into my subconscious. Nice work by Allan Corduner.<br/><br/>I did find myself wondering if the writer/director wanted to set up something more contrasting immortality versus mortality, where the decisions to lead one to one's demise, but they do nonetheless lead one. He's named Mr. Nobody, but a world full of everlasting nobodies tunes in for this life story.<br/><br/>Anyways, not as rewardingly twisted as ""Donnie Darko"" was for alienated adolescents of all ages, but time better spent than looking for old flames on Facebook, surely."
"jacklyn_lo","8","0","1","26 June 2016"," A bizarre mix of fantasy, sci-fi, drama, romance and spirituality
","Mr. Nobody is a bizarre mix of fantasy, sci-fi, drama, romance and spirituality.<br/><br/>In short, it's about a human and his choice, the choice that could change the life whether this or that way.<br/><br/>An old man has problems with his memory. With the help of a psychic, he travels into a number of scenarios of his life. This sets up his future, as he wakes up with different partners and in the different situations. <br/><br/>It could be explained by the theory that there are a few different parallel worlds where everyone has different lives. A little nuance in the situation influences the choice of a human being and the human is getting a new life scenario. <br/><br/>Another concept represented in the movie is ""chose your parents"" before you're born, so everything is defined by choices. <br/><br/>My favorite part is the futuristic element, because of the sci-fi innovative ideas, which are well-implemented into the movie."

","I really love the way the story was filmed, different and creative. Force you not to blink so you wouldn't miss the whole sequence of the movie. I understand the two imaginary altered lives and was looking forward to the end which came simple, clear as it was to summarize the story and clarify its message. <br/><br/>In the real life you will always have to make the choice and have to bear the consequences. So be strong, accept the life challenge and hope for the better. <br/><br/>Enjoy, be shocked by the movie , imagine and think if it would go this way, we wouldn't........"
"milija17","5","0","4","13 January 2016"," Interesting idea, poor development
","Jorge Luis Borges once said, comparing the short stories to novels: ""The essential advantage I see in it is that the short story can be taken in at a single glance... It's possible for everything to be essential, or more or less essential, or — shall we say — appear to be essential, in a short story.""<br/><br/>This movie is directly opposite to this. Not only it is annoyingly and exhaustingly long, but it also treats the audience as people with absolutely ZERO sense of imagination. So, instead of giving the audience just a glimpse or two of ""look, this here happened, but instead of this here, if other choices were made, that over there might have happened"" - the movie takes us STEP BY STEP, each step iterating back and forth, into EACH AND EVERY possible scenario. <br/><br/>I liked the first half of the movie, then it just went on and beyond this ""possible scenarios"". If the movie was half as long, I'd have given it 6, maybe even 7 stars.<br/><br/>OK, not 7 stars, I just remembered that it has the most uninventive soundtrack ever. ""Playing safe"" is the best description of music choices here. I thought Faure's Pavane is going to wash out forever, that many times it was played in this movie."
"Seraphion","6","0","2","30 October 2015"," A surreal tread through nonlinearity
","The story just don't get enough justice to be called a story, due to it serving multiple possibilities of Mr. Nobody's life. Those who get comfortable with this kind of surrealism are those who also get comfy with Darren Aronofsky's story telling and visualizations. Yet the movie offered something different from Aronofsky by presenting somewhat rather patchy editing and transitions, which actually turn out to be great due to them helping set the movie's pace to be really fast and tight at all times. Then again, I must say that this kind of movie can only be fully enjoyed by those who are experienced in understanding and thus enjoying complicated movies such as Nolans', or those who simply let go of any assumptions and expectations and then just absorbs all to then deconstruct it after watching. The acting feels very nice, especially in Jared Leto's work, being total and encompassing a wide breadth of character variations."
"basscadet75","8","0","1","28 November 2014"," Complex, beautiful, but let down by a flat ending
","This films borrows heavily from the likes of Charlie Kauffman and David Lynch for multiple ""films within films"" that are really pretty much impossible to keep straight. Luckily the film is interesting, visually beautiful and yes, emotional enough that I was captivated anyway, and I quickly learned not worry so much about ""where I was"" in the story.<br/><br/>The film leans heavily on real science for much of its central conceit of branching reality as we make choices in life. With its talk of relativity and string theory (most of which is actually pretty accurate, as someone who's interested in such things), you can almost think of the film as an exercise in exploring the ""many worlds"" theory of quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>But don't worry if you're not up on the science, because the film ends up being a lot more grounded than that. Its overarching story is about love, after all, and the real explanation for what's going on ends up being based on emotion rather than science.<br/><br/>This film could have been a masterpiece in the same way something like ""Mulholland Dr."" is a masterpiece - an inventive, complex, deep and emotional film with multiple layers to peel back but a simple and resonant message at heart. And in fact, my wife - who is not into science fiction (or science) at all - called it ""one of the best films she has ever seen"".<br/><br/>But I felt let down by the ending, which becomes hugely and unnecessarily expository and works really hard to tie up every loose end into a neat and tidy little bow. The film is perfectly content to keep you in a state of mild confusion right up until the last 10 minutes, when absolutely everything is explained in monologue. And many will find the explanation unsatisfying, at least at first.<br/><br/>I will say that it ends up being one of those movies - like Mulholland Dr. - that you look back on once you know the ""secret"" and say ""oooooh, so that's why this happened"". The internal logic of the film suddenly becomes clear, and that can be fun. I just wish I had been allowed to get there on my own, without being dragged on a leash.<br/><br/>Still deserves an 8 out of 10 for the first 8/10 of the film, which is perfect."
"zavyman","Null","0","1","11 May 2014"," Celebrating ambiguity
","This remarkable film celebrates the ambiguity of life. What-if questions are answered in ways that are visually stunning and emotionally touching.<br/><br/>Have you ever been through an emotional, traumatic, or difficult situation and wanted to just be able to detach yourself from the situation? Maybe to see it from the third person, and imagine the confluence of an immense multitude of events that got you there. Or to wonder how any number of otherwise completely insignificant changes would have taken you elsewhere yet rendering you none the wiser. Perhaps a clearly life-altering choice is materializing before your very eyes.<br/><br/>Mr. Nobody will, in one way or another, visualize all these perspectives. You will enjoy its interleaving of romanticism and harsh reality, in a way that makes it feel very genuine and real in spite of its sci-fi undertones. In this respect, its mixed timeline of emotion, romance, and regret are quite reminiscent of Makoto Shinkai's ""5 Centimeters Per Second"", and is equally touching."

","I missed this one when it came out in 2009, in fact I don't even remember hearing anything about it. I recently found it as a new addition in the Netflix streaming movies library. Superb picture and sound, even streaming over the internet.<br/><br/>This multi-national film production (yes, shot on film) begins somewhat oddly, showing a pigeon in a cage, with a block of wood on one side and some food suspended out of reach in the corner. It seems as if the pigeon is thinking, and figures out if he pecks at the block to move it near the corner he can reach the food. And he does. The ""pigeon superstition experiment."" And this is associated with the theme of the movie, we make decisions to do certain things and that has wide-reaching effect on a number of other things.<br/><br/>The movie cuts backwards and forwards many times as Nemo Nobody, the last mortal human in a New York hospital is being watched, reality show style as he turns 117 on February 9th, 2092, and is being interviewed. The many cuts are made when Nemo was either a small boy, a teenager, or a young adult in different situations. Even in different family situations with different wives and different children.<br/><br/>How can all these be possible? How can each be real? Or is anything real? It is difficult to say exactly what the story is here, but for me I found watching it mesmerizing. The images, the whimsy, the fantastical story-telling. Maybe the way film and movies were received when they first began over 100 years earlier.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about Jared Leto, who not only plays the recognizable Nemo as a young adult, but also the 117 yr-old Nemo in the hospital. With appropriate makeup and a change in his vocal quality he really comes across as the very old man.<br/><br/>Key actresses in his adult life are Sarah Polley as Elise, Diane Kruger as Anna, and Linh Dan Pham as Jean, all wives of his in one version or the other.<br/><br/>Other key characters are Rhys Ifans as Father Nemo (actually father Nobody) and Natasha Little as Mother Nemo (mother Nobody). <br/><br/>I give this film really high marks, I am certain I will watch it again. But I also recognize some will not enjoy this sort of non-linear story- telling.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: At one point when Nemo was a boy of about 9 his parents decided to split up. At the train station he is standing with his father, watching the train pull away with his mother at the train door. He doesn't know what to do, should he go with mom or stay with dad. As long as he fails to decide, then every future possibility is as good as any other, and this is what is depicted during the 2+ hour movie. It touches on such things as the butterfly effect, the Big Bang, time, and entropy."

","Intricately woven parallels form to capture loves many trifles in Mr. Nobody. It's hard to understand what's more important, knowing who you are or knowing when you are. An old man referring to himself as Mr. Nobody reminisces on many timelines to illustrate to quasi-immortals what his life has been like as ""the last mortal"" on earth. He struggles through his Dementia to determine which timeline was reality and which was illusion based on the choices he perhaps made. All of Mr. Nobody's memories revolve around his love for 3 women. Anna's love, being the most epic, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Director Jaco Van Dormael uses water, monotonous argyle sweaters, and a blowing leaf in the wind to symbolize the choices made or unmade by a young Mr. Nobody called Nemo (Jared Leto; Dallas Buyers Club, My So-Called Life) who is fetchingly innocent and dedicated to those he loves.<br/><br/>These images play out beautifully on screen, making a long running time bearable. Don't try to make sense of an old man's ramblings until he tells you what to make of them in the end. Waiting until 2092 might be the key or flipping a coin to choose which way to run could get you right where you need to be..."
"blissey_s","6","0","3","9 December 2013"," Arduous and Intelligent At The Same Time
","I sat down to Mr. Nobody with the preconceived idea that it would a monotonous, philosophical narrative without much thought or purpose. I was half correct. <br/><br/>While the images and artistic techniques displayed in Mr. Nobody are entrancing, they don't quite justify the length of the film. The first and last 15 minutes of the film are arguably the most intelligent portions of the movie, during which the viewer is asked philosophical questions that truly challenge everyday thinking. Sadly, however, the the greater part of the film is dominated by the unnecessary reiteration of these ideas.<br/><br/>Indeed, I've never felt both compelled as a viewer yet at the same time utterly bored as I did with Mr. Nobody. At times I was entranced by the imagery and introspective thoughts put forward, but at others I found myself checking my watch and wondering to myself if the movie would ever end. <br/><br/>The fundamental problem with this movie is not with its ideas but in its execution. The movie could have been shortened greatly yet supplied the same amount of meaning. Unfortunately, its arduous length and excessive contrasting of choices made by the main character ruined for me what could have been a neater, more polished film."

","The past. Not an entity where variation tends to exist. What's done is done, right? Mr. Nobody, a film by Jaco Van Dormael explores and re-imagines the theory of the Arrow of Time: the notion that time moves in only one direction.<br/><br/>A simplistic sketch of the film's plot: By 2092 the world has moved on. 118 year-old Nemo Nobody, the last remnant of the old world recounts his life to a reporter. Nemo's details his past as a series of fragments. He recount them as if he were in fact choosing his past the way we choice our future. We are shown array of lives.<br/><br/>""Why does the smoke never go back into the cigarette? Why do the molecules spread away from each other? Why does a spilled drop of ink never reform?"" As the laws of entropy take the universe further and further into a state of disarray what will happen when we hit maximum entropy? When total chaos bestills nothingness? Mr. Nobody is not exactly hot off the reels. It's a 2009 film that was on my must watch list. Despite so many awesome elements, the cinematic culmination of Mr. Nobody was rather disappointing. Mostly, the scenes tended to drag on. This was 100 minutes worth of great material stretched over the course of 155 minutes. Van Dormael should have taken a cue from his own philosophy and realize that if the Arrow moves only forward, and if I'm going to spend 155 minutes of my Arrow watching your film, I'd better be good.<br/><br/>More film reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

","This movie was really well shot. The scenarios are incredible, and for those who like a confusing atmosphere - you can see what I'm talking about by the number of different actors for the same character - that gets elaborated and explained with time, this is a great movie. It's similar to The Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko and perhaps Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, because of the romance. Some compared it to Click too, which I don't think is a good comparison because this isn't a comedy.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was too long, though. I was kind of impatient at the mark of 90min and it kept running to the mark of 141min. I didn't like the music and some scenes of this movie, but those are details.

I watched it one more time, read the discussions to get some idea but still it seems this movie can't be clearly explained. I really don't like uncertainty. I wish it was explained more clearly in the end. I am planning to watch it for the third time, to read more discussions and I expect things to get clearer.
